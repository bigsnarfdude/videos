All right, well, welcome everybody to this reflection on the history of modeling and theory in population biology. This is a series launched by the Society for Modeling and Theory in Population Biology, a new organization available at your website, smtbb.org. The goals of our society are to provide a The goals of our society are to provide a forum for discussing theoretical issues and our results, strengthening the connections among us, among the practitioners in our field, building our community up, fostering the careers of modelers and theoreticians in population biology. And we launched this podcast to talk with really some of the luminaries in our field, people that have shaped the way we think about population biology, informed a lot of. Formed a lot of our kind of theoretical foundations. So today we are very fortunate to have with us Dr. Deborah Charlesworth. And alongside her are Kaylee Charlebois, a graduate student at UBC who's helping with the tech side of things, John Wakely at the University of Harvard, and myself from the University of British Columbia. From the University of British Columbia. So, Dr. Charles Worth is a professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh. She started her PhD studies actually more in biochemistry, I learned, and got her PhD in genetics from the University of Cambridge in 1968, working on quantitative genetics issues, but surrounding things like glucose levels. And not in plants, for many of you who know Deborah. For many of you who know Deborah's work, you might be surprised that that was in mice. She continued her research for many years and published a large number of papers before she reached, she got her first position. So I was reading a nice article by Stephen Wright, who mentioned that for 20 years, Deborah continued without grant support or really without a research position before she landed her. Before she landed her job at the University of Chicago. And she has gone on to win many of the most important awards in our field. She's been honored as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, elected as a member, born member of the National Academy of Sciences, and has received the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Society for the Study of Evolution and the Genetic Society Medal. She has worked on Has worked on a large number of papers. It's hard to count, depends on what you count, but Scopus has her nearly 300 papers cited over 26,000 times with an H index of 80, which is incredible. But more incredible is how she's shaped the way we've thought about everything from the evolution of recombination to separate sexes, patterns of selfing versus outcrossing in populations. In populations, and looking at the evolutionary processes that shape genomic evolution and how that the selection, recombination, migration, mating system all influence things like where do we see regions of high recombination, low recombination, how do sex chromosomes form, and so forth. And so, pretty much in every area that I've worked, Area that I've worked. There's a Deborah Charles Worth fundamental paper really launching the field and influencing many of us strongly along the way. So thank you, Deborah, for being with us here today. Well, thank you for your terribly kind words. It doesn't sound like me, but anyway. I've been having fun with these things over the years. Yeah, exactly. That's a really good point. And over to you. We're going to ask a series of questions. John's going to launch us off. Great. Thanks, Deborah, for being with us. I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about when you first realized that mathematics was such a great tool that could be used to provide insights into biology. Yeah, I looked at your question list, and that was an interesting one. I don't think It was an interesting one. I don't think there was ever a time when I didn't think mathematics was part of biology, anyway. At the time when I was doing my sort of high school biology, there was a lot of excitement about sort of stuff where there was an interface between physics and biology. Biophysics was sort of the weasel word of the time, and there was X-ray crystallography. Of course, I didn't understand a word of it. Of course, I didn't understand a word of it, but I could see it was exciting, and I could see it was kind of mathematical. And my favourite teachers at school were my physics teacher and my maths teacher, Miss Sutton and Mrs. Briggs. And I just loved those two teachers. And I had a lot of nice teachers, but those two stood out. And so, you know, although I liked biology and I was interested in it, it was more the more quantitative side of biology that interested me always, I think. Me always, I think. I mean, certainly it wasn't the remembering all the bits and pieces and doing the dissections. I was not good at those things. But your training was more in biology? Yeah? Yeah, so I had this lovely physics teacher, Ms. Sutton, and so I applied to universities for places on physics courses, but I knew all along that I wasn't going to be a physics student. I was not up to it. But I just didn't want to. But I just didn't want to tell her that. So, as soon as I arrived at university, I asked if it was possible to change to biology, and I did. That was fine. I think they heaved a sigh of relief and thought, thank God, this isn't going to be a physics student. And then I said, well, but I'd like to do some maths courses. And they said, no, you can't do that. So I went away and thought about it. And I came back and I said, well, at least maybe I could do some statistics courses. And they said, no, you're a biology student. So I was trapped. So I was trapped. But they can't stop you reading the odd book or whatever. So I didn't want to do anything heavily mathematical. I'm not up to it. But I at least tried to sort of keep in touch with a few things where it was possible. And we were lucky that our biology course started with neurophysiology, which was mathematical. And so at least that was something to keep one going. Going. So you kept reading and learning as you went to build up your theoretical skills? Well, I did, but I don't know that it did have that effect. My theoretical skills, as you know, are pretty limited. But I used to enjoy reading those things, and I don't know that I ever made much use except of the most elementary books that I read. But at least it seemed to me that it would be possible if you needed to. If you needed to. I got over being totally intimidated. Well, I think that's a big step. Once you get over that, then you can start thinking and developing and creating models. Who influenced your work and your research most over your career? Well, of course, Brian. Yes. But it's hard to say. It's hard to say because I never have thought of myself as a theoretician. I've dabbled in theory, I think would be the, you know, an accurate thing. So the people who've influenced me most are people I either admired and read their work or people who, you know, for some reason or other, got me going on a project. So, I mean, Philip Shepherd, for example, at Liverpool, at that time. At that time, you know, I was an unemployed ex-human geneticist, and I was hanging out around the genetics department. Philip Shepard asked me to think about mimicry. I mean, he knew I'd helped Brian, I'd help do some programming to do with the questions of the evolution of recombination rate. And in mimicry, it was well known by then with Philip Shepard's work. By then, with Philip Shepard's work and others, that there was what looked like a cluster of genes affecting tightly linked genes affecting the mimetic Batesian mimetic butterfly wing patterns and colours. And so the question was, had they got closely linked from being genes scattered around the genome that were brought together or something else. People thought that was the idea that they had been brought together. The idea that they had been brought together from different progenitor genes that were brought together in one place so they could co-segregate and control these different characters. And I really didn't want to work on that at all, actually. I thought, I don't know anything about butterflies, I'm a biochemist, you know. But Philip was, you know, he said, well, just go and read a couple of things. And when I did that, I thought, well, I can do a bit better than that, so I'll have a go at it. Go at it. And so that's what got me started. So that, you know, that's a person I tremendously admired, the genetical work that Philip did and his understanding that there was something still niggling everybody that you didn't understand about this system. So that's one person I admired. But in general, that's the sort of people I have mostly admired or envied. Somebody like Doug Shemsky, also, who works in a completely different field. Completely different field, and not at all theoretical, really, but testing theories, of course, but with a clear idea of some questions and an eye for questions that you could make some progress with. So, you know, and then there's the people who've done theory. I was just this morning reading a paper by Monty Slatkin about transposable element evolution, and oh, what a pleasure. I mean, a purely theoretical paper. I mean, a purely theoretical paper, and I was scared of reading it. I thought I'm not going to be able to understand this, but he is so beautifully clear what assumptions are, why they're important, whether there's some empirical support for making those assumptions, where it's weak, and what it would do to the results if those assumptions were wrong. And then the theories, beautifully clear, just admirable. You know, those are the sort of people who I would like to hope I'd been influenced. Who I would like to hope I'd been influenced by. And have influenced in turn. That's for sure. The story that emerged from mimicry and linkage of genes is really fascinating and played out over a whole number of years, having to do with recombination suppression, of course. I'm wondering, not necessarily in that context, but maybe in that context, do you have a favorite sort of Context, do you have a favorite sort of aha moment when you really saw something for the first time for yourself and it made a big difference to you? Well, I've had a few minor ones, I think. I mean, that mimicry, there was one. I mean, obviously, I was, as I say, a biochemist. I didn't have really any idea. I now realise with hindsight that, you know, it's kind of obvious. And it was known well before Brown and I did the mimicry. Brian and I did the mimicry work that if you have a polymorphism and a new mutation arises at another locus, that where it would be good to be and to have the mutant allele with one of your original alleles, your original polymorphic locus, and bad on the other one, that the recombination fraction is an important issue in whether that or how that mutation will evolve. And that was And that wasn't too difficult to grasp. I think I got there reasonably quickly. But I mean, I did it stupidly by just doing the calculations. Now I realize it's kind of to be expected. And I didn't go into it expecting it. I didn't have any expectation. I really didn't know anything. But one of the things that emerged from that, which again is well known and intuitively clear. Is well known and intuitively clear that, of course, if it's advantageous enough, even if it's unlinked, it could go to fixation. And that explained some populations that were observed in butterflies with Batesian mimicry in Africa. Certain populations in Kenya have the mimetic types, but they have tails, which the modern species don't have tails, and so being a mimic, you shouldn't have tails. Being a mimic, you shouldn't have tails, but this was in some, because it was unlinked, it was advantageous enough that you got the mimicry pattern was advantageous enough that it went to fixation even though it wasn't linked, the tail list gene was not linked. So that was thrilling because it explained this mysterious population that hadn't been understood. It was just, well, it can't happen, but it did. So that was one thing. So that was one thing that I look back on and feel I understood something the biologists who work on it didn't. And I had another one later on with, again, it's sort of a minor thing really, but understanding why you can have polymorphisms of females and hermaphrodites, but you don't very often have polymorphisms of males and hermaphrodites. In fact, Sally. Males and hermaphrodites. In fact, Sally did a very nice paper which shows conditions where you can, but it goes right back to Darwin to remark on this absence of that kind of polymorphism. So looking at it naively, people often still do think, oh, well, one is as likely as the other to have, if you've got hermaphrodites, you could have females invade the population and establish a polymorphism or males. But it ain't so. And one of the And one of the thrills that I had was to actually write, in those days it was before email, it was letters, to a South African botanist who'd reported one of these cases. And by then I understood that it was unlikely that it was real. And I said, could you look at the pollen and see whether the pollen is functional? Because if the hermaphrodites were not functional hermaphrodites, it would just be the case of male and female, which we all know happens, of course. And so he wrote back to me. And so he wrote back to me saying, no, no, it's real. And two days later, I got another letter. Oops, I looked at the pollen. You're right. So that was a thrill that a bit of theory told you that this couldn't be true. And the biologist who'd worked on it for several years found out something he didn't know. It happens sometimes. Part of your answering this question made me think about the process and how we talk about. About the process and how we talk about the process of what we do. I think it's good to be able to speak clearly about the fact that we're often in the dark on questions and we don't understand them. And there can be long periods of time for any sort of insight into something. Or even in some cases to get clear what the question really is. And that's one of the things I do think that theoretical work is. Theoretical work is good for, even if you don't make any progress with solving the problem, to get it clear and to think, well, what would be a reasonable set of assumptions to think about this problem? I found it really a very, very useful thing. Deborah, you said too that, you know, oh, in hindsight it was clear and maybe you should have expected it, but at the time you didn't. And I find that I'm always in that situation of. In that situation of, oh, in hindsight, I understand it, but I really didn't get it. And then math helped me understand and get it. And I think that's important for students to realize that, because when you write, the result is so clear, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was clear from the very beginning. I do agree. And, you know, just starting to write down the assumptions, what you'd like to assume when you make a model. Make a model, you know, right away. You come across biological issues that, you know, you think, oh, well, we need some data for this, we could still make a model, but it's very, very illuminating, I find. Even before you get to the hard mathematics of analyzing that, but just writing down the model. Do you have a paper of yours that you wish more people knew about? Well, I sort of do because I wish people would investigate this more. I have a paper which I think he's right, which was actually work done by an undergraduate. I had this incredibly surprising experience of having an undergrad come into my office and say, I want to do a theoretical project on plants. This was in Edinburgh. And I said, no, no, no, you don't want to do that. And he was great. He said, yes, I do. I really do. Great, he said. Yes, I do, I really do. So, I had this question about what happens when you have a genetic sex determination system and it breaks down. And you can imagine that you've got males and females, genetic males and females, and you can imagine that the density of the population goes down or something, and it's not a good thing to be having separate males and females, and hermaphrodites would be advantageous. Would be advantageous. So you could have a female mutation, or you have a mutation that makes females be able to produce a little bit of pollen, if it's a plant or if it's an animal, a bit of sperm, enough so they can actually reproduce. It might not be so good to be self-fertilizing, but it's better than nothing. Or you could have a mutation that makes males conceivably able to have some female function. And what will happen and whether it will be different? Well, it seems again. It will be different. Well, it seems again, you'd guess ahead of time that it would be different if you had a sex chromosome system, like an XY system, with a very degenerated Y chromosome, so you can't become homozygous for that chromosome. And this student, Alan Grossman, did theoretical modeling on this issue, and we found what you might have expected that it does make a difference. That it does make a difference, and you can then establish a polymorphic situation rather than you don't necessarily go all the way back to being just hermaphroditic. You can sometimes, because you can't have a homozygous for the Y chromosome, you can establish a polymorphism where you'll have females and the other sex. And this again may explain what you see in some plants, but nobody looks, so I But nobody looks, so the reason I would like this paper to be better known is because nobody is looking hard at cases of breakdown of separate sex or genetic sex determination. Well, they are a bit, but John Panel does it. But I think it's illuminating in terms of if you want to know which species have degenerated sex chromosomes, it could be useful. I think it's illuminating about what the genetic. Illuminating about what the genetic and developmental control is of the separate sexes. And it's not just an evolutionary question. I think it can shed more light more generally. And of course, if the breakdown is because of a recombination between different sex-determining factors that aren't completely linked, but in some way can recombine, that would be interesting too. And it would again relate back to what, of course, everybody in our collection. Back to what, of course, everybody now collecting lots of genome sequence data and finding the regions. So I think there's a little some kind of quarry to be dug in there, and I wish that paper was better. It's a small issue. Well, and with that particular example, it sounds too like incorporating the ecology of the situation, that they're that n not all populations are equally dense, finding a mate. Are equally dense, finding a mate varies over space might be an important part to consider. Yes, well, it did relate in the case that we think it might relate to, studied by the ecologist Larry Vennable at University of Arizona, I think. That's the right university. And it is indeed a marginal population of the species. So it fits, but I would like to know more. More. Awesome. Very interesting. Very interesting. I think evolutionary biology is a big field now, and there are lots of students entering it. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about advice to them, if you have any. Starting the career now, as opposed to maybe when you started. Yeah, it's hard to give advice to young people. The world is so very, very, very different. And evolution, I mean, as you say, it's a big field now. There's a lot of Now, there's a lot of different things going on in evolution. And my first bit of advice would be not to be too intimidated by all the very slick stuff that you see published. It's kind of terrifying to read. All the different things that, you know, papers now are crammed with things. You know, you have to have an interesting question and you have to have a system, of course. And you have to have a system, of course, and then you have to sequence the genome, of course, you know, and think. I think for young people, I would say, you know, try to find questions that small and bite-sized question. That's terribly vague advice. How do you do that? And the only way I can see of doing that is to read papers. That is to read papers closely that interest you, and that means not too many papers because it's such a lot of work to read any paper. And I've found in my, you know, to the extent that I've developed at all as an evolutionary biologist, reviewing papers has been tremendously helpful because I learned how to read a paper really closely. And of course, I don't advise people to start off by reviewing papers because in the first place, they're not all perhaps working. And first place, they're not all perhaps worth so well worth reading. Maybe even published ones, you need guidance. So I would say, you know, journal clubs are the way in to learning how to read a paper properly. And I do like journal clubs. I do love journal clubs. I used to run one in Chicago. I ran it for many years and then I ran it when we came to Edinburgh. I would love to continue running it, but younger people are doing it. Running it, but younger people are doing it, and still, I love the journal clubs. Whoever does it, I think it's just a terrific way to notice that there are questions that either thrown up by theory, we need some data, because they're assuming this, but we don't really know, or empirical things where you need some theory. They're saying we interpret it this way, but you don't know if it would work. I think when you're starting off, you think there's terribly difficult. Think there's it was terribly difficult to find questions. When you get old, you think, oh, it's terrible, there's no time just to work on all the interesting questions. That's true. And I think the advice to look for some relatively small, quote small problems and publish on them is really a great encouragement for people. Obviously, if you pick up Nature or Science or the bigger journals these days, you read a paper that has a front end and it has an enormous And it has an enormous list of people and consortia that are on the authorship, and then it has a back end with a supplement, 50 or 100 pages of detailed technical stuff. It's intimidating. It really is. And even, I mean, just to read the figures now, I mean, you know, one figure is actually eight figures. Right. It's a PSD. Eight figures. I'm thinking of a journal club I'm going to do. I'm thinking of a journal club I'm going to do in a couple of weeks. It's a good paper and I want to do it, but it's intimidating. Deborah, you mentioned that you were interested in math all along and that if you had had the options, you would have taken math classes as an undergraduate and as a PhD student. I'm not sure that everybody has always seen modeling and theory as central in biology, but I'm In biology, but I'm not sure if it's if it how views of modelers have changed over your career. Any thoughts on that? Again, I don't have very coherent thoughts. I mean, nowadays there's so much modelling for estimation or for, you know, it's a different world. And there's still some modelling of the sort that we used to do. The sort that we used to do. But it's not a lot of population geneticists. I mean, it never was something that was dead popular. People are chewing up to learn how to do it. But I mean, we've lost journals where it was considered the kind of thing they wanted, like we've lost genetical research and even genetics. And even genetics doesn't have as much, although it still does have. So it's become what I would call population genetics modelling has become a bit in the shade, perhaps, compared with, I mean, genome sequencing is dominating every branch of biology, probably, and it's part of that. So, but I mean, of course, I still think that there's lots of theoretical understanding that's needed to. Understanding that's needed to understand genome sequences. I mean, this, why I was reading Monty Slackin and reading other papers about transposable elements. You know, I want to understand how they behave in genomes. And there's a lot of understanding already, but there's many new questions coming out of genome sequences. And I'm interested in sex chromosomes. And obviously, they're just one example, one case of. Just one example, one case of non-recombining regions, and repetitive sequences do build up in those regions. That we already know. But if you can get the question is whether you can get any better understanding of how fast they build up, in what way they build up, I think there are still unclear things that need more modelling. One of the challenges. The challenges facing students today, too, I think, is how to integrate across subfields that are increasingly considered separate. Biochemistry is separate from genetics, is separate from ecology, is separate from evolution. That stifles evolutionary theory because you tend to develop it within your subfield. And so, what is your perspective of how do you break those boundaries? Perspective of how do you break those boundaries down? Is it worth doing? And what should we be careful of as we develop models? Yeah, I think it is a problem, all right. I mean, one of the nice things about working in evolution is that you get to poke your nose into different aspects of biology, you know, these different questions. And in many cases, you can't overlook, say, some biochemistry or some Obviously, population genetics is inherently an interdisciplinary thing between evolution and genetics. So we're used to it, at least, which is helpful. But how much, you know, again, if you were talking to young people, you can't say, well, you've got to learn everything, you know, do a course in everything and remember it all and understand it all. It's crazy. So, you know, all you can do is deal with things. Is deal with things as they seem to impinge, but if you don't even realize that this would be relevant, it could be a real problem. And again, journal clubs, and I think journal clubs are the only sort of real hope for us. And, you know, I like the idea of people getting together who are interested in evolution or interested in genetics, but more and more people feel that they have so much in their own field that they Their own field that they don't have time or energy to belong to a more general type of journal club or run a more general type. And I think that's a loss. Obviously, some journals are starting a kind of journal club type of article. And I think those can be quite attractive and helpful, short articles that introduce you. You might be prepared to read it to introduce you to something that impinges but isn't. Impinges but isn't within your field. We have to try and be conscious of it and work on it, I think, whatever we can do. But journal clubs are my main hope that they'll help. Right. Of across your career, keeping your mind broad and your understanding broad. That's try not to be too narrow. And again, in this context, it's not quite the same thing. But of course, one of the things you notice when you get old is that. Things you notice when you get old is that wonderful work from the past, from some of the greats in genetics, is kind of forgotten about. And, you know, again, partly because of the dominance of genome sequencing, it does look terribly old-fashioned to be doing just genetics. But boy, did they do some good stuff with it, and it's stuff we shouldn't forget. It's sometimes exactly what we need to understand. Exactly, what we need to understand. Is it your impression that it's easier now to bridge fields than it was in the past, or are there similar challenges? I imagine they're fairly similar. At least it's easier to get hold of the literature with Web of Science and follow up things, but still there's just so much. There's just so much. Everybody, I think, feels the same. And I think it's always been difficult, and I think it's just bound to be. If you work in evolution, as I say, you get to poke your nose into different things. And there are various different things you need to know about. I mean, and especially such a wide range of organisms, you know, from pathogens and viruses right through to big things, plants and animals. It's interesting, so it's fine, but it is work. That's a very nice segue, I think, into what will be the last question for this interview. Deborah, your work has really always been very innovative and covered a wide range of topics. And yet, you know, reading your papers this morning and looking through your literature that you have produced, you can see these threads. You can see these threads that you've maintained through your career and their key themes, such as the role of deleterious mutation in evolution and the tremendous utility of plants as model systems for studying very general evolutionary phenomena. So what has helped you, if you could talk a little bit about what has helped you to see the good problems to work on? I think I was just lucky. Honestly, I worked on the mimic. Honestly, I worked on the mimicry question, which was a recombination question, as I said. And then that led to separate sexes as another recombination question, because you have exactly the same question. Why do you get separate sexes? Just like why do you get nemetic forms? And in both cases, these are phenotypes or phenotypic polymorphisms that have several aspects and probably controlled by more than a single gene. So it was a So it it was a similar problem, and that led to other planty things. I mean, when I did the sex chromosome evolution paper, David Lloyd had been working on similar things, and he sent me a nice letter. I replied, you know, it's been fun doing this, but there's nothing more to be done on it. So I completely, idiotically, never dreamt that I would work any more on sex chromosomes, and I've worked on them ever since. And I've worked on them ever since. So I don't think there's been any grand plan, really. But then, recombination, I mean, again, I was always from high school interested in genetics, and recombination is certainly a very interesting aspect. And there's loads we don't understand about it, genomic patterns, why recombination rates vary, you know, and mechanisms. So it did end up. So it did end up as a theme, recombination, really, more than anything else. But not planned way. When you're working on a project throughout your career, how do you move from one project to the next? I think it's a really, we have to write papers, we have to finish projects, but there's always something that comes next. Something that comes next, or maybe there isn't. Well, yes, I think there usually is. I mean, because at some point you have to wrap it up and say, I want to submit this manuscript, but I haven't done all I wanted to do with the thing. So that's one major way. You just end up, the thing got too big, and you end up with one paper, and then there's something else, and you think, well, that'll just be a note, but it ends up perhaps not being, when you think about it independently of the rest. Think about it independently of the rest, it ends up more. But again, not necessarily very planned because, with the funding situation, you know, when you have to ask, when you have a project finishing that funding, you know, I mean, in the case of the work I've been doing in the last seven years or so on sex chromosomes in the guppy, that Chromosomes in the guppy, that arose because I'd been interested in sex chromosomes for a long time, and then people were doing stuff and writing papers. I felt that the genetics was being left out and had been done early in the 20th century and through the middle years of the 20th century, but now with molecular markers, it was something you could revisit. So, again, although it's not exactly a plan theme, I do think I've been very conscious that some of the classical work. Some of the classical work can be revisited with the benefit of genetics using molecular markers. That has been a theme. And in the case of the guppy sex chromosomes, it told us something that was quite surprising, perhaps shouldn't have been, but with hindsight, you can see it shouldn't have been, but was quite surprising at the time. And it's, you know, basically that the X and Y chromosome in this particular X and Y chromosome in this particular fish are almost identical. And then it's not the only case. Of course, then you look around, you find there are other organisms that are like that. Deborah, thank you so much for spending this hour with us. I think your career has been marked by doing theory, developing theory, but then always having an eye to the empirical patterns and using that as a check of, okay, something's missing. Of okay, something's missing, or this isn't quite right, or more is needed to be done. And I think that's an inspiration for us all of always reading broadly enough to know what the empirical patterns are and keeping that, keeping our theory true to them. Yeah, well, when one can, yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you.
