The beautiful city of Oaxaca. This is basically a collection of a few projects which have several collaborators. And for each project, there was a different subset of collaborators. And one element And one element in the intersection of this project is Waiting Ram. So she's been my PhD student, and she's now a postdoctoral fellow at Florida Atlantic University. So this is about some simple mathematical models for the Sun, Jupiter, Hector, Scamandrius system. So this is a cartoon of the Jupiter's Trojans. So these are. Uh, Jupiter's Trojan. So, these are two clusters of asteroids that some of them are located in the L4 Lagrange point of the Sun-Jupiter system, then some others form a cluster around the L5 point. So, I'm going to focus on a To focus on a particular one, on a particular asteroid. So, this is Hector, 6 to 4 Hector. So, this is the largest Jupiter Trojan identified. It is located at L4. And I'm just giving you some numbers to have a sense. So, this is 270. 270 kilometers in approximate diameters. So, in this picture, vector is this tiny dot where you have the arrow. And over here, I believe this is Jupiter. So, Hector has an irregular shape. So, in this second picture, you see that. you see that Jupiter that Hector is against Jupiter. So Jupiter is the dark disk and it seems like Hector has this elongated shape. And it's also known that Hector spins very fast. The rotation period is about seven hours. Seven hours. What is also interesting about Ector is that it has a moonlet. The moonlet is called Scamandrios. So, Scamandrios is this small dot inside a green circle. And the names are sort of matching the history. So, Scamandrius was the son of Prince Hector from the Trojan War, A San. ASAN. So the observation of Scamandios has been very poor, and all of the measurements are done with some degree of approximation. So the distance between Hector is Camandria, it's approximately a thousand kilometers. Diameter of Scamandria is about 12 kilometers. And what is interesting is that All of these estimates have been done indirectly from observing the trajectory of the moonlet. So even the shape of Hector, it's kind of a good guess. So there is one has to, in order to get a modeling of the In order to get a modeling of the motion of Scamandrius, one has to take into account the irregular shape of Hector. And here it's ranking of the effects on the orbit of Scamandria. So first of all, the strongest effect is the effect of the gravity of vector. But the second one is the J2 effect. So this is the effect of the irregular shape. And then other effects are, of course, Sun and J. Other effects are, of course, Sun and Jupiter. So, what I'm trying to do is sort of discuss a few simple models of different aspects of the dynamics of Scamandrius. And I want to mention that the orbit of Scamandrius is sort of complicated according to the optical observations. So, there are some models that have been proposed by astronomers for the shape of hector. So, there is a convex model, a bilobed model, so this is like a peanut shape, and a binary model or a doublet model. So, essentially, these are two rocks that are somewhat detached. Detached from one another. So the simplest approximation of the shape of vector, it's an ellipsoid with semi-axis, which are 280 kilometers in one direction, 65 in the other direction, and sixty kilometers that would be in the vertical direction perpendicular to the ecliptic, and the average radius is about ninety two kilometers. Is about 92 kilometers. And one estimate of the J2 effect, so this is the oblateness effect is about 0.4. So Hector has one of the largest oblateness in the solar system. Again, all of this, you have to take all of these estimates with a grain of salt. You look at the literature and you find some estimates that are significantly different, and there are also some errors that people are. Some errors that people have done. So I'm not going to argue for these particular numbers. This is just a case study. So I want to discuss two aspects. So how to model the gravitational potential of an irregularly shaped body and some simple analytical models for the dynamics of the moolette. So I emphasize the word simple, so I'm not. I emphasize the word simple, so I'm not going to try to get the rather realistic models that are essentially numerical models, but models that are simpler, maybe not so accurate, but they can be analyzed with essentially pencil and paper to some extent. So let me just briefly mention that one classical way I briefly mentioned that one classical way to model the gravitational potential of irregular bodies is to use spherical coordinates and to use an expansion in spherical harmonics. So this is just a general formula for such an expansion. But it turns out that this expansion is particularly good. Particularly good for bodies that are almost spherical bodies, and the approximation is not so good for bodies that are not close to spherical. And other type of expansion, in terms of elliptical coordinates, for instance, have been proposed. So, what I want to describe quickly is Describe quickly, it's a different way to provide models for the shape of an asteroid. So, the idea is very simple. So, I want to model asteroids that are given by surface of revolution. So, I'm taking a function f of x and I revolve this, the graph of the function, about the horizontal axis. And we want to estimate. We want to estimate, we want to compute what is the gravitational potential at each point generated by such a solid. And we came up with the following formula. So this is a one-dimensional integral. So the bounds of the integral is negative x0 is the left endpoint and positive x0. Point and positive x0 is the right endpoint corresponding to this shape. So it's a one-dimensional integral. And f is again the graph of the function. And what is this y here? So y is a combination of elliptic functions. So the next slide might be a little scary. So there is a precise formula for y. Precise formula for y, but y involves a bunch of elliptic functions. So I'm not going to attempt to read this formula. But all I'm saying is or I'm repeating that all of these expressions are rather explicit and they are done in terms of well-known elliptic functions. And there is a little bit of advantage. There is a little bit of advantage that these functions are implemented in numerical computational software and they can be also expanded in convergent power series if one wants to do so. So one complication is, of course, that this is not a formula easy to digest, but on the top of this, you have some integration, albeit is a Integration, albeit is a one-dimensional integration. Nevertheless, we are able to use this. So, okay, let me just say one more thing before proceeding to applications. So, take such a solid generated by the revolution of a graph, and you also want to spin. And you also want to spin this around the vertical axis, the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the ecliptic. So, this is the same formula as before. And this is the effect of the rotation where omega is the rotational speed. So, you have an effective potential that gives you a way to estimate the energy acting at each point on the surface. And one of the general And one of the general questions is: what are possible realistic shapes? So this is a question that goes back, has a long history, goes back to Newton, Clara, Stokes, Maclaurin, Jacobi, Pancare, Darwin, Chandra Secare, Rigucci. So they found the idea is that you think of the body like a fluid body. And on the one hand, you have the gravity that if it's just the gravity. If it's just the gravity, the body will assume a spherical shape. But if you choose to rotate the body around a vertical axis, then you have competing forces, the centrifugal force and the gravity. And when you change the rotational speed, one can achieve different shapes. And there is a sequence of shapes that people have been discovered over the years. So from spherical, you go to different kinds of ellipsoids. Here on the top, you have the Poincar√© shape, pear shape, and then there is a peanut shape and there is a doublet shape and so on. So this is just a short historical note. So what we these shapes are very interesting to study, however, they are not given by analytical formulas. They just come out more or less numerically, particularly the most complicated ones towards the end of the sequence. So, what we want, we want something that can be modeled with few parameters. So, we chose this particular formula that depends on two parameters. The graph is like this, and we study what are the possible shapes that Shapes that are given by as equilibria of the effective energy. So we want that the energy of the surface generated by this graph to be constant. And we achieve this by a variational method. And what we get is various shapes that are somewhat realistic, so they are similar to the ones that have been discovered. ones that have been discovered but what I want to emphasize that they are obtained by revolving a single function that depends on just two parameters so you have some ellipsoid like shape some peanut shape and some other shape that are like double so so this was a sort of a nice exercise Sort of a nice exercise to get shapes that are similar to what is believed to be the shape of Hector. So, in fact, we get a family of such candidates, but it's still quite hard to use these for analytical studies. So, from now on, I'm just going to take the simplest of these possible models that I'm going to assume that hector it's a That I'm going to assume that Hector is an oblate spheroid. So, and we are going to take this assumption and try to study or try to develop a relatively simple model for the dynamics of the moonlet of Scamandrius. So, there are several steps. So, we want to look for triangular relative equilibria with one oblique. Equilibria with one oblate mass that would be hector, but in fact, we are going to look for three oblate masses just to be a little more general. Then we do a Hill approximation of the circle-restricted four-body problem. We use this Hill approximation for an analytic determination of fixed points, stability, bifurcation, invariant manifolds. And at the end, we are going to regularize. At the end, we are going to regularize collision with the asteroids. So, first, we just take Hector, the Sun, and Jupiter. We assume for generality that they are all oblate bodies, and we want to find triangular central configurations. And we follow Just a standard approach. So, this is the gravitational potential that we assume, the formula that we assume essentially for each of the three bodies. So, we use like we cut the harmonic, the expansion only to the second order harmonic. And this C20 is the coefficient of the second harmonic, and this is. The second harmonic, and this is negative j2, so which this is the oblateness coefficient. So these c coefficients account for the oblateness, and for an oblate body, these c's are all negative. So a question. So this assumes that the oblateness axis is kind of, they are all aligned, right? Yes, so we so they are all in the same plane and the oblateness axis are all vertical to the ecliptic. So it's a the model, it's quite simplified. It's quite simplified, and it's indeed not many asteroids, many Jupiter Trojans are not like that. But this is a sacrifice that we make. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the good answer. And then we find we look for triangular relaxed. Triangular relative equilibria, and unlike the case when these are just point masses with no oblateness, we found the triangular relative equilibria that they are scalene triangles. So we normalize Sun to Jupiter to one, and the other two distances we denote them by U1 and U2. By u1 and u2, and they have to satisfy this equation. What are the c12, c13, c23? Let me go back. So the c's are normalized and then the cij's are the sum of the obliveness coefficient of the bodies. So this may be a little bit cryptic in a short talk. Bit cryptic in a short talk, but what I want to say is that there is a nice property that it's similar to Euclidean property of triangles that the larger the angle, the larger is the opposite side. So here we have that the larger is the oblateness coefficient, but taken as a negative number, the larger is the opposite side. So we have a similarity. We have a similarity with Euclidean geometry property of triangles. In the case when only hector, hector is M3, it's oblate, then the relative equilibrium turns out to be an isosceles triangle. And I want to mention here that a similar type of result has been obtained by Arredondo and Perez Chavea. They use, they look at other types of effects, relativistic effects, if I remember correctly. So now we have like we know what is the position of the Sun, Jupiter, and Hector when we consider the oblateness effect. So we can compute their position relative to a corrotating frame. Position relative to a corotating frame. Again, we have complicated formulas that I don't want you to look at too closely. I just want to emphasize that everything is explicit and it can be done by hand. That's all. And from this point on, we only consider the oblateness of Hector because the oblateness of the Sun and Jupiter are fairly small. So now we write the object of the So now we write the first the restricted four body problem with one oblate mass and that is only hector and the effect of the oblateness in normalized units is like negative three ten to the power negative fifteen. So in normalized units when the distance Sun Jupiter is equal to one the oblateness effect is based The oblateness effect is basically a number which is close to machine error. So this is not very good. So however, we do a hill approximation. So heel approximation, we follow the standard recipe. So we do a conformally symplectic scaling by the one-third power of the mass of hector. We also rescale. We also rescale the average radius of hector and we expand in power series of m3 to the one-third and neglect all higher order terms in the expansion. This is the standard recipe, no secrets here, and we get the Hill approximation. So, and the point is that again, there are two points that I want to make is when you look at the Hill approximation. Make is when you look at the Hill approximation, the effect of Sun and Jupiter. The effect of Sun and Jupiter gave singularities in the original system, but in the Hill approximation, the effect of Sun and Jupiter are polynomial. The only singularity is given by vector. So this is a bit of a gain. And the second gain is that the oblateness effect, which used to be 10. Which used to be 10 to the negative 15 is now a more manageable number, which is 10 to the negative 7. And there are quite a few results I'm mentioning here only a few of them that are related to the restricted four-body problem or for the Hill approximation of the restricted four-body problem. So we perform. We perform some type of rotation of the coordinates for convenience, and we want to compute now the equilibrium points for the Hill approximation, and they turn out to be six equilibrium points. And the computation, so the equilibrium points come from Come from fifth degree equation, fifth degree polynomial equation. So it's a relatively simple computation. So we have two equilibria on the horizontal axis, two equilibria on the vertical on the y-axis, and two other equilibria on the z-axis. So z-axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic. And for the For the case of San Jupiter Hector, I want to call your attention on the real units. So on the x-axis, the Acha Libya are at 85,000 kilometers away. On the y-axis, they are 900 something thousand kilometers away. But on the z-axis, the z-equilibria are fairly close, like 100 kilometers away. Why I want to call your attention on this number, I'm just going to go back several slides, a bunch of slides. So the estimate for actor in the Z direction is 60 kilometers. So it appears to be that this equilibrium point in the Z direction is very close to the surface. And you may be surprised about this. If you are not surprised, I If you are not surprised, I'm going to surprise you later. Okay. Again, the advantage of doing Hill approximation is that we can analyze the stability of the equilibria analytically. So I can get some results, some proofs for these results. So the X equilibria are of center-center-saddle type, that is, for all. That is for all C small negative and small enough, and for all mass ratios. Now, the mass ratio in the Hill approximation is the mass ratio between Jupiter and the Sun. For the Y equilibria, for all mass ratios and for all C negative and sufficiently small, we have a bifurcation. We have a bifurcation. So the bifurcation is with respect to the mass ratio. So for some values and the bifurcation point also depends on C, on the oblateness. So the linear stability changes from center, center, center to center complex saddle. And these equilibria and their stability are the same as in the Hill four body problem without oblateness, except that the bifurcation here, the bifurcation value of for the mass ratio, now depends on the oblateness. While in the classical case, when there is no oblateness, there is a No oblateness, there is a threshold value of mass ratio for which you have a change of stability from center, center, center to center, complex atom. So there are no surprises here. So the only element of happiness is that we can do this analytically. So when we look at the Z equilibria, these are of the linear stability center complex atom. Stability center complex saddle, and we can also prove analytically that the two pairs of eigenvalues that are not purely imaginary, they have the imaginary part extremely close to plus minus i. So it's that says that there is an infinitesimal motion around the equilibrium point, which is close to one-to-one resonance with the Sun Jupiter. Sun Jupiter. So this is verified numerically, but we have an analytical proof for that. So what I want to say now is that the surprise is that these Z equilibria are not necessarily physical. So they might be as well an artifact of the approximation. I imagine that you have an asteroid. I imagine that you have an asteroid that in the Z direction is 60 kilometers, but you have an equilibrium point which is 100 kilometers away. So, how could it be? It means you are above the ecliptic and you are above the asteroid and you do not fall on the asteroid. So, this is impossible. And in fact, this is an undesirable. An undesirable consequence of the J2 approximation. Moreover, I want to say that the spherical harmonic expansion is not always convergent. So it's convergent outside of the Browen sphere, but inside it might be divergent. So the spherical harmonic expansion, it's not so good when you are very close to the body. Close to the body, and moreover, the J2 approximation is particularly bad in this case. However, we wondered whether it is possible for non-convex bodies to have equilibria in the z direction. And we came up with a man-made asteroid. So, this is for pedagogical purposes. So, if you Create your own rubble pile type of asteroid, it is possible that you have equilibria on the vertical axis, and you can even have multiple equilibria, some stable and some unstable. So we speculate that non-convex shapes may have Z equilibria that are true ones and they. And they really depend on the configuration. So I think I have a few minutes. We did a bit of very standard computation of the stable and unstable manifolds and quasi-periodic orbits. So on the x-axis, you have the Saddle center equilibria, and we compute the stable and unstable manifolds. So, you might see in light green, so this is the hill region, and the stable and unstable manifolds are in red and blue. And it's not shown here, but they do intersect transversally. So, you have chaotic motions inside the hill region. So, this is a hill region. Hill region. So, this is a hill region by hector. So, we can speculate here that the motion of the scamandrias, which is observed to be complicated, may be driven by the stable and unstable manifolds and their intersection. You also have stable and unstable manifolds outside of the outer region, in the outer hill region. So, now the hill region. Region. So now the hill region is kind of very faint. I hope that you, if you can squint it, you can see it. And there are intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds in the outward outside region as well. And here I'm showing some quasi-periodic orbits near the y equilibria and some orbits near the z equilibria. So I think this is sort of Is sort of in agreement with the Hill model without oblateness, so the oblateness has little effect on these invariant manifolds and their intersection. So the last part is: I want to say a few words about the regularization. So we want to, for practical purposes, For practical purposes, we would be interested in regularized collisions. And this is after some notation changes, so this is the Hamiltonian of the Planar Hill for body problem. And I want you to observe that we have two. Two singular terms. So this is if you ignore the other terms, so this is basically the quasi-homogeneous type of potential that Slim Ibrahim mentioned the other day. So we undergo classical McGihi coordinates. Again, I'm not going to take you through this. Take you through this whole thing. So basically, you change to complex variables and you rescale the time in a convenient fashion and just draw the conclusion. And this is we obtain a collision. So maybe I should say the following. So the collision manifold turns out to be a two-dimensional torus and the two-dimensional And the third dimensional torus depends on C. What is C? So, C, it's again the obliqueness coefficient rescaled in some convenient way. This time, this C is positive for oblate bodies. So, I think this is written over here. So, this C is now has the same sign as J2. And I'm sorry for the many notations. The many notations that are somehow changing a little bit from one slide to another. So now the C accounts for the effect of oblateness, but C positive corresponds to oblate body. So what we have is we have a collision manifold, which is a two-dimensional torus. The energy equation is somewhat complicated. So there is no obvious relation between the Is no obvious relation between the interior of this and the energy, and the conclusion is that when we have an oblate body, each collision solution is branch regularizable, so it has an analytic, a unique analytic continuation, and moreover, each extension solution is a reflection. The collision set is not block regularizable. So, here I'm showing a projection of the collision set in two coordinates. So, the collision set is the circle. And you see that the collision set is not an isolating is not an isolated invariant set. So, this is why it's not block regularizable. Not block regularizable. When C goes to zero, the collision manifold undergoes a bifurcation. So what you have here is that you have an attractive fixed point, a repelling fixed point, and two saddles. And when C goes to zero, so this is So, this is moving from a bigger C to a smaller C. So, the picture kind of squishes. And then, when C is equal to zero, everything squishes to a point. So, the collision manifold becomes a point. And when you switch the sign of C from positive sign, so I recall that positive sign for C it's For oblate and negative sign of C, it's for prolate. So there are no collisions. So if you consider the same problem for a prolate body, so the collisions basically disappear. And it's sort of easy to understand when they disappear. Disappear. So when you take this term and you switch the negative sign into a positive sign, so the force exerted by this term becomes the dominating force and it's a repulsive force. So you have the gravity, which is an attractive force, but you have a repulsive force that is much stronger and prevents collision in the model. Of course, for a real prolate asteroid, Rolate asteroid, you can still collide at the surface of the asteroid. And it's, I don't know, I mean, why may wonder why do we care ever about prolate asteroids? Are there examples? And for me, at least, it was a surprise that there are some asteroids that are believed to be prolate and Uranus moons, which Moons, which have names from heroines in Shakespeare plays, they are considered to be approximately prolate. And I want to make some references to some related works besides the classical work of Megihi. They are the works by Christian. Works by Christina Stojka and collaborators, works by my colleague Ed Berl Bruno, and some works that I recently learned by Slim Ibrahim and collaborators. And I thank you very much for your attention. So, thank you. So, there are some questions. Question. In fact, I would like to ask you just a basic question because when you speak about regularization, so it is in Magi sense. It means that collision solution taking, so after regularization, collision solution take an infinite time to go to collision. Okay. That is correct. Okay, okay. So, this is a classical Magishi type of polarization. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. So, some other question? So, if not, we thank you. So, we thank you. Thank you very much. And I think we can switch to the last speaker of the The last speaker of the day.
