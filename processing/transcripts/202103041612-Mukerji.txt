It's called Sonobe units. The original, and my name is Minakshi Mukherjee, and I've been doing origami since maybe 25 plus years now. And I have, you know, I have a website that's very popular with a lot of resources. And I also have IP seven books right now working on my eighth. They're all available. They're all available on Amazon and other places. So it's my pleasure to be teaching at Gear for my Sunobe units, variations. But the reason I do have a lot of modular units of my own, but the reason I picked the Sunobe unit is simply because it's kind of like the building block for modular arigami. If you understand the Sonobe unit, then and make a few constructions. And make a few constructions, then you should be ready for most other modular origami constructions. And it is a nice way to learn about polyhedra without getting hit on the head too much with math for people who do not like mathematics, but they can still understand them while constructing with the Sunobe units. So here I have an example of, oh, it's vanishing in the background. Oh, it's vanishing in the background. I should hold it with me. So, this is actually an octahedral structure. We are not going to make this in class today because it needs like 25 unit, I'm sorry, 12 units and we don't have time for that. So, I'm going to teach a six unit cube with a Sonobe variation type unit. And the thing to remember about these particular kinds of constructions is that. Particular kind of constructions is that each face instead of being a flat face of a polyhedron, it's actually pyramidized. So imagine the base of the pyramid is one face. Then it's our octahedron, but each face has been pyramidized, and that's how Sunove constructions are inherently. So today in the class, we'll make a In the class, we'll make a six-unit cube and time-permitting a three-unit hexahedron or dipyramid, whatever you would like to call it. And then I will give you a little bit of insight into how to construct larger polyhedra with the same units. So, if we could please please pin the video to my instructions window and you know, I hope you all have. I hope you all have a six-inch paper handy, or rather 15 centimeters, I should say, for Canada. Anything from 10 to 15 centimeter squares are good. And we'll need six for the cube and then additionally three for our hexahedron. And then, you know, leave some extra paper around. So if you make a mistake or if you want to leave intermediate notes, step notes, you can do that if you have extra paper. You can do that if you have extra paper. So, let me get started. So, we are going to hold our paper white side up. We do need two-sided paper for this because, as you see, there's a pattern which is formed with the reverse side of the paper. In our case, the reverse side is going to be white and the other side is going to be yellow. So, let's fold that sheet in half. One of the things. Half. One of the things to keep in mind is because these are machine-milled paper, you see, in one direction, it's rather, you know, it kind of bends easier than the other direction. There's a little resistance. So I'd like you to take the direction that's easier to fold and then fold it in half. In origami lingo, this is often called. Go, this is often called book fold. So, because it's simply because it's like a book, and you can open it like that. Then we unfold that. And so, our paper is now in two halves, two rectangles. You are now going to fold the quarters on both sides. So we have folded the quarters and then let's hold it like this now for convenience. And let's what we want to do is take each of these flaps, and this is also called the cupboard fold in order because this. A cupboard fold in origami because it's just like a cupboard, but it's just quarters, that's all. So we hold the paper like that, and we fold the eight, but you know, in this case, you don't have to fold the entire line, but just make a pinch in the middle. That should be enough for us. And then we take that edge. So that pinch is really at one-eighth of the width. So and then further we'll So and then further we fold a sixteenth. So we fold a width that's one sixteenth and that is basically what creates the pattern on the shape. Otherwise it wouldn't have the white pattern. And then we turn it around and do the same. So we pinch the one-eighth just a tiny bit. Just a tiny pinch, and then we fold 1/16, a border that's a 1/16th the width of the paper. Then we open, we kind of go back to that orientation again and open the cupboard doors. So it looks like this on this side, and it has the borders on the other side. It has the borders on the other side. So now the next step that I'm going to do is very direction sensitive. It's a directional fold. So if I tell you to fold the top left corner like that, you please fold the top left because if you do some other corner, then our units will not fit with each other. The idea is to make all of them the same way, all six. The same way, all six. So please hold the top left corner up to the quarter mark and then the bottom right corner also up to the quarter mark. So top left and bottom right is what you need to remember when you make your other units. If you by chance switch that, then your units won't fit with each other. So after we've done that, So, after we've done that, let's close the cupboard door, the right cupboard door, and then kind of fold the 45-degree angle all the way like that, and then at that point. And then at that point, we close the left cupboard door. Let's rotate 180 degrees. So that's pointing down. And then again, do another 45 degree fold on this side on the right, all the way from to meet. To meet the other board. And at this point, what we want to do is we take that flap and we tuck it under that cupboard door that's still showing. So it's kind of locks into a parallel room. Is it possible? Is it possible to repeat the last few faults from where we did top left and bottom right? Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. So let me go back to the top left and bottom right. If you have that, then I'll proceed. Do you still have that? So what I want to do is close the right door and make a 45 day. And make a 45-degree fold starting from here. So, all you do is take this edge and bring it to that line. Yeah. And then you close the door on the left. And then we rotate 180 degrees. Rotate 180 degrees. We fold another 45 degree, we make another 45 degree fold like that. And what we want to do is we want to take that flap and we want to tuck it under that left door. So you kind of have to flip. So, you kind of have to flex it and tuck it. So, it's like a neat, neatly locked parallelogram. So then we turn the parallelogram over to the other side. And what we want to do is see the longer sides of the parallelogram. We just want to fold them in half. So basically bring that sharp point to this blunt point. And then the same thing with this one. Bring the sharp point to here. And that really is one complete unit. Is one complete unit. And we can unfold those last two steps and I can explain how these things lock. So all these Sonobe type units or most modular origami units are locked by things called tabs and pockets. So the tab go inside, the tab of one unit goes inside the pocket of another unit. Another unit, and that's how they lock, mostly held by friction and some you know, tensile strength and things like that as you as the construction proceeds. So, in this case, our tabs are pretty obvious. These two sharp things are our tabs. And our pockets are right here. This is one pocket, and this is another pocket. Is another pocket, but we can demonstrate the locking only once we have made at least one other unit. So let's, I'm going to make another unit that way you'll also start remembering how to fold a unit. You can choose for a cube, you can choose like three colors or just one color. In my case, I'm In my case, I've chosen three colors for my constructions. So for the second unit, it's all the same. I'm going to go a little faster, but please stop me if there are any questions. So book fold in half. Unfold cupboard fold, which is basically folding in quarters. Then, for folding convenience, we rotate ninety. We rotate 90 degrees and then we fold those one-eighth benchmark and then a one-sixteenth border. And then you do the same on the other flap. Black Then we rotate again, we fold what we did, and to fold the corners, our top left and bottom right corners. So we are folding it right up to that quarter mark we had originally made. And then we close the right door and we hold at 45 degrees and we close the left door. We close the left door, then we rotate 180 degrees and we hold another 45-degree fold. 45-degree folds are easy because all you have to do is bring the To do is bring the horizontal edge to the vertical edge, and you have a 45-degree, and we have to tuck that under the left toe. Then we turn over, we bring the We bring the sharp points to the blunt, sharp angles, like the acute angles to the obtuse angles. Which is basically also just bisecting this edge of the parallelogram, the larger edge. And we do that to the other one as well. To the other one as well. And that is one complete unit. So we now have two. Now, in the live class, I waited for people to fold six units. But do you think for this one, I just people can pause and make their units? People can pause and make their units, and then, like, I personally didn't fold all six, I just waited for people to fold and then started constructing. So, in this recording, what would you like me to do? What do you prefer, Camilia? Do you want to, if I get a say here, I really messed up my previous one, so I'm still trying to do one of these guys. I would appreciate seeing it one more time. Okay. It one more time, okay. Sure, yeah, okay, let's do that. Now, I'm going to dismantle one of this thing and kind of try to reuse this for our cube construction. So, you can see one like dismantling. Here are all the minutes. Okay. So So, where are my papers? Yeah, I'm just going to unfold one of these and go over them. Seems like I can't find in my paper here. So, should I start from the beginning or hello? I would love to be very late. That would be great if we start from the very beginning. Yeah, from the very beginning? Yes, okay. So we started with a square piece of paper, something between 10 to 15 centimeters is a good size. And having two colors on each side is a plus because we are going to have some pattern on our polyhedron. So I'm assuming you have at least six. I'm assuming you have at least six sheets. I don't have a double-sided, but it's color. It'll work. You just won't get the white stripes and the white patterns. Okay. So we'll fold the paper in half, which we call book fold. And then we unfold that. And then we fold quarters. And then we fold quarters, which is also called covered folding in origami because now you have like two covered doors. And then we make a we take one free edge and bring it to this edge and make a one-eighth pinch. This time we don't want to. This time we don't want to fold the whole line because we don't need it basically. So we made a pinch like that at 1 8th. And then we fold the border that's 1 16th using that pinch. And we do the same thing on the left, left door of the Left left door of the cupboard. All right, then we are going to open the cup, unfold the cupboard doors, but not we are not going to unfold the little borders, we uh little strips we folded. We uh little strips we folded, they stay as is, but we're opening the covered doors, and because this unit is directional, uh, we are going to follow exactly what I ask people to fold, otherwise there'll be fitting trouble in the end, later when we try to assemble. So, we fold the left corner at 45 degrees, top left. And then the bottom right. And you have to have this for all units. It's very because if you make an image of what I'm making, the units are not going to fit with each other. So top left and bottom right is something you have to remember. Now, once you've done that, I want you to close the right door. I want you to close the right door of the cupboard and make another 45-degree fold with the right side. And then we close the left door on top of it. Now we rotate 180 degrees. Degrees. So our sharp point is pointing downwards. And we fold another 45 degree with this whole width of the paper. And then we tuck it inside the left door of the cupboard. See, this time you'll have to kind of flex the paper to. You'll have to kind of flex the paper to in order to tuck it, and there we have a nicely locked parallelogram. And then we turn over to the other side. And this is the reverse side of the unit. We just want to fold these longer edges of the parallelogram in half. So all you have. Gram in a half. So, all you need to do is take this acute angle and bring it to that obtuse angle. And so, that way you've halved one side and then you halved the other side. And that really is one complete unit. We need six of those for our cube construction. I think Camilia might have three or four by now. And do you have the right unit, right? Did you get it? I got the last one, right? Yes. So I have one working one and two not working ones. It's better to make it from different colors. Is it going to be better? Yes. One color also has its own charm, but three has a different appeal. So for learning, I think three colors is good. So I will let you have a few more units. Even if you don't have all six, I can kind of like you can have. You can have a feel for how the entire construction will be. So I'll wait for you to have at least maybe three or four. So I was in band for So I was in Ban few years ago. It's so beautiful. I want to go back again. It was August, but there was still some good amount of glaciers and snow on the mountains. And one thing that stood out to me was any place I stopped in Banff, any place on the highway, anywhere, it's there's some beautiful scenery at the back. It is so beautiful. It is so beautiful. And also, the colors of the lake for the various minerals. It's amazing. I don't think I've seen those colors in any other place. Lake Moraine was so beautiful. Actually, in your classes, who is participating in your classes? Is it just anyone, anyone from public data interested or? Or, you know, could you say a little bit about your classes? Oh, yeah, about my, I don't actively advertise doing classes, but you know, I teach whenever people get in touch with me, just like you did. So, oftentimes, you know, I teach at origami conventions for sure. When I attend, there are such conventions as origami conventions. A lot of people don't know. And I've been a guest of honor in many different countries. Honor in many different countries, actually, gone to different countries. So, I teach over there. I teach those conferences are meant for teaching your latest and greatest and things like that, because they're all origami experts. And then sometimes, you know, libraries will call me to teach. You know, it hasn't happened in COVID, not live, but online has happened. Then, various origami organizations. Various origami organizations will also have Zoom classes like this. You know, now that people can't travel for conferences, a lot of Zoom classes. And mostly if I'm teaching to beginners, like in libraries or like here, I always, you know, teach something of this kind, some Sunove variation. How did you get interested to this? How I got interested. So So actually, from a friend, she folded a little bit, and I think at her office, someone was teaching every alternate Friday. And one day she invited me to join. And when I saw the various structures in his office, I was really intrigued because the animals and flowers, yeah, they were all right, but they didn't interest me as much. But when I saw the structure, But when I saw the structural and the mathematical and the geometry, symmetry of these, I got really interested. So I started out by folding existing designs and then I started my own designs as well. And at this same time, I wanted to practice some HTML. So I wrote a website, not really like for the origami itself, but like for an exercise for writing HTML. For writing HTML. But that's how my website started in 1997, and it's still there. And people keep referring to it because I have kept adding content all through the years. Actually, you can, if you go to this link tree, link tr.ee slash origami m with ee because that's from my name minakshi. Because that's from my name, Minakshi. You'll find all my social media, you'll find my website, you'll find a lot of resources. And if you follow me, that'll be wonderful on Instagram. So yeah, so after that, Origami USA invited me. They wanted to give me an award for just sharing my work on the web. So they called me to give me an award, and that was my. To give me an award, and that was my first origami convention, really. So, and over there, I was so thrilled to see that there could be so many origami enthusiasts under one the same roof, one big banquet hall full of people. So, a lot of them told me, Oh, your designs, I've seen your designs on the web, they're beautiful, you should write a book. So, that started me out on, you know. out on writing books. And I have seven working on my eighth. My first book came out in 2007. So I have like seven books in whatever many years now. Yeah. And it's very therapeutic and relaxing for me. That's one of the reasons I do it. For beginners, what do you suggest? So for beginners that they want to do this, where is the best place? Where is the best place? You know, just starting with one of these books? My books are not exactly beginner books, but you know, I have seen a lot of like very gifted people being able to do from there, even if they are beginners. So it really depends on the person. But there's so much material on the internet these days. You can just, you know, learn. You know, learn from there. And then, of course, I'll recommend my books too, but I wouldn't say they are for beginners, I'd say they are intermediate. So these Sonobe units can have different kinds of patterns on them. And they're all called, you know, people give different names like Sonobe variation number so and so, or they give a fancy name. But I have a whole big collection in my first book. First book, which is the marvelous modular origami. And whatever, later on, whatever resources I point you to are all in this book, like construction help, coloring help. And this was done by CRC Press. At that time, they were something else, but now they are CRC Press. And CRC Press has done four books with me, actually, one after the other. And then I also have three books which I sell. I also have three books which I self-published because I just thought the royalty structure wasn't very fair to authors. So I tried the other route as well. But CRC is always inviting me to write another book with them. But I can't convince them to give me more royalty than they already do. Yeah. So should I? No, there you go. I'm sorry. Go on. I'm sorry, go on. I am getting my fourth one. Oh, good progress after joining. But I have to say that I opened the first one to find the crease patterns and then I missed, I can't close it. But let me finish my fourth one. Yes, absolutely. And actually, what is the math behind this? Could you say a little bit about the math behind this? The math behind this is. The math behind this itself is not too much, but there's a math behind the constructions you make, like which part of the unit aligns with which part of the polyhedron. And if you have that concept in your head, any polyhedral construction will get easy. So these are called edge units, means it lies. Edge units means it'll lie along the edge of a polyhedron, whichever, let's say, you're constructing an octahedron. Then, you know, there's a certain part of the unit, although you're locking things and there are patterns on top, but there's a part of the unit that will align with the edge of a polyhedron. And if you can remember that, the constructions become easy. But you have to have a chart of the construction in front of you. Have a chart of the construction in front of you. Like, for instance, an icosahedron, it has five units meeting at a point at every vertex and is made up of triangular faces. So, those you need to have a chart in front of you, or you need to know the construction already. And keeping that in mind, you can construct the polyhedron with this one. But within itself, there's not real much math, actually. I mean, you can play with yourself. I mean, you can play with yourself and, you know, give like middle school geometry tribe problems. Like, okay, if I start with a six-inch or 15-centimeter paper, what's the size of, what's going to be the size of the cube, you know, without measuring, just with your Euclidean geometry, prove that, find out the size of the final cube, or you can do, you can play around to get interest of middle school children. Interest of you know middle school children, or let's say what's going to be the volume of the cube or area of each surface, things like that. But there's no deep mathematics in it, actually. Oh, yeah. There is, you know, something I'm thinking about now is maybe in even under the geometric course, we can use this and ask students to calculate. To calculate Euler characteristics of some of these shapes and see what is the Euler characteristics of that shape. Or yes, there are some names attached to some of these. I have hard time to remember those names, but they are kind of connected, and we can visually then show this to the students. Yeah, as such with origami, you can illustrate a lot of things like construction of angles. You know, how do you get a 60-degree angle just by folding? Like 45 is easy. Like you just bring one edge to the other in a 90 degree corner and you have a 45 degree. But you can do many, many other things. How to, you know, we bisected our paper. That's very easy, right? We fold it in half. We fold it in half, but how do you trisect a paper? The math behind it. So there are other things like that, but it's not in this unit because I purposely selected something very easy because not everyone is a folder. So five platonic solids, for example, could be just we could make all these five platonic solids and show or calculate the Euler characteristic of all. The Euler characteristic of all of them. So, in topologically, they're the same. So, but we could just show this to students: the five platonic solids. Yeah, so that's one thing could be done. They're so beautiful. I mean, the way that we see one of your construction, they are so symmetric. Yes. And like for this particular unit, it's not the pure polyhedron. It's not the pure polyhedron itself, like I said, it'll be pyramidized faces. But there are other units with which you can fold the skeletal structure of the polyhedron itself. And those are, actually, those are more suitable for illustrating the shape of a polyhedron. They are called broadly categorized as truck units. As struct units, S-T-R-U-T, struct units. Excuse me, can you show? So I have six crease patterns ready, but I don't know how to close it again. Can you open it very fast and I can follow? How to fold the whole unit? Yeah, so I mean, I have the crease patterns ready exactly from the first one, but because I opened it now, I don't know. So the order was, I got the little edges back. Edges back, then I did the right and left. Then you do the 45 and then you close the door. That was it. Like, yeah, so I can go back a few steps. Yeah, it'll refresh your memory. And then after that, we have to start constructing in about five minutes. Okay. Because in the other class, I also did a three-unit very interesting construction with just three units. So I'd like to. Okay. So I'd like to allow some time for that. Sure. So let's see. Should I open up to this point? Yeah, but go very fast. I can just follow you. Yeah, so we are here now. So what we do now at this point is close the right door. Hold the 45 degree here, right here. Close the left door. Close the right door. Then we rotate 180 degrees. 180 degrees. This is just for convenience of folding because I'm right-handed. And then we fold a 45-degree here. And then we tuck. And then we tuck. Exactly. And then we go to the reverse side and fold these two. And that's our unit, really. So, should I get started with the construction itself? Yes, please. Please, because yes, please. Okay, all right. Zoria, are you also folding? I'm not because I have issues with using my hands. I have to find my own time. Yeah. But two of you are, and that's a good, you know, that gives the feel for a live video, what people would do in a live video, right? Nice. Yeah, I have four pieces. I have four pieces. Okay, yeah. I mean, you, if you can join those, you can join the other things will fall in place. So, um, I'm going to take three different colors because it's easier that way to show the construction. So, what I'm going to do is like, let's call them color one, two, and three. If you have three different colors, or unit A, B and C. Let's say units A, B and C. So, what we want to do is take hold unit A in your left hand. Unit A in your left hand and hold unit B on your right hand and then insert what I had illustrated as a tab into a pocket. So that is two units joined. And one key thing to remember for your construction is that so we'll have six units, which means we have Units which means we have 12 tabs and 12 pockets in all. So every tab and pocket should be used, otherwise, your construction will not be stable and will not look right. So every tab and pocket need to be used. There's often a tendency of tabs getting lost inside the cube. So always make sure the tabs are outside and not hidden inside. So that's two units joined. Then we take color C and C and put it inside color B. So, what we are trying to do, we are trying to join in a cyclic manner. So, we have B going into A, C going into B, and then you have to complete the cycle A going into C, and you have to flex it a little to get your one vertex of the cube. That is actually one vertex of the cube with three units joined. And just like any puzzle, you can pretty much see where the rest of the things will go. So, what I'd like to do is To do is opposite faces should be the same color in a three-color scheme. So this face is yellow, so I'd have a yellow here. So this unit will really go like that. So I put that here. And then we finish the next vertex. So remember that three units. So remember that three units make a vertex. So we're done with two vertices, and then we just have to put all six units together like this. So here I have brown. So over here, I'll have another brown. So I want to make sure I don't hide the tablet. I want to make sure I don't hide the tab like that, or rather go under the tab. That way I don't lose it. And then it's just like a cube coming together. With how many we make a cube? With six. Six. Six. Each one corresponds to a face of the cube. Basically, that's the way to think. The way to think. Then I'm done with five, and I will have a sixth one, which is going to be blue. So here really is my cube. Are all the pockets on the faces and all the sides that you put in the pockets, the sides? They're the tabs, yes. So they're the tabs. The tabs are those that go in the pocket, and the pockets are right on the face of the cube, right? Exactly. And then tabs usually. And then tabs usually eventually become a face, part of a face. Like once you tuck it in, it's part of a face of the cube. Yes. Of the of the neighbor, of the adjacent face. Okay, so I have, I only had four, so my cube is kind of shaky, but I think I got the yeah, just make sure you use all the tabs and pockets. That's your puzzle, basically. That's your puzzle. Basically, that's a puzzle for you. And yeah, and I think I since that how you say it? Human? Yes, Human. Yeah, since you joined late, I want to explain one more time what's the tab and what's the pocket, but you're already doing it. I mean, I'm there, but I'm putting the fifth one on. So I have some issues that I'm almost getting it. I got. Getting it. I see you getting it. Yeah. Yeah, but tell me what are those names. So, okay, I see what's happening. So there are parts that they actually go on top of each other. Yeah, it looks good. Yeah. I mean, the worst thing that happened was Camellia actually invited me here. And like two hours ago, she texted me. And I'm coming from an optometry with these dilators in my eyes. So I'm like, I can't even see. Oh, dilation in the eyes is not good for. But it means nice. But it was nice that I nice Camilla, by the way. Okay, I'm making the sixth one now. So although I'm more known for modular origami, geometric, I also have, I'd say, one and a half books worth of single sheet designs. And they also became very popular. And I have my favorite one here that I'd like to show. Favorite one here that I'd like to show it's the bird of paradise. Oh, the virtual background is the bird of paradise flower and the leaf. Oh, you're just showing it there. Let me just pin you. I can see. Oh, it's so, yeah, that's that flower. That's so these are also actually quite challenging to make. They have, so for Watita origami, each unit. For modular origami, each unit is very simple, but putting them together, people have trouble. But with single sheet, the model itself is not trivial. Like you have to be a little experienced to be able to make it. So this is one of my favorites. So I left it out here in the front so I could show you. So basically, just to explain a little bit, this is made from orange and blue paper. So just like So, just like I was using, you know, white and yellow, white and blue. So, this paper is orange and blue. And so, the orange forms the petals. And then the blue forms that thing. If you've seen a bird of paradise flower, there's something blue sticking out of it. So, it's the other side of the paper. It's one sheet, really. The orange and blue are the same sheet of paper. And then there's a separate one that forms the because. One that forms the because on one paper, you can have only two colors, you cannot have three. So there's the green sheet for making this part of the flower, but it's very, very close to a real flower. Now, if you haven't seen one, you can look it up later. No, no, I know that flower. I mean, I know it. So that's one of my favorites. I don't have anything else up here because it's not really my room. It's my son's room. It is the quietest one here. He's not home. Quietest one here, he's not home because my husband is working downstairs and he's very loud. So, I mean, actually, you showed us the queue use using this modular objects to create that. Can we see other things that could be made out of this modular? So, looks like I won't have, I was going to make a three-unit construction also. Yes. Yes, we are going actually a little slower than the original class, like the class I did. I think the second, whatever is captured in that recording, it has the second part. It has all of this. So I think you should keep both because I haven't been able to reach even. Yes, good. But I will quickly construct a three-unit thing called Toshi's Jewel. And it is really, you can call it a die pyramid. Really, you can call it a dipyramid or a hexahedron, whichever you want to call. So the idea is the same tab and pocket, but you have one extra crease going through here. It's the same unit, but you have an extra crease. And I believe the other video may have a proper slower version of what I'm doing. I kind of forgot where it got truncated. So, this is, if you look from this angle, it's really like two pyramids back to back, base to base, really. So, it's a die pyramid. So it's a dipyramid. Also, it has six heads, so you can call it a hexahuprin. That's one construction that's with three units. This is with six units. And then the others, I'll probably show you from my book if that's okay. I don't have them out here. I hope you've made a note of my link tree or let me take a picture. Let me take a picture. Oh, it's going to be a video, so I will have a video. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks interesting even without the white borders, with the solid balls. Yeah. The borders that you made are just a little bit. So what is the rule for the, I mean, those tiny strips that you have for each one of these units? So is it just one centimeter? Just you fall. Just one centimeter, just you fold. What was the rule for that? Oh, it was one sixteenth of the paper, one sixteenth of the paper. So, yeah, we kept folding half, quarter, one eighth, and one sixteenth. And that's just for the visual. It's only for the visual. So, if we don't do that one sixteenth, we can still close that unit, right? It's gonna you can still construct it. Okay, it's just aesthetics. Also, for newcomers, what happens is if you have the Comers, what happens is if you have that white border, then it's easy to say what the pocket is because this could also be a pocket, right? But that doesn't work. People get confused. So if the white border is there, then it's clear that it's the pocket. Interesting. Because even though you can go in there, that cannot be a pocket. I think I made some of those mistakes here. Like I went to wrong pockets. I mean, my cube is cube, but My cube is cube, but I still think that there are some places that I did not go to. Is it possible to close a gromp? I don't think so. Unless you've lost a tab somewhere. That's a different. I mean, it's completely closed, but I'm like thinking that. No, I think it's all right. So in the burst files, I gave you Uh, I gave you a document that looks like this, and it's also in my book that really shows you all the constructions you can make. And, you know, what are the additional the units are all the same. I don't kind of show because these are diagrammatic representations. They're, you know, they won't show the white pattern or anything, but it Pattern or anything, but it shows what creases, additional creases you need to make that particular construction, how many of them. So I have the three unit which I just illustrated, three units and these other folds. The cube we just made six units and these other folds. And then we have a large cube which you can make with 12 units. And in that case, what would happen is here I have a unit. Here I have a unit, and all you need to do is we don't need these two creases, but just this crease. And when you make your large cube, those will end up being the edges of the cube. And that is the key thing to remember when you construct. Then you don't get puzzled. So you do that. And I can quickly show one face of the cube, although if you're making a large cube. Making a large cube. Sorry, I have to rush because you're trying to fit it in. So, if you're making a large cube, then your face will look like this. Sorry, this colour. So it's kind of opening up because I added the unwanted creases that we don't need. That's why it's not staying put. But what happens is that becomes the edge of your large cube and this becomes a face. It's kind of coming apart. But that's the idea of the face of a large cube. And so, like that, I have. So, like that, I have you can make an octahedral assembly with 12 and the creases that you need for that, and then icosahedral. Then, we have something called the spike pentachistodecahedral assembly, which is a little bit complex. And then we also have a nine, six, that's 60 units, and then you also have a 90 unit. Wow. So, I think you should all try at least up to the 12 unit one because it's not that daunting at all. It's not that daunting at all. You don't have to finish folding in the same sitting. You can, you know, fold two units a day, put them in a jar, and then when you have 12, just try the construction. Interesting. And this book actually, this document, I think I also, yeah, I gave it to the burst files. It tells you how to, you know, like various constructions, the tab explaining the tab and the pocket. And here I have some pictures. And here I have some pictures of larger constructions, also, and with different patterns, really. It's not the same pattern now. So this is a cube octahedron, large cube, and this is a 90-unit totacahedral. And I should show you a 30-degree icosahedral. I should have some pictures. I should have some pictures somewhere. So this is a 30-unit icosahedral structure. But like I said, each face has a pyramid on it. It's not the pure icosahedron per se. So yeah, my first book is the easiest of all my books, I think, simply because it has this chapter on Sonobe units, which is a Nobi units, which is a very good learning starting point for modular origami, in my opinion. So, when you say units, the units are all the same, the same as the one that we make today. Except for some last finishing creases are different. Like up to the paragraph, making the parallelogram, it's the same, but then you add creases for the construction you want. Another useful Another useful document that I've uploaded to the BERS website is where is that? Color chart, meaning, oh, I think it's in my back matter. Oh, yeah. So color charts. So, how you can distribute, like, let's say for a 12-unit octahedron, you can have You can have three colors or four colors. So, how what the distribution of the colors would be so that it's homogeneous. So, I have these charts are also very popular. They are on my website and I also put them on the bird's website. So, please refer to them if you're even making larger constructions. Great. Yes. Thank you. So, those points. Yes, thank you. So those files are already on our website. Yes, they are. And they are from this book. Yes. So you made us so much interested to go and get the book and start these activities. So they look so interesting. I guess one of the things that is the math background or the mathematics that is related to this also is the colouring, the colouring. The coloring, the coloring. So, there is the geometry of coloring also. Yes, absolutely. So, the challenges you would give are like for here, I said all three colors have to meet at every vertex. See that? So, any vertex you look at has all three colors. And similarly, if you make larger constructions, working with those constraints is really fun, actually, I would say. Really fun, actually, I would say. Interesting. Thanks so much. Thank you so much. Is there a final question for Meenakshi? Because I guess. I have a question. So from my point of view, I'm interested in dissecting three-dimensional shapes, including polyhedrons. And I was wondering, it's always very difficult to visualize when you dissect a shape. When you dissect a shape. And those pieces that we get are not necessarily symmetric. So you can imagine drawing a diagonal, internal diagonal inside your polyhedra and then dissect one of the half into smaller triangles or smaller pyramids. Have you done a design or is it do you think it's feasible to have a design that dissects? Dissects a shape into the smaller pieces that are not necessarily symmetric and put them together and also like break them apart. Yeah, I'm sure, but those units will become quite challenging to make. Like that is a separate challenge in itself to be how to make those units. And I can recommend some books by his name is John. By his name is John Montreal. He has tons of books on origami polyhedra. You might find them interesting. He even has them from single sheet. At least I'm using six to make a cube. He has a polyhedra that he's made from a single sheet, a 3D. And about dissection and you know, like studying the inside, the only way I think that. The only way I think that might get interesting is if you partially open up one of your constructions and then take physical measurements inside, you know, or imagine the shape that's exposed. I think a lot of things can be done, especially at middle school and ninth grade level, to get interest of children, I think. Thank you. All right. Do you have any question? So much. It was really nice folding. And thanks for having me. Yeah, you're most welcome. And please do refer to the other video for the three-minute construction because I've worked on it much slower and explained it better. I was trying to get there, but I didn't want to open this one. No, no, not a good idea. Yeah. You can think of it as a puzzle or a challenge. It as a puzzle or a challenge, and you get it. I think I want to do the 91 as a meditation, as you said. I think that's going to be gonna start like going crazy. I'm sure that's gonna be a very challenging. Yeah, the sweet spot for modular origami is 30 units. Most structures look beautiful. They're based on an icosahedral structure. And that's the one very popular among origamis because that. Among origamis, because that gives you the most beautiful shape. It has like a five-point symmetry from each side, and yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. You're most welcome. And thank you for inviting me. Thanks for the invite.
