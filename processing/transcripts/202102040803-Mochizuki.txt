This topic several times, but this is the first chance for me to give a talk in the workshop for monopole. Let me explain again. So, it is always interesting to obtain an equivalence between objects in differential geometry and algebraic geometry. Actually, so it is usually very difficult to construct objects. To construct objects in differential geometry because we have to solve a very difficult non-linear partial differential equations. And it is much easier to construct algebraic objects. And in some cases, we can expect to classify algebraic objects and to describe the modular spaces explicitly in algebraic way. So this kind of equivalence is very useful for the understanding of objects in differential geometry. Differential charity. It is one reason to study this kind of equivalences. And conversely, this type of equivalence may imply the modular space of the algebraic objects have many interesting structures, such as hyperchair structures, which is also useful for the understanding of the algebraic objects. So it is another reason to study. And the main result of this talk is also concerned with such equivalences. Such equivalences. Very roughly, there exist equivalences between periodic monopoles and additive definitions modules, and equivalences between double-paired monopoles and multiplicative definitions modules, and triple-pair monopoles and elliptic definitions modules. Let me briefly remind you what these objects are. So, in this talk, a monopoly means just a vector band on an oriented three-dimensional Riemannian manifold equivalent with a Hamish symmetric and intellect connection and an anti-Hamichian endomorphism called Hipfield satisfying the Bogomorni equation. That is the curvature of the Is the curvature of the connection is equal to the hosistar of the derivative of the Higgs field with respect to the connection. And we are mainly interested in monopoles with some similarity on the quotient of the three-dimensional Euclidean space by a discrete subgroup. I mean, we obtain the three-dimensional manifold M gamma as the As the quotient of R3 by a discrete subgroup gamma, which is naturally a Riemannian monopole. And we are interested in monopoles on the complement of a finite subset of M gamma. And according to the rank of gamma, such monopole, such a molecule is called periodic or doubly period periodic or triple periodic. Periodic or triple periodic. And let me mention, as far as I know, the first systematic study of periodic molecules was studied by Professor Cherkis and Professor Capustin. Oh, sorry. So that that the Uh so wait wait moment show your attention to push the wait a moment Yeah, so Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, let's start again. So, let me explain objects on the side of algebraic geometry. So, let R denote a commutative ring of a complex number field, and let phi star denote an automorphism of the algebra, which it just means a C linear automorphism that is preserving the multiplications. Then, a defined module. The defined module over the pair of R and phi star is an R module V equipped with a C linear automorphism, 5 V star, such that 5 star F S equal the 5 star F times 5 star S for N F of R and S of V. And if R is a field of rational functions, Rational functions, it is equivalent to, it has the automorphism induced by the addition of some complex number to the variable y. So in this case, difference module is called additive difference module. And the rational function field also has the automorphism induced by the multiplication of a non-zero complex time by Q. The complex number 2 to the value of y. And in this case, a defined module is called a multiplicative defines module. And if R is a field of neuromorphic functions on an elliptic curve C, then R has the automorphism induced by the translation of the LT curve. So in this case, a defined module is called L-Tefi's module. Called ethical defiance motion. Then let me repeat the rough statement, which says there exists equivalences between periodic monopoles and additive defiance modules, and the equivalences between double periodic monopoles and multiplicative defiance modules, and the equivalences between triple periodic monopoles and electrical definitions modules. modules and more precisely we have to impose some asymptotic conditions to monopods and the defense modules should be enhanced by parabolic structures and stability conditions which we shall explain later and i hope this kind of equivalences will be useful for instance for the algebraic interpretation of the modular spaces or modular monopoles with pvc Monopoles with perilistic, and there are two important source origins of this study. One is the Noahian Holtz theory for how many boundaries on compact behavior surfaces due to Professor Hitching and Professor Norlson in the Lank II case and Professor Shinkson and Professor Corret in the general case. And I don't explain the detail here, but the equivalencies between monopoly The equivalences between monopoles and device modules are exactly analog of these correspondences for how many bands. And the other is the classification of monopoles by algebraic data, which we shall briefly recall in the next. And the most classical work in the classification of remote powers is due to a remote pulse is due to again due to professor hitching and professor dunelson which was already mentioned several times in this workshop roughly speaking they obtained an equivalence of a su2 molecules from r3 satisfying l2 condition and holomorphic maps from p1 to p1 namely according to professor he changed the null transform induces an equivalence to monopoles and solution of the null equation Solutions of the null equation or interval, and according to Professor Donaldson, the solutions of the null equation or interval are classified by all fit marks from P1 to P1. So they obtain G2 equivalence indirect way. And more direct approach was clarified by Professor Hartwith. And the result was generalized by Hutwis, Murray, and Javis to more general cases. They obtained an equivalent between G monopology for compact G group G and homohyde map from P1 to flag varieties. And the interest to monopoles was renewed by the work of Kaposti and Victen on the geometric quantum theory from a physics viewpoint. And I can't explain about anything, but anyway, so inspired by their work, Professor Noble established. Professor Nobley established any height modification can be represented by a singular molecule. He studied singular molecules on the product of the interval and compact Riemann surfaces, satisfying some boundary conditions. And he obtained equivalence of such singular molecules and homophic vector bounds on the Riemann surface with heck modifications. More recently, his work was generalized to the context of Higgs bundles with HEC modifications by he and Warkowski. And Sharbono and Hartwith studied singular molecules on the product of S1 and the compact Riemann surface. And they obtained an equivalence between such singular monopoles on S1 and Sigma and holomorphic vector bands on the Riemann size sigma. Banders on the Riemann statue sigma is a male automorphism and H modifications satisfying stability functions. And because our study is directly inspired by the work of Professor Sharpon and Professor Hatwith, let me remind you more details of their work. So we set S1 as the quotient of R by Z with a standard metric. Z with a standard metric, and let Sigma denote a compact Riemann surface equipped with a Kerala metric. Then we obtain the three-dimensional Riemannian manifold S1 times Sigma. And let D denote a finite subset of S1 times sigma. And for simplicity, the intersection of D and Z times Sigma is assumed to be empty. This is just for simplicity of explanation. Expansion and we consider monopole on S1 stand sigma minus Z and it is reasonable to assume each point of Z is disagrees singularity and singularity to the molecule. It means the restriction of the molecule to a neighborhood of any point of Z is close to a direct sum of just molecules. So now we would like to obtain a chromic object or algebraic object from monopole and we consider the differential operator number 01 sigma in the sigma direction, which is obtained from the interconnection by the natural decomposition of the complex potential bandwidth of S1 times sigma. times 0 and we also obtain the differential operator delta t in the epsilon direction defined as delta t minus 1 to minus 1 phi then the Bromon equation implies the competitivity of these two operators and this is one of the key ideas in the study of the relation of monopoles and holophilic data Data. Then, so we obtained the vector boundary E0 of sigma as obtained as a restriction of E to 0 times sigma. And it is equipped with the chronic structure induced by Nabrad 01 sigma. And more generally, for any T, we obtain the vector boundary E T on. E t on the on the with the home structure on the t times sigma minus z. And by the construction, E1 and E0 are naturally identified. And let me introduce some more notations. So let ET, this guy, denote. This guy denotes the shape of homomorphic sections of this homophobic vector band. And for a finite subset S of sigma, let E T star S denote the shape of Meromorphic sections of E T, which may have points along at worst S. We have a scattering map. I mean, so we take t1 and t2 between 0 and 1. And if t has no points between t1 times sigma and t2 times sigma, then we obtain the isomorphism of et1 and et2 by using the parallel transport with respect to delta. I mean, I mean and uh sorry, and the constructivity of uh delta and uh naga-degawan sigma implies this is more frequent is. implies this isomorphism is holomorphic so if there is no singularity then we obtain the holomorphic isomorphism of the boundaries on whole dimensions of sigma and if this has a point in t0 times sigma for t0 between t1 and t2 and there is no other point of z between t1 between T1 times sigma and T2 times sigma, then we obtain the holomorphic isomorphism of ET1 and ET2 as side of dt0. So this is a holomorphic vector boundary given a homomorphic isomorphism given omecil minus dt0. So sorry dt0 means the intersection of z and t zero times c and but so And but so now, so because we are we assume each point of C is a jack type of singularity of the monopole, so this isomorphism is melomorphic at each point of d tz. So we obtain the isomorphism of the sequence of melomorphic sections of e t1 and et2 and it means Honestly, it appears at each point of DT0. I mean, the stock of the C4 merwick sections at Q for at T1 and T2 are identified with this isomorphism. And so we identify these spaces. And there are two lattices obtained as a lattice the stoke of VT1 at Q and V T Q at Q. Q and each Q at Q. So, in this sense, the Heke modification appears at each point of Tz D Tz. So, anyway, from a monopoly with disactive seniority, we obtain a form of textile boundary E by setting E0 and E call E0, and we also obtain an automorphism of E star D. D, which is induced by the parallel transport and the natural identifications of event each. And we also have the sequence of real numbers for each point of, so and these the image of z by the projection to ziggle. And for each point of d, we obtain a sequence of real numbers, which is obtained as the intersection of real numbers. Obtained as the intersection of T and S1 times Q. And we also have that C is LQI of the stock of E study active. I mean, we define LQ0 and LQMQ as the stock of E at Q. And for other I, we choose T between TQI and TQ. Between TQI and TQI plus 1. And we set LQI as the stoke of ET at Q, which is the rattle of ET star D at Q, but the stock of ET star D at Q, but it is identified with E0 star D at Q by the parallel transport. So we can regard LQI as the lattice of E star D2. So, anyway, in this way, we obtain algebraic objects consist of all vector boundary and meromorphic automorphism and sequence of real numbers and vertices. And we can also add the stability constant defined for such algebraic objects. So, suppose we are given such algebraic object, which is not necessarily induced by a monopole. Necessarily induced by a monopole and for any sub-bundle, non-zero sub-bundle, which is preserved by the actual F, then we obtain that this is L prime QI or the stock of E prime study at Q by setting by taking the intersection of LQI and E prime study Q. Then, so we obtain the sequence of vertices for this E'. Then we define the degree of E prime with respect to F and T Qi and L Qi as the sum of the degree of E prime and the relative degree of these vertices multiplied by 1 minus TQI. Here, the relative degree is just the difference of T. To the difference of the dimensions of these finite-dimensional textile spaces over C. So, anyway, we can define the degree for this algebraic object, for this type kind of algebraic object. Then, by using this degree, the stability constant is defined for the algebraic object. I mean, for simplicity, we consider the case, the degree of E. the degree of E with respect to F1, G2, and L2I is zero. And in this case, this guy is called stable if degree of any non-zero subvando for any non-zero south bundle such as that which is preserved by f the degree of e prime is negative if this contains satisfied this If this contains satisfied, this guy is called stable. Sorry, we should remove the equal cell. Sorry. And it is called polystable if it is a direct sum of stable objects of degree cell. Then the Charlbonno and Karl Katwis says if such an algebraic datum is induced by a monocode with just type singularity. A monopole with just like singularity, then it is a polystable of degree zero, and this induces an equivalence of the monopoles and the algebraic objects. And for the explanation of our study, let me give you an obvious remark. So, these algebraic objects are clearly formulated in terms of difference modules. I mean, let k sigma denote the field of numeric functions. denotes the field of melomorphic functions on sigma and that v denote melomorphic sections of E on sigma and of course this is a finite dimensional K sigma vector space with a with a K sigma linear automorphism F and we can regard the pair of B F as a defined module over the algebra K sigma with the identity mark and the And the top of the vector bundle and sequence of real numbers and vertices is regarded as a parallel structure of BF. So anyway, so we'd like to explain this kind of equivalence for periodic monopole. And for simplicity, first let me explain the case which is most similar to the theorem of Professor Sharwuna and Professor Hartwith. Sharwuno and Professor Hartwith. And later, I'd like to add some explanation for the other cases. So we consider the case gamma is and let Z be a finite subset of M gamma. And we consider a monopole on M gamma minus Z. And as before, And as before, we assume each point of Z is the actual singularity of the monopole. And we also assume a symmetric condition around infinity, which says the norm of the Higgs field is dominated by the log of the distance from a base point. And the curvature decays to zero around infinity. At the infinity, and if these conditions are satisfied, such a model is called of GCK type. Let me remark, this weak assumption around B infinity implies much stronger condition. I mean, a monopole of GCK is well approximated by an easy monopole around B infinity, which I will explain later. And so we assume gamma is generated by one zero in R times C and an isometry of R3 and R times C. And we obtain, then we obtain an isometry of M gamma and S1, the product of S1 and C, as a Riemannian manifold. And first, And first, we shall explain what kind of algebraic objects appear from the description of M gamma as a product of S1 and C. And for simplicity, we assume again the intersection of Z and 0 times C is assumed to be empty. And let me evapor again: there are many other isometries of R C and R times C for which gamma is not contained in Rc. For which gamma is not contained in R times 0. I'm sorry, 0 times R times C. Sorry, this should be R times 0, sorry. And from a different isometry, we obtain a different equivalence, which we shall explain later. And as in the case of the cell of Sharwood and Hartbee, we consider differential operators WT and Devi T and D V W bar. This is a differential paradigm in the direction of S1, and this is a differential paradigm in the direction of C. And we obtain config vector boundaries E t on T times C minus Z and we set E as E0, which is equal to E1. So you can affirm your vector boundaries, affordable vector boundaries. Delta bounds. And let D denote the image of Z by the projection to C. And then, as before, completely in the same way, we obtain the automorphism of E star D. And we also obtain sequence of real numbers and vertices for each point of D in the completely same way. So, we obtain something similar, but it is given on C. So, this is very transcendental object on C. So, we would like to extend this to an algebraic object on P1 by using the metric H. So, it is one of the main issues to clarify in our study. And a key result is acceptability. The key result is acceptability. We can prove the Holocaust vector boundary Et with the induced Hungarian metric Ht is acceptable, which means the norm of the curvature of the chunk connection of this Holy Factor boundary with the Hangi metric is dominated by the Point army around infinity. So, by this theorem, we can apply the general theory. Can apply the general theory to extend an acceptable value to the filtered band across the infinity, which was pioneered by Kohler band Biff and developed by Simpson in his study of time harmonic bands on curves. Let me briefly explain such extension. So, for any real number A, we would like to construct PAE on P1 as the extent. E on P1 as extension of E T on C. So for any neighborhood U of P1, U of infinity at P1, we define PA ETU as the space of colon fixed sections of ET on u minus infinity such as that the norm of the section is dominated by a perception square of the A perception square of the absolute value of W for any expression by considering this kind of spaces, we obtain the shift PAET on P1. And this gives us an increasing sequence of shifts with respect to A. And the union of P A E T is denoted by P P E T. P P E T the union is generated by P E T and according to Coinalba and Griffiths and Shimpson, so this is because ETHT is acceptable, a PAET, a locally free O module, OP1 module around the EPIT. And PET is a locally free OP1 star infinity module. So, in this sense, we obtain a filtered bundle as the extension of acceptable bundles. And for this Meromorphic extension, it is easy to show F the automorphism F induces an automorphism of this Meromorphic shift, this P zero study. So, we obtain algebraic data from a model of GCK type. We set CW vector space B as the space of global sections of P0 on P1 tensored by CW. So, this is the space of Meromorphic sections of P0 on P1. And it is a And it is equivalent with the CW linear automorphism. And we can regard the pair of BUI as a difference module on CW with the identity map. And this is equipped with parabolic structure which consists of filtered boundary from P1 infinity obtained as filter easel and a sequence of real numbers and vertices. So we obtain some algebraic data. Obtain some algebraic data. Here, let me remark: we have to be careful about the compatibility condition of the automorphism F and the filtration P style. The context is very natural, and perhaps it might look rather complicated, but I think it is important. So, let me explain it in this product case. Let me explain the compact. Let me explain the compatibility constraint in this product case. So let P e infinity denote the stock of P e at infinity. So it is a finite dimensional vector space over the field of convergent Roland powers of W inverse. So and the vector space P infinity is equipped with the linear With the linear automorphism induced by F. And let SPF denote the eigenvalue, the set of eigenvalues of F. And so first, let me explain the case all the eigenvalues of f is contained in this field. I mean, we don't need any ramifications. Then there exists the general. Then there exists the generalized eigen decomposition of this vector space, and each we can express each eigenvalue as the series of this form in this way by using integer omega alpha and non-zero constant beta alpha and constant gamma j alpha. And we consider the equivalent relation of the equivalent relation on the set of eigenvalues by compare comp by the comparison of alpha omega alpha and beta beta alpha and for each equivalence class we that these numbers are well defined and we also obtain the space attached to equivalence class by gathering the generalized eigen spaces so we obtain So we obtain the decomposition indexed by the equivalence class of equivalence classes. Then compatibility condition is given in this in this case. In this case, the compatibility condition is given in this way. I mean, P A infinity is the direct sum of the intersection of P A infinity and E alpha for any A and on. And on each direct summand, this condition is satisfied. So, this is a compact condition in the unranked case. And the general case is a little more complicated, but essentially the same. So, as well, there exists a positive integer L such that all the eigenvalues of F is contained in. Use of f is contained in the CW minus one over L. And so this is S extension of the CW inverse. And so we obtained the vector space P L E infinity over this field as an extension induced by P infinity, and we have the generalized eigen decomposition of this space. And again, each eigenvalue is. Again, each eigenvalue is expressed as a series by using rational number omega alpha and dental constant beta alpha and constant gamma j over L alpha. Sorry, may I ask a question? Yeah, yeah. Could you give some intuitive meaning of this L? So we need to extension. So we need to algebraic extension of the field. Algebraic extension of the field, and in the case of CW inverse, any algebraic extension is defined in this way. I mean, we just consider the L root of W inverse. Does it have any meaning in terms of the monopole? For monopoles, yeah, so these numbers describe some similarity of monopoles. So, in that sense, Ergo has some meaning for monopoles. But at this But at this stage, it is just algebraic, uh, just algebraic configuration. So, so, anyway, so we obtained, we define the equivalence relation on the set of eigenvalues by composition of omega alpha and beta alpha and gamma j over alpha for j smaller than m. And for each equivalence class, we define these numbers and we obtain the base. We obtain the vectors, the space attached to the equivalence classes by getting again generating spaces, and we obtain the decomposition as before. And for this space is equipped with naturally induced filtrations. And compatibility constant is again, as in the case of under-file case. I mean, the filtration of this filtration is compatible with the decomposition. Group is a decomposition indexed by previous classes, and on each stage summoned, this function is satisfied. And I'm afraid that maybe the compatibility function might look rather complicated at first glance, but this type of compatibility function is very natural and standard in the study of wide harmonic boundaries. And because it is rather strong constraint, it should be also useful. To it should be also useful for the classification of monopoles. I hope. I think so. So, then, anyway, we can define the degree and the stability condition of this type of algebraic coefficients. So, let V prime the C W sub space, which is preserved by F. Then we obtain OP1 star FD submotions of P E, which is determined by the which is determined by the condition the space of global section of P prime is equal to the intersection of P prime and the space of global section of P and P y. And as before, we obtain a sequence of vertices by taking the intersection of P E prime star VQ at L Q R. And we also obtain the filtration at P infinity and the decomposition by just taking intersections. intersections. Then we define the degree of V prime with respect to this parabolic structure as the sum of the degree of P0E prime and the contribution from the filtration P infinity and the contribution from the lattices, which is the same as in the case of the theorem of a shallow and hot beast and the contribution from this decomposition. This decomposition or the slope of defined operators. So, in this way, we can define the degree of sub-objects. And once we define the degree, then we can define stability conditions and polystability conditions by using in the standard way. So, we can define the stability and the polystability for a different module with a caloric structure by using this degree in the standard way. Right in this degree in a standard way. Then we can prove the following theorem. If a defined module of a CW with identity equipped with parabolic structure is induced by a singular monopole of GCK type, then the compatibility function is satisfied and it is polystable of the reason. And this correspondence induces a And this correspondence induces an equivalence of objects. I mean, singular monopole, equivalence between singular monopoles on M grammar of GCK type and different modules with parallel structure satisfying compatibility and possibility and degrees of constant. So this is the equivalence for page controls and defines modules in another in the product case. Case. So, and it is easy to construct examples of defined small shoes. And in some cases, we can classify parabolic structure satisfying compatibility degree zero and the polarisality conditions on the defined modules. And so it gives a parameterization of some class or some family or monopoles. Let me show some examples. Let me show some examples. So we take a finite set of complex numbers and we take a map from S to positive integers. And for simplicity, we assume there exists an element of S such that A0 is odd. And then, and we obtain the polynomial py in this way. In this way, and we consider a two-dimensional shear vector space with base E1 and E2. And we consider the linear automorphism phi-star B defined given in this way. And let PE be the locally free OP1 star infinity module induced by this free module. And we take any any for we take any numbers between zero and one for s which they give a finite subset of s1 times c then and we can classify monopoles on s1 times c minus z and we can induce the top level this brie and phi star brief and p e Pe. I mean, if the degree of P is even, then monopoles of GCK type on S1 times C minus Z inducing this tuple are naturally parameterized by real rhyme. And if the view of P is odd, then there uniquely exists a monopole of GCK type or sometimes C minus D, which induces beyond the fibrostan P. With standard P. Let me explain how to discuss it. So, in this case, if she write subspace V prime of V is preserved by the actual fiber star, then V prime is V or zero. I mean, there is no non-trivial subspace which is preserved by fiber star. So, the stability constant is. So, the stability constant is trivially satisfied for any choice of public structures. So, in this case, it's enough to classify filtered bundles P star E over P E satisfy the compatibility condition and the degree zero conditions. And actually, it is a very easy algebraic problem. If the degree of p is even, then the eigenvalue of phi star under phi star undying phi at infinity. So the compatibility constant implies this filtered bundle is decomposed into a diagram of filtered bundles of rank one. And the filtrations on the rank one is if we choose appropriate frame of direct summons E alpha one V alpha two then these filtrations these filtrations are determined by numbers just real numbers by numbers just real numbers so a p star infinity is determined by a pair of real numbers g1 g2 and the degree zero condition implies uh this this is zero sorry we need this is zero so which so in this way we obtain a parameterization some function of morphos by a real right and it's a degree of And if the degree of p is odd, then the eigenvalue of phi will start to infinity is ramified. So the compatibility constant implies this extension is, this filtered bundle is decomposed into the type sum of filtered bundles on the extensions. And then by the Garo action, the Garo action exchanges these two filtered bundles. Filtered bundles. So the filtered, so this filtered bundle is determined by one number D. And by the degree zero position, by the degree zero position, actually this number D is uniquely determined. So in this way, we can show that the multiple of this type is uniquely determined. So let me mention another example. Let QI Let Qi be a polynomial and we call the same two-dimensional vector space with E1 E2. And we define the automorphism by this formula. And let P denotes the same OP1 strain thinking module induced by this free module. Then, in this case, monopoles of GCK type or S1 type, non-singular monopoly. non-singular models of GCK type only C inducing GUI and Phi stand PE are naturally parameterized by a real rank. This can be shown by the same method. So we explain the case where gamma is contained in R times zero and under the isomorphism of R3 and R times C. Of Rc and R times C. But there are many other, there are many isometries of Rc and R times C paraphrased by P1. And in most cases, gamma is not contained in R times 0. So we'd like to ask what we could obtain in other cases. And it is natural to expect to obtain additive defines module. And the natural expectation is correct, but let me explain some remarks. Explain some remarks. Could you remind me what gamma is, please? Gamma is lattice of R3 of rank one. So gamma is isomorphic to Z integer group. And so, yeah, okay. So we take let lambda be any complex number, then we introduce a code. Then we introduce a coordinate system T0 beta 0 by this formula. I mean, T0 is a real value function and beta 0 is a complex value function and given in this way. And by this coordinate, by T0 and beta 0, so this indices another isometry of R3 with R times C. With alpha c, and for this coordinate system t 0 and beta 0, gamma is described in this way. And again, we consider the differential beta del E T 0 and deli beta 0 bound. Then they are commutative. And we obtain the holomorphic vector boundaries as a resection of E to T 0 times C beta 0 minus Z. And there exist Meromorphic isomorphism. And there exist menomorphic isomorphisms. And the same story compared. But if lambda, the isomorphism value of lambda is not one, then we set T lambda in this way. And then we obtain the metamorphic isomorphism of the restriction of E to 0 times C beta 0 and the restriction of E to T down the times C beta 0. And for you all. And for the automorphism, phi zero defined by the translation by two ram two ram root minus one rambler divided by one plus rambler square, we have the natural identification of the pullback of this boundary by phi zero and the restriction v to zero times c. So we have this kind of structure if the for this coordinate system if the absolute value lambda is not one. Lambda is not one, and it is natural to expect to obtain different modules by using these isomorphisms, and something maybe it could be done in some cases, but in general, it doesn't work well. One reason is obviously if lambda, the absolute value of lambda equals one, then we cannot obtain a different module by this method. And but more essentially for me, in general, Essentially for me, in general, the restriction of this this home of vector band with the metric A in this metric is not acceptable. So it's not clear how to extend this hormonal vector band to a Meromyph project on T1. So we introduce another coordinate system, T1 beta one, given in this way. This way. And it is more convenient to obtain defined operate defines modules. For instance, gamma is described in this way. So the actual gamma in the t1 direction is always non-trivial. But let me remark: R T1 times 0 and 0 times C beta 1 are not also. times C delta one are not also gonna if lambda is not zero so so this is this kind of coordinate system is not as far as I know this kind of coordinate system is not so tradition not not not so standard in the study of the gauge of monopoles and the holomic cog sheets and so we have to be careful about the construction of the two commuting operators but but it is actually it is easy but maybe important we can still obtain We can still obtain two commuting differential operators from this coordinate system. The vector fields del t1 and del beta1 bar are dated with del t0 and del beta 0 bar in this form. So we define the differential operators acting on e by this formula. Then we can easily check w e t1 and w beta number are commutative and And another important point is the holomorphic bundle obtained as a restriction of E to T1 times C beta1 with the metric, with the induced metric is acceptable. We can show this claim. So in particular, this extends to a filtered boundary on P1 infinity. So then once we obtain this. So, then once we obtain this extension, then it's easy to prove the isomorphism induced by derivative induces isomorphism of this extended shape. And for the automorphism, phi 1 defined by the translation by Turtoma and Lambda, induced for for for this automorphism, the pullback of P star E1 is equal to P star E0. is equal to p sine zero. So by this way we can obtain the algebraic objects. I mean we define V as the aspect of the meromorphic section of P0 and these two isomorphisms induce a single automorphism of V, which and the weak end. And B with five star is a different module of C beta five and star. And the seniority at Z and the filtered band Z and the filtered bundle P star E0 determining a parallel equal of this defined module. And again, we have to be careful about the compatibility function of this defined operator, 5-way star, and filtration piece. And in this case, we cannot apply the linear algebraic argument in the product case, but by using the general classification results of formal difference modules due to Or formal defined modules due to two rifting, we can define the compatibility constant similarly. Then, the degree and the stability constant are defined similarly, and we can obtain equivalence between singular molecules of GCK type and additive difference modules of a C beta1 with five and stars equipped with public structure satisfying the compatibility condition and the DV0 condition and the possibility conditions. Possibility conditions. So, this is the equivalence of defined module and the periodic monopole in the rank one case. And I'll have to explain briefly the asymptotic behavior of periodic monopoles of the GCK type, which is a foundational in this study. So, let UR denotes the complement of the disk of larger star in C. And we consider monopole or S1 times UL, satisfy the GCK condition. And for any positive integer L, there exists a covering map of S1 times UL by taking by considering the L soots of W. Then we can show for appropriate quadratic U integer L, the pullback to the covering space is approximated by some easy monopoles. Easy monopoles. And let me briefly explain what is this easy monopoles. So by the polarity composition of W, we obtain the isometry of S1 times C minus 0 and S1 2π times S1 times R the half-line is this metric. And a line bundle on, so there is this aligned bundle. So there is this Rhymband or Adrian on S12 patterns on this torus with whose first single pattern is N, and it has a Harmonich and user connection whose cover is constant. And by taking the pullback of this LAN and HLA and to the products of the torus and half line, we obtain some extra band with metric and connection. And we define the Higgs field by We can find the Higgs field by the multiplication of this function. Then we can easily check this is a monopole satisfying GCK function at T infinity. And we can explicitly compute everything, every indicator for this guy. And we have similar constructions that are covering space. And as a other example of monopoles are induced by how many cubes, I mean, Bands. I mean, the notion of a Hammer band was discovered by Professor Hitting as a two-dimensional reduction of instant tons. And he also found monopole as a one-dimensional reduction of instantons. So Hamilton boundary is one-dimensional reduction of monopoles. So which means if we are given a Hamilton boundary on UR, it induces a monopole on S1 times UR. And we can easily check how We can easily check, you can easily obtain a condition when the induced monopole satisfies the desired asymptotic conditions. And we have similar conditions on the covering space. And then, as I mentioned, on the covering space, we have well approximation of monopoles that is the GCK conditions. And as a collary of this approximation, we can obtain the estimate. And we can obtain the estimate for curvatures, which is important in the construction of algebraic objects, as I mentioned. And finally, let me mention equivalences in the double periodic case and triple periodic case. So in the double periodic case, the construction are much more complicated. Let me explain only a brief statement. Brief statement. We consider the case gamma is contained in zero times C in R times C. And so we are considering W periodic case to the rank of gamma 2. And we take any complex number lambda and we take a generator of gamma such that lambda is not equal to this number and the imaginary part of mu 2 over mu 1 is positive. And we define q rams. We define q lambda as this non-true complex number. Then there exists an equivalence between monopoles on m gamma with finite reactive singularity satisfying accepted constant infinity and multiplicative defined small choice with public structure satisfying compatibility function, positivity function, and the reserve function. And the action is given by the multiplication of Q ramp. So we have this kind of equivalences in the double periodic case for each choice of lambda and mu1 mu2. And the triple periodic case is the easiest. So let gamma be ratis of R times C. And we take a generator of gamma, which is described as a pair of A and alpha, and satisfactory the frame even. The frame E1 into E3 is compatible with orientation and alpha 1 and alpha 2 generates a lattice that is over shi, sorry. And the imaginary part of alpha 2 over alpha 1 is positive. Then we obtain the electric curve as a quotient of C by the action of the radius generated by alpha 1, alpha 2. Then there exists an equivalence in monopoles of The monopoles of M gamma with finite black type similarities and electric difference modules of this elliptic curve with parvic structure and satisfying four stability functions and degree zero functions. And the action, in this case, the action induced by the translation by alpha three, this alpha three. And this is essentially due to sharp and hot pieces, and also obtained by constellation. So Construction so it's and there is a generalization to the twisted case, but I don't explain the details here. So, sorry, so I stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Could I ask you about your boundary condition? Condition? Yeah, which about the condition? The boundary condition for the periodic monopole. The question is: Is your condition equivalent to the condition in the paper of Cherkis and Kapuzdin, or do you not know? So the periodic case being we assume just we inter we assume just uh the norm of Higgs field is dominated by uh dominated by uh the logistic between of the distance from this point and the curvature decays to zero and maybe this is stronger than the previous works I mean in the previous works of periodic monopoles usually it is assumed It is assumed that it is, for instance, in the pioneering work of Professor Chetkis, he assumed it is a direct sum of rank one monopoles at infinities. And in case there is some ramifications, so this constant is weaker than, for instance, weaker than the assumption Professor Chex imposed. Okay, uh-huh. Okay, that's very, very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jian. You had a question? I have a comment. So if you don't mind, I mean, it's a short one. Because, I mean, how this relation between difference equations and monopoles can be kind of realized geometrically. Realize geometrically. So, the underlying geometry in both cases is a three-dimensional real affine manifold, which means the manifold with affine structure and one-dimensional affine fallation with a transversal complex structure. So, then, depending on what your global transversal complex curve is, C C star of the ellipse. This C C star of the elliptic curve, the Poincare return map gives you the shift. So, and this is first command and the second, how this geometry appears in kind of in nature. You look for a complex symplectic surface and you consider its partial compactification with divisors where Where the symplectic form has poles of order one. It's kind of log compactification. So then again, there are three possibilities, rational when the divisor is C, trigonometric when it's C star, and the elliptic when it's elliptic curve. So then you make a real blow-up of this complex symplectic surface, which is Surface which is a real four-dimensional thing in this divisor. And you take, so you get a three-dimensional manifold with a fine structure because the divisor had it, and with a one-dimensional fallation, which comes from this real blow-up, it's a circle, it's S1 vibration. So, and then. So, and then these monopoles, they can be related to kind of floor theoretical objects, to objects of the Foucault category of this four-dimensional manifold. So, this explains why periodic monopoles appears as harmonic objects in the analog of non-abelian-Hodge theory, which Takura mentioned in the beginning. So, I mean, it's a it's So, I mean, it's kind of a more geometric, maybe less formal story, which we developed a few years ago with Maxime, but of course, did not bother to publish. But it somehow geometrically clarifies the relation between two things, monopoles and difference equations and periodic case. Okay, so that's a command. Thank you. Thank you. But for me, the other reason, I mean, just so Hamilton is just the different dimensional reduction of instant tons. And so we have some equivalencies of Hamilton Bandons and algebraic objects. We can translate it into some equivalences for equivalent instantons and algebraic objects. And as an analog of So we can consider such kind of equivalences for one-dimensional reductions, then we obtain, we can, we should obtain some equivalencies for monopoles. So for my, my, my reason is more cheaper ones. So, but thank you very much for your comment. Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions or comments? Comments? Well, there's a wish now that you understand this as corresponding either additive or multiplicative module in each complex structure, the natural question is how are they glued together? In other words, given a monopole, you have a section of this over P1. Of course, there was difficulty that you had to exclude. There was difficulty that you had to exclude the equator in case of periodic monopoles. But this equator likely was described just two days ago by corresponding Zastavas over C star. No, I don't think we don't have to remove equators in my correspondence. So as I explained, I tried to explain. So in the case, if we consider If we consider naive coordinate system t0 beta zero, then we need to exclude the case absolute ramp cycle one. But if we consider use this beta coordinate system, then we obtain the isomorphism equivalence for any complex number rambled. So we have the covering of p1 by two she and the only so. and only so we so it's better so i'd like to we'd like to have some uh equivalent some gruing for the intersection of two she so maybe i hope it is it should be done by using a kind of riemann hubbard correspondence for defense modules but i don't know precisely about the diemann hebbed correspondence in the context of uh difference modules and another and another point is And another point is structurally so we obtain equivalence for each fixed complex numbers, but I have not yet obtained the equivalence for family of holonic families. Yeah, that's exactly the question. And actually, even in the case of varioharmic bundles, we cannot obtain such holonic equivalence if we just consider the extension of ac acceptable bundles to filtered bundles. Band to filtered bands by using the metric. I mean, we need to the deformation of spokes structures. And exactly the same procedure, we need exactly the same procedure in the case of the periodic monopoles and defined modules. And so, and the theory has not, maybe it can be done, but the theory has not yet been well established. So, it is also. Established. So, it is also the problem. Yeah, you mentioned. So, yeah, yeah. So, thank you very much for asking about it. Thank you. Okay. So, as we're a bit behind, maybe I'll leave further questions for discussion. And let's reconvene, give ourselves a five-minute stretch, and we can reconvene therefore in five minutes for the next. Therefore, in five minutes for the next talk, which is Laura Frank.
