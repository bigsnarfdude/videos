Chris, thank you for the invitation for the conference. So now I can see that there's a speaker taking my stand. So yesterday we heard Ivan and Don talking about the actual constraint models where we have functional models that appear and disappear. That appear and disappear in conservative strength. And in this talk, I want to talk about conservative articles. So we will still have this type of strain, but these type articles will not appear and disappear, rather jump from one side to the other. So the general setting is It's uh it's a serious uh it's kind of the humanities of the spy max texts. And I will also assume exclusion, which means that you silent. And in this talk, people always think it's it too. Everything I say is really true. So the site is either empty or occupied. And I'm using the classy physics convention. So empty is one divider. empty is what the viral code infected and it will be marked by zero or empty and occupy is one t called one t called healthy which would be one or two that would be a bit confusing but I can't get confusing okay so uh particle jump Yeah, okay, so particle jumps to two nearest neighbors to an empty nearest neighbor as exclusion but okay, if you have a job if there is a constraint, ah, why does. I have to say here that instead of talking about functions that jump, I could talk about edges exchanging their occupation. Equivalently, the occupation and the endpoints of an edge are exchanged. I know all of you have seen this title but this is just saying that I have an HP and I have a particle here and the latency there, then making the particle junk is the same thing as replacing the one with zero. The one and zero, and if both sides are the same, then I could exchange them for free and make changes. Okay, so I have these exchanges on the edges, and the exactly the exchange is legal if a certain constraint is satisfied. So exchange is legal assertive input strange. If a certain constraint, which I'll call C is the edge, equals one. So that the constraint is satisfied. And my C is always zero or one, either satisfied or not. I guess you could have some variation like in gas stock of C, which also equal to. So C is zero or one. And an important thing is that C is. And an important thing is that CE will only depend on configuration outside the engine. So when I decide whether an exchange is legal or not, I'm only looking at the sites. I'm only looking at the sites, which are not the endpoints. Points of you and okay, usually talk about finite reinerages, and they also want CE to be decreasing in the configuration. And this is this somehow comes from the original motivation Christine introduced in the beginning: that we learn about classes and we say that gases are very dense, molecules can't move too much. Can't move too much, which means that the okay, so this is why I introduced the constraint. And if the neighborhood is not as dense, so I have more vectors around, it will only help molecules to move. So more zeros help moving. So in this interpretation, you exchange the role of articles and direct data in C-scope. Yes. Yes okay sorry so actually say that in the other interpretation they're also somehow if we're thinking about addresses this is the more natural choice of notation so isn't a legal exchange it occurs with rate one Yeah, otherwise, okay, let's change this to Kerbo threat zero, so we don't do that. And okay, so this is half of the bubble. This is just for dynamics. Well, any questions about this general setting? So we have practicals, good jobs. It's confusing to say that legal exchange occurs with rate one. I mean, there is some club with rate one, and then you check whether it is legal or not. Yes, it's the second. Yes, the memics. Okay, so I have my participants. I have my particles, and at each edge. And at each hedge has a clock that rings with rate ones. The clock rings. And if exchange is legal, the exchange starts basically how it ends. Otherwise, everyone will stay on the state. But legal or not depends on the value of CP and how is that assigned. Okay, so this is the general set of discusses. Then specific models will differ by the Will differ by the exact definition of this sum, the constraint. And the common things for all models is that this constraint can depend on the two sides two endpoints of pay-hatch and that it will be decreasing. So the setting is clear. I still disagree, but she was also disagreeable, and I think that is important because And I think that is important because if you say that legal exchange occurs at rate one, then on average on time interval one, you have one legal exchange. But that is talking about frequency. Then I would say frequency page. Okay. I know what you want to say. Exchange D happens with an A G, right? Which is different. Exchange. Exchange. Because C can be one or two. Now everybody's happy. I hope. And okay, an immediate consequence of this patient, in particular, this property is that. This property is that there is a reversible with respect to a product multi-measure with a parameter which I will call one minus Q for all the Q. And this Q is going to be the best idea of empty sense. So I want to dedicate this part of the backboard for notation. This is going to be density of empty size, density of vacancies. Yeah, why not? So the model is okay. All of these, all of the models in this family are reversible with respect to product measure. And for the different models in this family, we have a few questions that maybe different people have different questions. The questions that I'm interested in are, okay, so first of all, maybe preliminary question is about the rubicity. Preliminary question is about the rubicity, which, okay, for us could mean if I start from this measure, will all sites change their occupation at one point or another, for example? Maybe this also implies the temporal average equals the space average. So first question is of periodicity. So, first question is for rublicity. If we have a rubyity, we can continue asking about what are the relevant time scales of the model. Then, you know, so we talked about tank scales, the conservative system. The more the most interesting time scales, a very common time scale is if you sit, so you might. Common Python scale is effusive, so we want to ask whether the system is diffusive. And in the end, you know, if you have this viscidity, then maybe you would find some scale if it's this is the type of questions that. I'm interested in at least for the sake of this time. What do you mean by scaling D? Good question. Hydrodynamic limits, for example. For example, hydrodynamic limits or the path of a marked particle. So I mean, in general, I speed up time, I look from far away, I follow some observable, and I see if it converges. And they see if it converges to some continuous object. So, this is relatively the time scale. So, if I scale time correctly, do I get something a little bit? Okay, so before starting to talk about statistics and strainatics guesses, we'll give an example. So it's a public example zero. I'll look at one zero just C equals one always. This one that has a name, it's called the simple exclusion process. And this is well studied, well understood, it has very nice properties that we don't have in most discussions. But let's see what is the technology for this one. So, first question here was herbicity. So, if I don't have any constraints, all the changes are legal, then clearly they have herbicides, right? If I want to change the state of the site, I look for someone far away with a different state, and I go with signals of exchanges. This is very easy. Then we ask how time scale to behave. Very general statements at the style behaves like lens, which is called this thing that refers especially to the characters particles, or how should I interpret that? Okay, so how should we interpret that? How should we interpret that? And there are many ways to interpret that. And it's strange to so many ways to interpret time. And strangely, okay, not very strangely, but for good reasons, they all give this relation. Plane, which is, I want to write constant times square. And let me give you three examples for how to interpret this time length. So first example would be So, a first example would be something like a relaxation time of a system in a finite box. This relaxation time is constant times that square. Another thing to consider is you take a single particle and you color it, have one red particles, one red particle, and you see its trace z2. So you ask how long it takes to reach distance L, and this time will be more or less, it will be a constant times L squared. And a third example, which is also very interesting, is the hydrogen climate. So this model has a hydrogen climate, which is So this model has a hydraulic limit, which is very well established. And what does hydraulic limit mean? So if I start uncomputing, I'm drawing a one-dimensional picture, so you think of one-dimension or as a character of the dimensional case. And let's say I start with row equals one, the first half. equals one the first half and rho equals zero in the second half so i fill all the first half of my x is going to fill with particles and the right half i keep empty and i see what happens to the system so if i wait for a short time it's going to be much smaller than elsewhere i'm going to see a first particle we start moving First cycle would start moving from the left to the right, but they move very little. So maybe the corner here would be a bit more round, but I would still see something that looks a lot like the initial corner. Now, if I wait for longer, so t, which is constant xel square, I will see a real change in the profile. So I will see something like this. Well, and then if I wait for even longer, so t which is much larger than l square, then I'm going to see the stationary. So one half of two of them. So this means that the profile, the density profile evolves in diffusive fascism. In order to see something which is non-trivial, I need to look at styles which stay like length squared. Length squared. This is very well established for the simple exclusion process. An interesting thing that happens here, you see that I want here C, and this C doesn't depend on the density. So it's not a C, it's just a constant. And this will be different from the other standardized gases that we're going to talk about. So, this was the setting, a bit of the vocabulary, doing by scaling, using scaling for this example zero. Any questions because everything is clear. Okay. I hope it's better at this point. So, first one is the one for the back is the command. Another that lets me put the definition of the constraint here because I keep so I have a constraint of an edge and I will add this slide here. It would be equal. Let's do it this way. This would be my edge P. Each side here has three more neighbors. And what I want is at least one entine here. And I also want at least one activity. And I want to both over if this end corresponds to this variables. This is the same problem. I'm allowed to jump from here to here, here to here. If this guy has some at the anchor, this guy has some. Good. So this model was introduced by this chemist in 1993, let's say. And they simulated this model. And based on the simulation, they conjectured that there is a sound breaking of her. Breaking the ferries. So there is some critical probability, which is more or less 0.12. And what we observed numerically is that if Q is greater than QC, so many vacancies. Many vacancies means that the constraint is easy to satisfy. So we expect something that looks like simple exclusion. And the probability of this is going to be using. This is going to be diffusing. And we say that for Q, which is smaller than QC, I have very few vacancies, so the constraint is very difficult to be satisfied. So the evolution is much longer. Means that maybe the time is longer, then length squared. So I'll say that time much longer than length. Square and the reason is that okay, but the thing is that there are very large structures which are completely blocked and so that there is some formation of block structures how do you define a blood structure? So, I'll give you an example of a blood structure instead of defining. Let's say that. I mean, let's say that I have two rows which are completely filled. Here I have outside my claim is that these two rows will remain blocked forever. So no side here could ever change its application. Here, Culero changes occupation. So, why? If somebody changes its application, then there has to be a first edge to change its application. Let's say it's this one. It has three field labs. So this edge is not a legal edge. This just is not an intellectual. Very simple. So this structure, I have two rows of two columns which are completely occupied. Columns which are completely occupied is a plot structure. So, this is something that would break herbicity for the diffusive scaling. Okay, specifically, I think two rows which are entirely arphified has probability zero. Just because we're putting it in bundle measure, I want to use zero one, but uh I think the also zero one, so we don't have any. Zero wise, so we don't have any economic issues. So, this thing has problem zero, but you know, Kapogara says RSA simulation sprung some other type of percolating structures that seemed to be flux forever. So, they conjectured below this critical probability and diffusivity is broken. So, this is this is problem. Maybe it's a spoiler. And maybe you could mention so it was first proven the turn in the paper of Christina, Giulio Piraldi, and Daniel Fisher from 2095. They showed that with probability one and there are no So, if we have any finite density of empty signs, in the end, every blockage could be opened. And then, okay, series of papers with Fabia and Justina. And at all attributes and myself shows that there is a diffusivity. So time actually behaves like 10 square. And we'll see later why simulations. Uh so maybe before going into the Carbanus model and explaining what is going on there, I want to give a simpler model. And this model I think was first introduced in a paper of Christina with Alexa Burtini. Now, with the Raxo Burtini, but she didn't want me to call it the Bertini-Tabi Medi model. So I will call it the OR model. And yes, maybe I want one data here. I want this to have one data there. That one is a. Match one of them stuff. So if I have a vacancy here or a vacancy there, the transition is zero. Okay, so think of the colors of the end model and the or one. Maybe something will become routine. Okay, so uh this, I said it was a synchro paddle. What about? Why is it simpler? So it's simpler because we can identify a model as a cluster. Instead of defining a cluster, just give it a temple. So let's say we have somewhere two empty sites, which are next to one another. Decides which are next one. So, let's see what could happen. So, if you're looking at this edge, you could see that there is an empty site here, which is enough for the constraint. Which is enough for the constraint to be satisfied. So these two occupations could be flipped. So I'm going to flip them. Okay, that's fair. But I could take this edge and you see that it has an empty number here. So these two occupations will be fit as well. So do this. And we see that this cluster. And we see that this cluster, these two zeros, moved one step to the right. Same way, they move one step to the left. Okay, we also see, for example, that this edge is legal. So if you flip these two, and now this edge is legal, as that empty side, so if you take these two, you see that these two empty sites could also move down or up, which means that it's okay, well the bomber cluster. Call the polar cluster. It's very really name. It's a cluster of two zeros. The dismal light could move around C2, no matter which occupations are. They all want to have zeros. And this model cluster simplifies about analysis. So I think, first of all, So, okay, first of all, models that have a model faster, they have a name. So they're called non-comprehensive models. Non-comprehensive, maybe it will become clearer when we see what the cooperative bundle is. But the idea is that the slow cluster could move and it doesn't need the cooperation. Need the cooperation of the sites around it, a little bit overall. So, this is a non-cooperative model, and somehow we could think of it as analogous to the supercritical kinetic instrain models. We had, let's say, if you remember the one neighbor kinetic constraint model, there was one side that could move, erase, whatever it was to that. So it could move freely in space. Freely in space. Here we have this cluster of zeros that we will freely expect. There is some analogy there. Okay, so the first consequence, which is easy consequence is very interesting. It's because It's because if I'm taking z2, my initial state, I have somewhere two zeros which are adjacent. So I could find a model faster somewhere. This level faster could move around and change the configuration. So this is the kind of scary easy to see when the model is not proper. You see that, okay, here I told you that the model is zero, but it's not really true. Exergotic, but it's not really why. I mean, I'm just didn't see that. This is a very nice thing about my copper models. And okay, maybe should write that ergodicity is the same as same with QC. So you can think about QC as the PC of the dialogue. Of the I model, when the model becomes changes from ergonomic to an ergonomic, then here QC equals zero, which means that for all positive q, the model is ergonomic. Anyway, span to write my talk. So we have a predictive feed, which is a very easy consequence of a cluster, and another consequence. Faster and another consequence, which is a good fusion scale. So the idea behind diffusive, behind the show that this model scales effusively, is to say that if I want a particle to move or particle exchange to occur, then I could always wait. Then I could always wait for some other faster to reach my neighborhood. Then I do the exchange, and then I let another faster go back or put somewhere else. So the reason is that it's like the simple solution process with effective effective rates. The defective rates and corresponding to the arrival of the other faster. Which means that our time. Would scale as some traveling. So when time scales as some constant times lambda squared. But this time this concept will depend on Q because I will need to wait for a proper class to arrive. If Q is very small, then I need to wait for a long time until. Long time until the other cluster until I find this other cluster. So, this C of Q will be the verge polynomial. Okay, so the C will be equals Q one because the size of the sensor is two. The size of the sensor is two. So with distance q squared, I expect to find the cluster. And maybe it takes some time to arrive. Either way, you can have something which is worse than it, but nothing else. Yes. By the way, not proven, but quite. That's my answer. That's final version. So it's data final. But it's okay. Either way, it's fine by the factor. When you say my certificate one over Q, do you mean up to log? I always, first of all, I always mean up to dogs. I suspect there is no doubt here, right? Is not on here, right? Okay, when it's one over Q, I mean recently in dimension one and it was one over Q with nothing. No, we think in all dimensions it should be one over Q with no other. But in two dimensions, there could be luck. There could be luck. In the paper with Patricia and Claudia, where you have this set helping? I don't think. So the red learning unit for this model is not true. For this model, for the other model, for the hip 20 minute by T. So yeah, you still have the theory trying to prove this one. Yes, no. So converts the zeros and the one that you're working on. We didn't do it, so I just wanted to contact you. Okay, so. Okay, so if you change slightly, if you put a plus here instead of or, so you allow translation 352, then he claim it is proved. If you put an or it's proved in a very weak sense, right, in this epsilon weakening sense, just by elimination compared to the gradient model, but with the plus is gradient model with the plus gradient, okay. That's great. It's a gradient, so you could find the diffusion coefficient explicitly. Then, if you have an order, you could use variational formulas to dominate using this gradient model. So you know that the diffusion coefficient is positive. And then with some cheating, adding epsilon times and taking epsilon to zero at the end, you have, you could say that at least in some sense, there is a high merit for this one. So, this model is diffusive and essentially behaves 96 over. If you have any question about the scaling of the model, things input expansion and this factor of q to the minus theta because of the length. Okay, so uh this was your model. Let's look at the end one to the end. The end model is just comparison? Yes. So that's the end model, the computer model. And in this model, there is no model task. And okay, the proof is. And okay, the proof is very short. If there is another cluster, it means that there is some cluster of zeros that could empty everyone everywhere, no matter what is the occupation. So let's say I could find some other cluster. I ramp it to get the butts and I put only zeros here and also inside. So definitely. So, definitely, because we said that the constraint has to be decreasing, it's decreasing in the configuration, this integration would be able to empty everyone. But this integration, if I put once all around, no one could because of the can't condition, which means that I can't have a constant. So, this is another. So this model is cooperative. Cooperative, we may guess that we need some cooperative motion of many sands in order to move around, but exactly all that must. So, what you could see is that identify, so there are Which we call droplets. Let me just quickly convince you they exist. So let's take a column of L empty sense. Sense and now this can't be a lot faster because there are no but faster, but let's assume that okay, similar to its fragment, there is a zero. I don't care about that. Okay, so now let's see what happens. This zero could move up because it has an empty network here, with this I just read, but there is an empty guy here. This edge is legal, and there is an empty guy here. So, this edge is a legal edge. So, this zero could move up, and here I have now the next step, this zero could move to the right, because as a number here before, and here is a number the other. So I have a zero, and here something. Okay, now I could move this zero. Now I could move this zero down. Okay, so I have here zero, here sorry. Now I can exchange these two add something zero. And okay, I can go the same way, right? Take exchange these two and these two and these two and these two. And in the end, I reach a configuration where I have a column of zero. Equal zero to the right something else to the left with a zero sub. So if I have this volume of zero and if I happen to have a zero right next to it, then it would work. Okay, so it's not mobile, but it's almost not. So you can't control it. So the conclusion, if L is larger or equals of the order one over Q. So if this is very long, I'm thinking of Q, which is small. So if the column is very long, the order one over Q, it's very likely to find this extra zero to the right. Okay, the draft that's done. But the draft lats are probably the colour of the draft lens. Good move. And let's say almost free. Here you have there could be a. Is this clear? So I have a column of zero. If the column is long enough, I'm very likely to find a zero. I'm very likely to find a zero next term. And in that case, have a sequence of legal moves that will be fine to the left. Okay. So we see that the correct scale of the traple left is this tells you. Okay, so first we see that this model is what we call the cooperative in the sense that, yeah. In the sense that we need this extra zero to exist, and we have, in order to move the drop-up, we don't have finitely many moves like here, I think. Two moves in order to move the cluster, but we have the levels of moves that we need explodes when we approach criticality. So we need a very long, a very large cluster, and many moves in order to get this. But still, if you look only in this horizontal rate, And it's horizontal way, then sooner or later you will not be able to go through it. So you make it okay. And then you can sort of learn the density. If it is a low density, then things can move, so I don't have to go around. But you'll find in a good neighborhood, you could flat right next turn, and move up and down. And then you need to show that these good boxes are collected. Right. And then you. Right. And then you win. So there is a more important argument here that you want some percolation to occur. But the idea remains the same. Maybe you don't need a log here, you need to take a look which is a bit larger, but it's not very essential. So we have these droplets, and you know, if we believe this picture. Picture that we had before, then we expect to write this here so we still so we still don't have time, which is some constant times times square. Okay, because everyone could move if they want to move particularly if you wait for a droplet to approach, then. Droplets through the crunch, then it moves, and then the droplet goes away. So, again, this is something which looks like it's doing a process, slowed down by a set factor. But this factor relates to the probability of the droplet. And the probability of the droplet is going to be exponential of one over Q. This one over here is. Okay, this one over here is actually something with a log square with a constant. See that there is a large difference between these two. And when I said before that we'll see why Pavan Anderson got it from a type simulation, this is the real thing. Because exponential of one over Q is huge. If you want to take small Q and I think this one is actually one. One is not really one conjecture, it's 0.25, I think. And then, if you take the q, which was more or less one over 10, so we have e to the power 10. If you have this factor of one four or one half, I don't remember, then it becomes e to the power 20 or e to the power 40, which is huge. It's very difficult to capture in simulations. Okay, so this is the So this is the result for the Claude-Anderson model for all these things that we've done before. So the spectral gap, the diffusion coefficient, and the hydrogenic limits, at least in some weak sense, we could prove that this thing holds. Maybe just two. To conclude, we saw that there are two models, the cooperative and non-cooperative, ideally modeled faster or not. And the non-cooperative model is much nicer to analyze, it has a simple structure, but it has a very different terminology. I guess I think that from the classy point of view, we expect none except the cooperative models to give a better description of masses. So it's also important to know how to deal with To know how to deal with the cooperative problems or with the cooperative of the so just before I end a few of the questions and I guess, okay, my first question. And I guess, okay, my first question would be to get better results. Maybe it's not the best question to ask here because I didn't get at all into technicalities, but when you say button this thing exactly, it's n this because one is one over q, it's a weak version of convergence. Version of convergence hybrid thing. It's a these are all things that could be improved, and I think it would be interesting for you to improve if you're interested in the data. Are you improved or could be proved? Both are not great. Both are not great. So, in both cases, you don't really know the equipment. Sure, just in a weak sense. Sense well, okay, if you are steering, if you are steering, yes, okay, but then you change them all, yes and no. At the time, for example, you have that itself, but the constant in is basically equal to the constant that we have. The concept would be nice to get. So this one here would be nice to find. The skill of one here would be nice to understand. Okay, and gets more and gets better results in different ways. So this is one question, and the next question, second question, which is maybe more relevant to the talk and to yesterday, is a result. Day is a percentage. So now with candidate constraint models, there's very rich percent of the results. Very specific classes where we understand variable scaling. Then for the scale of the strain of skesses, I think these two models are essentially everything. Okay, so these are two things. Okay. So these are two. Okay, there is one warning. It's two. It might be tempting to think that should look a bit like an ethical strain model. So the conservative should look like a non-conservative. See, here we have something polynomial with a model cluster, which reminds us of this one-leighborn mechanism of supercritical. Of supercritical extra models here, we recognize this exponential one over Q for the critical neighbor model. I'd be tempted to say that in general this is what happens, but a work in progress. This is not analogy. So there are cases in which there are essential or qualitative differences between different strain models, and client difference training has a case. Try models, and I think it's trying to have the skin. There's really a different story that happens here from the point of view of different sort of things would be nice to understand something. I think I have already.
