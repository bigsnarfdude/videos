I'll remind you of what my title is, which is going to be about exactly M-coloured graphs. And almost everything I'll talk about today is based on joint work with my co-author, Thira De Kittipassant, who is now in Thailand. Okay, so I'll start with the definition. The definition of what an exactly m-coloured graph is. So for me, and I'll stop using the word exactly as I go forwards, an exactly M-colored graph is just one, it's just an edge-colored graph in which the number of distinct colours that end up appearing are. That end up appearing are precisely. So it's just an edge-colored graph G with the number of distinct colors used being equal to n. All right, so that's it. Not proper colourings by any means, just ideas. By any means, just I give you a graph whose edges are coloured and I call it m coloured if the number of colours that appear in the colouring is precisely m. Okay, so today I would like to talk about some rather interesting Ramsey theoretic questions that arise when one goes looking for such exactly m coloured graphs. We want to find such things inside bigger colourings. So there'll be a Ramsey theoretic sort of problem that I'll deal with. Deal with. At this point, I should sort of apologise, maybe, and say these might not be the sort of colouring problems that fit into the theme of the colouring problems that we've seen for the most part in the meeting. But I think there are some really nice questions here, and I'll try and advertise some of them because I think it would be nice for more people to think about them. Okay, and for the most part, I'll also. For the most part, I'll also say that I don't care about bounds in the stock. I just want to show existence results. So the setup will usually be that we're colouring the edges of the complete graph and the natural numbers. So it'll just be convenient to work with a really large graph. So we colour the edges of Kn. The edges of Kn, where n is, of course, the natural numbers. All right. Good. So here's question one. This is the question that most of the talk will be about trying to answer. So suppose I give you a colouring of the edges of the complete graph. And again, I use k-colored to mean. And again, I use k colored to mean that I promise to use k different colours when I coloured the edges. And also, k could either be a natural number or it could be a countably infinite number of colours. So I use possibly infinitely many colours to colour the edges of the complete graph, the naturals. And as I said earlier, I'd like to find M-colored graphs inside. Graphs inside, and so that's the question that we'll hope to answer: for which natural numbers can I guarantee to find an M colored clique inside this column. Inside this column. Okay, so just to make sure that I am on the same page with everyone, let me just do some silly examples of colourings. So for example, as I said, since I allow you to use infinitely many colours, it's possible that every edge of the complete graph and the naturals get a different colour. From the naturals, get a different colour. So, suppose the universe is rainbow-coloured. So, that edge gets colour one, that edge gets colour two, that edge gets colour three, and so on and so forth. Every edge gets its own colour. Then it's easy to see that the only values of m so the only Guaranteed values of m are precisely numbers of the form, you know, t choose 2 for some t in m. So those are the only values for which I can promise you that there'll be an m colored clique inside there, right? Another silly example, which we'll come back to, is Is what I'll call a star colouring, and we'll do the following. We'll pick our favourite vertex. Let me not call it anything. We'll pick our favourite vertex, and we'll colour all the edges instant to that vertex, let's say, with a different colour. And let's colour everything else with a single colour that's not been used so far. Not been used so far. In this case, what can we say about the set of guaranteed values n? I can get a single colour. I can just take any clique from down here. I can't get a two-coloured clique. If I use more than one vertex from down here, More than one vertex from down here and the special vertex up here, the number of colors inside that cleat becomes at least three, and it's easy to see that everything else is okay. So I end up missing the value two. I can't find an exactly two-coloured clique in this column. Okay, so hopefully, the notions that I've set up so far are clear. If there are any questions about the definition so far, please feel free to. So far, please feel free to stop me and ask them now. Okay, so this is the sort of setup I'll be working with. The edges of the complete graph get colored, possibly with infinitely many colours, and I'd like to know, given a natural number M, can I guarantee that there'll be an M coloured clique in this colour? Okay, but before I turn to saying something about this question or answer. About this question or answering this question, let me mention a related problem where many things are, at least the central thing is still open. So, question two is going to be more or less the same as question one, but now I shall ask for a really big m colored clique. And since we're starting with an infinite complete graph to begin with, we'll ask for an infinite m colored clique. So the setup's the same as before. Same as before. So again, let's suppose that Kn is K-colored, possibly with infinitely many colours. Ask the same question again. Can I guarantee the presence of an infinite? Of an infinite M coloured clue. And here, it could be that every edge gets colored distinctly, and then the answer is there are no such values. So the question makes no sense if I actually allow infinitely many colours. So in this case, it only really makes sense to ask the question for finitely many colours. Question for finitely many colors, but suppose I finitely color the complete graph and the natural numbers, for which values of m can I find an m-colored infinite t? So, and for this question, we already have some easy answers. So what about m equals one? Well, the answer is trivially yes, and this is indeed the contents of Ramsey's theorem. So, I should say this is for question two. m equals one is easy. You're promised by Ramsey's theorem that there's an infinite monochromatic clique, so that deals with m equals one. Turns out that m equals two is also guaranteed. So, in any finite colouring of the complete graph and the natural numbers, it turns out that you can find an infinite. It turns out that you can find an infinite clique within which there are exactly two distinct colours. And this was shown by Erickson in 94. And this is in fact the starting point of everything I'll be talking about today. And the starting point, in some sense, was the following conjecture that Ericsson made. These are the only two guaranteed values in general. Namely, so let me just say that informally first question two, i.e. For every k bigger than m bigger than 2, he claims or conjectures that there exists a k colouring of the complete graph with no monochromatic or not sorry with no M colored infinite click. Okay. So, in some sense, if the conjecture is true, we more or less have a complete answer to question two. The only things you could hope to guarantee are an infinite monochromatic clique or an infinite clique that has exactly two colours inside it. And in terms of evidence for this conjecture, Evidence for this conjecture was shown by Alan Stacey and Peter Weidel, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly in perhaps 99, that the conjecture is true for every m bigger than 2 if k is bigger. So, for any large number of colors in terms of m, there is indeed a colouring of the complete graph with k colors where no clique will have exactly m colors inside it. No infinite clique will have exactly m colors inside it. Okay, so in some sense, this was the starting point. And if you believe this conjecture, the answer to question two, in some sense, is not all that interesting, in that, at best, you could hope. In that, at best, you could hope for two different values. Let's return to question one, where we didn't demand that our n-coloured clique be infinite, that it be large. For question one, all we wanted was some possibly finite M-coloured cliff. So let's maybe establish a little bit of notation. So let's say that C. Say that C is our colouring, the complete graph, and for concreteness, I'll just assume that I'm using infinitely many colours. Most of what I say will work just as well if you have a large number of colours, but it's just cleaner to work with infinitely many colours. And let me say, let me define SC to just be the set of values m for which I can find an M colour clique. Find an M-colored clique inside this column. And so, in other words, question one rephrased is just asking which values can we promise will always belong to SC? Right, and as we saw just a few moments ago, the silly example where every edge gets coloured differently rules out any value m that's not a binomial coefficient of the form t choose to. But if you try to wreck those values of To wreck those values of m, you'll struggle. And indeed, this led Alan Stacey and Peter Roydle to conjecture again in that paper that these values of m are in fact unavoidable. So for all c, so for all colourings as above, The set of realizable values always contains all of the binomial coefficients, all of the triangular numbers. It's a pretty bold conjecture. And it turns out that this is true. So this was the theorem that I was hoping to say something about today with my collaborator, Theored Kitty Passant. We showed that this is true. So, if you colour the edges of the complete graph and the natural numbers with infinitely many colours, and you think about which values m can be realized as the number of colours inside some clique, then you can successfully find a d choose two coloured clique for every value g. For every value g. Okay. And it turns out, so let me try and say something about the ideas in the proof. Ah, but maybe before I jump in, I should pause and say: are there any questions about anything I've said so far? Okay, so if there are no questions, I'll carry on. Please feel free to jump in at any point. The first idea is to ask a slightly more general question. So, what do I mean? So, so far. So, so far, I've been asking which values m are unavoidable inside such a colouring of the complete graph on the natural numbers. It turns out, in some sense, the better starting point is to ask, when is it the case that not every value m can be realized? Or, in other words, in terms of notation we've established so far, you want to ask When is i.e., when is it the case that under what conditions could it so happen that not every value m allows us to find an m coloured clique inside our colour? And we've already seen two possible colourings right at the start where this is not the case. So we saw that, and this was the easiest thing: that when every edge gets a different colour, then indeed not every value m is realizable inside the clique. And you saw this other slightly less silly example where. Where we avoided the value 2, right? We saw with this star coloring that I showed you earlier, which let me remind you is something like this. All the edges coming out of a point get different colors, and all the other edges not incident to here get completely distinct colour from the colours I've used so far. And again, in this case, the set of In this case, the set of realizable values was everything but two. So, again, it was not all of n. And it turns out that these are indeed the only blocking configurations, and we have the following result. So, I'll call it the canonical Ramsey type theorem. That says whenever you colour the edges of the complete graph with loads and loads of colours, either you get to find an n-colored clique for every value n, or you must in fact see. You must, in fact, see one of the two obvious obstructions such to one happening, namely there exists an infinite rainbow clique inside the colouring, or there exists an infinite star-colored clique. Star color click inside the colour. And it's easy to see that this implies the conjecture that the numbers teach you are unavoidable. If the set of realizable values. Vergav, the first thing is presumably equal then, right? Apologies, yes, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, indeed. Indeed. Yes. Okay. And with the correct theorem, it's hopefully clear that it implies the conjecture written down earlier. Either you immediately get to see every value n, or you see an infinite rainbow clique from which you can work out that, of course, you get all the values t choose two, because again, these are all induced. And finally, if there's an infinite star-coloured clique, then the set of realizable values will include every value but two. Values will include every value but two, and happily that includes all the binomial coefficients. So I'll just record that. I'll just say the canonical theorem implies the status conjecture. Okay, so those of you who might have not seen some of the things, let me say. Some of the things, let me say why such a thing is called a canonical Ramsey theorem. It'll also be useful when I say more about how we might try and prove this. So an example of canonical Ramsey theorem. I say an example, but more or less the starting point of canonical Ramsey theory is the following. Is the following beautiful result of Erdős and Rado that says if I start with a colouring of the complete graph, possibly with infinitely many colours, here I don't demand that you use all the colours, but let's say we do. Then, of course, Ramsey's theorem would have promised us an infinite monochromatic clique, but that's no longer something we can necessarily. But that's no longer something we can necessarily guarantee because, as we saw earlier, we could colour every edge distinctly, so we've got to allow other possibilities in terms of what we could hope to find. And Erdős and Redo worked out precisely which set of things one can guarantee. Then either there exists an infinite one. One coloured clique or monochromatic clique, or there exists an infinite rainbow clique. These are the obvious obstacles, but there are two more that might be less obvious, namely, colourings determined just by one endpoint of your edge, either the left endpoint or the right endpoint. Or let's say there exists an infinite left-coloured clique. I'll explain that in a second. Namely, a clique where all these edges get some colour depending on the left endpoint, these edges all get some colour depending on the right endpoint, and so on. So that doesn't look like either of those two objects, and so we have to allow for. And so we have to allow for these sorts of possibilities as well. And similarly, for right colour, so these sorts of results that where the number of colours is allowed to be huge, but you still promise some sort of structure, these results are typically called canonical Ramsey theorems. And so when viewed against something like the Uruf-Fuedo theorem, Something like the Hero Fuido theorem. It's clear why I call that a canonical Ramsey theorem for m-colored graphs. It's promising you some structure, not one particular structure, but something from a small finite list. Okay, great. So let me say something about how we might try and prove this canonical Ramsey theorem. Turns out we need a couple. Turns out we need a couple more ideas to prove this. So, let me start with what might be the dream. So, of course, most proofs in Ramsey theory involve some type of neighborhood chasing. So, you pick a vertex, you look around at all the edges instant to that vertex, and depending on what you see there, you decide to pass to some subset. Pass to some subset. So here's the dream. The dream is that you pick some vertex and you see infinitely many colours coming out of that vertex. Suppose you were fortunate and this were to happen, then it turns out you're more or less done. There's almost no work to be done. And why is that? Because here are all the so let me pick out all So let me pick out all the edges of distinct colours coming out of this vertex suite. Let me look at what's left. Let me call that the neighbourhood that I'm jumping into. And let me apply the Hurdish-Rado theorem in here. If, for example, I got a monochromatic clique in here, I would have found a star colouring, as I called it, and that would have been on my list. And that would have been on my list of potential bits of structure that I'm allowed to find, and that would be great. If I find a rainbow clique in there, that's again a rainbow clique which I allow, and that'll be okay. And if you either see a left-colored or a right-colored clique in there, Then it's easy to combine that possibly with V to show that in this case you will get every possible natural number. You'll get every M colored cleave for every you'll get an M colored cleave for every value of M. Okay but of course there's no reason for this dream scenario to necessarily happen. Scenario to necessarily happen, and indeed, almost all the work is to deal with other possibilities. So, for example, let's say that instead I only see a single colour coming out of my vertex. In which case, what we'd love to do is to jump in here and ignore the colour one and try and do something inductive. Try and do something inductive. So we would love to ignore one. Let's say we forbid two and three, namely, we forbid a rainbow or a star-colored clique from turning up in here, because in that case we'd be done. And the hope is to do induction and say I can find an M colored clique in here that I can hopefully then combine with V to form an M colored M plus. We to form an M coloured, M plus one coloured clip. Okay. But of course, the problem is that if we ignore one, we're no longer colouring a nice complete graph, we're coloring an arbitrary graph in here. And so the induction doesn't quite work. And so I'll maybe stop with this idea. We need a couple more. With this idea, you need a couple more things, but this is the nicest part of the proof. It's to sort of boldly guess that there is, in fact, an analogue of this canonical Ramsey theorem that I wrote down earlier to arbitrary infinite graphs. So we'll study a much more general problem, i.e., our colouring is no longer a colouring of kn, but some arbitrary infinite graph with infinitely many colors, and we'd like to reason about this. It turns out there exists a good canonical Ramsey theorem at this level of generality. I won't bother writing it down. It's very similar to what we saw earlier, but you've got to be a bit. To what we saw earlier, but you've got to be a bit more careful, and indeed, what you really need is that plus some bipartite version of this to actually make the proof work. But since I'm running out of time, I'll stop there with regards to proof ideas. I'll stop with maybe a couple of open problems. And indeed, in some sense, almost everything I'd like to know about what happened. Everything I'd like to know about what happens in general is open. So I'll start by reminding you, of course, of Erickson's conjecture of just local. This was the claim that if you were looking for an infinite M-coloured clique, the only values of M for which you had any hope were the only values that you can guarantee. But I think there's But I think there's a large amount of interesting looking problems about hypergraphs. What happens with question one? Let's see. What if I colour all the triples of natural numbers? So, unfortunately, So, unfortunately, it turns out there are no unavoidable numbers like these binomial coefficients. So, for example, you might guess that maybe numbers that look like t23 are unavoidable, but that's not the case. But I think there are interesting things to be done by asking the more general question that I ended up asking. The more general question that I ended up asking: namely, when is it that the set of realizable values is not everything? And I hope, sort of vaguely believe, but let me not conjecture it, that this will lead to some sort of canonical Ramsey theorem. Namely, there ought to be a finite list of blocking structures. I'll stop there. All right, thank you very much. I have one question. Your Erickson's conjecture, though, Erickson's conjecture, it says one and two are the only numbers that would work. I mean, presumably there are some numbers that are known not to work. I mean, anything else has to be of the form K choose two, but are there some K choose two numbers that do not work? Apology, say that again. So, ah, so the difference between questions. So ah, so the difference between question one okay, so I think I got it. Let me try and answer that. So for question one, we were happy to find a finite M-coloured clique. So for those guys, I can promise you all the binomial coefficients you can do. But question two was about infinite cliques. Are there any numbers for which it's known not to be true? So for every number that's bigger than two, it's known. That's bigger than two, it's known that if I give you enough colours, you can avoid that value in. Okay, but there's no numbers where it's known completely that it's no, no. Even for three, I don't know if it's known that it's it's yeah, completely hopeless. Yeah, okay, okay. All right, thanks. Any other questions? What do those Stacey Widell colours look like? Oh, so yes, so they're very sort of lovely, random. They sort of lovely random colourings. So you start with a huge infinite clique that's monochromatic because you might as well. Ramsey sort of says this is unavoidable. And then you play with random colourings on finite bits and you hope that you avoid M by engineering these random constructions appropriately. But because they're random, you need some wiggle room to say that I've managed to avoid M. I see. Okay. I have a question. Yep. So there are canonical Ramsey theorems for other structures. I think it's probably due to Erdős and Graham that if you color the positive integers, there's arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions or arbitrarily long rainbow. And you can ask similar sorts of questions to what you're looking at. On progressions. On progressions or other structures. I don't know if you've looked into this. I don't know if you've looked into this. I have not. Could be interesting. And yeah, it sounds like very many things you could ask, and I know almost nothing. I mean, even for hypergraphs, as I said, I don't know what the correct conjecture is yet. Okay, any more questions? All right, well, thank you again. And uh
