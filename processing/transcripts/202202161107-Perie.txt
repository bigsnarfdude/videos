The right of this picture, and it's all produced from hematopoietic stem cells during adult life, most of them. And what we were busy with the different lockdowns for the last two years was to try to review numbers about this process. So with Jason Kosgroff and Lucy Austin, we spent so much time reading all the old papers. Actually, most of them are from the 60s or the 80s, trying to know how many cells we had. So, first How many cells we had? So, first, and it was actually very difficult, but we put everything in kind of a reference mouse that is a female mouse of 22 grams, and we did also it for human. So, what we kind of found is that you start with very few stem cells, and this number is very debated. We picked one, and then step by step, the cells differentiate and they amplify log 10 more or less, that's the order of magnitudes, and then you get. Order of magnitudes. And then you get the matrix cells. I'm skipping a lot of intermediate stage, of course. And then you have this huge number of cells. So red blood cells is by far the most abundant cell type, mainly in the blood, 10 to the 10. And then you get the lymphoid cells that are the least abundant. Just for the fun of it, if you convert cell types into seconds, that's the order of magnitude that you will get HAC hours and red blood cells for 100 years. Red blood cells are 100 years. By doing that, we also, so you kind of see that the amplification goes, most of the amplification, like how many, like a lot of cells are produced after some commitment is already decided, because at this stage, which we call the restricted progenitor stage, you cells are already deciding becoming a lymphoid or myeloid. Interestingly, by doing this, we also found that 15 million of cells are unknown. Million of cells are uncharacterized. So if you take the number of cells that are in the bone marrow, that are not the knee cells, and then you add up all the numbers for all the different populations that are known to be in the bone marrow. Actually, there is 15 million cells. We don't really know what they are. So that's just an open question. Of course, these are the numbers to compare mouse and human, and you see that it scales quite well between the two with some differences still. And it's actually strange. Still, and it's actually striking to see that some numbers of very basic numbers in human are missing. So, what's the absolute count of cells in the human screen? There is no paper about that. And if you know one, I would be interested. I spend quite some time, we spend quite some time trying to find it. Of course, it's not only about the total cell numbers because hematopoiesis is a continuous process, so we produce cells all the time. So, from these numbers, if you kind of If you kind of know the half-life of the different cell types, and that's just half-life we picked. So, for a lymphoid, we could discuss it because, depending if it's a memory or effector, it can change. But by doing this approximation, we could derive the number of cells that are produced per day, assuming a constraint renewal over time. And then, what you see, what I found interesting at the global level, is that red blood cells are much like they're two logs more abundant. Much like they're too lug more abundant than myeloid cells, for example, but in terms of production, they equalize most of them, just because red blood cells live much longer than myeloid cells. If you take notrophies, for example, as a reference. Lymphoid cells, of course, it's a bit less. We know there is less cells engaging into the common lymphoid progenitor path, and then there is a totally different process in the timers that you know. Still, I found it interesting to put that in perspective. Still, I found it interesting to put that in perspective: that it would be easy to say, oh, hematoposis is only about red blood cells. Well, it's a lot of cells, but still, in terms of production, it's not only about red blood cells. Well, just to pause, to say that you have produced since I started this talk more or less a few minutes, a few millions of hematopoietic cells. So, just to say that actually the number of cells we produce is really so difficult to grasp intuitively. That I found very Intuitively, that I found very fascinating. Then, another number that is actually missing is the number of divisions. So, it's not known how many divisions you will need to, a cells will do from a stem cell until a match of cells. So, a very simple way to kind of set a number is to make a calculation ignoring death and saying, okay, I have these numbers of erythrocytes, I have these numbers of stem cells, how many divisions you need. How many divisions you need, and then also you can take into account whether there is selection so that you add more division, for example, for B cells, or whether cells like mega-kerocyte are produced from big cells that fragmentate into platelets. And these are the kind of numbers we get. So I'm I bet they are totally wrong, but it's just to set the scene, I think, for to stimulate people to try to find ways to measure the actual number. To measure the actual number, okay. So, well, so going back to hematopoiesis, so we usually have this type of pictures about hematopoiesis, like a tree with branching decision. And of course, we know that the cells, what the cell is doing is to divide and differentiate. And so it's very hard to reconcile both views of the cell's process with the view of the total tree. View of the total tree, and so we were wondering, like, and there are many scenarios that could produce this type of tree. So, we started to say, okay, let's develop a system where we could, I don't see if I want to, sorry, where we could both track division, differentiation, and lineages of single cells. So, for now, I will call a family of cells, every descendant of a single cell. Every descendant of a single cell. I will not use the term clone, but you can think about it if you like it. And this work was done by a postdoc in the lab, Tamar Tak, in collaboration with Ken Duffy in Ireland and his former PhD student, Julio Corvedello. Okay, so we took the simple idea of cell trace division dye, like CFSC, that were invented a long time ago. And at every cell division, the fluorescence of the dye dilute, and that's how by. The dilute, and that's how by fact you can count on any division. And the lab of Phil Hodgkins in 2017 invented this nice trick that because the cell division dye exists in different colors, you can combine them and you can follow several populations at the same time. So, if you label the cells only with CFSC, they will keep CFSC. But if you label them with a certain proportion of CFSC and cell transviolets, so the green and the violet. So, the green and the violet dye, the proportion will be kept when the cells divide, and you can count division. So, the idea of this combination of dye is to multiplex different families within the same well. So, in our experiments, we isolate bone marrow and we split the bone marrow in four fractions that we label with different combinations of the green and violet dye, cell-trace dye. Then, we label the cells for the surface marker that are on. For the surface markers that are used to identify different types of stem cell and progenitor cells. And then in each well of our plate, we sort one cell. For example, if we work on SLAM HSE, which is one type of stem cell, we sort one SLAM HSE in one of the four combinations. So in each well, you will have four cells and each of them will have a different combination. We also do index. We also do index sorting, so we recall for every cell what's the expression of the protein that we label. And then we culture these progenitors for 24 or 48 hours in different cocktail conditions. And at the end, we label them with facts, with antibody and measure by facts. And so the antibody is used here as a proxy for cell type. We can discuss. Cell type. We can discuss that later on. And then the combination of dye is telling you from which ancestor these cells belong to, so which family. And then you can also count the number of divisions. So for every cell in the well, you know from which cells it comes from, what is its ancestor, how many divisions that cell has done, and what is the cell's type, so the differentiation. Type, so the differentiation. Okay, so first thing we use these two cocktails. So with stem cell factor TPO and plus or minus L6. Just in general, the cocktail condition, we retrieve what is known at the population level, that with IL3 and ILX6, you get some differences in differentiation, and mostly that you also get at least one or two divisions more with this. More with this cocktail than with the other one. But this is the data, the single cell looks like. So you have here the type of progenitor, ancestor resorted, here the two time points for each of them, then whether it was culture, wizard or we val 3 analysis 6, etc. And then every row is a family, so from one ancestor, and then the x-axis is the number. The x-axis is the number of divisions we can compute, and the color is the cell type defined by cytometry. So, first thing that you can see from this heat map is that there is a lot of heterogeneity within cell types and also the heterogeneity in division between families. Okay, so let's dig into this data a bit more in detail. So, first question, we wanted to know whether there will be symmetry or asymmetry in differentiation. So, we defined four categories. So, we define four categories of symmetry and asymmetry. So, one that we call symmetric undifferentiated. So, the two daughter cells will be of the same type of ancestor. The asymmetric undifferentiated when one of the daughter cells will differentiate and the other one will keep the same type of the ancestor. Symmetric differentiated where both cells differentiate, but they have the same phase. They have the same phenotype and asymmetric differentiated, where they have two different phenotypes. So, what we did, we took all the families that were in generation one, meaning you have two cells, so the cells, the ancestor cells with one division, and of these two cells, we then classify the family whether in these four categories. And these are the proportion of families in these categories for the three different progenitors and the two cocktails. I think the strategy. I think the striking result from this is that actually most of the families are in blue, these two, so they are the symmetric undifferentiated or the symmetric differentiated, or actually the majority of the events. So asymmetry, which is classically, especially this one, asymmetric undifferentiated, which is classically defined for hematopoietic stem cells, for example, is very rarely often seen. It's less than 20% of the cases. 20% of the cases, and that actually matched quite well all the literature data because I was expecting much more symmetry and differentiated. But actually, in most of the paper, that's the frequency that they see. It's just that a lot of people are focusing on this 20%. Okay, so the next question was whether within a family, so all the sister and cousin cells, would they be dividing at the same time that the Dividing at the same time that the family will be concordant in division, or would it be discordant in division? So, that meaning that some members of the family will stop dividing earlier than others. So, if you analyze that, you have to be a bit careful because if you take a family like this, where the cells divided three times, you get the that's the daughter cells you get, and you will say this family is in range G2, meaning that the Range G2, meaning that from these two cells there is two division aparts. But of course, we don't sample all the cells when we do analysis, and we get a bit of loss. And it's more likely that you will lose the cells that didn't divide a lot because there are fewer of them. So basically, you need to take that into account when you look at your data. And so we measure experimentally the loss of cells. So we have 70% recovery, right? We took a very consistent. Recovery, right? We took a very conservative numbers. And then using a simple stochastic model, we feed to the data the correlation between cells that will be your proxy for concordance in division. And the probability of division is fixed based on what we observe in the distribution in the data. Okay, so that's the results we have. So the data is in red. So whatever the cell type, ancestor type you look, Cell type or sester type you look at, or the cocktail condition, more than 80 or 90 percent of the families are in range zero. So, all the sister or cousin cells, they divide the same time, amount of time. And that is also true if you take into account sampling, you have a high correlation coefficient that's the best fit from the data, which then suggests a very strong concordance in division between families. In division between families within families, sorry, but the cells don't, the families don't divide the same amount of time. So then we looked at whether cells could differentiate without dividing. So for that, you look at the cells that are in generation zero based on the dilution dye, and then you look whether they are the type that you sorted. So for example, if you sort slam HSC that are in red, you see that C. You see that 60% of the cells are still in that phenotype, but you do see a significant proportion of cells, these cells in blue, the SLAM plus MEP, that are actually, so the cells differentiate in these cell types without dividing. And it's not a question of gating because we have the index sorting, so we can go back to see whether the cells were at the border of our gates, but they are not. And this actually is also seen in two other papers where that In two other papers, where that's the disprogenitor is actually a megakerocytes bias progenitor, and we confirm it with in vitro differentiation assay. And it's really specific to this cell type that it will occur without division. We also see that cells differentiate with division. So, for example, if you take the SLAM HSE, at every division, you lose the SLAM HSE and you produce more. SLAM HAC, and you produce more differentiated cells, and the same for all the different cell types. So, from this, it's a bit hard to conclude whether division and differentiation are linked or linked. I cannot answer from this data, but it's actually puzzling to see the two occurring. Okay, so then we looked at whether there is, if you look at the different cell types that are produced, so we are in vitro, so we don't produce the full range of. The full range of matrix cells that are produced from a metopolytic stem cell, but we do have a diversity of them, more biased towards myeloids in vitro. Still, it was interesting to see whether the different cell types that are produced at the population level come from always the same ancestor, or would you have actually the diversity coming from a collection of the different ancestor? So, for that, we map the phenotype. Phenotype on the UMAP because it's really a continuum of expression. So we do the argating with facts, and that's the color. But just to with a dimension reduction, to see the different cell types, stem cells are here, and the more you go that way, you differentiate, and you come more myeloid, and this is more the megacaryocytes part. And what you see now, every dot is then a cell. If we color the cells by family, The cells by family. So every color is from one family. We see that the families tend to be together. So the cells from one family, for example, the green one or the dark one are in this region, then the light blue are in this region. So this subject that's basically within the family they tend to differentiate and go to the same type. Of course, we can't interpret the distance on the UMAP, so we developed A test to look at that. So we classify all the families with the number of different cell types they will give based on the flow cytometry gating. And this is the two time points. So what you see is that with time, you have more cell types that are produced. And then we compare that to permutation. So like creating random families, but keeping the structure of the data for division and differentiation. And differentiation. And then, what you see is that basically the families are more similar, in fact, than what you will get by random permutation. This is very significant, suggesting that the cells from one family, from the same ancestor, they tend to differentiate the same way. It's not totally perfect. It's not like division. There is a diversification, but they still tend to do the same thing. The same thing. We also look because we have this index sorting, so we record the expression of some receptors that we picked to identify them in the ancestor. And then we look whether this expression will correlate with the one of the data cells. And so for some markers, basically we see like a correlation between the two. So also some receptor levels are inherited within the family. Within the family. Okay, so that's the conclusion of this part. I don't know what I'll do with time, but we develop a system to simultaneously follow division, family, and differentiation. We see that families of cells in the system are very concordant in division and differentiation, which suggests that there is an inheritable property or memory that is passing from one cell to another. There's that early differentiation occur most. That early differentiation occurs mostly with symmetric division. That the population heterogeneity that we get in this in vitro culture system is generated by different families of cells and not by one family that will generate all the different cell types. And well, we don't know whether division and differentiation are linked, but we do see instances of differentiation occurring without division, and we also see differentiation progressing with division. Just to tell you briefly that. Just to tell you briefly that we also analyze human curlblood data and this is the data and we do find the same concordance. So this is the data for the division. So again, even taking into account sampling, the families are very concordant in division. And this is the concordant, the similarity in fate. Also, we see a lot of similarities. And we also did it now have data on the bone marrow cells from L F donors. Bone marrow cells from alpha donors, and it's the same. So, something that is conserved across species. Then, we were really wondering whether this concordance is a synchrony or not. So, we developed an assay where we sort single cell into a 96-well plate and then just do live cell microscopy and track the cells. So, that's one movie. So, you have your cell here. Here, so it's a bit slow, but at some point the cell will divide, you see there, and then you see that then it divides, but the two of them will divide at the same time now. You see they divide at the same time, and then at some point, one of them will not be synchronous anymore, and the other one will keep synchronous. So, here you saw there is. So here you saw there is one cell that didn't divide. Still, and so that raised the question whether this synchronic could be lost with differentiation. Still, what I was calling concordance with this essay, we can see it's synchrony. So we measure time to first division, time to second division, and time to third division. We see that cells that are less committed, like That are less committed, like hematopoietic stem cells. So, this is in human core blood. They divide slower than cells that are more committed. That was already shown. And also that the first division is slower than the second division. But to look at synchronicity, we plotted the correlation between time to first division and time to second division, very strong correlation. And then for division three, we looked at the standard deviation between the At the standard deviation between the time to third division, and we see there is actually the standard deviation is within less than two hours. And we take pictures every one or two hours, depending a bit on the size of the experiment. So definitely our cells are synchronized, or at least they divide in this amount of time that is similar to what we can observe. And just to leave you with an interesting observation, this is the work in progress. We looked at the correlations, like whether The correlations like whether the time of the mother will predict the time to divide of the daughters, two daughters, and subsequent siblings. So, this is the correlation. You have no correlation actually between the time to divide of the mother and the two daughter cells. And the same for the correlation between the mothers and the cells after three division. There is no correlation basically, which I found quite. Which I found quite surprising. So they are synchronous, but it's not that they seem to inherit the time to divide from their mother. So it's not directly inherited. And I'm happy to discuss this. I've seen that it has been observed in many systems also, this effect, not only Maimanian cells, by the way. Okay, with this, I just want to raise a few questions that we have in mind in the moment about this family matter. About these family matters. So, first, we kind of assume when we think about differentiation that cells are making dependent decisions. And that's what we use a lot when we do, for example, single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Most of the, for example, pseudo-time analysis, they assume that cells are independent. So, it's kind of we have to be careful with that. So, we see that there is an interesting property that is. Is an interesting property that is inherited, so we don't know the mechanism, and that's something we are looking at. Of course, all this was done in vitro, and now we would like to know whether it's working in vivo. And we would like also to know how long this family effect will last. And more generally, it's striking to me. So, if there is a memory and you think about this different process at a large scale, what properties does it give in terms of What properties does it give in terms of differentiation? I think it's good for me for now it's easier to assume that cells are independent and they divide and differentiate. It's not clear to me what properties it gives if you remember your ancestor. Especially it's striking because we, well, all the cells come from the same initial egg, right? You have development, but then this is during adroit woods and all HAC doesn't seem to be equal. Doesn't seem to be equal. And on this, just briefly, well, I was trying to think that while source of heterogeneity are usually classically defined as epigenetic or genetic or from the environment that includes cytokines, I think there is also a variation in the cell dynamics that could play a role in the source of heterogeneity. And also, now we looked a bit at hematological malignance. Hematological malignancy, such as leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, that are thought to be an imbalance of division and differentiation. And what we see is that this is a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. And what we see is that basically the cells lose this concordance in division. So now it's only 50% of the family that divide at the same time. And we are quite excited about that to see big. Excited about that to see because I intuitively would think that cells in leukemia or clones they have the same mutation or few mutations, so they would tend to behave the same and same, and we kind of see the contrary. So, that's something we are exploring also. With this, I would like to thank you and thanks the people. I acknowledge them along the way. Maybe I forgot Alexandro Dolada, who did the we've had in the human parts. Parts, and I'm happy to take questions and discuss with you. Where are you? That's the thing. I don't see you anymore. So, questions, Amita? Yes, really great talk. I have a question on the last part. On the last part mainly. So, as I understood, you don't see a correlation between the period of division of the mother cells and the daughter cells. But how about the cousins? Have you looked at that? I'm just thinking it reminded me of this paper in Yeast. It's the work that Natalie Balavan made some years ago, which is a very interesting observation. And they had a beautiful Interesting observation, and they had a beautiful way of explaining it not through stochastic dynamics, but rather to strange attractor, and that's why. So, the so the sisters they are correlated, the cousins are correlated, but their time is not correlated with the ancestor before. Okay, we do rapidly. I think I know the paper you're talking about in East, and yeah, we do see also that the cousin are correlated. Hello, so Alexander Lila, that was a phenomenal work, really wonderful. I want to join your lab. I mean, it's really fantastic. It's just really fantastic. I think some of so the epigenetic memory, I guess, that you describe, or maybe it's not epigenetic in the biggest sense, it could be chromatin, it could be signaling network, it could be, you know, I mean, a priori, I would think that such memory, you would expect to see such memory. So I think the idea that every cell makes a stochastic decision is not, you know, is You know, is completely dissociated from the physical reality of a cell sharing that two daughter cells are sharing the same proteome and are sharing some memory of the epigenetic state. Now, to what extent that memory disappears, that's a good question. And you show that it lasts a long time, which I think is fantastic. I think it's fantastic. And B cells, we looked at a similar issue in B cells, and we also see an amazing correlation over six or seven generations. So six or seventh cousins have the same cell biological parameters. So anyway, that's just a short comment. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, it's not clear to me whether it's obvious like a To me, whether it's obvious, like I have the impression that if you want to diversify, you do need to remember, right? If you always do the same, then you family member. Yeah, we do see that the differentiation process is not totally deterministic, also. So you do need variation. So meaning that the family cannot be so precise, otherwise, you will not produce all these cells. Well, people have. Cells well, people have focused on the stochasticity of the process, but the reality is you say it has to be actually heritable, right? So it has to be very stable, otherwise you lose the diversification also. So I guess kind of related question, Leila, fantastic talk. So when you index the cells, right, you are staining on these classical markers. Do you remove, do you remove the Do you remove the antibodies? I mean, is there a way to resell the system or is it going to bias the way these cells are activated? I was particularly struck when you indexed them and you saw that there were kind of tracking based where they were at time zero, you know, going back to Alex version. Maybe you have extreme sensitivity to small differences and you expand them as you go in time. Yeah, it's possible. This is difficult. I know that, well, the antibodies internalize and recycle and so on, because when we are And recycle and so on because when we restain them, we did the control to see if you don't restain them, would you see the markers? And we don't. Yeah, so no, we didn't try to see whether what we were, we started to touch a little bit, but to change the concentration of the cytokines to see how it would affect this. And for now, it didn't affect the memory at least. It changed what the like how much the What the like how much the cells can divide, but the heterogeneity I don't think is so much changed, and the inheritance is kept. That's what I could say. From what I would say, you try to do a very quick p-stat staining after like literally 15 minutes from PPO, L6, L3, PSAT5, PSAT3, and so on, and see if based on the indexing that you have, they are responding differently very early on. Yeah, it would be nice to see if that explains. Would be nice to see if that that explains the differences between them. Yeah. The initial heterogeneity, basically. Yeah, nice suggestion. Okay, thank you, Nena. You have some echo with your with your microphone. So we're going to move to the last talk of the day in person here by Elen Rothenberg. I'm not sure how to change over. I'll be right up. Wonderful. Good.
