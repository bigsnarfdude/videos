All right, welcome back for our last talk of the afternoon. And the rest of the conference is dedicated to collaborative work. So we'll have Grant Budget tell us some more about the extended e-book. So thanks to the organizers for inviting me. It's been really fun so far, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the week. So I'm going to pick up where David left off. So David told us David left off. So, David told us about Coxer groups and weak order inversion sets. And at the very end of his talk, he introduced byclosed sets. So, I'm going to tell you a little bit more about those. Okay, so just as a reminder, biclosed set is a subset of a set of vectors. So, we're going to fix a set of vectors phi plus. And then we say that a subset of phi plus is biclosed. subset of phi plus is biclosed if it satisfies the following two properties. So for every triple of elements of phi plus, such that gamma is in the positive span of alpha and beta, or the cone over alpha and beta, then we ask that if alpha is in beta, if alpha is in B and beta is in B, then gamma is in B. So that condition is called being closed. And we ask that if alpha is not in B and beta is not in B, then gamma is not in B. not in B, then gamma is not in B. So that condition is called co-close because it's the same as the complement of B being closed. You could also call that movement. And these could be called cloppin sets. It's just history that led to that not being the case. Okay, so if we look and we take phi plus to be the set of positive roots for a cockster group, like David told us about, then the post-set of I post sets under containment is called the extended weak order of that cockster group. Order of that cost circuit. Okay, so let's look at an example. So I'm going to look at bioclosed sets for the positive roots of S3. So this is the positive roots of S3, these three vectors right here. And the one in the middle is the sum of the two on the outside. Okay, so we're going to check these conditions. So the first example of a bioclosed subset of those three vectors is all three vectors. So that satisfies both of those. So that satisfies both of those conditions. So V plus is biclosed. We can also look at just the two outer vectors, but that will not be bi-closed because it's not closed. Their sum, gamma, is not in the set, so it's not closed. We could look at a set consisting just of the middle vector, but that's not going to be co-closed because the two outer vectors have that vector in their cone. Have that vector in their cone, but are not in the set. Okay, but every other subset is bi close, and so here's the list of all of them. And we can look at the containment order on them, and you'll see it looks just like the weak order on this metric group, and that is indeed the case. So here's the weak order, here is the post-set of by closed sets, and here's the parade arrangement also. So you see these things are all very similar in shape, and David told us about the correspondence between. And David told us about the correspondence between these two things and briefly about this. So, the theorem that's going on here is a theorem of Matthew Dyer, which is that if you have a root system, then the inversion sets of elements of the Coxster group are exactly the finite biclosed sets. So if, in particular, your root system is finite, then actually these, oh, sorry, then that's all biclosed sets. And furthermore, that these biclosed sets are in bijection with regions. Spyclosets are in bijection with regions of the Cox der arrangement. Okay, so that's the finite setting. So let's look now at an infinite example. So this is the affine symmetric group and its root system. So this is S2 tilde. And it has infinitely many roots. It looks like this. Okay, and if we just apply Dyer's theorem, which is about finite by closed sets, then we see that we get the weak order on the affine symmetric group that looks like just two chains going off to infinity. Like just two chains going off to infinity. Here are two chains of biklos sets. And then here's the Coxster arrangement. So now, since this is an infinite system, we're not reaching outside of the Tietzcone. So the Tietzcone is only the bottom half of this picture, and we're unable to escape it by following the weak order or by only looking at finite hypostates. Okay, and here's just a comparison of what the weak orders look like for three different brain tube resistance. Okay, obviously the one on the right looks a little bit different than the one, the other two. So these two kind of look like circles. This one is just like two lines. So ideally we'd have a top. And that's what the extended recorder is doing for us. So we're going to look at all by closed sets instead of just finite by closed sets. And now we get a post set that looks like this. Okay, so what's going on here? So at the bottom, we have the empty set. As we go up this chains of blood. As we go up this chain to the left, we're adding more and more arrows on the left. And then in the limit, we hit this point in the middle where we have every arrow that's on the left and none of the arrows that are on the right. And then as we go past that point, now suddenly we have infinitely many arrows on the right and we have more and more as we go up. So until we reach the top of the post set, which is the full set, the full principle set. And similarly up there. Questions about why this looks like this? So you should imagine extended weak orders kind of like going around the root system in a circle. So just to clarify, if I'm going down from the topmost element, like towards that left chain, I'm deleting the bottom rightmost. Okay, cool. And then you would delete the second bottom rightmost. Okay. Other questions? Other questions? Okay, and then here's the comparison with the Cox arrangement this time. And now we have points corresponding to every region in the picture. So this one at the top corresponds to the big region at the top. And we have chains going towards this sort of limit point. And in this cycle plane arrangement, the sort of space between all of these lines that are kind of folding down this way and the lines that are folding up this way is infinitesimal. There's no actual points in there. Infinitesimal, there's no actual points in there. However, there's still a point in the extended weak order that corresponds to that thing. So somehow the extended weak order is allowing these sort of infinitely small regions to be included in the postet. And we really want those. And we actually have even worse things than just infinitely small regions. We have things that aren't regions at all. So it turns out these are actually really natural objects to include, because otherwise a lot of conjectures fail. Lot of conjectures fail. So, yeah, so somehow we do want these sort of weird, weirdly behaved objects to be interplaced. Wait, so did you say you do have kind of like a limit point there? Yeah, so there is a limit point, yeah. And what I'm saying is just that there's no, it's arguable whether there's actually a region there. Yeah. But there is a region. You want this to be a complete lattice. So you don't want one of those infinite chains going up the left-hand side to have a joint. Exactly, yeah. So if we didn't allow that thing to be included. So, if we didn't allow that thing to be included in the post-set, then this would not be a complete lattice. So, here it seems that the construction is the smallest complete lattice such that it contains the weak order and that is autodual with bias implementation. Okay. Yeah, that seems true. That's not true in general. Yeah, in general, there's more stuff in the middle than just limit points from the top and bottom. At bottom. Yeah. Yeah, uh it's just easiest to draw that postet in rank two where that is the case. So there's a separate limit point from the top and from the bottom? No, these sorry, this is the same limit point. What I was saying is in higher rank, you can have points that are not limit points from the bottom or the top. Okay, so now some generalities about extended recorder. So it's actually the subject of a lot of open conjectures. The subject of a lot of open conjectures. So, Matthew Dyer was the one who introduced extended week order. And he has a paper where he has just a whole section which just lists like 20 conjectures about it. So, you can take a look at that if you're looking for ideas of what to think about for extended weak order. But here's his two main conjectures, the oldest ones. So, I put this one first, even though it's called conjecture B, because it's probably the one we care about the most. And it says that the extended weak order of W is. is a complete lattice. So if you're more familiar with lattices than complete lattices, complete just means you have all these stepper bounds. Instead of just joins of two elements, you can take joins of arbitrarily many elements. Infinitely many elements. Infinitely many, yeah. And Diarrhea's conjecture A says that we kind of discussed this during David's talk yesterday, says that if you have a cover relation in extended weak order, that comes A correlation in extending order that comes from just adding a single root to hereby closed set. Okay, so we're going to talk about the progress on these conjectures so far. They're both open in general. So for Dyer's conjecture B, there's a theorem of Bjorner, which says that the finite biclosed sets, which is just the weak order, form a meat simulatus. So you can always take arbitrarily many meats as long. As long as you started out with finite by close sets. And in general, you can't take joints of finite by close sets to get finite by closed sets. You'll get rings of the thing infinite, usually. Okay, and then more recently, the theorem of Wei Zhao Wang is that the extended weak order for rank three affine cocksure groups are complete lattices. So rank three affine cocksure groups correspond to putting a tilde over rank three. correspond to putting a tilde over rank two finite Coxster groups. So A2 tilde in particular is like the affine symmetric group S3 tilde. Okay, and then even more recently David and I proved that extended equators include that as for all affine constraints. Is the lower one lower right click case, I guess, is known? Oh, right two? Oh, rank two? What you showed us on the board? Yeah, rank two, you could prove by looking at it. So this is a complete lattice. But all rank two, I mean, there's a like hyperbolic. Yeah, so in rank two, actually the extended recorder always either looks like this, exactly like this, or it's finite. Okay, so what does the join, what does the mean join look like? What does the meaning join look like? So, first of all, let me define the closure of a set of roots to be the minimal closed set containing them. Remember, closed meant closed under, if you ever have alpha, beta, and gamma, where gamma is in the cone over alpha and beta, then if alpha is in your set and beta is in your set, then gamma should be in your set. So we're going to take the minimal set that has that property. So basically, we look for every pair of roots where that fails, and we throw in the. And we just keep doing that until it's closed. Closed. So that's the closure. And then the way that you compute the join is you take the union of all of your biclosed sets, and in general, that won't be biclosed. It'll be co-closed. You can show that pretty easily. But it won't be closed. So what do we do? We take the closure, and that'll give us a closed set for sure, but you need to check that that's actually a bi-closed set. But it actually turns out that it is. And so that bi-closed set that you get by taking the union and then the closure is the join of your original list. The join of your original list. This is an affine type. And this is, our theorem is an affine type. If we knew this in general, it would be a, this is the last part. But this is what we expect the lattice closure, or the lattice join and meet to look like in general. And then the meet is the dual thing, so we can take the intersection of all of our sets and then take the interior, which will give us something that's definitely co-closed, but turns out to be biclosed. Okay, so that was about. So, what I was supposed to see for the convector is just to say that this is actually probably also more or less in order. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, so something to work on. Turns out it's a little bit hard. And if you could show that that formula on the right-hand side did give you a bi-closed set, that would be pretty quick than it was the drawing. Well, that's what it can't be smaller than drawing. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah, so it must be this. Right. So what you should do is corrupt those R light most. It is not necessarily exactly this because you might have a by close set that's slightly bigger and there might be a unique minimal byclose set that's bigger than you even if you aren't by close to begin with. But that's funny. If the right of the guy is by close, then it must be the joint. Yes, I agree. Yeah, that part I agree. Yeah. Exactly. So yeah, sorry, other questions about that? Alright, so the other conjecture was Nyer's conjecture A. And I think the main progress on this was, okay, so David and I proved this, but Dyer has already proven this in an unpublished work. So there is at least one proof that you can read. And so, yeah, we've also proved this for affine. So we actually used the same technique to prove both things. So it seems like a very Things. So it seems like a very powerful technique, and we are very happy to tell you about it if you're in our group and you want to try to use it. So it's something called suitable orders and clean arrangements. Okay, so here's an open problem. Can we prove Dyer's conjectures for a new Coxster group? So we did the affine Coxer groups. The next, maybe, most natural infinite Coxster group to look at will be the rank 3 universal Coxster groups. David told us about this last time. And here's a picture. And here's a picture. But can we prove that the standard week of this thing is a lattice? Can we prove that cover relations are given by adding a single element? I'll give you some more conjectures about it later if I get to it. Yeah, so questions about that before I talk about more explicit. Why is that for the next step? Because every other Coxer group you write down is less symmetric. So other than the affine break-three Coxer groups, the other ones, they're hyperbolic and sort of weird. And they're sort of weird. This one, it seems, like, the easiest one to study first because it's highly symmetric, it has connections to number theory. I don't know. If you look at it, it's just like when you traverse regions, it corresponds to like going down a tree. That's no relation. There's no relation. It's simple. In these arguments, we are constantly making inductive reductions to reflection subgroups. So, what goes down when we go to reflection subgroup? So, what goes down when we go to the reflection subgroup? Well, one thing is the embedding dimension. So, the next natural thing to do, sort of thing is, so it's natural to think about: can we do all the rank 3 cases? We've done the rank 3 affine cases. Well, you can decide what you think is the next hardest rank 3 case after the affines, but I think it's that one. Do you have a sense of what the affine flow sets are for this? Yeah, so our conjecture is that they're exactly what we call the separable sets. So, they correspond exactly to the regions, is the conjecture. For some definition of regions. For some definition of region. Yeah, so you need to allow these infinitely small regions as the ships. No, so this is like the Poincaré disk model. So actually what we're looking at is we're kind of like looking down onto the hyperplay arrangement. And there's stuff behind this circle. So outside this circle, there's more stuff. Circle. So outside the circle, there's more stuff, and that's the hard part. So you can set it the same separable set. That's the conjecture for rank 3. Not true in rank 4. We have immediate counterexamples in affine rank 4. So there's more separable sets now. There are more bikeless sets than separable sets. All separable sets are bikeless. All the other. All the bikeless rats. And we want to know all of them, yeah. All of them, yeah. Other questions? Yeah, so if you only look at the separable ones, you don't get a lattice starting in rank four. So you can actually show that the separable ones do form a lattice in rank three. So it's all sorts of different various things, but it seems like bicolus is the most natural thing, and they just happen to coincide in rank three. Okay, so I'm gonna move on to some more explicit combinatorics. So the first thing, So, the first thing David and I did when we were thinking about this was we worked out exactly what the byclosets are in affine cluster groups. So we did this for all affine types, but in types A, B, C, D, we are able to give actually very explicit combinatorial models in terms of orderings of the integers. So, type affine A is the same thing as the affine symmetric group. So, David told us about that yesterday. And there's like an option. And there's like an off by one thing with indices, which is annoying, but is sort of irrelevant. Okay. So here's a problem. So we know this, this is an open problem. So we know that we have these explicit combinatorial models for the element, for the byclos sets. And in particular, we know that the byclosed sets are determined by a finite amount of data. So can we find an algorithm that will compute the mutant adjoin of two byclosets? The formula I showed you earlier. The formula I showed you earlier is not really an algorithm because when you do this closure, you might have to add infinitely many roots to your set. And that's not really something a computer can do. So you need to somehow figure out a shortcut to that. But that might be an interesting place to start if you're not used to MicroSets, sort of thinking about it very explicitly, how do you actually compute things. And it might be useful just to have a a program that can do this. So that's one of our problems. We have a list of seven in the notes if you. Problems. We have a list of seven in the notes if you want to take a look at the full list. Okay, so let me work out what this combinator is looks like for affine permutations. Wait, was the minor? What time did I say wrong? Late. Late, okay. So the affine symmetric group is a group of bijections satisfying these conditions. So when we add i, or when we add into the input, it's the same thing as adding in the output. And we have some second condition, a normalization condition. Have some second condition, a normalization condition. What that does is lets us recover the fine permutation from its one-line notation. So we can also encode an affine permutation via window notation. And what that does is we just take a list of in consecutive things from the one-line notation. So for instance, this is the identity. And so 0, 1, 2 is three consecutive things. And so that's a valid window. That tells us we're looking at the identity. 1, 2, 3 would also work. Here, I could take 1, 0, 2, and that would be a window. Or I could take 0. And that would be a window, or it could take 024, and so on. Okay, so that's affine permutations. That's what the group looks like. So, what does the extended recorder look like? And so the object that we construct it with is something called a translation invariant total order. So I'll just call that a Tito, which is the acronym for that. Okay, so this is a total order on the integers so that i is less than j, if and only if i plus it is less than j plus it. Okay, so here's just two examples. So each of these. So each of these Titos is comprised of one or more blocks. Okay, so what do I mean by block? This thing is one block. This thing between the dot dot dots is one block. And this is another block. So a block is a subinterval that's isomorphic to the integers under their order. Order isomorphic to the integers under their usual order. And there's one more piece of data that we usually like to know about, or two more pieces of data that we usually know about. Like to know about, or two more pieces of data that we usually like to know about the blocks. One is whether they're waxing or waning. So, waxing, which is a word that just means getting bigger, waxing occurs if when we look at a number in our block, if that number is less than itself plus n, so one is less than four, which is one plus three. So, this is waxing. Waning is when you're less than yourself at minus n. So, here, four minus three. Minus 3 is 1, which is over here. So this one was waning. So it turns out that that data is independent of which number you check. And the other data is the size of the block, which is the number of residue classes it contains mod n. So this one has size 3, this one has size 1, and that one has size 2. A block is a sub-interval that's order isomorphic to the integers. So it's what's between the dot dot dots. Other questions? Okay, so we can use window notation to encode these TDOs as well. So here's one of the Titos from the previous slide. And what we do is we take each And what we do is we take each block and give it its own window. So, here, this was a block of size one, so I'm going to give it a window that has one element in it. So, I just pick any one element and I put it in the window. Over here, this is a block of size two, so I'm going to give it a window with two elements. So, I'm going to pick any two consecutive elements, and I can put them in my window. And that encodes the block. Okay, so there's one more piece of data, which is whether you're waxing or waning, and we encode that by just underlining the waning. And we encode that by just underlining the waning blocks. So the only difference between these two window notations is I've underlined this block right here. And that tells us that, so it's still 3, 2, so we know 3 and 2 appear consecutively. But because it's waning, we know that the next number is 0 here, which is 3 minus 3, whereas up here, the next number is 6, which is 3 plus 3. So you can fully recover the original Tito from this finite amount of data, which is what I get what is referring to. Referring to it. Questions about the windows? Oh, I have a question. On your bottom right example, if you were trying to figure out how the five comes before the three, how would you... Oh, is that two plus three? Yeah, it's two plus three. So you would look, you would see, oh, five is congruent to two, and it's underlined, so it should be after that. Likewise, right? Okay, so it turns out that there's a well-defined weak order on TDOs. So we can find an inversion of a TDO to be a pair ij, where i is less than j in the usual ordering, but the tito puts them out of order. So j is less than i in the tito. And then the weak order on tito is just is the ordering by containment of inversion sets, just like permutations. And here's a picture of what this looks like for the This looks like for the T DOS that are translation invariant worth n equals 2. So you'll see it's not exactly the thing we were looking at before. It looks very similar, we kind of have two chains going up, but then there's this sort of diamond stuck in the middle. Okay, so this lattice is not exactly the same thing as the extended recorder. What is true is that the extended recorder is a quotient lattice of this lattice. So I'll sort of state this in two ways. One is that it's a lattice quotient. I'll sort of state this in two ways. One is that it's a lot of sposset, but we can also think of the extended recorder as a sub-posette. So let's say a Tigo is real if it has no waning block of size one. So in the window, that means you should not have a window of size one that's underlined. Okay, in that case, this quotient map restricts to an isomorphism. So if I look at this picture, here was the extended weak order, here is the post-set of TOs. So the quotient is just sort of taking this diamond and scratching it down to a point over there, too. A point over there, too. And then instead, we could also look at the subposet of the left of the real T DOS. So, what I've done here is I've just sort of deleted the three T DOS that have a block that's underlined of size one. And then these three as well. And then what's left is extremely. So it's nice to compute with these things using these windows. They're pretty quick to write them. And so here's just an example of what a join would look like. Here's just an example of what a join would look like. So we can take the join of this sequence of affine permutations, or we can think of them as ketos. And what I'm doing is I'm moving zero farther and farther to the left. And these things do not have a join in the weak order, but they do have a join in the extended weak order. And in the extended weak order, we end up with a Tito where zero is kind of in a block all by itself. So everything here is congruent to zero, one, two. 0, 1, 2, and everything else is still on the right. And then, in terms of the Haas diagram, what we've done is we've gone up this chain, and then when we took the join, we kind of took the limit of that chain, and it was that limit time. Okay, I think it's been about 20 minutes. Maybe somebody timing me, I'm not sure. Oh, wait, no, I thought it was a 40, okay. Wait, no, I thought it was a 40. Okay, okay, I see. Okay, I have 20 more minutes of talking, so that would be wonderful, but I definitely can do it. I think I just have no idea what time I started at, now that I'm thinking about it. What time did I start? It's probably like 25. We go until 3. Okay, perfect. Or a little after. Okay, so let me talk a bit about cover relations. So the lower cover. Cover relations. So the lower covers of a Tito correspond to pairs A and B, so that A is less than B, and the Tito puts B right before A. So that's a cover relation in the Tito. So as an example, if I want to figure out the lower covers of this TDO right here, I'm going to look for an adjacent pair that's out of order. So for instance, this 3 and 2. And then the thing that is covered by it is sort of what you get by swapping. Sort of what you get by swapping it. So we kind of swap the 2 and 3 here. We also have to swap the 5 and the 6 and the 0 and the negative 1, or we keep it together. But that gives us the lower cover. So that's one of the lower covers. And there's only one other lower cover of this genome. So here's another one. So we have another pair that's out of order, the 4 and the 1. And we swap them, and we're forced to swap, we're forced to reverse this whole block because this whole block has size 1. And so we end up with. And so we end up with this T D where we've removed the underline from the one. Okay, and so now once we know that the lower covers correspond to these pairs that are out of order, we can write down an arc diagram to encode sort of these lower covers. And if you've seen arc diagram sort of permutations, this is exactly analogous. So what we do is we look at each of these pairs that are out of order in JSON. Pairs that are out of order and adjacent. So we do 2 and 3 first. So what we do is we're going to draw the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in a circle, and then the arcs are going to correspond to each of these pairs. So for the pair 2, 3, I'm going to start at 2 and go to 3. And so that's one of the arcs. Okay, so for the pair 1, 4, I'm going to start at 1, and then I'm going to go clockwise around the circle. And as I go by each number, I'm allowed to go either inside that number. I'm allowed to go either inside that number or outside that number. And the way I decide is that when I go, when I approach the 2, I look at where 2 is in my Tito, and if it's to the right of where I started, then I go inside. And if it was to the left, I would go outside. So 2 is to the right, so I go inside. 3 is to the right, so I go inside. And then we end at, once we are back around the circle, we're viewing this as a 4 now. And so we're ending at 4, which is this number. And so we're ending at 4, which is this number. Okay, so in that way we get a number. And it turns out that when you do this, the arcs you get don't cross each other. So we call it a cyclic non-crossing arc diagram. And also, every diagram you get by writing down a set of arcs that don't cross each other and also don't share start points and don't share endpoints, every single one of those diagrams is a diagram you get by looking at the lower covers of the TF. Covers of the T2. Okay, so it sounds like there's going to be a bijection there, but actually it's a little bit subtle in this case. So if you're used to sort of labelings of cover relations by joining irreducibles and semi-distributed lattices, it's a little bit different for infinite lattices. So we don't exactly have canonical join representations always. Even though this lattice is completely simulated derivative. So here's So here's sort of the technical condition that's going on here. So we say an element of a postet is widely generated. So if the element is y, then it's widely generated if for all x less than y, there exists a y prime, which is covered by y, so that x is less than or equal to y prime. Okay, this is like a thing that's definitely obviously true in a finite poset. But it is not always true in an infinite poset. I mean, you can imagine like the real I mean, you can imagine like the real numbers is a poset, and 0 is less than or equal to 1, but there's nothing covered by 1. So 1 is not widely generated in the real numbers. And this term comes from the lattice of torsion classes where it coincides with torsion classes being generated by a wide subcategory. Okay, so theorem, there's a unique, widely generated T-DO having each cyclic non-crossing arc diagram. Each cyclic non-crossing arc diagram. So, furthermore, this is the minimal TDO with that diagram. So, you might have multiple T DOs that have the same diagram. But if you have that diagram and you're not widely generated, you can go down farther and then eventually you'll be widely generated. And if you are widely generated, then you have a canonical join representation, which you can read off from the diagram in exactly the way you would guess if you know what that means. But I'm not going to be into that. Okay, so let me just give an example of a title that's not widely generated so we can see what these look like. Generated, so we can see what these look like. So, if I just take three separate blocks with n equals three, so I have like everything congruent to one right here, everything congruent to two, and everything congruent to three, there are no lower covers of this at all because no adjacent pairs are out of order. However, this is not the identity Tito, it's not the usual ordering on the integers, so So if I had claimed that there was a bijection between arc diagrams and Tito's, then I'd be wrong because this has the empty arc diagram, but it's not the trivial order. Okay, questions about web regenerator. This is a new thing for everybody. I'm like 95% sure. Okay, sorry, except Paula. So the cyclic arc diagram for this would look like? It would be empty because there's no lower cars. So, yeah. Any other questions? In an extended week order, every element is widely generated? No, I mean, this is an example of one that isn't. Oh, okay, because I was thinking you had more T-toes, but no, okay, I lost track. So, yeah, this is a Tito. So, yeah, this is a Tito that is not what they generated. And it's also a real Tito, so it's in the extended recorder. Also, just even in the infinite dihedral group, you have like these geometric. Yeah, exactly. So these limit points in the ring two case are not weby generated. Other questions? Good questions? So here's an open problem. So, here's an open problem related to these arc diagrams. So, the problem is: is there a limit-shaped arc diagram for non-widely generated Titos? So, if a Tito is widely generated, you have this arc diagram that fully encodes it, and you're good. But can we somehow use arc diagrams to understand non-widely generated Tito's? So, if I'm thinking about these limit points in rank two, the ones we were looking at, we took this limit of Tito's earlier. This is the exact same limit. I've just written it as window notations. Window notations. Here are the arc diagrams for each of the T DOS in the sequence that was limiting to this guy. And you'll see that kind of they're spiraling around more and more and more. So there's kind of a limit shape to these diagrams. And I don't know exactly what the best way to draw this would be. I mean, if you're interested in this problem, then you can be the one that decides that. But I kind of see, like, oh, there's some sort of infinite spiral here, and maybe that's somehow encoding this T-dome. This T DOM. Circle? You would need to know the start and end point, but you could draw it as a circle, I guess. Yeah, and so the question is, is there actually a consistent way of doing this? I looked at this example and like one other example. So I don't know what exactly this pattern is. And if somebody wants to think about it more, I think it's really interesting. So that's a potential problem. Any questions? So, in this case, the join is the arc diagram with two circles, right? One on the outside starting at one and one on the inside starting at two? No, the arc diagram of this guy is empty because there's no lower covers. So, if you write out the full Tito for this, you just have one block that's increasing and another block that's increasing. Okay. Yeah, it's a it's very strange if you're used to finite stuff. Strange if you're used to finite stuff, which we are. So here's another open problem. So that was some combinatorics for F9 type A. So David and I have these models in types B, C, and D, but really no other combinatorics at all. So if somebody wants to work out more of these combinatorics, like maybe doing arc diagrams or something like that, that would be cool. And I've written them in this sort of And I've written them in this order because this is probably the order from easiest to hardest for the dark deck. So, yeah, take that what you will. So, for instance, if you want to start with affine type C, then the extended recorder for that thing is a quotient of, if you look at, instead of TOS, you look at TOS that satisfy i less than j if and only if negative j is less than negative i. So kind of translation invariant and negation invariant for reversing. Reversing. Then those things have a quotient which is extended for types in the multiple. And then here's going to be my favorite problem, I guess. So pretty much everything that I've showed you so far has fit this pattern, which is that everything you can do with weak order extends to weak order. But we had this thing with the canonical joint representations being restricted to widely. Being restricted to widely generated elements and things like this, there's a lot of weird subtleties that happen when you're looking at these infinite postsets. And I think it's an interesting part of this process to figure out what those subtleties are. And so one of the problems, this is problem number one on our list, is can we find more examples of this phenomenon where you take something you can do with recorder and do it for extended record? So if you've done something. So, if you've done something that is related to weak order, which I think something like 50% of the people in this room have done, so you might consider what does it look like for extending weak order? And maybe it's interesting. Okay, so I have one more example, which an example of this slogan. So, this is joint work with Colin, and we call it the Affine Tamari Lattice. It's the sub-postet of extended. It's the subpost set of extended weak order consisting of the 312 avoiding real Titos. And it can be equivalently described using the following objects, which might look familiar. So we have 312 avoiding Titos. We have translation invariant binary trees, which look like this. We have regions of the affine Tamari fan. We have vertices of a type D ossohedron. We have type D triangulations. And so there's like bijections between all those things that are all very nice and, you know. Things that are all very nice and are exactly what you would guess they would be from thinking about finite binary trees and Mari Lattice. And it's very pretty. So this is an example of what you can get by thinking about how things should extend to extend it. And here's the PASA diagram. So the vertices are labeled by the real through on two of odding titos. And you see it's an association. And you see, it's an associahedron. So, this is a type D associahedron, but it's D3, so it's the same as A3. So, this is the association that is the most famous association. And there's more problems in the notes, if you're interested. Also, some other perspectives on bi-closed sets. So, another very important problem is the relationship with the lattice of torsion classes for pre-projected algebras. Dyer has other conjectures. Dyer has other conjectures. A very useful perspective for actually proving these theorems is to look at the postet of quasi-regions, which is like the post-set of regions view on weak order, but for extended weak order. So that's described in the notes. And from that perspective, you can talk about shards and how they relate to complete joint irreducibles. And there's a nice story there in affine type A, and it's not, it's open whether it generalizes. And then also, by close sets for S infinity are interesting as a toy model. That's something that's. Is a toy model that's in the middle. But with that, we'll be good. Any questions? Are there other leaders of the non-aligned group that you think deserve to have a mathematical object standard? Yeah, so for semi-distributivity, so for things like finite type of line arrangements, it's equivalent to satisfying like a certain, like you describe the closure for the joint with like a certain extra property you have. So it's not just like the closure of the union, but you can take like the union minus the intersection, take the closure of that, and then add the intersection back in. Had the intersection back in? Oh, um, wow, actually, I haven't seen that in a very long time, and I don't remember if I ever thought about that in the context of Extended Recorder. That's a good question. Yeah, yeah, maybe. So, yeah, I was wondering if that was a formula possible that works in Extendable Recorder, and if that's the one that's. Yep, it's entirely possible. I haven't thought about it. How much of the Safine Tamari lattice lives in the Jeetscode? Oh, yeah, good question. So, it's actually color-coded. Actually, color-coded. So, the dark blue is the part in the teeth count. So, we have to actually add new stuff by thinking about extended recording. And in general, you really have to, so like these things actually are all correspond to these infinitely small regions. But in general, you even have to include these things that don't correspond to region at all. So, it's like really an extended recorder, sort of you have a count of how much is. I think we haven't counted that. I'm not sure. It might be like the number of things in the cheat scope is like half the type B Catalan number. Oh, is that right? And then the whole number is like a type D Catalan number. So so in that case it seems that elements that are in a phase that's maximal phase that contains one, two, three sort of video. Yeah, I'm not sure if that's always true. It might be. Question, yeah. What was the generality for the outline type tomorrow? This was uh it was tomorrow, so it was just for cyclically oriented. I do have other things. I do have other things, but I'll be talking about it later. Oh, you said there's a connection between the rank three proxy group and the universal one and number theory. What is this? Oh, it's like the fairy tree. Oh, okay. I see. Have you studied concurrences on these types? Yeah, so I mean, in African type A, yeah, so there's a nice description in terms of forcing of arcs, which is pretty much what you would guess it would be. Maybe not the first thing you would guess it would be, but it's probably the second thing you would guess it would be. And yeah, but I've only done half my type A, so that's definitely an open question in general. Okay, so we have a short coffee and break and then group discussions here.
