It's more general. Okay, so really glad to give this second. You probably had enough of me at my third slide of the previous talk, but now more. So what I'll actually talk about is, I realize that they're sending the title, not really ergodic theory, but like I will introduce some notions which are central in the study of ergodic theory of quantum market. Study of ergodic theory of quantum microevolutions and try to understand a little bit of properties related to these. Okay, so the notions that I have in mind are recurrence and transience. Okay, so I don't know how many people, so I try to avoid the comparison with classical market chains, but if you have it in mind, it will help a lot, I think. Will help a lot, I think. If you don't have them in mind, I hope you will still understand some. Okay, so we start with the, well, the definition of, well, it's actually a semi-group of quantum Markov maths because it also holds for discrete time evolutions, which are also known as cascades sometimes. So we have a separable Hilbert space, and we have a semi-group of maps indexed by either like continuous time. By either like continuous time, so the positive semi-line or the natural number. And what we ask from them is to be linear, completely positive, normal, or weakly star continuous. So continuous with respect to the topology induced by the predual, so the trace class operators, and unital. So they map the identity into the identity. And this is what it's known as Markov maps. While the predeal acting on states, it's usually known. Redual acting on states, it's usually known as quantum channel. We want the semi-group property, and then in discrete time, actually, these maps will be powers of a single quantum Markov map, while in continuous time, we will ask for a weak continuity of the map that sends time to the elements of the semi-group. Okay, actually, what I Okay, actually, what I'm going to present, so I chose them to act on B of H, okay, the old algebra of bounded operator on a Hilbert space. But actually, all these facts, well, some of these notions can be defined for semigroups acting on general von Neumann algebra, while some facts I'm presenting actually hold for semigroups acting on atomic von Neumann algebra, which are von-Norman algebras of this. Norman algebras of this form. So basically, it's a direct sum of factors of B of H's that comes from a decomposition of the Hilbert space into an orthogonal sum of orthogonal subspaces. And the indices, of course, run in a denumerable set, okay? Because we assume H to be separable. So just to give you an idea, are like block diagonal operators. And this is nice, this framework, why? Nice this framework, why? Because it encodes the, let's say, the classical framework of quantum mechanics, the original one where you have A being B of H, where alpha is taken as a single element, so you have a single index. Or if you consider this H alpha as one dimensional, so basically you're fixing an orthonormal basis, what you are considering are diagonals. Considering our diagonal operators, okay, which we've seen in a certain sense correspond to classical random variables. It's a commutative algebra. And semigroups acting on this kind of algebra, so L infinity of V, are classical Markov chains, both in continuous and discrete time. So actually, this framework allows to treat the two instances at the same time. But there will be some differences in the. But there will be some differences in the quantum case, which I'll try to point out. Okay, so the first notion is the notion of positive recurrence space, and it's defined as the supremum of all the supports of the invariant spaces. Then we have, so in a certain sense, it's the maximal space that contains some equilibrium of the thing. Equilibrium of the C. Then we have the transient space, which is the closed span of all those vectors in the Hilbert space, such that the integral over time of the semigroup applied to the projection on that vector integrated with DMT. Well, DMT just writing for ENCODE the two instances, continuous time and discrete time. So this will be actually a series in discrete time and an integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure in continuous time. In continuous time. So basically, this integral defines an operator which is a bounded linear operator on H. Okay, this is a little bit abstract, but I'll comment on it. So if we have a state rho, then the trace of rho against t, so the semi-group at time t applied to the projection onto v, is actually the probability of finding the system in V, in the one-dimensional subspace. So we can assume that V is normalized. So we can assume that V is normalized in the one-dimensional subspace described by V at time t. And again, we identify, in a certain sense, projections with events. So if we have that a vector satisfies this definition, actually what happens is that this operator goes to zero weakly star. So in a certain sense, the probability that the system will be at time t in that will hit. Time t in that will hit that vector decays in time and decays in time actually in a uniformly integrable way. Okay, so this is quite technical, but I think I will manage hopefully to explain you the meaning, why it's important to have this definition. First of all, well, for people which know the classical theory, because it's the right definition for, let's say, for having this as a general. For having this as a generalization of the classical setting, but there are like other reasons. Okay, if the dimension of H is finite-dimensional, actually T has a simpler expression. So it's all those vectors such that this goes to z. Okay, here we don't need to care about norms. So it's known as the decaying space, and this exhausts the whole universe. So we have a bit with equilibria. There is always an invariance. There is always an invariant state in finite dimensions, so R plus is non-trivial, and then we have a decaying space, which contains all the observables that we will not be able to detect anymore with time. In infinite dimensions, actually, what one can say is that the positive recurrent space and the transient space are orthogonal spaces, but they don't fill the whole space. So the direct space. Space. So the direct sum will might be strictly contained in the Hilbert space. So one defines the Nader-Carrent space as the orthogonal of the direct sum of the previous two. So basically fills the space. Okay, so these are the main notions and I want to show you some properties that they have. I will include for the sake of bravity all the references at the end. So the first So, the first notion is accessibility to take care of. So, if we have two spaces, close-up spaces of H, V and W, we say that V can reach W if there exists a vector in V and a time such that the operator obtained taking the projection onto W, applying the semi-group at time t, is a diagonal element corresponding to V, which is non-zero. Uh, corresponding to v, which is non-zero, it's strictly positive. Actually, this is maybe more intuitive. So, the system starts in the state supported on v. Again, v is normalized. We evolve it, and there is a time for which this hits the projection corresponding to the subspace W. Okay, so this it will reach W in this sense. If we measure W at the time, there is a non-trivial probability non-zero probability that we will obtain outcome, positive outcome. obtain outcome positive outcome okay so the first property is that we can access our plus and our nodes so positive and non-recurrent spaces from the transient subspace but no other arrows are allowed here okay so this is the first important feature in the study of like evolutions moreover Moreover, there is another notion which is the notion of enclosure. I present it in this form because it's more intuitive, but it's strictly related to the subharmonic projections that Franco spoke about earlier. So an enclosure is a closed subspace such that we cannot exit it. So the evolution cannot leave it. So the orthogonal subspace is not accessible from. Such space is not accessible from it. So, if a state is supported in V, then the support of the evolution of the state at any time will still be in V. And this is important aside from the study of the evolution, the accessibility, because it simplifies the study of the evolution, because it breaks the semi-group in simpler pieces. Because if our state is supported in V, we don't need the whole semi-group to describe the evolution, but only a semi-group. Describe the evolution, but only a semi-group restricted to Vina Circle. And an enclosure is said to be minimal if we cannot find a proper enclosure which is contained in it. So basically, any enclosure in it, it's either the trivial one, so the zero subspace, or the whole subspace. In this sense, it's an unbreakable bit. So every vector will fill the whole space in a sense. Okay, so the previous observation tells us that The previous observation tells us that our plus and our node are enclosed, okay, while t is not. Okay, then what about minimal enclosure? Well, there are some results that tells us that we can actually, so minimal enclosures are minimal bricks. Okay, Air Plus can be decomposed always in a sum of orthogonal minimal enclosures, and each one of them is the support of an extremal invariant state. So, what does extreme investment? invariant state. So what does extremal mean that, well, we know that invariant states are a convex set. Okay, if we take any convex combination of invariant state, we still have an invariant state. And extremal ones are those that cannot be broken into a convex combination of different states. Okay, they can only be written in terms of themselves. Their minimal breed. In general, this decomposition is not unique. And this is a quantum feature because for A quantum feature because for classical Markov semigroups, you can find minimal communication classes of states. And there is a unique way of decomposing the state space. In this case, this is not true. And this corresponds to the fact that the set of invariant states is not a simplex, which was something mentioned by Retidoux earlier. So if we take, for instance, two states, the probabilities on this space are convex. Space are convex combinations of the deltas. Okay, so the deltas are extremal elements, and every state can be expressed uniquely as a convex combination of these two. If we consider instead two degrees of freedom, but in the quantum world, we have the block sphere. And every state aside the identity can be expressed in a unique way as a convex combination of orthogonal extremal states, which are pure states. Extremal states, which are pure states. Okay, here it's a geometrical view. So basically, there is only one diameter, except from the center of the sphere, that passes through each point. So mixed states are the interior of the sphere. And the two extremal states in the spectral decomposition are the points on the surface of the sphere. But basically, if we change state, there will be different orthonormal base. So there is not a orthonormal base. So there is not a unique, there are not two states that decompose every single. And the same happens here for invariant states in the quantum case. And this reflects in the fact that one can decompose into minimal enclosure R plus. So basically communication between these such spaces is not allowed. Plus we cannot break them into further pieces. But this decomposition is not unique. So we can find multiple ones. Unique. So we can find multiple ones which are not compatible. They're not a refinement one of each other. What about the non-recurrent space? So this is another difference with respect to the classical theory. So if we have an enclosure here, then one fact that holds is that also the orthogonal subspace restricted intersected with the null recurrent space is an enclosure. Current space is an enclosure. So we can always decompose it into sums of enclosures. So the communication is not allowed. In the classical case of Markov chains, again, you can decompose the set of states into communication classes also in this case. And it's a unique decomposition of minimal bricks. In this case, actually, there are examples in Actually, there are examples in which there are no minimal enclosures. So you can always decompose each enclosure in a smaller enclosure and you keep on going to the infinite. So this is another difference with the classical case. Plus, this true. So this decomposition does not hold for the transient space. So this is another difference between positive recurrence. Between positive recurrent, non-recurrent, and transient space. And it also points out why it's important that the definitions are of the form I present. Okay, actually, how much time? Five minutes. I'll probably finish earlier, but I'm sure nobody will protect. So another feature of now non-recurrent space and tangient space is an analogy in infinite dimensions. Analogy in infinite dimensions of what I call like decaying space. So these are, and in the classical literature, a similar result is called, is known as like the theorem of flow states or something similar. So basically, if we take any normalized vector in the direct sum of narrative ion space and transient space, and we look at, so this is the only ergodic thing we'll see today. thing we'll see today. So if we take like the ergodic mean, which is in a certain sense the average time spent up to time t in v by the system. So this will converge to zero with L star. Okay, so in a certain sense, the average time spent by the system in each one-dimensional vector in this subspace will go to zero. Will go to zero. For the transient phase, it should be true that this holds even without the average. But for the narrow current space, I actually don't know how to prove it. In the classical case, it should hold instead. And the last thing I want to present is again another difference between non-recurrent space, positive recurrent space on one side, and transient space on the other. On one side and transient space on the other, which is like a note here and flavor, but it's something much weaker. So it concerns conserved quantities and symmetries. So if we assume that the whole space is recurrent, so we don't have any transient component, then if we take a self-adjoint bounded Self-adjoint bounded operator, which is preserved by the semi-group, this means that the average of that observable is conserved along the whole evolution. But in general, since we are dealing with dissipative systems, that doesn't have any further consequences in general. But in this particular case, where the semi-group is recurrent, what one has is that actually actually every bounded and measurable function of our operator, so this is defined using spectral calculus, is preserved. So basically every statistic of our observable is preserved. So basically the distribution of the observable. Plus, if we have a conserved quantity, we can find a group of symmetries which commute with the dynamic. Which commute with the dynamic. So, in a certain sense, the dynamic is covariant with respect to these symmetries. And this is just the unitary group generated by the observable. So, if we apply the semi-group to an element which gets transformed by this unitary group, it's the same as first applying the semi-group and then applying the C method. And this is in general not true. But in general, we don't have the converse. It's not true that if we have symmetries, in general, there is a corresponding conserved quantity. So there are some words related to these that distinguish strong symmetries and weak symmetry. And these are strong symmetries. And with this, I will conclude just mentioning an incomplete history of all these. History of all these results, which were initiated in the 70s, actually, as far as I know. Of course, this is why it's incomplete. I might be forgetting some people. And so subharmonic projections and the positive recurrence space were appeared in some works in the 70s by Evans and Oegron. Then transience and recurrence was introduced and deeply studied by Frank, Orlando Regoy. By Franco, Rolando Rebugedo, and Veronica in the 20s. The decomposition of R plus in various forms appeared in works by Baumgartner Narnofer in the Physical Community, Finite Dimensions in 2012, Rafaela Carbon and Jan Potra, and Anna Yenchova and Pets. So they derived it actually these results in a completely different setting. So they were So they were concerned by statistical problems. The study of the narrow current space was further conducted by me and Rafael. And then the ergodic theory has infinitely many names. So we have Frigerio Verri, Emmanuel Esuel, Damiano, Chirillo, and many others. So with this, I will conclude. Well, thank you very much. I will hope we well, thank you very much. Sorry. That's a good question. I hope someone can help you because, like, what's a good reference? There are some notes by Frank Rolando, maybe on. By Frank Me and Rolando, maybe on qualitative behavior for studying this topic, like ergodic theory and long-term. But there's not an easy reference. Yes, that's the problem. Yes, sometimes things are scattered in literature, so it's really hard to find a reference. Let's thank our speaker.
