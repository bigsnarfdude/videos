This thing runs well. I don't know if they're listening, but let's see. So integration and differentiation for physiological group widths. So the title that I've written here is very general sounding, but actually what I want to do is something much more specific than this. So really I should have put here some very special. I theological difference. And of course, they're very special because they're the ones relevant to Poisson geometry. They're the ones that appear when, say, you have a non-integral algebra, and you look at Look at what I like to call the fundamental groupoid, the alder royal. It's also oftentimes called the Weinzang groupoid. So this specific group point is really the one I care about. I want to understand not the sort of geometry of this object and the non-interjection. Object in the non-integral case. And so, what we should take away from this discussion is that these are a very special kind of diffeological groupoid, and that the diffeological structure on this groupoid is actually rich enough to recover the algebraid. So, this is something that's not really obvious at all, that you can recover an algebraid out of the typiology. Out of the diffeology. If you're sort of familiar with the sort of stacky language, which I guess many people in this audience likely are, you can think of one stacks as kinds of sheaves of group points roughly. And of course, you have higher things if you really are into that kind of stuff, right? To just sheaps of infinity for points. But there's ways of passing from higher things to lower things. And there's really something. There's really something at the bottom here, which you could think of as zero stacks, which is just sheets of stacks. So in a way, this talk is about stacks, because it's about the theological spaces which live inside of this setting. And so the results that I'm going to talk about is essentially that. I'm going to talk about is essentially that, while you might have heard previous talks yesterday, for example, you can take a non-integrable algebraid and try to integrate it with the two-groupoid. It was briefly mentioned yesterday by Mikkel. And then the question is essentially, if, rather than trying to integrate it by two-group way, I just truncate it all the way down to zero, or well, I truncate it actually to. Well, I truncate actually to here. But I live inside of the diffeological universe, and I still recover the algebra. So that's what I want to talk about. So we have this nice theory of integration and differentiation, right, for For Lie groups in Lie algebras. This nice differentiation functor that goes from Lie groups to Lie algebras. And I'll just write it like this, integration functor that goes from Lie algebras to Lie groups. And these things have a lot of really nice properties. For example, the identity of the idea of the idea of the For example, the identity functor on, so it should be the object, is actually naturally isomorphic to taking the derivative of the integral. And we also have a nice property that if you take the integral of the derivative, there's a canonical canonical natural so this is not a natural isomorphism but this is a canonical natural transformation to identity functions this is basically kind of least second theorem and this is and this is the sort of essential surjectivity of the d of the integration or sorry the differentiation Differentiation functions. So these properties basically mean that these guys are a nice adjoint pair of functors. So actually these are like a unit and co-unit for these two functors. And then of course the observation is that if we try to go to Lee algebra to the group points, we can't successfully, there's no way to successfully extend these functors. These functors, unless we restrict to, I should take my math, unless we restrict to integral algebraids. So I've been wondering about this question for a long time since I was a graduate student, which is essentially: is there, does there exist a category C with some notion of group weights and some notion of Lie algebraics, right? So that groupweights for C and there's conjugroids for C together with a nice integration and differentiation functor. That faithfully accepts this thing. So, a few days ago, Marco mentioned that he lives in a magical world where every algebra is integrable. So, we'll call this world theories paradise. So, of course, this has kind of been done. You know, it was mentioned that you can integrate Poisson manifolds using two groupoids. And you can try to achieve this by generalizing the notion of groupoid, of course, being a little bit more flexible about what you call groupoids. So, in order to explain my point of view of what I'm trying to do is, I want a kind of low-tech solution to this problem, where I view higher category theory as kind of a high-tech approach. And diffeology is, in a lot of ways, a low-tech approach, because it involves, you know, diffeology is kind of cheap. They're cheap to construct, but the price we pay for that is an excessive generality. It's hard to. Excessive generality, it's hard to prove a lot of general theorems about them. So, the idea is that I want to come up with a sort of low-tech approach to see if there's a setting where this works. And of course, the tool I'm going to use is diffeology. Okay, so I guess I should say what a diffeological space is. Most, probably a lot of people here have seen at least one talk where it was mentioned. But let me. Let me write down my basic definitions at least. So, in epheological space, I have until 11, sorry. No, I have it until 1115. Okay. So, a diffeological space is, so this is the cheap definition, a concrete. A concrete sheet on the site of. So, I mean, I would like to just say manifolds. Of course, usually they say Euclidean spaces. But these have the But these have the same concrete sheaves, so it doesn't really make any difference. But what it actually means, like, so the idea is that a diffeological structure on a set X is just a notion of the set of the settings. A notion of admissible mass C, infinity, and x squared and ranges over manifolds. And you can write down what are some sort of reasonable axioms that you could put on such a Reasonable axioms that you could put on such a thing. It needs to be sheaf-like, it should be stable under restriction. You should be able to glue them together. So I'll spare the extensive details and instead just sort of give some examples. So for example, you could say on a set X, define the infinity from M to X. From m to x to be only constant. So this is called the discrete diffeology. So this is not a very interesting diffeology to put on the set. But it is one. And of course, you can do the opposite thing where you can say that C infinity m Infinity m x equals all set theoretic maps from m for x. This is also not usually a particularly interesting etiology. But they're the two extreme examples. But the most important case that I care about is the case where you have a manifold and an equivalence relation. And you say that a function f from, say, n to m modulo of the equivalence relation is smooth if f locally factors root f. By a smooth math. So this is this has a name, this is the quotient, if you want. And these are actually the spaces that I'm interested in. I'm actually really only interested in things that are constructed out of manifolds. So actually, if even without even using the word diffeology, Even without even using the word diffeology, if I insisted on just talking about sheaves on manifolds, I would still essentially be talking about concrete sheaves, because a sheaf of this form is going to be concrete by its construction. Now, there are a lot of, you can try to do differential geometry with diffeological spaces. You can talk about things that are kind of Things that are kind of like submersions and things that are smoothness. So the definition of smooth, of a smooth map of diffeological spaces is kind of the obvious thing. It's just that this is smooth if for all g from m to x smooth we have We have that F composed with G is smooth. If you prefer the sort of categorical formulation, this is just saying it's a morphism of sheaves. M ranges over finite dimensional manifolds. Yeah, yeah. Manifolds. Yeah, yeah. So, of course, you could choose different categories, but yes, I'm thinking about finite-dimensional manifolds. But X could be, in principle, infinite-dimensional. I mean, there are infinite-dimensional objects, yes, which are diffiological spaces. I mean, like, it's not too hard to, I mean, just take your favorite infinite-dimensional vector space and then try to define what a notion of a smooth map from a finite dimensional. Of a smooth map from a finite-dimensional manifold into it is. Of course, there's ways of doing that that are going to satisfy these sort of niceness properties. I mean, the category of geological spaces is closed under limits and co-limits. So, of course, you can construct into dimensional things. But I'm really interested in interested in a very specific kind of theological square. Okay, so I said what the notion of a map being smooth is. Let me say that you give it a taste of like what some of these definitions of euphiology look like. So you say f from x to y is a, so we had to define what a local subduction is. Is say local subduction if for all, let's say m t y naught x x naught. So if I have a pointed diagram like this, then there exists an open neighborhood. open neighborhood, so u v. Oh, so here is an arbitrary smooth map. So here this is arbitrary. No, and there is a normal matter coordinate. Yeah, and this is a manifold. So I'm going to try to use M for manifolds and X, Y for topological spaces. If you can always lift If you can always lift it in a pointed in a pointed action like this. So there exists this. There exists this. Of course, this is the sort of the useful definition that you use when you're trying to actually prove things. But it does have a shorter version, which is just saying that f is a kind of pointwise surjective. Morphism of sheaves or you can think of it as kind of like a surjective on terms. So the reason that people care about local subduction. That people care about local subductions is that local subductions are manifolds are submersions. Of course, the way I've written those definitions, they are local submersions. They're not necessarily surjective. They're just things that are surjective at the tangent level. Alright, so one more definition that I need to give. If you went to Les Diablo Ref, which unfortunately couldn't go. Unfortunately, couldn't go. He might have seen Christian blowmen with a similar in-premise-sounding talk to mine. And I'm going to borrow a little bit of what he's done, where he has a way of defining essentially a tangent functor. So let me write the picture. So it looks like category of manifolds, category of manifolds. This has a tangent function. This has a tangent functor. We're thinking of this as like the total space functor. It comes with a bunch of extra data, but let's start with that for now. This category sits inside of diffeological spaces in a kind of obvious way. You know, smooth is smooth. And here you have the theological spaces. And let's consider the inclusion here. Consider the inclusion here. So, when you have a diagram like this, category theory people might tell you that you might try to construct what's called a can extension. So, I think the usual notation is lan t, something like this. It says that this is like a left-hand extension. So, the tangent functor for the geological space. Or the geological spaces is the left and extension or the usual. There are other, so I should mention also that there are other definitions of tangent functors in the literature for diffeological spaces. They kind of have different advantages and disadvantages. So far, in what I'm trying to do, I found this one to be a bit more useful. To do, I found this one to be a bit more useful, but it has some problems. Well, not they're problems, but also they're sort of necessary things. For example, when you construct this thing this way, well, you know it's well defined because of this property of being closed under limits and co-limits, right? This count extensions are just kind of limit, no, they're co-limits. Can extensions are kind of co-limit. And extensions are kind of co-limit, so you can be sure that this exists. And it comes with a natural projection. So you can do this, you can take a zero section, and you can also multiply by scalars. So these are all So, these are all technically natural transformations of this functor, but you don't have addition. So, that's the price that you pay for this construction. So in particular, if you take the pointwise version by taking the fibers of these projections, this thing is not a vector space. So the fibers of this tangent functor are not vector spaces. That's the punishment. But there's some sort of motivation for thinking of this way to think about an orbifold, which is a kind of example of a diffeological space. The tangent space of a singularity really. The tangent space of a singularity really isn't a vector space. If you think of tangent spaces meaning sort of the directions you can go in at that point. The directions you can go in are actually a cone. And so you have perfectly well-defined scalar multiplication, but you can't really add on a cone. And so you should think of these kinds of things as being these kinds of very nasty cone things in general. Thanks. But is there any choice involved in this construction? Or is it unique even though the logical space is a much bigger category than that form? I mean it's constructed by this T is constructed by a universal property, so it's like unique up to unique isomorphism or something, you know, natural transformation. So there, I mean, there's choices depending on what level of the cache. There's choices depending on what level of the CAC or what level you're trying to think of things. If you want to actually compute this thing, you've kind of you kind of end up making some choices, but questionable as well. Sure, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, that's right. I have a question. Yeah. Hi, um, yeah, do you have? Hi, um if you have a, say, a an integral, then that the space at endpoint is a whole line rather than a half line? Yeah, so if you think of it, you mean like if you have like a manifold with boundary, what do you get? Yeah, so you will get just the part of the boundary pointing inside, basically. Like for like for the interval, if you take the tangent space at one of the endpoints, Take the tangent space at one of the end points, you'll get the half-line. But then you can't multiply by negative numbers. Ah, ah, okay. Let me think about that. Is that an exponentiation? You're taking the map CX, maybe it's exponential of T? Ah, no. So I haven't, to be honest, I haven't thought about the manifolded boundary case. Honest, I haven't thought about the manifolded boundary case very much. So, okay, so the problem is, I guess, of how you construct the diffeology on the manifolded boundary, because there's kind of different ways of constructing manifolds with boundary, but they can give you different diffeologies. Like if you take like rotations on the plane and you look at the diffeology that you get from taking that quotient, you get a half-line. Well, you have what is set theoretically a half-line, but it's tangent space. But its tangent space is going to be basically our modulus like reflection. Does that make sense? So you can multiply by negative numbers because we identified the negatives and the positive numbers. If you define the diffeology in a different way, if you define the diffeology in the standard way for manifolded boundary, then I think what you'll get is the full tangent space at that point. Get is the full tangent space at that point. Like it'll be pointing in every direction. So just my initial answer was maybe wrong. Sorry. Okay, thanks. Okay, so let me get to the sort of category that I was trying to construct at the very beginning, right? I said that I wanted to find some category. So I'm now equipped to. So I'm now equipped to tell you what that is. So we say x is nice. We say it's nice if one there exists a manifold, say m and a local subduction. I from m to x. And let's say it's surjective. You can generalize this a little bit more if you don't insist on the surjective one. You can just say that around every point you have something like this. So let's actually let's do this. Let's say around every What is property two? Property two is the sort of weird thing that says for all p in m, if you take the tangent space, the tangent functor at p of this projection pi. Of this projection pi, and we look at the inverse image of zero. So this is like the kernel of pi, right, at that point. But the problem is here that this is not vector spaces. And so it's not a group homomorphism. So it's not exactly like the usual kernel of group homomorphism. But what we ask is that this be zero. Zero. This is like an italness condition, it's kind of a ital like. And again, you shouldn't think of it as being like a local diffeomorphism because the tangent spaces are much messier than the traditional setting. But you should think of it as like what a local chart for an orbifold looks like. An orbifold looks like, where you have a sort of a diffeomorphism, it's sort of a local diffeomorphism, but it kind of has these singularities. So the problem is, of course, that this is a fairly complicated thing to work out what it is, which means that this definition is a little bit hard. So I'm going to give an alternative formulation. Of this exact condition. So, suppose you have like some equivalence relation. So, if we have an equivalence relation on a manifold, we'll say that this is nice if this is going to be nice. This is going to be nice if one, let's draw, rather than writing it out, well, draw a picture. Given points P and Q and P equivalent to Q, there exists a kind of open set around P and the function f, f of p equals q. And f so pi composed of f equals pi. So pi here is the map from n to this. So what this is saying is that like if you have two different points that are equivalent, then the equivalence relation around each point kind of looks similar. Relation around each point kind of looks similar. You have a kind of symmetry. So the way this is stated doesn't mean that it doesn't suggest that it's a symmetry. But that's where the second axiom comes from. Is that ever just a smooth map or a local diffeomorphism? It's a smooth map. But it will be a local diffeomorphism after I write two. So if you have gamma one and gamma two, say little curves. Little curves inside of M with the property that pi composed of gamma 1 equals pi composed of gamma 2, then gamma 1 prime as 0 equals 0, if and only if gamma 2 prime as 0 equals 0. So, I mean axiom 1 here is this, and axiom 2 here with some work can be shown. With some work can be shown to be this. Yes? Does property 2 imply that there's no local product formula for deductions or like really constant rank theorem? No, yeah, there's not going to be, like, subductions don't, there's no constant rank, there's no like local product. I mean, I mean, just think of the case of like an orbifold. So an orbifold. Orbifold. So an orbifold is an example. Take like an orbifold atlas, like the fibers of an orbifold atlas. They're not like local products in general. So yeah, so these are, this is not like a bundle in a traditional sense. But this condition here is a bit more easy to work with in what, and two implies that. Two implies that half is a divier. So one of the interesting punchlines about these nice physiological spaces is that they are all the orbit spaces of atal groupoids. What's the atal groupoid? The set of objects is m, the set of arrows are. The set of arrows are germs of diffeomorphisms between two different equivalent points. But your claim is that the solution of x is equal to what here? To x being quotient? Okay. Is x? Yeah. So I mean, because we're thinking of like the sit the equivalence relation is the fibers of pi. So in that in that definition, m has And it's not fits, right, for every x x zero and an m. Is that an element? Yeah, yeah, so I mean you could just like take the disjoint unions of the local m. Are you asking that about the same dimension, for example? Or that we should that have the same dimension or could it do you have to find a countable amount of them or um Countable amount of them work. Um, so if the sort of local thing will mean that it has like locally constant dimension, I the way that this is written, the dimension could change between connected components. Of course, Andrew tells you how to figure out what connected components are, but these will have locally constant finite dimension. So these are finite-dimensional things I'm talking about because their dimension is just the dimension of m. Because the italic atlas. Atlas. So you should really think of this M as being kind of an etal atlas for whatever kind of singular space X is. And in fact, you can recover an actual groupoid. The only caveats for saying that these are orbit spaces of atal groupoids is there's like some second countability, how's darkness things when you're looking at these germs of diffeomorphisms. But so they are at least orbit spaces of. So they are at least orbit spaces of possibly big Ital group points. Okay, so let's see some examples. So if you have G acting on M free, if you have a Lie group acting on a manifold freely, then M control of G is nice. So in particular, this is going to tell you that forma folds are nice. A lot of other things. Wait, so so you can replace free with real tree food? Um yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess if you if you like. Well, let me think. Yeah, so so no, yeah, sorry, this doesn't imply orbit false. Orbifault, so you have to show orbit false, you have to show it in a separate case. But it doesn't have to be like these things are not always like quotients of free groups, but free groups are examples, or sorry, free actuals. Is freely not necessarily proper? Yeah, not necessarily proper, because if it was proper, it'd be manifold. So you can have all sorts of irrational foliation of the torus, for example. What about the leaf space of foliation? Hold on a second. So I'll say example one prime is you can take a Lie group, modulo H. Modulo H A let's just say for the sake of it, totally disconnected with zero to so this is like a zero dimensional thing subgroup So here's a H is also an example so this is also Iraq. So, this is also irrational totally. Votorius is one of these. As a separate example, you do get orbifolds, but I don't have the time to explain why that works. But, I mean, if you like, you can try to just check these conditions. Just think about curves. And then I would really like to tell you that, so Jonathan just asked this question, that leaf spaces are foliations. That would be really nice. I don't have a counter example. And it's just property two. So if you can give me a proof of property two for the least space of a foliation, I'd be really appreciative. So this, in the case of a foliation, you should think of M as like a complete transversal affoliation. Okay. Okay. That's the because that's the ital. Okay. So let's get to my one of the main theorems. So I've constructed that I have this category of nice spaces. I have this kind of geometric characterization of this thing. It has this nice property about paths, and it's kind of symmetrical. Paths and its kind of symmetrical equivalence relations on manifolds. So, theorem, suppose G is a physiological groupoid. So, here I just mean this is a groupoid object in the category of diffeological group. Groupoid object in the category of diffeological spaces, where G0 is a manifold and G1 is nice. Okay? Then there exists a local legal void we'll call it G tilde. We'll call it G tilde over the same set of objects with a homomorphism pi from G tilde to G. So this is this is a statement about locally replaced, so there's all sorts of There's all sorts of close enough to the identity. Maybe you want to say some extra property of pi, not just a homomorphism? Yeah, it's a homomorphism and a realization. So that's just a projection map like one of these, like one of these atal atlases. So this map is an eta essentially like an etau homomorphism. But this is a Lie groupoid. So the punchline is, or sorry, this is a local Lie groupoid, but you can differentiate local Lie groupoids. They have algebraics. So we define the derivative of g to be the derivative A derivative of g tilde. You might ask, are you sure this really works? Because there's one extra thing that happens in the theorem, and that this local Legroupoid is unique up to a unique isomorphism. Local groupoid isomorphism. The local everywhere. So that tells you that any algebraic that you construct by coming up with such a local Lie group point, Coming up with such a local Lie group point will be canonically isomorphic to each other. So we have a perfectly well-defined notion of algebraic up to isomorphic. In the definition of a diffeological report, do you assume source and target to be submergence? So I assume that they Um I I assume that they're l um so I assume that they are uh local subductions um so that like these things I can't say submersion technically because they're not manifolds, but I assume that they're local subductions. Okay. The assuming that a diffeological groupoid has it has like source and target local subductions. As source and target local subductions, you can actually kind of see it as being equivalent to asking for the existence of local bisections, at least in the case where G0 is a manifold. So it's a reasonable thing. But of course, this theorem by itself is not really quite interesting, except for the other. The other theorem, which is that pi 1A is nice. So the Weinstein group point is nice, and the derivative of it is isomorphic to A canonically. So this gives you the answer of yes, the Weinstein groupoid does remember the algebraid because our construct of the kinds of group widths that our differentiation procedure is defined on is just totally abstract. It doesn't remember that it came from a Lie algebraid or anything. Sorry, Jeff, are we supposed to know already that pi 1a is a diffeological? That pi1a is a diffeological groupoid? So, diffeological, yeah, sure. That's a reasonable question. It's a diffeological groupoid because, so yeah, so let me explain. So, I one a is diffeological sense. since its path space of A line below in the equivalence relation. And this is like some infinite dimensional manifold. It's a diffeological space. Diffeological spaces are stable under quotients. Is it uh an easy thing that P of A is diffeological space? Yeah, it's a saying something as diffeology like is is e is almost always easy. Is almost always easy if it's constructed out of manifolds. Like you write down the most obvious definition. You take C infinity paths. Right. Yeah, yeah. You just take C infinity deformations of paths. Sorry? No, no, no. Yeah, sorry. When I say paths basically, I mean algebraic paths. Maybe there is. I don't know if you are worried about the fact that he only uses finite-dimensional manifolds in his definition. Is that what you are worried about? Is that what more important? No, no, I'm I'm just wondering what the definition is. No, PFA is. Well, PFA is a Banach manifold. So you don't have to use a Banach manifold structure. You can just say smooth family of paths. And you're right, this is actually a subset of the path space. So there is also a thing where if you have a subset of a diffeological space, it inherits a diffeology. And that's just the obvious one. And that's just the obvious one. It's the ones that a map into it is smooth if composition with inclusion is smooth. So that's how you get a diffeology on this, and then you take a quotient. So it's not, diffeologies are just so flexible. Like if two diffeological things are related, you can come up with a diffeology for them. So the last comment that I guess I should make, I didn't really have time for it. didn't really have time for is you might ask what is the sort of etal atlas for the Weinstein group width. Well, you have this characterization as this quotient. If you take the Banach approach, then this is the leaf space of a foliation. And you choose a complete transversal to that leaf space. And that is one of these sort of like atlases. And it was proven some time ago that if you take like the If you take like the algebraid and take the exponential map, that's transverse to that foliation. You choose a connection on the algebraid, take an exponential. That's transverse to the foliation, and it inherits a local group-wise structure close to the identity. The exponential map gives you a, you know, you can see some papers by Julians, where he constructs these explicitly. So this is really just trying to do, trying. So this is really just trying to do this where I don't remember that anything is an algebraic in the first place, which is the hard part. That's the hard part. Okay, so I'm out of time, so I'll stop here. Thank you. Questions or remarks? This question mark about the deep space of audio? the leaf space of polio that seems to be space of poliation right so the yeah so the thing is that this the the proof that the Weinstein groupoid is nice involves the groupoid structure on the Weinstein groupoid. Like the it's because it's so symmetrical, like the the existence of a groupoid structure like Of a groupweight structure implies things are very rigid and much more symmetrical than these things. This is not an arbitrary foliation, it's actually a very special one. It comes out of the geometry of the ordinance on a on the real fraction. Yeah, mononomy transformation. But we also become from a finite dimensional object. So for example, I mean this is not really that relevant to this talk, but the holonomy of the foliation, I can prove that it's finitely generated abelian group, the holonomy group. So this is not an arbitrary foliation. Yeah. How is this related with the works of Chen Chang? I mean, this is just, this is like the truncation. Like if you take the stacky group points, you know, anytime you have a lead group point, you can construct a diffeological, you can take the diffeological portion of the objects modulo of the equivalence relation by isomorphism. And this is kind of just the truncation, right? So Chen Chang was trying to integrate using one stacks. Trying to integrate using one stacks by realizing the objects as a stack. And here I'm saying that if you care about integration and differentiation, you can operate here. Yes? In the case of a possible manifold, I suppose you get a symplectic structure in this epidemiological group? Yeah, that's in the sense of epiology somehow. Well, Well, so these are very, these are much better than arbitrary diffeological spaces. And defining symplectic structures or metrics for them is actually quite easy for these nice spaces. Because as I said, they're all orbit spaces of etal groupoids. So they are all orbit spaces of etal groupoids. If you want to say what a symplectic thing is, you just say symplectic symplectic if it's stable under these isomorphisms. These isomorphisms from point to point. Right? You just talk about the zero symplectic structures. So, I mean, it's like, yeah, because of the atalness, it's actually easy to put additional structure on these things. Yeah, I was just going to ask: are there some conditions, checkable conditions? Checkable conditions which tell you when a nice diffeological space is actually a manifold, and if so, do those should give another perspective on the standard obstructions to integrate the algebra to get an actual new loop. I'm not sure. I suspect that there's something like some kind of like condition that you could be able to state that about separating the equivalence function. Separating the equivalence classes. Like, the problem really, it's not just that, though. Yeah, I don't know how to, like, I don't have a nice criteria to give you for that. I mean, it's if the equivalence relation is one of those ones that give you a manifold in the quotient, right? Which are, I mean, there exist axioms for those already. I don't know how much you have to add to get this to be one of those. Alright, any other questions? Popula expand oil again. What I suggest is that we take a break of three minutes and restart a bit earlier so that people don't feel so because there are people who want to fly and have on a tight schedule. So let's start at 25 instead of half an hour. Is that okay with you, Ryan? Because you want to speak five? Sure. Thanks. Oh yeah, I'll send you a I will send you something funny to poster wallpaper I mentioned. Just to get that to give the geometry of this. So so far you want it. Well, it's it's how you find that on oh that's that's great. We'll uh we'll update our uh our paper to be more precise. Yeah. It's possible. I'm just saying for Uh yeah, I guess thank you to the question. Now we want to go to the bar. There is fun. So I asked you if I'm saying it's for searching for all of the problems. Problems we can say for things that we'll say. Also treating the one subscriber.
