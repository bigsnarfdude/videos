JC's research interests are combinatorial, analytic, and elementary number theory. And today's topic is the Euler-Tosient function on Luka sequences. Okay, we need a microphone. Okay, you need a microphone. Great. Take your piece and put it on that table and then you'll also print. Thank you, Mike, for that introduction. And thank you to Renata, Ha, and Habiba for having me speak here today. So I'm going to talk about So, I'm going to talk about a research project I did by myself here at Calgary, and it's on the Euler total function on Lucas sequences. Yeah, and I've just recently submitted it to the International Journal of Number Theory for publication. So our starting point is the general definition of a binary recurrence sequence. So the first example that comes to mind of such a sequence That comes to mind of such a sequence is the usual Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. So, and we can generalize this sequence, and number theorists have done it in several ways. So, a binary recurrence sequence is a sequence of integers that satisfies a given recurrence relation where the nth term is a constant integer p times the n minus. p times the n minus first term plus another integer q times the n minus second term. And there are actually two important kinds of binary recurrence sequences that I'll be talking about today that I'll get to on the next slide. But the nth term of such a sequence, it actually has the explicit form of a times alpha to the A times alpha to the n plus b times beta to the n, which is analogous to the usual Binnett formula you have for Fibonacci sequences. And well, if AB isn't equal to zero and alpha over beta isn't a root of unity, then we call this sequence non-degenerate. Okay, good. So now I'll get to the two special kinds of binary recurrence sequences I'll be talking about here. So a Lucas sequence of the first kind is a binary recurrence sequence that has the zeroth term just being zero and the first term just being one. And a Lucas sequence of the second kind is a binary recurrence. Is a binary recurrence sequence that starts with the zeroth term being 2 and the first term being the constant p, which is the same p in the recursion formula. So the usual Fibonacci sequence is, of course, a Lucas sequence of the first kind. And another example of a Lucas sequence of the first kind that has a special name to it is the Pelt. Special name to it is the Pell sequence where the recurrence relation is, well, you double the n minus first term before adding on to the n minus second term. And you get that sequence there. And an example of a Lucas sequence of the second kind is the sequence of the Lucas numbers. So 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, etc. And then here are the Binnett formulas for these two kinds of Lucas sequences, which is u sub n is equal to alpha to the n minus beta to the n. Sorry, this might hang on again. We're having issues on zoom here. Better? Yeah, it's okay again. Yeah. So a Lucas sequence of the first kind. sequence of the first kind satisfies u sub n is equal to alpha to the n minus beta to the n divided by alpha minus beta and of the second kind you just have alpha to the n plus beta to the n. So here is the first result I'm going to mention here and it deals with the Euler-Toshing function. So the Euler-Toshen function So the Euler-Tossian function, I'm sure you all know, just counts the number of integers from 1 to n that are co-prime to n. And it is a multiplicative function. So here's the first result due to Flory and Luca in 2002. So if we have two non-degenerate binary recurrence sequences that satisfy these two recurrence relations here, and the roots of the characteristic equations will of the characteristic equations will be alpha 1, beta 1, alpha 2, and beta 2 respectively. And I'm just going to have these roots satisfy at least one of these statements here. And moreover, Luca had V sub n be a Luca sequence of the second kind or it satisfies Or satisfy S sub 2 being even and R sub 2 is odd. And he proved that the equation phi of the absolute value of A times U sub m equals the absolute value of B times V sub N actually has a finite number of solutions. And, well, if, and, yeah, the upper bound of such solutions is computable. So if you give me two So if you give me two recurrence sequences that satisfy these conditions, I can give you an explicit bound for the solutions on M and N. So now I'll go through a few examples of this theorem. Now, the first question is, why do we need these assumptions? Well, let's just take away the assumptions for a minute and just see what happens. So I'm just going to So I'm just going to let the two sequences in question be 2 to the n minus 1. Now if n equals p is a prime, such that 2 to the p minus 1 is a Mersenne prime, then what do we get? Well, we get phi of u sub p is equal to 2 to the p minus 2, and that can be written as 2 times v sub p. And of course, it is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. Sen primes. So if you take away all of the assumptions, chances are you won't get a finiteness result. And yeah, and in his paper, Luca gave these couple of examples, where L sub n is just the Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers are F sub M. And we get those solutions respectively. Now, these two assumptions leave out a number of cases. So, we've seen that we can't take away all of the assumptions, but so the question becomes, what assumptions are actually necessary to get such a finiteness result? So, something that has been studied after Luca came out with this result is what if came out with this result is what if the two sequences u sub n and v sub n are exactly the same sequences and it is easy to say that they well they violate the conditions in Luca's theorem so for instance we could have u sub n be equal to b to the n minus 1 divided by b minus 1 Where B is some fixed integer. And in 2005, well, Luca proved that phi of if x and y are two integers that are between 1 and b minus 1, then you can only get finitely many solutions in that equation. And moreover, very recently in 2017, Chen and Tian, well, they looked at Luca's techniques and refined them a bit to get to find out exactly what these solutions are for when well for when the coefficients Well, for when the coefficients are what? In the equation. So if you have phi of x to the n minus y to the m divided by x minus y is equal to x to the n minus y to the n divided by x minus y. Then all of the solutions are of that form there. And then moreover in 2020 2020. Bai was able to put absolute values in the equation as well to similarly get all of the solutions. So now I'm going to go into a bit about how you actually prove these results. So the first thing I'm going to mention is a few useful properties of leukocye. Useful properties of Lucas sequences. So if u sub n is a Lucas sequence of the first kind, then for any natural number capital N, we have that capital N divides the nth term if and only if an integer that we denote as Z of n, which is called the order of appearance of n, divides n. So a simple example. So a simple example of this would be if you were to take the ordinary Fibonacci sequence, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 5, etc., you notice that every third term is even. So in the ordinary Fibonacci sequence, you would have z of 2 be equal to 3, because in order for u sub n to be even, n has to be a multiple of 3. And then Lucas in 1878 proved the 1878 proved these two results about this order of appearance. So if we have capital N be a prime p, then z of p is equal to p. If p divides d, I didn't define what d is there, but d is it's p squared plus 4q, where p and q are the two integers in the recurrence relation. relation. So in the ordinary Fibonacci sequence, for example, d would be 5. On the other hand, if P doesn't divide D, and D is a quadratic residue mod P, then the order of appearance of P divides P minus 1. And if it isn't a quadratic residue, then the order divides P plus 1. And then moreover, Lemma Lucas. Lemma, Lucas proved this result here. They're just letting you know when they disappear. Yeah, thank you. So if you have integers a, k, m in the natural numbers, and q is a prime such that the highest power of q, which we denote as q to the 8, dividing u sub m, with q to 0. sub m with q not dividing k then for any l at least zero if q to the a plus one divides the km times q to the lth term in the sequence yeah then q to the eighth less l is the highest power of q so no So knowing what the highest power of a prime is in the term in the order of appearance, you can basically tell what the highest power of that prime is in any given term by looking at how many at the highest power of the prime divides the indice in the sequence. That's basically what that results in. Then moreover, we have this other neat fact about Lucas sequences. So first I'm going to define a primitive prime factor of u sub n or of respectively v sub n, where v sub n is a Lucas sequence of the second kind. Yeah, so So a primitive prime factor is a prime factor of u sub n that doesn't divide any term that comes before u sub n in the sequence. And in 1913, Karmichael actually proved that if that unless n is equal to 1, 2, or 6, then u sub n always has a primitive prime factor. Unless, of course, you have n equals 12. you have n equals 12 in the usual Fibonacci sequence. So now I'll just wave my hands a bit here, but if you have the equation being phi of u sub n is equal to u sub m and you're going to divide u sub n divide by u sub m. u sub n divided by u sub m, then, well, by definition of the Euler-Tossion function, you're going to get that product of 1 plus 1 divided by p minus 1 over all the prime factors of u sub n. And then, well, by the Binet formula, you're going to get a lower bound of b to the lambda, where lambda is the difference between n and m, which is, of course, bounded below. Which is, of course, bounded below by the G C D of N and M. And then, well, if you take logarithms, then you actually get k is less than or equal to lambda, is less than this sum here, where s of d is just the reciprocal, um reciprocal of the primes. Prime satisfying Z of P is equal to D. So by the property of the Lucas sequences that I mentioned before, you can see that S of D is less than or equal to, P is congruent to one mod D. And well by And well, by and well, if you're summing over reciprocal of primes that satisfy, well, that are in some kind of finite arithmetic progression or satisfy this in such a congruence relation, then we can use the Brune-Titchmarch result to get that this is bounded above by log log D over phi of D. Then well again I'll wave my hands and just say that this that this can actually be bounded above by 1 plus the sum of the prime factors of n of log log p over p. And then using, yeah, and then we break up the sum into whether the prime factor of n either divides m or not. Either divides m or not. So if it does divide n, then we get a lower bound of log log log k squared by prime number theorem. And then, so this is where this is where the lemma dealing with the prime powers in the indus. With the prime powers in the indices comes into play. So if p is a prime factor that divides them but doesn't divide m, and we let p to the gamma be the highest power of p dividing use of m, then, well, basically p to the gamma must be the highest power of prime of p dividing Dividing u sub z of p. So if we take some divisor of n, say d, that divides p, then u sub b must have a primitive prime factor, say q. And since And since, well, p divides u sub q minus, or q divides u sub q minus 1, so that implies that p divides q minus 1. So q divides u sub n then. Moving slides with the second event, And well, since Q is congruent to 1 mod P by Lucas's result, we have that P divides U sub M. So every divisor of N divided by P is going to give rise to a prime factor P of u sub m. But we know that the prime power of The prime power of p in u sub m is bounded. So that means, well, we can just derive that the number of divisors of n is bounded. So then to bound n itself, we just have to bound the prime factors of n. Yeah, and I won't go into that details there, but basically, Into that detail there, but basically how that works is that if all of the prime factors of n are significantly high, then this sum is just going to go to zero, which means that the ratio of use of n over use of m must be, well, it must be about one, but that's not possible because the ratio between use of n and use of m, it must be at least alpha by the net formula. least alpha by the net formula. So now we'll go on to two other results by Luca and others. So in 2009 Luca and Nicolai proved that the only Fibonacci numbers whose Euler total function is another Fibonacci number are 1, 2, and 3 and and Fay and Luca proved that the only Pell numbers whose Euler-Tossian function is another Pell number are 1 and 2. And so my result generalizes these two results. So if you have a fixed natural number, capital P is at least 3, and we have the recurrence relation u sub n is equal to p times u sub n. To p times u sub n minus 1 plus u sub n minus 2, and it's a Lucas sequence of the first kind, then the only solution to the Diophantine equation here is phi of 1 is 1, basically. And well, I'll just remark here that this completely exhausts the problem of finding solutions to such an equation. Equation where you have this recurrence relation with a positive integer p. But if you want p to be negative, well it turns out that if you take absolute values of the terms, then you can basically just take Then you can basically just take you can just multiply p by negative 1 to get the positive case. So we've completely generalized the coefficient p in the recurrence relation in this result. Although I have yet to generalize q equals what, I was unable to do that. How much time do I have? Oh, five minutes. Five. Okay. Yeah, so maybe I'll just do a little bit of the proof, but not all of it. But um basically you use the same technique that Luca used in his 2005 result. Um but the problem is that you can't automatically bound the number of divisors of n that I did, or that Luca did rather, because the order of appearance of a prime p might not divide p minus 1. might not divide p minus 1. It might divide p plus 1 instead, in which case you can't directly use Luca's results. But it turns out that I think I'll just skip these two slides here, but it turns out that if n is even, then you can write u sub n as u sub n sub. as u sub n sub 1 times v sub n sub 1 times v sub 2 times n sub 1 all the way up to v sub 2 to the s minus 1 times n sub 1 where n sub 1 is the largest odd factor of n and v is the corresponding Lucas sequence of the second kind which just means that it satisfies the same recurrence relation. So if you do that, it turns out that the prime factors of v sub n sub 1 must satisfy their order of appearance at of p to divide p minus 1, which is basically what this slide is about here. And so that helps us to use Luca's original. To use Luca's original techniques. Yeah, and another thing that I had to do was instead of dealing with S sub T, S sub D, we had to deal with T sub D. So I had to trivially bound and take into account first the divisors of N that are less than alpha squared or squared or the divisors p of use of n that are less than alpha to the fourth. And I had to found them in 2.163. So yeah and this is basically what Chen and Tian had to use in order to get the complete result for all of the solutions. Because otherwise you're going to get a Because otherwise you're going to get a bound that gives a finiteness result, but the bound is going to go off to infinity as alpha goes off to infinity. And then, well, and so that leaves the n-odd case. Yeah, so I'll basically say here that in the n-odd case, it turns out that if p divides u sub n, then p is congruent to 1 mod 4. So you get 4 to the k minus 1 divides u sub m. And I won't go into the details here, but this, but depending on the sequence in question, this implies that 4 to the k is bounded above by just the indices of the Lucas sequence. And uh yeah, I show that for insufficiently large that this leads basically to a contradiction, although I probably don't have enough time to go over all the details here. But that's basically how I prove my result anyway. And so, for I'll just say a few words about future research. So, can we get the same result for So, can we get the same result for any q? I got it for q equals 1. I couldn't quite generalize it, q like I did for p. So that's definitely something else to consider. And then, well, another question is, can we replace the Euler-Tossian function with another arithmetic function, such as the sum of divisors function? And Luca has yet another paper. And Luca has yet another paper on this with the usual Fibonacci sequence as well. So I would like to thank the University of Calgary for the award of a post-doctoral fellowship, which made this research possible. And thanks for listening. Any questions? We have lots of time for questions. Uh can we hit the record button? There you go.
