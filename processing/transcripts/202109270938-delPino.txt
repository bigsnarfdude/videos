Mano, you are in office. Oh, yes, okay. You do, yeah, you're in the office. Okay, so Manuel, are you ready? Yes. Okay, so we can start even if one minute early with the second talk today from by Emmanuel Delpino. He will talk about the dynamics of concentrated vorticities. Of concentrated vorticities in 2D and 3D Euler flows. Thanks, please. Okay. So, thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me. So, well, I will speak about solutions with concentrated vorticities in 2D and 3D Euler flows and related problems. And unrelated problems, I would say. Okay, so the main topic of this talk concerns the Euler equation, the Euler equation for an inviscid fluid, incompressible fluid, which is a system that in the so-called vorticity streams. Called vorticity strings form becomes this equation here, when I denote V. So this is a transport equation where the term defined in the transport is the gradient orthogonal, okay, gradient per of the so-called string function, which is defined in this way. So if we consider the probing entire... Would consider the problem in the entire tool just for simplicity. I could also consider bounded domains, but that's not an essential additional difficulty. So from now on, Laplacian inverse of omega will be the notation that I will use for the Newtonian potential. So this is just a convolution with the fundamental solution of the lamp. With the fundamental solution of the Laplace and in the entire entire two. And okay, and if I call u to be the gradient per pop psi, this quantity represents the velocity field of the underlying fluid. And an omega represents the vorticity, which is by definition the curve of the velocity field. And since this is just two dimensions. Since this is just two-dimensional, this vorticity field can be identified with the scalar function, which is simply given by this quantity, where U1 and U2 are the respective components of U. Okay, so local existence and uniqueness in a number of good spaces, in particular the infinity and most functions. Most functions, okay, smooth valued functions, is known in the two-dimensional case. In particular, well, this depends in essential way on the fact that for bounded omega, the gradient of psi is log ellipsoids, okay, and that. Log ellipsis, okay, and that implies that there are characteristics for the transport equation that are well defined and so on. And a good thing, which is a dramatic difference with the three-dimensional case, is that it is known that solutions are regular at all times if the initial condition is regular. In this talk, I will be interested in solutions to this Euler. Euler system with concentrated vorticities. In other words, I would like to consider solutions so that the vorticity omega has most of its values concentrated or supported near a finite number of points that I will denote simply as say j of t, they are functions of time. And well, by definitions, Well, by definition, since if we consider vorticities that have this form, that are concentrated at the number of points with constant weights, which is natural from the fact that the equation itself preserves mass. So it is a natural answer to consider that these numbers are constants. They pie simply cosmetics for Cosmetics for a reason that I will discover. And the corresponding stream function is the inverse Laplacian of the sum of the deltas. It is the sum of fundamental solutions. The fundamental solutions, because of the pi weight, it captures four in front, right? And so the string function is a singular object, not too singular, but singular. Okay, so solution. Okay, so solutions with concentrated vorticities are rather natural objects. Of course, from the previous picture, you can think of it as the configuration of a fluid exhibiting a finite number of vortices. And the study of this vortex, concentrated vorticity solutions, traces back to Helmholtz, long, long ago. Long ago. And even though this is concentrated vorticity is a rather standard subject in fluid dynamics, and there are a lot of computations, very interesting computations done around them. They still have, there are still a number of unanswered questions that I would like to, some of them I would like to discuss here. Okay, here are other names involved, very important. Here are other names involved, very important in this case. Okay, then I come back to simply this limiting object, which is a singular object. Okay, this is not a solution, it's not a classical solution. In the beta scenario, it is a distributional solution. And formal and vortex singular solutions are given by this object, by this linear combination of direct deltas. linear combination of direct deltas with moving centers right and the corresponding stream function is um this sum of um fundamental solutions okay then um now if we plug in these answers in the equation i insist formally because these are not really i mean the direct delta is not a function right it is the distribution but i can still But I can still write down this computation. So if I write the operator corresponding to the Euler equation, then I get this combination of gradient of direct delta, so even more simple, right, times dot product with the velocity of each of the points, of the corresponding points. And well, if I plug the corresponding stats in this product of two grains, I get the double summary. Product of two grains, again, the double summation. This product of singular objects. This product of singular objects is kind of critical, right, in the case that I equals J, because both of them are singular. Gradient of direct delta times this gradient of fundamental solution. On the other hand, in any reasonable sense, or by using approximation. by using approximations to these objects. When i is equal to j you can use the fact okay that gamma of x and the distribution direct delta are both radially symmetrical invariant under rotation. And in that case, well, the gradient vert of a radial function times the gradient of a radial function is automatically zero. In case these two get Is zero in case these two guys were functions. Okay, so I will make this reasonable guess that this is zero. So if I use that fact and I gather the remaining terms, I arrive to this setting. The gradient of direct deltas, right? Some with these coefficients. So when is this singular object? When is this singular object going to be a solution? Well, when these guys between brackets are all identically zero, and that amounts to simply considering the following differential equation. Okay, this is simply a system of differential equations, an embodied problem. Equations, an embody problem in the plane, right? And of course, this is a perfectly reasonable object. And this is the dynamic law defining the formal motion of vortices. And this has been known for a long time, maybe, I mean, definitely more than a century ago. And so here is the question. The question The question. The question that I would like to talk about is about solutions, about the systems of solutions that really behave, I mean true solutions, smooth solutions, that really behave as the singular objects or approximate the singular objects for a given solution of the system. Of the system of ODs. So, say the existence of such solutions would justify the dynamic law, the asymptotic dynamic law. Okay, let me consider to construct this solution, so to state a result that we have in this direction, let me do the following regularization of the singular object. Of the singular object. The singular object here, some fundamental solutions, I will simply regularize it. This is not the only possible solution. This is not the only possible answer for the regularization issue, but this is a convenient choice. You simply add epsilon squared to this argument here. If you do that, then this solution becomes no longer singular, smooth. smooth and um and then the laplacian inverse is actually this is the this is the nice thing an explicit object it's simply uh this linear combination of scalings of a fixed function with finite mass right all these guys have the same mass it's the mass of u zero actually in entire two and where u zero is this function uh here this texture Okay, so this is the basic thing. What I would like to do is to find solutions that are close to this nearly singular configuration, which is not simple. This is the main part of a truly regular solution. This is what I would like to show to you. Well, an observation is that these approximate vorticities, of course, they approach, as epsilon goes to zero, the corresponding linear combination of Dirac deltas. There is an A pi missing here. And also the velocity field is the magnitude of the velocity field approaches the sum of the rank deltas when it is normalized by this exact value, one over two epsilon. One over two epsilon. Okay, okay. What is our main result in this direction? Is the proof that for a given solution without collisions of the Ermatic law I stated before, which is this one, there exists a solution of the Euler equation, of the two-dimensional Euler equation, that differs little from the singular configuration, I mean the Configuration, I mean the nearly singular configuration, psi 0 epsilon, omega 0 epsilon. Okay, so this is the shape. Of course, this is a very natural object because of course, if you are standing at the center of a tornado, you see no velocity, right? I mean, you see something smooth. Of course, when you go a little bit away from the center, you will see an extremely high winds, right? High winds. But that reflects the fact that the solution, the true solution, is smooth. So these are the interesting solutions for the problem, rather than the formal direct delta solutions. Okay. Our main result states that given a collision, the solution of the info-Rawl system, this is how it is called, in a given time interval, 0d, then there exists a solution of the Of the Eudel system that has the following form. The string function and the vorticity are perturbations of these regular, nearly singular objects, where these functions P and Psi are, of course, smooth and have the following estimates. First, psi is very small, it's of epsilon size. Of epsilon size, even epsilon square size, the gradient is a little worse, right? So it loses one epsilon, still size epsilon, and the remainder of for the vorticity is small, still small, but small compared with the main term, with this bubble. So it's a little small fraction in epsilon with respect to the values, to the bubbles, to the asymptotic bubbles. To the bubbles, to the asymptotic bubbles. Okay, this is a result in this first result, I mean, a first result with exactly this type of asymptotics. Let me mention that there was an important result previous to this one by Marchiro Pulvirenti. Marchiero and Pulvirenti were able to construct a solution. Construct a solution that was smooth with the centers, I mean, approximating in distributional sense this sum of the radicals. Sorry, at least the first assertion, not the second, we didn't have the second assertion. The first assertion, however, didn't involve any final symptoms of the solution near the concentration points. Near the concentration points. Just very rough information was available for them. And the reason is that they were using methods that involve just asymptotic energy estimates or things like that. So this is why the distribution defines something. We have much more information about the solution itself. Okay, so essentially. So, essentially, what they were able to detect was the outer regime solutions approaching distributionally the limiting configuration. And however, finding the fine behavior near the vortices was open and in fact it is more important. Let me mention the ingredients of the proof of our result. A main part, whereas it is A main part, whereas it is customary, as in the previous talk, is an important procedure, right? I mean, it's linearization, it's linearizing around a good approximation of the solution. This is what we do, except that the parameter is not time, but the epsilon itself, okay? So, what we are able to find is first a procedure that allows us to improve the approximation in powers of To improve the approximation in powers of Percy. Using a combination of elliptic and transport equations, then we set up the problem as a couple system of inner and outer problems. Inner problems is what we call the regime near the singularities, and an outer problem which is much more regular. This is what we call the inner-outer lining scheme. Call the inner outer gluing scheme. And then, in order to solve the problem, to find a true solution, we need to find applications estimates for the corresponding system, which allow us to solve the final problem using a fixed point, a degree argument. Not really banach fixed point theorem. That becomes much more delicate in this setting. I will refer to this later. Okay, concerning the improvement of the approximation, the way we proceed to do that is to, well, we first use this guy as our initial, I mean, this was the initial approximation for the string function that I mentioned before. And say, so what would we like to do? What we would like to get is a solution to this problem where they To this problem, where the e operator is this guy, right? With size defined in this way. So, making this change of variables, so defining the variable y to be the variable, the natural variable near the concentration points. Then, what I do is to find, what I would like to do is to find a solution, I mean a perturbation. I mean, a perturbation of the main terms that improve the convention. I mean, this is the natural thing to do. And well, if I write in terms of the variable, the natural variable that I call white for this operator, then I arrive to the following system when I start close to the point side, well, psi JSON. Okay, and I get this operator. Now, this operator has an expansion, of course, that involves the fundamental solutions, right? And because it's the sum of fundamental solutions. And at the end, the fact that we are assuming that psi j's solve the system, the Kirkov raw system, then allows us to get a good error time. What I am trying to say is that the first error Say, is that the first error of approximation of epsilon size if I didn't assume anything in the points? However, it will be epsilon square size thanks to the fact that we are assuming the equation, the corresponding equations for the both. In that case, the linearized problem around that first approximation becomes the, I mean, it's not, I mean, it's not linearized, it's the main. non-linearized the main is the main it's the main term i mean it's the cooler relation and the function r is quadratic so for the epsilon square um y squared then uh what we get therefore is that the i mean the new error the error after uh after i i after i i let the m psi equal to zero in fact uh is simply this guy right so this exceptional square size divided this is epsilon square size divided by y to power minus four by by power minus four and uh and in order to improve the approximation i need to solve this elliptic equation down here this equation down here is not so complicated but but it involves extremely degenerate operators which is this one uh so the way we proceed later on is to solve this elliptic i mean we solve these elliptic equations provided that Equations provided that the corresponding error doesn't have mode zero. Okay, that doesn't, I mean, it has no radial part. So if you're expanding in, I mean, this time here is differentiating, it corresponds to differentiation with respect to the polar angle. So if this guy has no radial component, when you expand it in Fourier series, then I mean, you can solve the equation. I mean, this Equation. I mean, this in each courier mode corresponds to just something like this. And this is the way we proceed. On the other hand, this is the Lippy equation. However, you lose decay every time you improve powers of epsilon. If you want to still get good decay in space for the corresponding solutions, you need to alternate the use of these elliptic equations with these. With this with the transport part, with the transport part, in which we simply omit this guy here. Anyway, that's the procedure. And after getting a sufficiently good approximation, we need a priori estimates in order to solve the linear X problem in the interior regime. And the basic ingredient of the proof is to get. The basic ingredient of the proof is to get a priori estimates for the solution of this equation with zero initial condition. Write the initial condition. And in fact, we are able to get that under the assumption that phi has center value, sorry, center of mass zero in a large ball, okay? And it has mass zero as well. If I get that, Well, if I get that, then I get this nice accurate estimate, okay, which essentially tells me that phi has a two-norm controlled by the two-norm of the right-hand side after losing this factor, epsilon squared, epsilon epsilon. And this is a weighted norm, so it also tells you that P will decay at a certain rate. In fact, at a certain rate bigger than rod to power three. And since the error that we were able to get was of this form, then Was of this one, then we are able to iterate. I mean, we are able to invert the operator in the good space. So at the end, this is good to do the degree argument. Anyway, let me mention some recent work with my postdoc, Antonio Fernandez. We have considered a very similar equation, a related equation, right? Which is the generalized quasi-gystrophy. The generalized quasi-geostrophic equation in which the inverse Laplacian is replaced by the inverse fractional Laplacian. Okay, the quasi-geostrophic equation corresponds to s equals one car and the inverse is this guy here. So we would like, again, we would like to get solutions with concentrated, not vorticities, omega doesn't have the interpretation of vorticities. It's called an active scalar. Okay. Omega is not the standard notation. So what is our main result? uh what is our main result is um this uh is that if uh you start you start from a solution of this system yeah which is the corresponding the right modification for um for the for the kirchovs ross system then we are able to get a solution for which vorticity votes okay is a Vorticity is approximated in the same sense as in our previous result by this linear combination of bubbles, where the bubble now has this exact form. Yeah, this is the solution of, this is related with the elliptic semi-linear equation and the critical exponent for the fractional Laplace, which is for which you have good information about the non-degeneracy and so on. The proof, however, is much. The proof, however, is much harder. Let me tell you the reason. The result looks the same. In fact, the content is very similar. However, the proof becomes more delicate because, in fact, the proof breaks down for S equal to one half. What I am stating here is only valid for S bigger than one half. And the reason is that. And the reason is that there is the need to, unlike the order to D, it is necessary to get a very high accuracy of the approximation. In fact, arbitrary large order of epsilon if S is very close to one half. In fact, the procedure breaks down at one half. Also, the problem arises not just for the improvement of the approximations, but of course, in more fractional equations. Of course, involve fractional equations, but also from the fact that the apriority estimates break down when s is equal to one-half. This is the reason why we need to invert with such a high accuracy. Part of the reason why we need this very high accuracy is that we don't have a U-Dovish theory. I mean, we don't have a good theory to invert the transport equation because the solution, the gradient of the solution is no longer of this corresponding. Is no longer of the corresponding string function, it's no longer local. Yeah, and this is an important story. There are partial results. I mentioned here some recent works. All these results are actually partial in the sense that, and in the sense that, for instance, this one is conditional, in the sense that if there exists a solution, then you have the good behavior, just like in Macuropulu with it. In macropulvi, and otherwise, it is not, however, okay, a big difference is that it is not known that there exists such an object. A small solution is not known to exist by general arguments. So, in our scenario, we have to build the solution really by hand. And again, s equal to one half is the mysterious scenario. Let me mention, on the other hand, Let me mention on the other hand that we were able to find travel wave solutions with our Weiwei, with Juan Davila and Monica Musso and Jung Cheng Wei. I mean that and what we were able to find were traveling vortex pairs that are special solutions of this system by the way. In our situation down here, on the other hand, we were able to do On the other hand, we were able to do it without any constraint in the functional parameter. But for the time-dependent scenario, it's really time-dependent because this is this problem reduced to an elliptic equation. It becomes more important. Anyway, okay. So concerning the three-dimensional case, let me say some words about it very quickly. So a question that is highly open. A question that is highly open, highly open, there is not much about it, is about solutions with concentrated vorticities in the three-dimensional Euler case. So now the existence of solutions with such concentrated vorticity, so what this picture, I mean, this picture is part of the I suppose. This picture is fancy, I suppose, but this one is a true picture taken outside the volcano. So vortex rings or tornado-like things, so of course have an underlying law of evolution in ideal conditions. And this was first analyzed. Anyway, the vortex filaments are objects that whose study traces back to Helen. Whose study traces back to Helmholtz again, and the law with which they evolved was discovered by Darios. Darios was a student of Levita in the early 20th century. Let me tell you more or less how it works. Well, first of all, the William equation in R3 in a string vorticity form. In this equation, the difference with the 2D case is first. With the 2D cases, is first that omega is now a vector, it's no longer a scalar. Okay, and there isn't, and the presence of this term arises in R3, but not in R2. And this is a very bad term. I mean, it's called the vortex stretching, and that changes the nature of the equation a lot. In particular, it is a big, big open problem knowing if the solutions develop singularity in finite time or not. Develops in Uranus in finite time or not. Anyway, now the string function is going to be defined by this, which is which I mean, this is nothing but the gradient of the fundamental solution in R3. It's a convolution, convolution, but with this cross product. And so, and omega is the vorticity, which is the curve of the velocity p. Okay, what we would like to find our solutions with vorticity concentrates. Minor solutions with vorticity concentrated on a time-evolving curve parameterized by R. And in other words, solutions for which vorticity behaves asymptotically as a direct delta, but now a direct delta concentrated as a measure, a uniform concentrated on a curve gamma of t, an evolving curve gamma of t. Barrios discovered the formal law. I mean, he discovered that if That if he considers solutions very with vorticity very concentrated, and if he makes this change of variables, okay, he changes time into tau, which is t times log epsilon, then there are some way in which the curve evolves, I mean, defined by a parametrization that preserves length. Reserves learned is going to become the system down here, which is called the binormal flow of curves. This is the binormal vector of the curve. And well, and this is not a parabolic equation, it's a dispersive equation, in fact, and a lot is known about it, and it has been studied a lot in the last 10 years or so. Or so and um so this is the binormal and this is what is called the binormal flow of curves. Okay, the vortex filament conjecture states that there exists a solution, a regular solution that after you scale in this way, right, then you obtain a solution behaving in this Behaving in this form, yeah, with the as with the with the with the uniform direct delta at the curve, yeah, behaving with vorticity parallel, okay, and very concentrated to the tangent field to to the to the curve. Anyway, so uh, what is natural is to look for a solution of this form now for the same U0 as before, the same bubble. And on the other hand, let me tell you that the statement, this statement of the vortex-filling conjecture is only known in very special cases. In fact, it is known in vortex rings. I mean, this is a classical work, in fact, by Frankel and other people later on. And the case of Hilesis, which was something Which was something, in fact, that we recently work on. The nice thing is that if you use the invariance, the screwdriving invariance of the flow of the oil flow in 3D, then that's useful to reduce the problem to an elliptic equation again, to reduce the problem in dimension, in fact, and then to the analytic equation if you look for traveling waves. Integration: if you look for traveling waves, and this corresponds to solutions concentrated near near helices. So, this is recent work with Juan, Monica, and Juncheng. And concerning the axisymmetric Euler with no swearing, the solution becomes, I mean, the equation can be written in this way. This is completely standard. I include this log epsilon factor. include this log epsilon factor in order to the log epsilon in the in the other setting. And if we use this, it is known, as I mentioned before, the existence of traveling links. Something that we work, and I will finish with this, with Juan, Monique, and Jun Cheng also, is the leapfrog emotion. The leapfrog emotion was again Emotion. The literal emotion was again discovered by Henkel, sorry, or he had the intuition that they exist. It corresponds to two annuli, to two vortex rings that go one through the other in a sort of alternating way. And this motion involves the law of interaction for the rings that in reality reduces to the interaction of vortices when you consider symmetric situation. And we were able to prove that, I mean, we gave the first mathematical justification of this motion that was a problem open probably since it was originally formulated by Helenholtz. So anyway, so it's again a problem of the same type of vortex motion, but that involves weights and there are a lot of delicate. And there are a lot of delicate ingredients in the construction of approximations and in the proof here. Anyway, thank you very much for your attention. I stop here. Okay, many, many thanks, Manuel, for your interesting talk. And there is space now for questions, if you have any. Besides mine, which is about uh your result with Antonio Fernandez and this uh one half so so it's the method or what do you think uh what what do you and Antonio think about uh no the we don't know in fact it is uh it So, in fact, it is definitely an obstruction for the method, but when you do it, you actually have the feeling that there is something essential. The case one half is, I mean, this is well known, it's a model for Euler CB. So, it is a critical scenario, it is a truly critical scenario for. Critical scenario for which you may even have blow-up. And concerning this part of finding the vortex, the interaction of vortex of vortices, we don't know if this can be done for one half. The approximation, the improvement approximation, you can do something, you can advance. But using it in a useful way, we don't know how to do it. I mean, to structure the true solution, that's what I mean. To track the true solution, that's what I mean. Oh, sorry, I didn't mention something important. That I should have said the there is a conditional result proved by Gerard Bogra and Seis, who proved that there exists that if the solution remains concentrated in a general but specific form around a curve, then the curve evolves necessarily by. Evolves necessarily by normal flow, but the big open question is still that one: the existence of such an object. Okay, okay, very well. So if there are no
