Today, some recent work we've done in vascular pattern plants. And first I gotta start off by saying that Fremisplav Shintevich wanted to really be here, but some like last minute political circumstances couldn't come. On the other hand, he asked me to give this talk on his behalf because I had a big part in this research, or in most of this research. And I was a research associate in his lab for many years. Okay, so the focus of Focus of the talk today, of my talk today, is on two recent papers that we've been working on. The first one is on this leaf ination in potilaya leaves. And the second one is on the vascular patterns that we examine inside flower heads. So the common theme between these two images and these two papers is that they both exhibit this reticulate loop formation pattern. Pattern. Okay, but to start off, so a bit of background, as is suggested to start off a talk. So in patterning and living organisms, there are kind of two well-developed paradigms. The first one is well-posed positional information. There's a diffusing morphogen inside a tissue, and its concentration gives a clue. Concentration gives a clue to the cells of its position inside the tissue. You can use that to model phenomenon like, or they use it for modeling development of Drosophila. The other well-studied paradigm is reaction diffusion. You have two substances that kind of interact within cells and diffuse between the cells. So in this case, there's an activator, there's an activator in red and an inhibitor in blue. Red and an inhibitor in blue, the activator autoregulates its own expression and the expression of the blue inhibitor, and the blue inhibitor down-regulates the expression of the red morphogen. And in this, when you do this kind of simulation, you see you get concentrations of peaks of one morphogen and valleys. And you can use that to model different patterns, but you observe in nature, like in seashells. Okay, but in plant modeling, there's actually a third paradigm that has emerged. The third paradigm has emerged. It's called regulated transport. And here, in this, the difference compared to the other two is that cells actually regulate their own transport. And we heard that in that, a little bit about that in one of the talks this morning. So essentially, this substance is transported between cells, and in some way or another, they regulate how much is being transported, and then we get also these peaks of. And then you get also these peaks of activation, or you get a polarization of the tissue, actually. This is just one example of what you can do getting these peaks, or convergence points, they're called. Okay, so in plants, it turns out that the phytohormone oxin inside these plants is actually transported by a family of proteins called pin proteins that are concentrated in the membrane. And the question is really: well, how. And the question is really: well, how does the flow of oxygen translate the allocation of wind? How does oxygen control its own transport? And starting in about 1969, C. Sachs proposed this idea that oxygen flux between two cells promotes allocation of its transporter, so that you polarize the cell in the direction of the highest net flux. And in the 80s, Graham Mitcheson actually made a model of this idea. Model of this idea, and it showed that it can generate vascular strands or canals of oxygen and polarizing tissue from a source of oxygen to a sink of oxygen. And then later when these molecules were identified, I said that kind of a little bit backwards because back in the 80s, SACS didn't know about them. Later when those proteins were identified, this whole model was revisited by N.D.L. Rowan and Prussian Tabitch in 2005. And they showed that in a In a tissue. So, the next slide basically will show a simulation of that model in action. So, here the source of oxygen is being denoted by this arrow, and you can see that a vascular strand or a canal of oxygen polarizing the pin proteins forms and finds this sink. It's just not very good at creating the shortest path towards the sink. So, that's in order to In order to resolve that, you need some additional information, but I'll get into that in a second. The other phenomenon that this kind of model can produce is if you start with a row of cells at the top that are all sources of oxygen, so all these at the top are sources of oxygen, and run the same kind of polarizing mechanism. Then the model is able to simulate the creation of tree-like branching structures, but see that it. See that it is not very good, or it's not even able to create closed loops. And these are known features of the model. So, of course, many people try to figure out how to form loops using oxygen-based patterning. And here I just wanted to kind of mention one of the ideas that was proposed. And that was in a study by O'Connor et al. in 2014. They were looking at the development of the spikelet. Of the spikelet in this brachypodium, in a grass. So the development of what this looks like in this grass. Yes, and they observed under a microscope, basically, under a microscope, they observed that there are actually two pin proteins, pin1b, which is expressed broadly inside that spikelet. So you see the expression is kind of not these narrow canals that I was showing in the model, but it's very. Canals that I was showing in the model, but it's very broad. And then another thin protein that is expressed more narrowly. And I hypothesized that what's happening is pin1b is helping to form a connection between a source of oxygen and a sink. And then it's further refined later by this PIN1A protein into these high flux strands. I had a question, the sort of enhancement of the transport because of the flux of autoxine. Is it therefore good? Or is it reversible that if the flux goes down, then the spin basically disappears? Yes, yes, you're right. So exactly, it does. There's more, I didn't write the equations in the end, but those are exactly one of the components in the equation for allocating pins to the membrane. So flux allocates pins to the membrane. Flux allocates pin to the membrane, but you have this rate of deallocation. And so this model actually does exactly what you're proposing. Although I'm obfuscating the details a lot here just to make it fit in within the 20-minute time frame. So exactly, in order to do what you're asking, in the model of brachypodium, they separated the oxygen flux into two components: the oxygen E flux. The oxygen efflux, which promotes allocation of pin to the membrane, and the oxygen influx, which inhibits this kind of allocation of the membrane. So it's kind of similar to deallocating pin from the membrane to unpolarize it. I don't think that's a word, but to take pin away from the membrane. And in doing that, they modeled the chain. The change in concentration of pin 1b as a linear combination of e-flux, the flux going out of the cell, given the amount of pin that's available within the cell and the influx that's coming in. And that is called weak polarization. So in contrast, the pin 1A has this non-linear dependent, a quadratic dependence on the and that's and that's what this lets you do a broad expression of Do a broad expression of pins in the tissue, and this allows you to give this more concentrated, high-flux, what's it called, vascular strand. Okay, so in the simulation, here are some steps from the simulation, and the blue indicates the pin 1B, how pin 1B is polarizing the tissue. White is indicating how pin 1A is polarizing. So you see it's Is polarizing, so you see it's more broadly expressed, the blue compared to the white. And here is a new auxin source. As the simulation progresses, that expression of the PN1B becomes more narrower, and eventually you get a strand connecting this newly formed source of oxygen to the existing oxygen. Okay, so why do we just go through all that? It's because this model of reticulation. Um this model of reticulation uses the the weak polarization model that I just described from like BRACA quote. Okay, so what's so particular about this plant? Well, it's the Chinese money plant, Philea. It has an interesting feature, these oval-shaped leaves, and whereas many plants have okay, so it has these signatory pores here in the In here in the and all over the lamina of the leaf, whereas in most plants, these large pores are only on the margins. What's kind of the special thing about this plant? No, yes. Well, in Arabidopsis plants, that's been shown experimentally, but not sure about here. So yes, and and they essentially they have uh their function is to release excess water among other things. Release excess water, among other things. But that's not really the more interesting things about them, too. If you take this leaf under a light microscopy, you can trace out the major veins here and identify the hylatodes. Sorry, the hyalatodes are these secreting pores. I've forgotten what I mentioned. These are called hydatodes, and these are the pores that secrete this excess water. So, what's so interesting about this? Well, you can see there's a reticulate pattern of venation. Reticulate pattern of venation, but also the hydratoles seem to be at the centroids of these regions where the loops are formed in the venation. So really this is a, I believe, this is one of few examples that shows Borneo, oh, sorry, the next slide, if you then do a geometric analysis, you can show that that major ring closely approximates a one-eye diagram. Of one eye diagram, if you take those centroids where the hydroplots are as the centroids of the polygons that divide the plane into this one-oi diagram. Okay, so that's a very nice observation, but how can we model this using an oxym-based pattern? And like I was saying before, we have this weak polarization model that starting from a group of cells of sources will Cells of sources will polarize the tissue from the source of oxygen to sink. But it also introduces this oxygen, this dynamic of a wave of oxygen propagating through the tissue. Here you see this a wave of high concentration of boxin propagating. And now, if you make this assumption that hyalotodes are sources of boxin, let's say you have two of boxin sources. Have two toxins. So, sources not only of water but also of oxygen. Sorry, oxygen, the hormone. Yeah, because I mean, we can ignore that for just a moment. Let's just say that, yes, these two are sources of this hormone oxy, which is being transported through the tissue, but it's polarly transported. It's controlling its own transport. The part about the water is just a function of the hyalitose in the leaf. It's not related to the model. The model. Yeah, so if you have two sources and this wave propagates from the sources towards, well, within this tissue, eventually a crest will form between them, which corresponds to the foronoid edge between those two sources. Is there a sink as well in this program? No, no, there isn't, but there are, yes, there are definitely additional details about how maximum constants are. How maximum concentrations of oxygen in some of these cells. Why are you getting this line? Yes, because there's some maximum concentration you can have in cells. So it's effectively like having some sink. A lot of the oxygen is just being transported away. Because you're right, otherwise everything would just get filled with oxygen. So now. So on their way, the plant is absorbing this axin. On their way to like if you have two sinks and then they release this hormone on their path to the central channel, let's say, or the hormonal plant is absorbing the hormone or not? I don't think, I'm not sure if absorbing would be the right word, but certainly it's being degraded within the cells. But so don't have a good picture, but see, so here is the connection point of the leaf to the rest of the plant, the connection to the petule. So that hormone would be transported down that petule. So that would be the oxygen sink, a major oxygen sink in the system. But now, okay, so now I'm having this colliding wave model of locks and Lighting wave model of oxygen-based transporting model as weak polarization. If you make the assumption that the hydlatones emerge more or less at the same time, roughly at the same time, and that let's step on the point, just ask that the hydratones are actually sources of auxin. And then running this simulation, see the waves propagating from the sources of auxin, and eventually. And eventually, something that resembles a Voronoi-like diagram will form. And in fact, if you compare it to an ideal Voronoi diagram, it is actually what you get, assuming that the hydrogens are the centers of the polygons. Just a nitpick, it doesn't look like they're the centroids. I mean, in some cases, yes, but in many cases, In some cases, yes, but in many cases, it looks as if they're not really the centroid or the center. Ah, sorry, they're the generating points of the polygons in the Horonoi diagram. So, like, that means that any point within this polygon is closer to this generating point than to any other generating point. And the edge just means that these points are equidistant to this generating point than this generating point. Does it mean that the leaves? Does it mean that the leaf tunation uh are the spaces with the lowest concentration of oxygen? Oh, yeah, that's a good question. Like, in between, it does, it does, uh, I suppose it does mean that the lowest is the blue color and then the lowest is the blue? Yeah, so I cannot understand it because I thought that those points were the sources of OPS, right? So, yes. So, so around them there should be the highest concentration, not the lowest. Ah, but it's controlling its own transport. So around it is around this habito, around this oxygen source, you are transporting lots of oxen away. And that's where that fast transport away. And then along with the leaf nation, the slow transport is saying? Well, along here is where two waves of oxen are colliding and forming this edge. So the oxen has no level. So the oxygen has nowhere to go, right? Exactly. Exactly. Yep. So it's actually, it's pretty straightforward. It's just the neat thing is that it's, I was going to say this for the good quizzes, but the neat thing is that it's a little different application of the canalization model I showed before. So you have a vascular strand forming from a source to a sink. Whereas here we have exactly what you noticed. There aren't strands forming from sources to sinks. We have this venation. To sinks. We have this venation that isn't connecting the sources to the sinks. Does that mean that the thing is actually transporting up the concentration gradient bit? Is that right? I don't think in this case... Because it looks like the edges are the regions of highest oxid concentration. Yeah, so it's transporting towards the edges, which seems to be bytoing up the concentration gradient. Yeah, it's kind of I suppose so, yeah, but so it's a little bit confusing because there's a different model of oxygen-based patterning that is called up the gradient. And it works in a different way that it generates these sources of oxygen. You have kind of a uniform distribution, and you run this model, and then it generates the sources of oxygen. Where it's like, but actually, there was a talk, but I don't remember who was talking during this workshop. Where it was shown that this sort of self-enhancement, the anti-diffusion coefficient, might not be self-diffusion exactly going anyway. So don't worry, that counts as questions. Okay. No, it's great. It's great. As long as there isn't anything I can't answer, it's great. So there are so so compared to the real vination in this paleo leaf though, there are some it's it's close, but there are some discrepancies and Close, but there are some discrepancies. And the main one is, I think there was the talk as well about leaf terror element this morning, but the mid-vein, of course, is straight in the real E4, well, I mean, a little bit straight, whereas in the model, it zigzags. And that's just due to the asymmetric distribution of the radio assumptions of the model. Also, where the leaf attaches to the petrol to the rest of the plant, of course, that's not in the model, so there's a discrepancy there as well. Nonetheless, if you compare. As well. Nonetheless, if you compare regions or zones of the nation, so where they are labeled in different colors, between the real plant and the model, there's a good correspondence. Okay, so that is one way to model loops in plants. And now I'm going to switch over to modeling loop formation in flower heads. And of course, the big difference between leaves and flower heads, I mean, there's many differences, but one of the big differences is that you can see One of the big differences is that you can see the leafination in the leaf, and in a flower head, it's all hidden inside the flower, so you can't just look at it. And that's why we, with our collaborators from the University of Helsinki, we collected many samples of different flower heads from the aster family, so like squirrel brush sunflower and daisy. And they were dried out, and then we took them to this large synchrotron facility. Synchrotron facility called the Canadian Light Source on Saskatoon. So here you can see the scale of this building, and within this gigantic building, we placed our little flower head samples here. And so after a few hours and... And $1 million. Well, this is a government-funded facility, so anyone can apply from anywhere in the world and get tied on the V-line, and you can scan different. uh scan different what well whatever you'd like to scan. I suppose, yeah, there there's some there's some caveats that uh we had the advantage that our samples were dry so it was easy to get them. But if you have like living samples then it's a little bit more challenging. But otherwise anyone is welcome to go use it. Although I gotta say, it is uh it is hard work. The secretron is on and you might be allocated time in the middle of the night and you're uh that's the time you get to scan stuff. That's the time you need to scan stuff. Oh. Okay. Okay, so after scanning and reconstructing the samples, then the result is this kind of volumetric rendering of a flower head. So here's a curved flower head. And of course, the big advantage of X-ray micro CT computer tomography is that you can split this volume in into different parts and look at the inside of it. Into different parts and look at the inside of that. Especially you can look at the basculature. That's what we are interested inside of that. However, we realized that just looking at these volumetric renderings is nice, but it doesn't really give you much information about how the patterns are, what the patterns look like. So some students in the lab, they worked on tools to segment the different tissues. Basically, to label the different tissues. Phil Mogu, he was the main developer of a system that used stereostopic. In that use stereoscopic display to give the user kind of an idea of the depth of the sample. So, some kind of faked 3D view. And this haptic device, which is pretty neat, it gives you a force feedback. So as you're labeling, you can actually touch parts of the sample and it will push back as you're touching. Which we found pretty helpful in labeling these scans. And he also implemented this idea where. Implemented this idea where as you're tracing out a vascular strand, this device is attracted into the center of the strand to facilitate the segmentation process. So we had pretty good success with that. We were able to segment many different flower heads. But I also want to mention another tool that we found very useful as well, which is developed by Jeremy Hart, a different master's student, using virtual reality based software. So Reality-based software. So, even though it looks a little bit silly to put this thing on your head, it is actually a very incredible immersive experience where you can take the sample of a flower head and bring it up into your head and look at all the different patterns of bashulature inside. And here you can see he's using these controllers to look around the head, and he's also using them to label different parts of the vasculature. So, as you drag this controller. So, as you drag this controller through the air, it colors these white strands into green so you could identify different parts. And in the end, what you get out of that is this segmented flower head. So, here's an image of our Gerber flower head that was segmented by Jeremy. And my running out of time is one minute. Okay. All right. So, you can peel back the different layers and. So you can peel back the different layers and then get a good sense of how the vascular looks like. And so just basically to go through. Yes, so in the end, I was the group about that. But we also looked at many different species and we found different architectures like monochordial, synchoidial, and reticulate. And of course, because it's nature, there's a big mix of all these architectures. But I wanted to show you this reticulate pattern. And first, what we observed is that the reticulate pattern actually forms. The reticulate pattern actually forms over different growth stages of the flower head. So, in the early growth stages, the vasculature follows just one family of periskitches, and then later you add the second family of peristiches. And to model that, we took our volumetric data and sliced it into longitudinal sections and computed how the surface of the flower head grows. We modified an existing model that we had made for Gerber. Model that we had made for Kerbera to simulate the patterning of the florids on the surface of the flower head. And then, okay, okay, and then, so before, yeah, maybe I have to skip past this pretty quickly. So we had this model for brachaponium that simulates the vascular turbulation. But then that is way too computational intensive to model vascular inside these huge flower heads. So, Andrew Owens developed a particle. But more particle-based method that adds vasculature as tips to this growing geometric representation where it's attracted kind of to existing vasculature and to the base of the tissue. But actually we've find it even more based on Adam Reinan's model that was using, almost there, almost there. Ah, that minimizes the length of the, that adds a new vein in one single simulation step. Step and it minimizes the length of the vein connecting to existing vasculature and the length of a point of attachment from a vein to the leaf base. So depending on these parameters, you can get a diverse representation of the kind of patterns of leaf relation you see in nature. But when we tried it, it didn't work for flower heads because when you do distance-based, it actually produces vascular patterns that switch between the different pairs to pieces and become unregular. becomes an unregular pattern. So we modified it to use instead of minimizing, well, I skipped a lot of details there. Instead of minimizing based on distance, we minimize resistance based on the age of primordial. So we go towards the oldest primordial. And because our data show or indicated that the second vascular pattern forms with a delay, so we applied the same algorithm, but this time to the second oldest primary algorithm. And that's what produced these particular patterns. And it's much The patterns, and it's much easier to understand what's going on if you just video what's happening. So, here we're connecting to the bracks and then to the florids, and you see the first family of peristickies being formed, and now the second family formed. Okay, so this guy showed the best patterning in paella leaves and in Dallas flower heads. Leaves and in Della's flower heads using imaging and modeling. The key takeaways are that oxygen-based leaf polarization versus veins with loops, and there's this unexpected connection to Voronoi diagrams, and then we have this time-dependent algorithm for finding particular patterns of flower heads. Of course, the big question is to what extent do these models generalize, and that's where the point is. What we really learned is that we don't know that much about vascular patterns. I'm just going to go quickly through this and Going to go quickly through this. And so these are the collaborators for the Paella Relief, Mono Tishi Zhang, and Saket Noveka from Cook Speak Harbor. Then we have the flowerhead, we have Shitra Kurun-Kran and Jarvis Stokes from Canyon Light Source, Paula Eloma, and Tang Jang were the flowerhead experts from the University of Helsinki, and then the rest, sort of the computer science guys from the University of Kyogre. So I know I'm definitely out of time, but if you want any more information, there's some links here for the papers. Links here for the papers and the software and the flower hub of the program. Thank you. Maybe we have time for one quick question from Mick. So in this cloud heads, you have like one fast collector going in one spiral. Yes. And the other one is going so they do not see each other anyway. So they do not see each other anyway? Uh the only way they see each other is that the the first one is formed first, and then when the second one has been formed with a time delay, then it sees the it won't connect to the existing one. It won't. It won't connect to the uh to the already pre-formed vest restraints. I believe in the model. We can check them in. In a way they are interconnected. But no. Although they are interconnected. I mean that uh when it's looking for a new connect the second spirals, when they're looking for a new connection. Spirals, when they're looking for a new connection, they won't connect to the folder volts. They only look for the second volt labor. Thank you, Rick.
