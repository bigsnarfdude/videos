Thank you very much, Donna. Hi, everyone, and thank you to the organizers for inviting me to give a talk. So, today I will be speaking on groups acting on rooted trees and their maximal support. So, let me first start with groups acting on rooted trees. And let me also say, when did they sort of first come about? And I guess one can sort of trace it back, trace the origin back to the burnside problem. And this arose from the famous this. Arose from the famous influential question from William Burnside, which he asked in 1902. And the question is: do there exist infinite, finitely generated torsion groups? So we know that the answer is yes. And Golod and Chaparevich gave the first construction in the 60s. However, their construction was non-explicit and it also was rather complicated. So where these groups acting on rooted trees kind of fit into the picture is that they were constructed in the 80s, first by Grigorjak and then a few years later. First, by Grigor Chok, and then a few years later, by Gupta and Sitki. And these groups acting on rooted trees gave the first explicit examples of infinite, finitely generated torsion groups. So this is kind of their claim to fame or their beginning. Yes. And so, but there are lots of groups acting on rooted trees out there. There's loads of groups acting on rooted trees. But the constructions by Grigori, Gupta, and Sitki, these are kind of groups acting on rooted trees. These are kind of groups acting on rooted trees with a very nice property. It's a kind of tree-like or branching property, which we'll go into a little bit further on in the talk. But these Grigorcho-Guptan Sitki groups are quite famous. You might have maybe heard of branch groups, which I'll talk a little bit about. Unfortunately, I won't have time today to define the Grigorcho-Guptan Sitki groups. They are quite easy to define. You can write down their generators quite quickly, but I'll be Quite quickly, but I'll be concentrating on some other groups in this talk. But yeah, this is just kind of where these groups acting on rooted trees kind of first fit into the picture. And of course, this burnside problem is a big influential problem. And there's so much more you can say concerning the burnside problem, which I am not saying. I just wanted to kind of sneak in where these sort of groups acting on rooted trees kind of fit into the picture. Okay, let me move away from this slide and kind of. And kind of define these groups acting on rooted trees with a special sort of tree-like branching property that we're going to focus on. Okay, so as I mentioned in the previous slide concerning these Kugotsa groups and Sitki groups, they're also, they were the first sort of pioneering examples in a larger family of special groups acting on rooted trees, which we call branch groups. So these have been quite well studied over the last 20 years or so. And what's maybe less Or so, and what's maybe less known is this slightly more general family, which we call weekly branch groups, and these are the ones we're going to look at today. And so, as I was vaguely saying, that the groups that we're going to be interested in, these sort of weekly branch or branch groups, are groups acting on rooted trees with this sort of special tree-like branching property. So, a branch group just has this tree-like branching property in a strong sense, and a weakly branch group just has it in a slightly weaker sense. Okay, but But first of all, these are groups acting on rooted trees, infinite rooted trees. And a wiki branch group can act on quite a general infinite rooted tree. But I'm going to just look at the case where you act on a very nice tree, which is what we call a regular rooted tree. And I'm just going to define weekly branch bits in the setting just because it's the most well-studied case and it just simplifies things. One thing about our tree, so I will show you a picture on the next slide or so. On the next slide or so, but we always draw our trees growing downwards. So we have the root at the top, and then the children of the root are drawn kind of right below the root and they kind of form the first layer or the first level of the tree. And then their children form the second level of the tree and so on all the way to infinity. So that's kind of how we're going to picture our tree. Right. Okay, so to define weekly branch groups acting on such a regular rooted tree, I first need to, okay, so first of all, weekly branch groups. Okay, so first of all, a weekly branch group is first of all a subgroup of the full automorphism group of such a tree of tree, capital T, a regular rooted tree. So, first of all, it's a subgroup of OT. And it has to satisfy two conditions. Okay, so the first condition is it needs to have this tree-like substructure, which I will go into more detail in the slides to come. But yeah, that's one condition. And the second is it has to act transitively at every level or every layer of your tree. Or every layer of your tree. Okay, so that's what it takes to be a weekly branch group. So, before I kind of formally more precisely say what this tree-like substructure is, let me first of all say why are people interested in studying these weekly branch groups? So, one reason is that within your class of weekly branch groups, you often find groups which are easy to describe, very explicit, which is nice, but also have sort of what we call exotic algebraic properties. We call exotic algebraic properties, such as, so, um, and often we're looking only at finite generated groups with these interesting algebraic properties. So, the first example would be, and in fact, the very first example of such a group was in the class of weekly branch groups. So, yeah, the first example of a finitely generated group of intermediate word growth. If you do not know all these terms mean, if you do not want to know what these terms mean, it's fine, it doesn't matter. It's just to give you an idea of why these groups are important. These groups are important. And actually, this first example was the Grigorchev group, which I mentioned but I'm not going to define, unfortunately. Another reason why this, another such instance of this is that within your class of weekly branch groups, also the first example finitely generated amenable, but not elementary amenable group was a weekly branch group. And again, this was the Grigorcho group, the first ever constructed such branch group. The next example is. The next example is not a branch group, but a weakly branch group. So, this gave us the first example of a finitely generated amenable, but not sub-exponentially amenable group. Again, don't worry about what all these terms mean. And this third example is a group called the Basilica group, which is a very well-studied or quite a well-studied weekly branch group, which we will define in the coming slides. And the last thing I want to say about why the class of weekly branch groups is important. Branch groups are important. Is this quite a general comment? But anyway, again, within your class of weekly branch groups, you find finite generated groups which you can use to answer open questions. So sorry, this is quite a vague statement, such as involving finiteness properties. So this has to do with the work of Rachel Skipper and her collaborators, for example. And you can also use, one has used, well, yeah, people have used wiki branch groups or branch groups to disprove conjectures. Again, this is. Branch groups to disprove conjectures. Again, this is quite a vague statement, for example, in cohomology and et cetera. So, this is just roughly to give you an idea of why the class of weekly branch groups is important. Okay, but let's now define weekly branch groups. So, but if you remember in the previous slide, I said a weekly branch group is first of all a subgroup of the full automorphism group of your tree, and it satisfies two conditions. One is that it's transitive. Conditions. One is that it's transitive at every level of the tree, and the second condition is it has this tree-like subgroup structure. So, let me kind of say a bit more what this tree-like subgroup structure is. However, before I do that, we need to kind of understand the tree and understand the full automorphism group of the tree. Oh yeah, sorry. So, the definition I'm going to give is actually of not of the general definition of a weakly branch group, but a slightly restricted version, just because it's easier to define. And that's the, these are the groups we're going to be. That's the these are the groups we're going to be looking at. Um, so I just put it in brackets that actually I'm going to give the definition of a regular weekly branch group, but it's um don't worry about it. Okay, but in order to define the sort of tree-like subgroup property that a weekly branch group has to satisfy, let's first try and understand our regular rooted tree. And in particular, what can we say about the full automorphism group of our regular rooted tree? So, here we've got a tree which I've called capital T. A tree which I've called capital T. And again, this is an infinite rooted tree. So I've only drawn kind of the first, the top part of the tree. So here is usually the root. And let's say the, in this tree, let's say it's a five regular tree. So every vertex, so the meaning of a regular tree is every vertex has the same number of children. So let's suppose that the root has five children. So you've got five vertices here. I haven't drawn everything. And again, all these vertices here, your first level vertices, so to speak, will have five children. So, to speak, will have five children and so on, all the way to infinity. So, I haven't. So, this verse X needs to have five children, and then they need to have further five children, and so on. So, I haven't drawn the full tree, of course. Okay, what do we observe about this tree? So, there's actually a lot of symmetry to this tree, being a regular rooted tree. So, one thing that's going to come in handy, if you consider the whole picture of the tree as a whole, and if you look now at this Look now at this everything hanging from the leftmost first level vertex. So, here's my leftmost first level vertex. And if you look at everything hanging from this vertex, we call that the sub-tree rooted at this first level vertex here. That whole sub-tree is identical to your original tree, isn't it? It's just your regular rooted tree. So, this whole tree here, this sub-tree, this maximal sub-tree, we say, is identical to the original tree. And likewise, from this vertex here, you again have a maximum. Vertex here, you again have a maximal sub-tree, which I haven't drawn, which is identical to your whole original tree, and so on. Here, this maximal subtree is likewise identical to your original tree. So, using that observation, we can actually give this useful decomposition for the full automorphism group OT of the tree. We have that every automorphism in Otta, you can split it as a bit that stabilizes your first level vertices, and this corresponds to this direct product here. Direct product here. So, because if you fix your first level of vertices, you're doing something at the subtree here. And of course, the subtree is identical to your original tree. So, that's why you have M copies if your tree is an M regular rooted tree here. So, this bit here corresponds to the bit of your osomorphism that fixes your first level vertices. And then, of course, you have a bit that could permute your first level vertices, and that is just the symmetric group on M. Just the symmetric group on M element. So you can always decompose any automorphism in this form. So let's be a bit more specific. So if we had an element F, which is an automorphism of the tree, you can write it as a bit that stabilizes your first level vertices. And usually we use the sort of M to pull this coordinate form to describe an automorphism that fixes your first level vertices. So the components kind of tell you what's happening at sort of your relevant maximal sub-tree. Sort of your relevant maximal subtree. And then here you've got tau, which is in the symmetric group of m elements. So that's the bit, the tau is the bit that permutes your first level vertices. So you can always write any automorphism of the tree in this manner. And we will use the sort of this tuple form whenever we're talking about an automorphism that fixes your first level vertices. Okay, what have I done in this slide? I've gone on to talk about the tree having all the sub-trees being identical to the original tree. Being identical to the original trees, the symmetry that your tree has, and that has led to this semi-direct product decomposition for OT. But the plan was, of course, to tell you what this tree-like subgroup structure property that a weekly branch group should have. So how does this help us define this tree-like subgroup property that we need in order to define a weekly branch group? So it turns out the semi-direct product here will give us the tree-like. Is will give us the tree-like property that we need. Okay, so in particular, okay, we've got the semi-direct product which we saw before, but in particular, what's useful for us is the fact that we've got M copies. So remember, M is the sort of branching degree of the tree. So we've got M copies of Otta sitting inside OT. So strictly speaking, this direct product is isomorphic to a subgroup of OT, but I just wrote a subgroup here. Never mind. But yes, you've got M copies of OT sitting inside OT, and of course, within each. Or t and of course, within each copy of OT, you again have m copies of all t sitting inside there. So you kind of have more and more powers of m copies of all t sitting inside all t. So this last line here, in words, you would say that Otti branches over itself. So this is sort of the tree-like subgroup structure or branching property that we want our weekly branch group to have. Okay, so now we can give the definition of our weekly branch. Can give the definition of our weekly branch group. So a group G is weekly, is called weekly branch if it remember has to satisfy two things. It acts transitively at every level of the tree. And so it is a bit much to expect the group to sort of branch over itself. So here we saw in the line above OT branches over itself. But that's quite a strong condition to require. So to be a weakly branch group, we just require that there's some Branch group, we just require that there's some non-trivial subgroup K, capital K, that branches over itself. So K may not be the whole group G, but that's okay. So to be a weakly branch, as long as there's some non-trivial K that branches over itself, you're good. Okay, so let's now look at, so that's the definition of a weekly branch group. Let's now look at an example of a weekly branch group, a concrete example. But before I move on to the next slide, I did mention the stronger class of group. Stronger class of group called branch groups. So, the Gregorcio group is an example for branch group. So, the difference here is that the branching condition that we have is stronger. If you want to define a branch group, how do we make it stronger? Okay, so if you want to define a branch group, you just need, so everything stays the same, apart from the fact you need K to have finite index in G. And then it's a branch group. So, if K, so if K has infinite index in G, K has infinite index in G, it's just the weekly branch group. So that's kind of the difference there. Okay, so let's look at an example. And the example I want to give of a weekly branch group that is also not branch is the basilica group, which is quite a well-studied weekly branch group. And so let's here the basilica group is going to act on a regular rooted tree. And let's suppose M is the branching degree of the tree. So every vertex has got M children. Has got M children. Actually, traditionally, classically, the basilica group was defined to act just on the two-adic tree, the binary rooted tree, but recently it's been generalized to act on sort of a wider range of regular rooted trees. So the term here, M-adic, is just the same as saying an M regular rooted tree. Okay, so M has to be at least two. A very well-studied case is when M is a prime number, but here we're not insisting that M is a prime. Okay, the basilica groups are. Okay, the basilica group is generated by two elements, and we usually denote the generators by little a and little b. And in order to define these generators, little a and little b, I just need to set some notation. And the notation is that, remember when we were talking about the decomposition of the full automorphism group of the tree of ORT, we have a bit that stabilizes your first level vertices, and then you've got a bit that permutes your first level vertices. So here. Your first-level vertices. So, here we're going to let sigma to be the automorphism that permutes your first-level vertices. So, in other words, the root, which we sometimes use the symbol, the non-empty set symbol to denote the root. So, sigma permutes the first-level vertices cyclically. So, in other words, your sigma is just your n cycle. Okay, right. Okay, so now let's define the two generators for the basilica group. So, yes, we usually write little a and little b to be the generators. Little a and little b to be the generators, and unfortunately, I can't just kind of give you the definition of a and b straight away because they are recursively defined in terms of each other, but it's still quite easy to define, write down what they are. So, okay, so let's have a look at a over here. So, here I've got this coordinate description, which is telling us that A stabilizes the first level vertices of our M regular rooted tree, our M-adic tree. And on the left, M minus one first-level vertices, One first level vertices: we have just a trivial action on the sub-trees rooted at these m minus one left first level vertices, and on the very right subtree rooted at first level vertex, on the very right, we've got b okay, so what does it mean to act at that subtree like b? Well, we go over to the right and look at what the definition for b. So, b, we've got, as you see, this tuple, which is the bit of b that stabilizes your first-level vertices, and then you also have a sigma. level vertices and then you also have a sigma which is our m cycle so you also permute so b permutes your first level vertices cyclically and then it has a corresponding action on your m maximal subtrees according to the tuple so trivial on the left m minus one subtrees and then you act like a on the right most subtree so and to understand what you mean to act as a on this right subtree you go back and have a look at the description of a so you kind of go back and forth between a and b um to help you understand what's going on a bit better To help you understand what's going on a bit better, how these generators act on the tree, let's look at well, let's look at a picture of how you would depict their action on the tree. So, let's now look at a picture. So, or what we say, sort of a portrait of the action of A on the tree. So, remember, our trees, we always draw them to grow downwards. So, we've got the root up here. And when I write nothing here at the root, that means essentially that this element A, which we know fixes. A, which we know fixes your first level vertices. If I had sigma up here, that would mean I'm permuting the first level vertices, but I don't have sigma there. And yes, so you see you've got ones for the first m minus one first level vertices, and you've got B here on the right. Okay, that's A, the description of A up to the first level of your tree. And likewise, B, we would have a similar picture, but of course we've got sigma up here because B has that sigma, the permutation of the first level vertices as well. As well. Okay, so these two just give you the sort of pictorial description of A and B only up to the first level of your tree. If you want to understand how, say, A acts on the tree up to the second level, what would you do if you want to try and understand what's going on here, for instance? I mean, the other bits is just trivial. So if you want to understand how the action of A on the subtree root is at the right most first level vertex, you would just take the picture of B that you have here and just stick it here. Okay? It here, okay, like that. So that gives you the description of A up to the second level of the tree, and you could keep on going. You then take the picture of A that we had on the previous page and put it here, and so on. So you see that if you follow the rightmost infinite path of your tree, remember our tree is infinite, you see sigma appearing sort of alternate layers. So that's how A operates. Okay, so that's the generasis of our basilica group. What can we Basilica group, what can we say about the properties of our basilica group? So, let's have a look at some quick properties. So, although in the generators you have this P cycle sigma, which is a torsion element, of course, sorry, M cycle, the group G is actually torsion free. There are no torsion elements. And the abelianization is perhaps what you'd expect it to be is just Z cross Z. And it is a weekly branch group, and actually, a regular weekly branch. And actually, your regular weekly branch group. And in the branching subgroup, our capital K, in the definition of a weekly branch group, you can take the derived subgroup to be your capital K. And of course, you see from the point above that the derived subgroup has infinite index, which is giving you an indication that this is, although it's a weekly branch group, it's not a branch group. Right. Okay, so this is an example of a weekly branch group acting on our M regular rooted tree. Tree. A lot of these, as with this example, a lot of sort of the key examples of weekly branch groups that one deals with, so the Grigorcia group, the Guttasiki groups, they live in the infinite iterated wreath product of a fixed cyclic group. So in this case, this group lives, it's a subgroup of the infinite iterated wreath product of the cyclic group of order n. So this is often the case with lots of these constructions. Okay, right. Okay, right. But although we have lots of weekly branch groups acting on rooted trees, you also have lots of groups acting on rooted trees that are not weakly branched. So it's not the case that all groups acting on rooted trees are weakly branched. So let's have a look at an example of a group that's not weakly branched. And the example, you don't have to look really far to find an example because the infinite cyclic group is such an example. For group acting on a rooted tree that's not weakly brought. acting on a rooted tree that's not weakly branch so how do you see um how can you see an action of the infinite cyclic group on the rooted tree so you can define um the generator a as follows so the it's the the bit of it that um stabilizes your first level vertices it has a again and then you've got sigma so this is sort of a recursive definition and if you were to draw the portrait as we did unlike what we saw for the basilica group where you had sigma We saw for the basilica group where you had sigma appearing on every other level along the rightmost infinite path. Here, you would for this generator have sigma appearing in every level along the rightmost infinite path. So, there's a difference going on here. But yes, so this group generated by A is isomorphic, well, it's the infinite cyclic group, and it's called the adding machine. It's also called the odometer, which was mentioned in Zoran's talk on Tuesday. But, yeah, so this is an example of a group that's not. Example of a group that's not weakly branched. Okay, what we're going to do now to end sort of the introductory part of the talk is to introduce a recent idea from two PhD students from Dusseldorf. What they did is they looked at the odometer here and the basilica group that we saw in the previous slide, or the previous few slides, and sort of Observed a connection between the odometer and the basilica group and generalize that. So, and this connection or what they this generalization is called what's called the basilica operation. Okay, what is it? So, the odometer is generated by this generator, which I called A. And what you want to notice is that, yes, you've got A on the left, but here A refers to itself within this tuple. Okay, and Okay, and the basilica group, the generators, we had A and B, where here A first refers to B, and but B then refers to the first generator A, and then you've got sigma. So in some sense, you could view the basilica group as a delayed version of the odometer, that you have to first go through B before you get back to referring to A, the first generator, and with your sigma permutation. Okay, so you could take this further, and this is what Petri can write. Take this further, and this is what Petchik and Rajiv have done this year. They introduced the idea of what they called an S-step basilica operation. So you can view the basilica group as a two-step basilica operation because you need two generators before you then, the second generator refers back to the original generator. So if we had a three-step facility operation, we need three generators. And so A would then refer to B and it will stabilize your first level vertices. It will stabilize your first level vertices, and B again would stabilize all first-level vertices and would refer to the third generator C, and then C would refer back to the first generator, which is A, and have the sigma permutation added onto it. And then you can keep on going. You could have a four-step, have four generators, or more generally, S generators. So you see A1 refers to A2, and then A2 would refer to A3 at the next level, and so on. Whoops, sorry. Sorry. Yeah, and so on up until AS, which refers to the first generator A1 and has the signal. Okay, so these groups are called the generalized basilica groups. And Petric and Rajiv studied them in a much more general context as to how I'm defining here. And but yeah, we'll just leave it at this on this slide. Okay, so the point is, this is now the yeah, this is the end of my. This is now the yeah, this is the end of my introduction to the talk. I'm now going to move on to the second part of my talk, which is to talk about maximal subgroups of weekly branch groups, but I will come back to these generalized specific groups right at the end of that section. Okay, so now moving on to maximal subgroups of first of all, branch groups, because this is a more well-established topic. Okay, so I mean, there are many things one would like to know about maximum sub. Would like to know about maximal subgroups of branch groups or weekly branch groups. And the main thing that I'm interested in, or that people are interested in, is the index. So which branch groups have maximal subgroups only of finite index, and which branch groups have maximal subgroups of infinite index. So the story is not very old. It began in 2005 with the work of Provova, and she looked at the early constructions of branch groups. Of branch groups. And she looks at the torsion, Grigorcho groups, and the torsion, what we call GGS groups, which stand for Grigocho, Gupta, and Sidki, which I unfortunately I didn't define, but it's basically a family that very much resembles the early constructions by Grigocho, Gupta, and Sidki. Hence, it's named after them. Anyway, Provova showed that here you never find maximal subgroups of infinite index. They all have finite index. And furthermore, Have finite index, and furthermore, these groups only have finitely many maximal subgroups, and they're also all normal. Okay, so this was the first result that sort of kicked off this subject, maximal subgroups of branch groups. But then Bondorenko showed five years later that you do have maximum branch groups, finitely generated branch groups, with maximal subgroups of infinite max. So they do exist. However, Bondarenko's result is his groups are not explicit. His groups are not explicit. And also, his construction doesn't work for the two-addic and the three-adic tree. You need trees of higher degree for his construction to work. So, and then, but what's we do have some explicit examples now of finitely generated branch groups with maximal subgroups of infinite index. And this came from the work of Dominic Franco and Alejandro Carrito in 2018. And they looked at the non-torsion Sunich groups. So, again, I'm not going to define Sunich groups, unfortunately. Again, I'm not going to define Sunich groups, unfortunately. So, these were groups defined by Zora and Sunich, and they're also called siblings of the Grigorcha group because they quite closely resemble the Grigorcha groups, the original, the first construction of branch groups. And you have torsion ones, torsion Sunich groups, non-torsian Sunich groups. And they act on binary, two-added trees, three-added trees higher. But so Dominic and Alejandro showed that the non-torsian Sunich groups that act on the binary rooted tree, they do have maximal subgroups. Tree, they do have maximal subgroups with infinite index. So these give the first explicit examples. Okay, there have been more results concerning maximal subgroups of branch groups. I'm not going to mention because I want to move on to talk about maximal subgroups of weekly branch groups. But let me just say a few things. So there are many reasons why one will want to understand maximal subgroups. There are lots of applications out there, and it's whether the applications of having maximal subgroups. Applications of having maximum subgroups only a finite index or having maximum subgroups of infinite index. But let me mention maybe some general comments. So, one concerning maximum subgroups of infinite index. So, as we saw in Tim's talk last and also other talks, that if you're interested in sort of primitive actions, if you know that you have a maximal subgroup of infinite index, then you have a primitive action on your infinite set of cosets of your maximal subgroups. So that could Your maximum subgroups. So that could be of interest. And another thing that kind of is in line with what I mentioned more at the beginning of why the class of branch groups or weekly branch groups are of interest to people is that Franco and Garrido's results. So they're these non-Torsian Sunic groups that have maximal subgroups of infinite index. They also have countably many maximal subgroups of infinite index, if I remember correctly. And if I remember correctly as well, this is the first. Correctly, as well. This is the first example of an infinite, finitely generated group with countably many maximal subgroups of infinite index. I think previous examples of, say, finitely generated linear groups with maximal subgroups of infinite index, you have uncountably many maximal subgroups of infinite index. So you get kind of new groups cropping up among your class of branch groups or weakly branch groups. Okay, but yes, so there's a bit more to say regarding maximal subgroups of branch groups, but I'll leave it. Groups of branch groups, but I'll leave it here and move on to talk about maximal subgroups of weekly branch groups. So, this is a slightly newer. Yeah, so this is the story is not as well established. So, it's really only a year old so that people have started looking at maximal subgroups of weekly branch, but not branch groups. One of the reasons why people have only started looking at maximal subgroups of weekly branch, but not branch. Branch, but not branch groups is because previously the techniques which one would use to study or to determine whether your maximum subgroups of branch groups have finite index or infinite index is the technique is due to Provova and it only worked for branch groups. But Dominic Franke last years generalized Provova's technique so that it now works for weekly branch groups. So now one can study maximal subgroups of weekly branch groups that are not necessarily branch. Are not necessarily branched, such as the basilica group, which is not branch, but it is weakly branched. And Dominic has shown that here you do not find maximal subgroups of infinite index. So they all have finite index. And then together with Dominic, we looked at the GGS groups, which stand for Grigor Group Tensitki, which I did not define, sorry. But most of these GGS groups are branch, but you have some that are not branch, but they are weakly branch. Branch, but they are weakly branch. Here, likewise, we've shown that you do you never find maximal subgroups of infinite index, they're all finite. And one thing, if you want to compare these results to the ones we saw on the previous page regarding Provova's result, where you only had maximal subgroups of finite index, so the group of torsion Gragosia groups and the torsion GGS groups. These are quite different. Well, they're different in the sense that back there for branch groups, when you only have maximal. Groups where you, when you only have maximal subgroups of finite index, they will all the maximal subgroups are normal, and you only have finitely many maximal subgroups. But here on this page, for these wiki branch, but not branch groups, you have maximal subgroups of finite index that are not normal, and you also have infinitely many maximal subgroups. So something, it's not quite the same as for branch groups, even if the result is the same that you have no maximal subgroups of infinite index. Okay, and the last. Index. Okay, and the last results I want to mention here on this page is joint work with Khartika Rajif. And we've looked at those generalized basitical groups that we saw at the end of the first part of the talk and shown likewise here you do not find maximal subgroups of infinite index. So I guess looking at this page, you might wonder whether there even exists a weekly branch, but not branch group that has maximal subgroups. Group that has maximal subgroups of infinite index. So we don't have any examples at the moment. So that would be an interesting question to answer. Right. Okay. So now let me tell you a little bit about how the proof works for this last result here. And luckily, or in some sense, for all of the results, even those for branch groups and weekly branch groups, there's sort of a one underlying strategy that is originally due to Provova, but Dominique Franco extended. Rova, but Dominique Franco extended it to so that works for most weekly branch groups. So the idea is: so if you're out, look, if you're out there looking for maximal subgroups of infinite index, so one uses the reformulation of maximal subgroups of infinite index as proper pro-dense subgroups. So if you're looking for, so basically, if you're looking for maximal subgroups of infinite index, you want to be looking for proper pro-dense subgroups. What does it mean to be? Subgroups. What does it mean to be pro-dense? So, this is quite a general concept. So, you have any group G, a subgroup of it is called pro-dense. So, H is pro-dense. If whenever you take a non-trivial normal subgroup N, your product, H with N, should give you the whole group. And this is for whatever normal, non-trivial normal subgroup, capital N you take. So, this is what it means to be pro-dense. Okay, so where's the link between maximal subgroups of infinite syndex? Groups of infinite index. So Dominique Franker showed that if you have a weakly branch group, then every maximal subgroup of infinite index is pro-dense. And of course, if it's a maximal subgroup, it's a proper subgroup. So it's a proper pro-dense subgroup because the whole group G itself is pro-dense. So if H was equal to G, it still satisfies your definition of being pro-dense. So with this first result here from Dominic Franco, if you're wanting to look for maximal software, If you are wanting to look for maximal subgroups of infinite index, you should be looking for proper pro-dense subgroups. On the other hand, if you want to show that there are no maximal subgroups of infinite index, you want to show that all your pro-dense subgroups are equal to the whole group. Okay, so if you want to show that there are no maximal subgroups of infinite index, you want to take an arbitrary pro-dense subgroup, an arbitrary pro-dense subgroup. An arbitrary pro-dent subgroup and show that it has to be the whole group. Okay, so you want to show that there are no proper protein subgroups out there. How do we do this? So, this is a second result from Dominic Franco that will help us reach our goal. And so I put a little asterisk there. So it's not, it doesn't hold. Well, we don't know if it holds for all weekly branch groups yet. There's an extra condition that you need, which is a bit technical, which is why I'm not mentioning it, but it's quite a natural condition. So let me just leave it as. So let me just leave it as weekly branch with an asterisk. Anyway, so if you have a maximal subgroup of infinite index, which by the previous result we know is a proper pro-den subgroup, but anyway, you have, suppose you have a maximal subgroup of infinite index in your weakly branch group. Then, no matter which vertex you take in your tree, in your infinite rooted tree, you can go as far down the tree as you like. But for any vertex that you pick, what we call What we call sort of the natural projection of our maximal subgroup to the subtree rooted at your vertex V. So, in a sort of a natural sense, I'm not defining it properly, but if you consider the restriction of your subgroup M to the subtree rooted at your chosen vertex V, then this should still be a proper subgroup and, in fact, a maximal subgroup of infinite index in the relevant restriction of your whole group G to the sub-tree. Whole group G to the sub-tree rooted at V. Okay, so I guess this is quite a natural thing to expect. If you're maximal of infinite index right at the top of your tree, then no matter where you sort of project in your tree, you kind of stay maximal of infinite index. So what's really important to us is the fact that not so much is the fact that if you're starting with a proper pro-dense subgroup, okay, you've got your maximal subgroup, which is has. Okay, you've got your maximal subgroup, which has to be a proper subgroup. And so, what so the result that we want, I'm going to talk about here in more detail is the last result on the previous slide, which was that if you look at a generalized basilica group, I'll recall the definition on the next slide. But yes, if you have a generalized basilica group, we want to show that there are no maximal subgroups of infinite index. So how are we going to use these two results? These two results. So, the plan is from the first result, we know that a maximal subgroup of infinite index is going to be a proper pro-dense subgroup. So, the plan is you take an arbitrary pro-dense subgroup, call it capital H. And we want to show that there exists some vertex now using the second result here of Dominic Franco. We want to show that for our arbitrarily chosen pro-dense subgroup H, that we can go, we can find some vertex deep down in the tree. Deep down in the tree, never mind where it is, but we can show that there exists some vertex V such that the restriction of our arbitrarily chosen pro-dense subgroup to that sub-tree rooted at V is the whole of G. Okay, so then we kind of violate the last statement here, which means that our arbitrarily chosen pro-dense subgroup can never be proper. So it can never be a maximal subgroup of infinity index. So that's kind of roughly the plan. So let's let me kind of write that. The plan. So let's let me kind of write that all down again on the next slide. So this is what we do for the generalized basilica, the generalized basilica groups. So just recall the definition of a generalized basilica group, you can have S generators for S, any integer S, at least two. And remember, your first generator refers to the second one in its first level decomposition. The second one, A2, will refer likewise to the third one. 2 will refer likewise to the third one, and so on, until the last one, the S1 AS, will refer back to the first generator, and then you have your M cycle sigma. Okay, so this was the definition of a generalized basilica group. And let's recall again the definition of being a pro-dense subgroup here, because we're going to need this. Okay, so a subgroup is pro-dense. Whenever you take any non-trivial normal subgroup capital N, the product H of N is the whole group G. Right. Right, how are we going to proceed? So, the plan is, as I said on the previous slide, but let me say it again: the plan is because we want to show that there are no proper pro-dense subgroups, which is equivalent to saying that there are no maximal subgroups of infinite index. That's what we want to show. Yes, the plan is to take an arbitrary pro-dense subgroup H of our generalized basilica group G. And this is a very trivial observation. Is a very trivial observation. Our group G, of course, is generated by A1 to AS. So, definitely the product of A1 to AS, A1 times A2 all the way up to AS, is certainly an element of G. Okay, and another fact is that the derived subgroup of our generalized specific group is certainly a non-trivial normal subgroup. Great, so now the plan is this, the derived subgroup is going to take the place of capital N in the definition of a prodense. Of a pro-dense in the condition for being a pro-dense subgroup, and so the fact that H is with taking H to be a pro-dense subgroup, this tells us so the pro-density of H implies that you can find some element little Z in the derived subgroup such that this element lies in H. So, where does this equation come? Where does it come from? It just comes from this equation here in the definition of being pro-dense. You just have to maybe move things around, but it's not difficult. Things around, but it's not difficult, it's not a big jump from this equation to get to this. So, pro density, because okay, so this element A1 times AS is an element of G, and pro density tells us that you have some little Z, which is in the commutative subgroup, such that this element is in capital H. Okay, so what do we do now? So, we work with this element. We do not know what little Z is, but it's in the commutative subgroup. And so, this is quite a standard approach in all. Quite a standard approach in all of these sort of results where you work with maximum subgroups of branch groups or weekly branch group. The plan is you work with this element here for this unknown z, never mind that you don't know what it is. And the plan is you kind of look at projections of this element down the tree in such a way that you kind of eventually get rid of your z. And so what one does, sorry, this is very vague, but roughly this is what one does, what one does. What one does, what one does, and what one could do. And so you can show that somewhere down the tree, there's some vertex v such that you can get rid of this z, but you're not exactly left with this product a1 times a2 times a3 all the way times as you get a reshuffled version of it. You don't know what, but at the end of the day, you have some product which has length. Some product which has length is a product of S elements. So you've got rid of Z, but at the expense that you could have reshuffled your product of A1, A2 all the way to AS. But never mind, this is still a huge gain because you now know that your product only consists of the S distinct generators in just some unknown order. So your pi is just some permutation in the symmetric group on S element. Okay, so Elements. Okay, so once you get this product of your S generators in some order, it's not too difficult. You have to be a bit careful. But basically, you can go further down the tree. You can find some deeper vertex and you can separate your product into the S distinct generators. And of course, once you have your, you found a projection down in the tree, which has all your S generators. Which has all your S generators, then you've shown that you've got some projection, some restriction to a certain subtree where it's not proper anymore. It's the whole group because you've got all the generators. So this shows that our randomly chosen pro-dense subgroup is never going to be proper. And that tells us we don't have any proper pro-dense subgroups, which is equivalent to saying that there are no maximal subgroups of infinite index in our generalized basilica group. Group. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say. I think I've run out of time, so thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Anita. So actually, the topic of that fit very well in this meeting. It's not the sort of thing I think about very often, but I think it, yeah, all those groups are different kinds of groups than what I usually think about. Does anyone have questions? Yeah, can I ask something? Sure. Sure. So you've shown us all these groups with only maximal subgroups of finite index, but what do you know about the finite images of all these branch and weakly branch groups? So the first example you gave us is a symmetric group as an image, but is there some, are they restricted, the finite images, or can you get anything or what? A lot of these groups are just infinite. Infinite. So all of their images would be non-trivial images would be finite. So for instance, the Grigorchok and the GGS groups here are just infinite. Actually, all of these groups on this page, they are just infinite. The other ones here, sorry, they're not just infinite. And you can probably get, but you're interested in the finite images, aren't you? Interested in the finite images, aren't you? Yeah, um, okay. So, um, one, so there are some with the tree structure, you've got your level stabilizers, which are normal subgroups of finite index. And there's another quite well-studied area of branch groups and weakly branch groups, which is called the congruent subgroup property, and which is whether every finite index subgroup contains one of these level stabilizers. Group contains one of these level stabilizers. And so, with these groups here, they have a weaker version. They don't satisfy that. So, you do have quotients which are not necessarily p power index. You have finite quotients which, because often the abelianization is just z cross z. And so you can have finite quotients of Quotients of all kinds of orders that you want. Can I say something a bit better? Yes, so with these groups on this page, we know that they have, if you take, if you're looking at, so any normal subgroup of p power index will contain one of these level stabilizers in your tree. So you have some control on those sorts of. On those sorts of finite quotients. So, if you're looking at finite quotients of p-power index, then that's maybe a bit more better understood. Does that answer your question? No, not really. Why are you saying the index should be a power of p? They are not always a power of p, but those are the ones that people like to look at for very other reasons. For very other reasons, for competing in the house of dimension or stuff, but you do have other finite quotients of other non-p-power index, but I'm not sure I can say anything about them, I'm afraid. If you take one of those level stabilizers, the quotient will be something like a wreath product of symmetric groups. Absolutely. Yes, because these groups also are subgroups of the infinite wreath product of your cyclic group of order P if you're looking at. Cyclogroup of order P, if you're looking at a P addict tree. So, yes, exactly. Yeah. My question is: can you get other finite images apart from just those? Aren't these groups solvable often? The reproducts of exact groups aren't there. No, they have a symmetric group sitting at the tree. No, no, that's the full automorphism group of the tree. These are defined by cycles, aren't they? They sit inside the infinite iterated wreath product or. Infinite iterated with product of the cyclic report, P, say. But they're not solvable. But the quotients must be, right? Yeah, the quotients, they have infinite derivatives that are not solvable, but not because they're simple bits. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Other questions? Sorry, maybe a question. Is there anything known about the finite indices? For example, are they bounded for the basilica group or the generalized basaltic group? So these groups acting on rooted trees are residually finite. And if you just look at the levels. And if you just look at the level stabilizers, the intersection of all your level stabilizers is trivial. So the index is always when you're looking at a level stabilizer and you increase the level, the index is always going to grow. But is the level stabilizer a maximal sublude? No. Sorry, was your question regarding maximal software? Yes, yes. Regarding maximal subgroup, yes, yes. I see. Oh, sorry. Um, for this page, yes. So, for instance, you have a maximal subgroup for index any prime. So you can always find them for this for these weekly branch groups. But on the previous page, you only have finitely many maximal subgroups or finite index. So the branch groups are more restrictive. Okay, other questions? Okay, perhaps it seems not. All right, thank you again, Anita, for this talk. Thank you as well. Yeah, and so let me.
