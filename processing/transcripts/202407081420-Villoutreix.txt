Okay, so thank you everyone for having me. I'm really interested in the broad question of how you make from one cell into similar organs of. And I've been interested in this question since my master's time when I had classes with anime and pensant at CRID. And that's the beginning for me of knowing about more progress. And you can think of development as a very simple process where you have one cell that is fertilized and keeps on dividing. Is fertilized and keeps on dividing, and the cells change their internal chemical state to differentiate into specific cells like neurons and muscles. And they also move around and build some specific tissues. This is a process that you can find in most multicellular systems. And here are the typical model organisms that we usually study: nematode, CRT, Drosophila, zebrafish, mouse, and human. And the angle I'm trying to keep, which is rather different from the classes I had because it was mostly continuous, is to look at it at the single cell level and try to understand the relationship between how cells are dividing, so the cell history from the initial cell after successive rounds of divisions, their special relationships, so how they form tissues and how they grid these tissues, and the link to the gene ex gene expression trajectory, so how the So, how they change to go in specific cell phase, so how they become nervous system, for example, neurons or muscle cells. So, my plan today is to present three examples around these ideas. So, I hope it's not too much so easy. So, the first one is in the context of Josephila, and it's to highlight the relationship between how sides are dividing and their position in space. So, if you So, if you just think about it in a very general level, when you have an initial cell, it divides, and usually it divides next to its mother cell, and it divides again and again and again. So, from a given genealogy, if there is not so many cell rearrangements, you get some type of graph that is actually constrained by the cell histone. In the tissue, you have various of the cells, but I actually worked on one specific system where you can look at this. system where you can look at this tissue, sorry, this tree in space. And the system is the Drosophila ovaries. So it's a system where you have a ovocyte that is surrounded by 15 cells, so it's a system of 16 cells, and it has the specificity that the divisions are incomplete. So when you look at these 16 cells, you're actually looking at the history of division of the cells and how they are positioned in space. So you can acquire images where you can see the cells. You can acquire images where you can reconstruct the history of cell engine by counting the number of connections between cells. And from that, you can actually derive a tree. So you have the first cell which divides, and you can actually put a label on the cell because it divides always in the same way. And then you have four cells, eight cells, and 16 cells, where each of the cells on this tree here has a unique identifier that you can find in this tree display. That you can find in this 3D structure. So, then the question would be: how the fact that cells have divided this way constrains how they are positioned in space. For this, we analyzed several of those o-cytes and extracted the cell identity of each cell. And it's actually a network that you can reconstruct from this, where you have two types of edges: the one that corresponds to cell division. Cell division, so cells that come from the same mother, and then cell contact between cells. And you can also derive just how this cell lineage tree is positioned in space by looking at the relative position of the descendant from the initial cell. So if you start from the founder cell here, you have a first organization of cell around it. So 2539 in that case. And then you go at the next layer, you have also. And then you go at the next layer, you have also a specific relative positioning of the set that you can identify, and then you can do it one more time, and one more time. And so then you can just look at the leaves here, and that will summarize the spatial organization of all your cells that are then put in 3D. So that's what we did. So that's the unique identifier for this 3D structure. And actually, if you do the combinatorics of it, you can find 72 ways of embedding this very small tree. Of embedding this very small tree, at least in the plant, and those 72 ways, I mean 142, and then they have some symmetries, each of them correspond to one 3D structure. So what we did to see if there was some constraint between the lineage and the cell positioning of the cell was to acquire many. So we acquired 121 different samples and we looked at the statistics across each of the 72 states to see which one were more frequent and if it was uniform or not. Frequent than if it was uniform or not. So, what we found was that the histogram wasn't uniform. There were some states that were more often observed than others. So, to try to understand that, we did a simple model. So, this is a convex shape that has the same number of edges than our O side here. And for different planar outmitting of R trees, here, those two. Meaning of our tree here, those two, we computed the number of ways that we could put it on top of this shape to see how this planar could be put in 3D. And so, in that case, here, we only found one way to put it on top of the 3D structure, whereas in that case, we found six different ways. So, in terms of statistics, you can think about it as the six different microstates, the small one, for a given macro state, which is the organization of history. And that gave us also a histogram that was biased. Also, a histogram that was biased towards certain states that were more easy to have an interpretation of it is that a tree is more like a hyperbolic structure that tries to get more space. And if you put it in 3D like this on top of a surface, you actually constrain it. And some of the branches will have problem to find their room. So that's the hand-waving understanding. But I found it quite interesting to see that actually the cell history could constrain how the cells are. Could constrain how the cells are positioned in the space. The elementary difference between the two? Yeah, so if you look at, starting from the cell number one, at the relative position of the cells, so you see here around it you have 5932 and here you have 2953. So basically there are some flip between branches and that's enough to make it more difficult or less difficult to put onto this shape. Okay, so that was the first story. How does it compare with your measurement? Not one-to-one. It's the same period, but not one to one. We also did some simulation with attraction reduction between the cells. We also found a biased histogram, but LOC also went for next diaspora. Okay, so going back to this general scheme, the second Work that I wanted to present to you was the relationship between gene expression and spatial relationship cells in the tissue. And for this, I will use a muscle system in the mouse, which is the development of the heart. So this is a truly looping system. So you start from, I will actually direct you to on the skin. So you start from epithelial sheet that buckers in one direction, so it gets out of the plane like this. So it gets out of the plane like this, and then this part that occurs makes a tube, and the tube detaches from the bottom tissue and forms a completely disconnected tube, at least at the middle, and has a connection here at the arterial port and a connection here at the venous port. And this tube actually then loops on itself and makes the different bone checklist of the heart. So this is how you make a heart. It's a very simple system and it's quite similar to how you make the neurotube. How you make the neurotube active. And here the question we have is how to characterize this set of sets here that form the second heart field. So the tube is the first heart field and the tissue here is the second heart field. And what are the relationship to actually contributing to the tube? So basically what happens is that here you have the progenitor cells, so the undifferentiated cells, that proliferate and go inside the tube and we wanted to understand their behavior in the tissue. Understand their behavior in the tissue. For this, we established a pipeline from microscopy images where we extracted several features for individual cells. The features are size a bit small, so orientation, area, perimeter, eccentricity, and number of neighbors per cell. And then we also inferred some mechanical features using software by Lafayette Gemo, who's over GCC of Stefan. And here we have the stress map. And here we have the stress map, the pressure, and the stress anisotropy. And so our question was: can we in an unsupervised way, find some specific patterns and how do they relate to the tube system that we have? So this tissue here is the one that I have put here. It's the second part of it directly. So you have to imagine that there is a tube coming from there and There is a tube coming from there, and the other part of the tube coming from there. So we tried to identify the specific cell features that were the most correlated to, on one hand, the variation within cells, and then the special patterning. So we used something called the spatial PCA, where we identify the specific features that are explaining both the variation within the data and the spatial organization of sensor. The most important features that we found. The most important features that we found were explaining the spatial pattern and the variation in the data were the orientation of size, the stress direction, so it's a bit similar to the orientation, and then the second set of features were the area and the pyramid. And so what we did was to cluster the cells according to those features. So I know it's a very computer scientist approach to a crowd of physicists, but that enabled us to actually find some. Enabled us to actually find some patterns into our tissue. So we found roughly three main groups of cells that are distributed in various parts of our tissue. So we have group one and two that are around the arterial pull, our arteries that go out like this, and that correspond to cells that are under isotropic stress and that are oriented in directions like this. So those two groups are opposite directions. And then Opposite directions. And then we found a third group that is closer to the venous pole here, where cells are under anisotropic stress here, so they're really poor. And the cells have a tendency in this part to align the anterior-costerior axis. So this is the purple. And we found that in several samples, they were cells of the group three are closer to the penis pole, and cells from the other groups are closer to the arterial pole. To the R terrible. So that's on the morphology part. Associated to it, there is some genetic patterning of our system. So here the two colors correspond to two sets of transcripts, so two genes that are expressed in different parts. You have to understand that you have these two here, cells that are proliferating and that either go in this direction or go in that direction. We've seen with the morphogenetic features that cells here. Genetic features that cells here go in this direction with an isotropic stress, and cells that go in this direction are under a stress that is anisotropic, and cells are a tendency to be aligned in this direction. So, we wanted to know what is the relationship with this genetic patterning. So, we did some perturbative experiment and found that if we remove the T-Bix files, so the patterns that is associated to the venous, I simplify a bit here, we lose our We lose our patterning of the tissue, so all of the three clusters are completely mixed. If we remove the TBX1, the pattern, the gene that is associated to the arterial pore, we keep the same structure, but the size of the tissue is much reduced. And then, if we look at the time point that is before the formation of this tube and before the expression of PBS5, we find that the three clusters are all mixed. So, the conclusion I wanted to make. So the conclusion I wanted to make here is that for this looping system, we have both the influence of gene signalling on the cells and also mechanical features. And we can see it quite clearly already on the set of cellular features. Okay, so that's my second structure. If you have any questions, don't hesitate. But then I will move to uh third uh aspect. Dividing these cells into clusters was Finding these cells into clusters was you you did a like of the cells? Uh so we did it based on the features and the features revealed that it was um interesting patterning. So basically we take um all our cell features that are here, put them in a big matrix and from it we actually compute the spatial PCA which is the product of the covariance and the Mohr index that explains both the variation in the data and the spatial autocorrelation. And then the main features are the idea. Main features about the IVM vectors. And this is the first one, and this is the second one. And from it, we could cluster the data. Yeah, we try to reduce the set of potential features. Okay, so best idea. So what about what can we do if we have the three aspects together, so in some data set? Expression, special relationship, and sending edge. And for me, we have actually worked with the We have actually worked with the C elegants. So it's a nice model system, which is a very simple nematode. It has at its stage around 1000 cells. And the nice thing with it is that it divides always in the same way. So you can actually give an identity to each cell in the division process. And if you take two different embryos, you can say which cell corresponds to which one. So that's nice because if you get different types of data set out of them, you can match them pretty easily. Match them pretty easily. That's what we did. We actually fused two data sets, so one that contains the spatial position of cells across time, and one that contains protein expression for 266 transcription factors, together with the cell image, so the history of cell division. And that gives us a representative atlas of our embryo through time, where we have a Where we have on one hand a spatial network that comes from outside next to each other. There is the history of this network based on the tissue history. And then we have for each cell here in this network a vector. So we have some signal on top of the cell, which is a vector of 266 dimensions. That if projected in 2D with UMAP here, we can track the different trajectories. And this is a more a vertical way to interpret. This is a more embarrassical way to interpret it, but here you have the undifferentiated cells and on the right you have the more specific cell types. So basically the question is can we say something about the trajectories in phase, in expression and across the lineage? The two basic assumptions that people do in biology usually is that lineage or development can be either mosaic or regulative. So mosaic means that uh the information is mainly contained in the lineage. Is mainly contained in the lineage. You start with all the potential fate, and then as long as you throughout the cell lineage, you specialize in different cell types. Or you can have a more regulative mode, which is that your identity is dependent only on your surroundings. And this one is a bit more consistent with um gradients, for example, of expression. And the first one is usually what is uh hypothesized in the context of C elements because of the invariant C. Because of the invariant cell in the tissue. The usual way to test it in biology is to, for example, remove one cell from an embryo and see if it continues to divide and give the same cell type. So that would be the mosaic. It contains all the information inside. And the other way is to take a cell and put it in another position of the embryo and see if it acquires the fate that is associated to the cells in its turn. So we have this kind of complicated data. This kind of complicated data set where we have the history of each cell, the position of each cell through time, and then the expression of each cell, so the vector of protein expression. And to try to see if we could tell if the development was a lineage or a context-dependent, we thought that it would be interesting to compare the distances between pairs of cells and relate that to their expression. So let's say if. So let's say if uh the development is completely um defined by the history of cell division, you can imagine that cells that are uh close in the lineage will have similar expression, or at least that there will be some rules that you can derive from the lineage, close to expression. And if it's completely irregulated, you imagine that if sense have similar neighborhood, then they will have similar expression. We have some confounding variables, so this is the thing that was a bit complicated. So this is the thing that was a bit complicated in the beginning: is that the context here we define it as the expression of the neighboring cells, but cells that have similar neighbor might be just cells that are close in space, close to each other, or cells that divide usually stay close to each other. So there is also a relationship between spatial positioning and division. But still, so I will try to show that we can say some. I will try to show that we can say some things about that. So, we have this idea that mosaic mode is more related to cells that are close in the lineage will have similar expressions, and regulative is more related to the fact that cells that have similar context are similar expression. Then you have this idea that when cells divide, they stay close to each other, so in-place division. And the idea that if cells are close in space, they will also share similarities in their neighborhood. The first thing we did was to confute the The first thing we did was to compute the correlation between all those distances and we found that uh we do have some correlation between the different distances, even not so big but not so low either. So everything is a bit mixed and tangled. So for example here we have a correlation of 0.49 but still here 0.33, so everything is a bit mixed. To study it still we thought it was possible to remove some of the confounding factor and we compared it Some of the confounding factors, and we compared it to two new models. One, which is we call the shuffle type model, where we keep the same spatial structure, the same lineage structure, but we shuffle all the expression profiles. So the vectors that we have are each of the same. We mix them and put them again on the image. And the other new model is a model where we generate vectors on top of the cells that are completely defined. That are completely defined with the lineage. So it's a lineage and we simulate this. So basically we generate a random work on top of the lineage and that generates this for vectors. Okay, so those are the elements and the results are that we can show this time. We have actually computed an indicator of mosaic versus regulative, which is Versus regulative, which is a stratified correlation, mind weakness score, and then we measure the size effect compared to the new model. So it's a bit technical, but the way to interpret it is that the points here, sorry, so we have the variation of the new model. So the dotted line are the variation of the value of this indicator for the random model. Is there for the mosaic indicator, for the regulative indicator, and the data points? Indicator and the data points are here. And so, if they're red and above the line here, it means it's mainly DNA-dependent. If it's blue and full, it means it's mainly regulative. And this is muscle, so one tissue. And so, we could see that in the various tissues, we have first lineage dependency and then regulative dependency. And the tempo was not the same across the different tissues. So, basically, there is a mix between the mosillic and the regulative one from our interpretation. From our interpretation of the data. And the lineage-only model is purely lineage the whole time. So our indicator seems to work. I will finish because it's my last minute. I think that in addition to this, we can find loops in our system. So, for example, if we take cells that go towards the same expression in the gene expression space, they can be in various ways. Space. They can be in various places in the cell lineage. So here is the root and going towards the leaves. And they can lead to stimuli position in tissues and have looping. So it's a bit like the island this morning, but the trajectories and expression are quite different during the development and then they converge to the same sector. So that's quite interesting and I think it's, I mean, given the, I mean, it can lead to interesting analysis of the data also. Analysis of the data on specific tissues. So, my conclusion is that I think, in addition to the mechanical interpretation of development and morphogenesis, it could be interesting to look at it also at the single-cell level and that highlighted some of the constraints that come from the division process. The fact that cells have a specific position and that they also need to go through certain state through the different machine paths before reaching. Before reaching the reflect. So, with this, I would like to thank you for your attention. This is the group I'm working with, and the work I've shown is mainly from Clara and Solene, who was a PhD student with Armenik and who has been very helpful in these works. Thank you. So, my question is on the app. So, I didn't understand very well. So, during development. I didn't understand very well. So during development, I mean the heart needs to have a part for the systemic circulation and part for the pulmonary. I mean at least in humans I suspect also in mice. So here you're showing us which part. You mentioned it's bald over itself. I didn't understand the hard tube and it forms the different uh ventricles. So maybe it's a bit uh literally what you're describing because it's not. So here, so you have the activity and the minus part, and it's just in the beginning when you start Just in the beginning, when you start just following the tube, and somewhere because of the differentiation regime of the appearance, you will need a valve in the middle. So I guess I wanted to ask you about the valve. I don't know so much about the middle. I don't know. Because I was very interested in the different you had different expressions, and I was interested to see how the wild knows. Nothing. Yeah, so we can fix some defects a bit later because of the problems. The problems in pythoning are related to problems in morphogenesis, and so the different parts of the chip don't fall normally. So that impacts later on the values. And so when the tissue falls, it already knows where it's going to cut the little things which are going to patterns. Pre-patterned. Afterwards, it's pre-patterned, it doubles exactly there, and then the flow, the flow enhances the valve effect because it's a tip. And so it goes inwards. So the pre-existing flow helps create a bar, but you you still have the status quo at that point. Is it beeping or not? The heart can beat before it exists. And the other interesting part with this is also the fact that you have this pattern now that gives actually boundaries. And because the tube is separated, then you have a boundary in the second half field and a boundary in the first half field. Here are the two metric codes in terms of patterning. In terms of patterning, they correspond to earlier separation of the cells. So it's kind of interesting how this is also. Okay, I get now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In your UMAP for the gene expression, what is the meaning of the distance between notes? No, this was your last slide. Oh, the the the friendships, the magic? Yeah, what is the meaning between the distance of meaning of these two? Distance of meaning of these two probably? So, the edges here, I can have them because we have the whole track of cells in the genealogy of the cells. So, the type of data that we have contained for a given cell, you know exactly where it was since the beginning in terms of the history and the spatial position. So, you can actually later in development take one cell and say, okay, so where was it before? And say, okay, so where was it before? Which are the ancestors? And for each of the ancestors, then you have a specific gene expression. So basically, you can reconstruct the trajectories that led to the specific point in the human. This is the final state, but you can reconstruct the whole history from the cellular initial. So this is spatial, like so. It's why, so this is you have some. It's a bit you don't want to interpret the metric too much because you do a projection from a spacing. Because you do a projection from a space in 266 dimension for its true, so we can mess with the. So it's not because it's closed that it's closing the original. There was a direct rotation. So you said that your sensors were anticipated. Uh would you measure it and what's your so we um okay so for the first part of the question we take um sets of uh distances and um we um bin them according to bins in the context distance. So basically we stratify them by the other uh variable here and um and then that that gives us a set of uh correlation. A set of correlation that then we used and compared to the new model. That's one thing. So that was one way of disentangling. Also, here we stratified it towards lineage distances as well. And then we looked at the effect of spatial rearrangement on cells and also the effect of random cell divisions because there are more cell divisions across time. And so we found that it was synchronized, but we don't think there is really a But we don't think there is really a causality. In the first part of the cell cell contact network, there you saw the different frequencies that were not uncomfortable. Do they correspond to somehow the most contact? We try to find this type of measures, but we never. So, my interpretation is that you have these long branches. Some of them are quite long, and in some cases, if you have two long branches next to each other, it will be hard to. Branches next to each other, it would be hard to position them. But we try to find some actual numbers for it, but as a bit of a optimal packing of it. Yeah, exactly. So basically, we solved it as an optimal packing of linked objects. Yes? Seven? Yeah, exactly. In this case, I'm surprised at the fact that divisions are not at all symmetric. They come from a symmetric process. So you have an initial cell and then the same division. An initial cell, and then the cell divides. So, yeah, each division is symmetric, but the fate of each cell, then some divide mesh plus and the other one. So it's a symmetrical division, meaning that they all divide at each round of division. And the street is completely symmetric. If you take one or two as the root, you will have the same thing. But the fact that they stay connected to their ancestors, some of the cells on their Some of the cells went less divisions than others. So you have this, let's say, you say one stays old and there is a new cell that appears, and then the old one divides again and the new one divides. So the old one has divided twice and the new one only once. And then the old one divides three times, the second old one two times and then the new ones only once. And the same here, the old one divided four times, and this is how you get the asymmetry and you can identify. How you get the asymmetry and you can identify each other's tests. Yes, yes. Except, but then you have one yellow one. So again, the yellow, just the corroborate, because here they are one edge away from the root, two edges away, three edges and four edges away. There's some kind of breaking between a pivot and 12 or a pit and 8. So we have to say that 1 is the oldest one, and that's 12. No, no, but number 16 could have come up with 8 or 12, but it only came up with one. Do you mean the ordering? So we try to respect some type of ordering that was... So let's say start from the red one, if you want to, you take the US one, the four, and then you add the eight, and then you add the twelve. And yeah, so I mean, it's converted from. So I mean it it's converted from player, it's converted actually what it's it's kind of arbitrary. The point is just a judgement. Thanks for let's check out the speakers of the I guess it's a good break right now because there was a sound just three of the clocks of the sound. So, what do we do now? I think we discussed. Okay. So, please. Stefan, later if there's something to say. And then there's a chair in somebody chairs the discussion or it's self-organized? I think it's self-organized. I mean, I can check this discussion, but basically, I don't see at this point without you want to. Okay, go on, go on. I like this to last. I wanted to ask actually the further transfer of the graph to net, like what kind of information we get regarding the connection, like can we identify like hubs for instance in the graph, like connect several more points than others? Or what do we get from the transform of the graph? Well, the whole idea of the free transform is that you have these moles and moles are more smooth. So, what does that mean for a graph? Well, it means that across the edges, the signal doesn't vary very much. So, that means that if you have only the signal, you can kind of see where the connections are because that's where the signal is very similar. Is very similar. Now, what you ask about hugs is a bit of a difficult question because it seems that this is there's no theory, but it seems to me that this all works very well when every node has approximately the same number of connections, and it doesn't work so well in Grasper, where you have very big variations in number of connections. That's just That's just yeah, not even experimental observation. I had much to play around just a simple bit, but yeah, it could be very interesting to compare, to use the waves actually. Waves have a very strong distribution of quality. And I wonder if you find out uh sorry, what what uh Claire showed is that in a two T graph it's a connection, it's very poor, it's very objective. It's very cool, it's very well changed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then you look at your waste, it's very
