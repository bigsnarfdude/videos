I mean homological mirror symmetry, an idea first introduced by Konsevich in 95. So of course mirror symmetry you will all be very familiar with. Pure mathematicians really became interested in it through the work of Candelas, de la Ossa, Green and Parks, where they used mirror symmetry of Calabiao manifolds to compute invariance in enumerative geometry. Invariance in enumerative geometry, so essentially counting curves in algebraic varieties. This was before mirror symmetry, this was something that was incredibly hard, and mathematicians had been struggling to do it. And then in this work, this group of authors came up with a range of numbers for invariants that before had not been able, people had not been able to obtain. And these predictions, while not rigorously proved in the sense of mathematics, Proved in the sense of mathematics, all turned out to be true. So, yeah, this is basically what got mathematicians excited. And Konsevich's concept of homological mirror symmetry is one of the ways mirror symmetry is today understood from the mathematical perspective. So, what's the idea? The idea is to relate a symplectic structure on one side of the problem to a complex structure on a different under. To a complex structure on a different underlying manifold on the other side, and in homological mirror symmetry, this is done through what's called an equivalence of A infinity categories. So on both sides, you associate a mathematical object to the structure. On the complex side, this is the derived category of coherent sheaves. And on the symplectic side, this is the derived Foucault category. And you try to establish an equivalence of categories. Yeah, an equivalence of categories between these. So I'm going to here, I'm going to be fairly vague, but I'm going to try and give you an intuition for how this works. So in practice, this is very hard to do, not least because the definition of the Fukaya category is an extremely delicate matter. And there is no one definition of the Fukaya category, but there are sort of different ways of constructing Fukaya. Sort of different ways of constructing Foucault categories for different types of symplectic manifolds. Very often they involve making certain assumptions that people then later try to weaken. And there are a whole host of really bad analytical problems. So there's some really hard analysis involved. All formal proofs of mirror symmetry, so hormological mirror symmetry, furthermore rely on basically guessing. On basically guessing a mirror partner, then comparing the two categories. So, there is, in no sense, a constructive approach from the mathematical side. So, examples where formal proofs for homological mirror symmetry exists include elliptic curves. So, you know, complex structures on an underlying two torus. So, this is one of the easiest cases and was, of course, tackled first. Course, tackled first, then torus bundles, and for example, yeah, famous proof of mirror symmetry for the quartic surface. So what are these categories, or rather, what is the Fakaya category? I am chiefly going to focus on the symplectic side in this talk. And the idea sort of coming from the physics idea of mirror symmetry is to build categories or rather A infinity category. Categories or rather A infinity categories out of the brains on either side of the problem. So on the symplectic side, the simplest type of brain are Lagrangian submanifolds inside the symplectic manifolds. So of course, mathematicians are also aware that there are higher dimensional brains that are not symplectic, not Lagrangian, but because they are hard, these generally Because they are hard, these generally have not been included in this type of analysis. Although I am personally very interested in sort of higher-dimensional quasotropic brains and symplectic manifolds. So as objects in this category, we want to take Lagrangian sub-manifolds with an equivalence relation, namely up to Hamiltonian isotopes, so Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. And so often we would And so often we would take these to be equipped with a flat principle U1 bundle, so they're supposed to be brains. But so that part I'm mainly going to leave out of today's talk. And as the morphisms between these different Lagrangians, we take well the module generated by the intersection points of the two Lagrangians over Of the two Lagrangians over some field. So, in general, you need to build something called the Novikov field that includes formal power series. But in the simplest case, you can do this just over the field Z2. And that has, I guess, the advantage that signs don't matter anymore, and the disadvantage that it is, of course, quite a coarse thing to just work over that too. Now, I said intersection points, of course, a whole Of course, a host of assumptions already goes into this. First of all, in order to have intersection points, you need to assume that these Lagrangians intersect transversely to begin with. And so we will generally want to consider compact Lagrangians, at least for everything that I'm going to say here. So there won't be necessarily a problem with infinite dimensional things. With infinite dimensional things, but of course, even when you look at this, even the number of intersection points is, of course, not invariant under Hamiltonian isotopy either. So there's a somehow the way this is built will, to start with, not look invariant in any sense. Now, in order for this to make sense as something like a category, we have to be able to We have to be able to compose morphisms. So if I have three Lagrangians, L0, L1, L2, and I have a morphism from L0 to L1 and one from L1 to L2, I should be able to compose these to a morphism from L0 to L2. And so the question is: how to do this with formal sums of intersection points? And the answer is where basically. Answer is where basically ideas first developed by Andreas Fleur come in. So this is, yeah, this is all down to Fleur's work on pseudo-holomorphic disks. So what you do here in order to make the product of an intersection point P2 of L1 and L2 and P1 of L0 and L1 is you look at intersection points Q in the intersection. Q in the intersection of L0 and L2. And you build the formal sum where the coefficient is the number of pseudo-holomorphic triangles where the three points are the corners of the triangle of correct index. So I'm not going to say what the index is, but this has to do with some kind of winding number around the boundary. And in order for to say you In order for to say you count the number of these pseudo-holomorphic triangles, you have to just consider the ones of correct index. Pseudo-holomorphic here refers to the following. So you view these triangles as basically images of maps of the punctured disk in the complex numbers into the manifold, the symplectic manifold, which you equip with. Which you equip with a compatible, almost complex structure. So, compatible with a symplectic form, potentially a family. So, this complex structure doesn't have to be, this almost complex structure doesn't have to be the same across the manifold. It's potentially allowed to vary. And then this is the holomorphicity condition, which says, okay, u is holomorphic with respect to these two structures. Right, so this allows you to. This allows you to write down a multiplication of formal sums of intersection points. Now, in an honest category, the composition of morphisms has to be associative. Here it is not. So, this normally, in order for this to be associative, this up here should be zero. So, I'm working over Z2. So, everything, so all signs will be pluses because over Z2 it. Pluses because over Z2 it doesn't matter. So this is in this case not zero, but instead is what we find is this expression down here where which involves two further maps. So first there's this del and then there's this H. So H is a map taking three arguments, sort of three morphisms that can be composed between Lagrangians. And the del takes one. And so basically this H is something And so basically, this H is something like a triple product with three arguments, and the del is a differential. And what we see is that multiplication is not associative, but only associative up to essentially terms that would vanish when we take the homology with respect to this differential, which is the flow differential. And so the object that we arrive at with this construction is not a category simply with objects and morphisms and the multiplication. And morphisms and the multiplication, but rather what's called an A-infinity category that also comes with a differential. So there's a differential structure on there. And it comes with all sorts of higher products, which I've here denoted as mu k for every natural number k, taking k arguments and obeying something called the a infinity relations. So So, I've very briefly and very loosely summarized how this should look. But this, as I said, this is in practice, this is very difficult to do. First of all, in order for this to make sense, you need to make sure that the moduli spaces of pseudo holomorphic disks that you consider, that they are smooth manifolds. This can generally be solved by not picking one compatible, almost complex structure for the symplectic manifold, but rather a family. Manifold, but rather a family that is allowed to vary somehow, then you need to ensure that the moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic disks are compact, or rather, that the right kind of things are in the compactifications, so are in the boundary, and that you don't get weird degeneracies if you take sequences of pseudo-holomorphic disks. Namely, there are phenomena called sphere bubbling and disk bubbling that do Bubbling that do arise frequently in examples. And if they do, well, then, for example, the differential map won't square to zero here. So this del won't square to zero and won't be an honest differential. And so the whole thing just doesn't work. And so in general, you need to make additional assumptions on the symplectic manifold and on the Lagrangians that you consider in order for this to be well defined. Well defined. And then I said that all these different maps involve counting of pseudo-holomorphic curves. So, this, of course, means that the moduli spaces of these pseudo-holomorphic disks that we're considering should really be zero-dimensional. Otherwise, you can't count. So, that is where somehow there's an index thing that comes in. Now, when you have taken care of all this and gone to where this works. Where this works, then what you find is that while the morphisms and the composition and the things that I've written down here are not in themselves invariant. What is invariant is if you take the homology or cohomology with respect to this differential, and this is the famous Flurk homology, and that is an And that is an invariant of the symplectic manifold itself, or rather, of a pair of Lagrangians within this symplectic manifold. And the Foucault category, well, all instances of the Foucault category that you would get by making these different choices will, of course, all end up being equivalent. So, in that sense, it can also be considered an invariant. The easiest case for this. Case for this is compact symplectic surfaces, where, of course, on a surface, any non-vanishing two-form is symplectic. And where for dimensional reasons, basically all the issues that I mentioned here at the top go away. So there are no more analysis problems, and suddenly the whole thing is basically just combinatorics. And so the Foucault category, for example, for the elliptic curve, can be very explicit. For the elliptic curve, it can be very explicitly computed, and mirrors you can also very explicitly do homological mirror symmetry for the elliptic curve using just this combinatorial approach. Now, generalized complex geometry, which was majorly developed by Marco Gualtieri in his PhD thesis 2013. So, we've already heard quite a lot about generalized geometry in this conference. In this conference. So, what we do, we consider a smooth manifold potentially equipped with a non-trivial H, which is a class in the third cohology. So potentially cohomologically non-trivial three-form. And then we have this associated exact Couron algebraic, which is the tangent bundle plus the cotangent bundle equipped with the canonical split signature symmetric bilinear form. Symmetric bilinear form, the twisted Dauphin bracket, and the projection to the tangent bundle. And so that's the data that makes up an exact current algebra. So within this, a generalized complex structure is an endomorphism of Tm plus T star m that is first of all compatible with the symmetric bilinear form. So that's why I wrote an orthogonal group here. And it is generalized, complex if. Generalized complex if it squares to minus the identity. If it's just that, we would call it almost generalized complex. And then the integrability condition that makes it actually generalized complex is that the plus I eigenbund in the complexification of Tm plus T star m is involutive under the twisted Dauphin bracket, which I've written down again for you here, although we've seen this before. We've seen this before. So, this is in fact basically the same definition that you can make for a complex structure on a smooth manifold. So, you could say a complex manifold is a manifold where the tangent bundle is equipped with an endomorphism that squares to minus one and obeys this integrability condition with respect to the Lie bracket. So, this is really just porting that formulation of complex geometry to the generalized case. And so, it should cover. And so it should come as no surprise that, in fact, given a complex structure, you can immediately write down a generalized complex structure that just uses this data. More generally, if you look at a generalized complex structure as this kind of matrix mapping from Tm plus T star m to again Tm plus T star m. Then we always know something about the top right. always know something about the top right component in this matrix, which is a map from T star m to T M. Namely, this will always be a Poisson bivector. So what that means, for those unfamiliar with Poisson geometry, is that this bivector always gives you a Poisson bracket on the smooth functions of the manifold in this way. So in that sense, generalized complex geometry is a subfield of Field of Poisson geometry in that, yeah, every generalized complex structure comes with an underlying Poisson structure, although, of course, not every Poisson structure can be made generalized complex, but those are quite specific Poisson structures. Sort of, I've just said, complex structures, of course, constitute examples of generalized complex structures where the underlying Poisson structure is simply the zero Poisson structure. So that's fairly boring. So that's fairly boring. But then there's also the other extreme where we can use a symplectic form, so non-degenerate closed two form on the manifold to define a generalized complex structure in this way, where then, of course, the Poisson structure is simply the inverse of the symplectic form. So within mathematics, I think that the fact that both symplectic and complex structures are examples. Complex structures are examples of generalized complex geometry. This immediately caught people's attention because, of course, these are both very active fields of research. And then also because complex and symplectic structures are precisely those structures related by mirror symmetry. And here we now suddenly have a way of viewing them as instances of one and the same structure. In general, generalized complex. Generalized complex structures sort of interpolate between complex and symplectic. So, if we consider a regular point, by which I mean a point where the rank of this Poisson structure is constant, at least on some small neighborhood of the point. We can basically have a local normal form for the generalized complex structure where it composes as a product. Where it composes as a product, first of all, of a complex vector space and then a complementary symplectic vector space. So, locally, at least around regular points, every generalized complex structure looks like symplectic leaves of the underlying Poisson structure times a transverse complex structure. And the dimension of this complex part of the structure Of the structure complex dimension k is what we refer to as the type of the generalized complex structure. This is, of course, a local invariant. So, if you go to a different point, the type can jump. Now, as I said, the fact that both symplectic and complex structures are examples of generalized complex manifolds sort of immediately raises the question: what about mirror symmetry? And this question in its general full general Question, in its full generality, is certainly intractable from the mathematical point of view, both because homological mirror symmetry is not sufficiently well understood and because generalized complex structures are not sufficiently well understood. But there are certainly approaches for some first steps that one can make, and those are some of what I hope to outline in the rest of the talk. So, here's a very brief section of where general Brief section of where generalized complex structures show up in string theory. Most of you in the audience will know this much better than me, not least because most of the authors that I've cited on this slide are listening. So yeah, certainly the experts are right here. So as you will notice, one of the papers by Gates, Harlan, Rochek that I'm citing here is quite old from 1984, so certainly much older than. So, certainly much older than the concept of generalized complex geometry. So, in fact, physicists have known about generalized complex structures much longer than mathematicians have, in a way, namely in the context of string compactifications, where for the internal six-dimensional manifold, we of course get conditions that keep the theory consistent, namely, in order to preserve the supersymmetry, sort of. Geometry. Sort of in usual geometry, one would have said, okay, the manifold, the internal manifold needs to be KLA. But what is in this paper from 1984 is that, in fact, there are other structures that are not themselves KLA, but still preserve this property. And sort of with what we now know about generalized complex geometry, we can identify this condition as being as the manifold being generalized KLA, which means that it is equipped with. Scalar, which means that it's equipped with two generalized complex structures that are compatible in the sense that the commutator is zero. And then we also need the conformal symmetry to be preserved. And this then requires the structures to be a generalized colour biao, which is a statement about their pure spinners. So every generalized complex structure can alternatively be described in terms of a pure spinner line. So yeah, line bundle associated to bundle associated to do the generalized complex structure and in the case of a generalized color biao structure this line bundle then needs to admit a global non-vanishing section that is closed and for generalized scalar these come with a compatibility condition between them as well so yeah this structure was a this type of structure generalized scalar that was originally described as by him Was originally described as by Hermitian geometry and has since been identified as being the generalized concept of Kayla manifolds. Now, in this third more recent paper that I've cited here, there is an interesting discussion of somehow the generic manifolds that come out of this. So, the generic versions of geometry, of generalized complex geometry. Complex geometry that arise in this context. So you can have the case where the pure spinner is odd or even, and this will be a constant across each of the manifolds. And accordingly, they are generically the lowest type possible. So in the odd case, they'll be generically type one and then jump to type three, which of course for real dimension six, that's the maximal type and means the manifold is complex. Or they can Complex, or they can be generically type zero, which means it's symplectic, and then jump to type two on sub-manifolds. And it is this latter type of geometry that I am working on and that I'm going to discuss. Namely, these are what's generally referred to as stable GC. So this is a concept formally studied by Cavalcanti and Gualta. Studied by Cavalcanti and Gualtieri in this paper from 2015. So, what are they? They are precisely generalized complex structures that are generically symplectic and jump to type 2 on a certain locus. And this locus is the zero locus of a smooth complex divisor. So, here basically this is scribbling terminology from algebraic geometry, where of course devices and Devices on complex manifolds are more common, and this is the smooth analog of that. So, what we have is sort of the symplectic bulk of the manifold M and then inside that there's this locus D that is two real dimensions smaller. And I've drawn this here as a torus. That's no accident. So, if we have a four manifold, then the degeneracy locus sitting inside of type two will always be an elliptic curve. Two will always be an elliptic curve, and in general, the degeneracy locus will fiber over a two torus, so if compact. So, the topology of this is actually fairly restricted. So, why are these structures particularly exciting from a mathematical point of view? These are the first examples of structures where basically you can find a smooth manifold that we know does not emit a complex structure. We know does not admit a complex structure or a symplectic structure, but does admit a generalized complex structure. So, these were the first class of manifolds that showed that generalized complex geometry is genuinely bigger than either symplectic or complex geometry. And an example is, for example, the connected sum of three copies of CP2. So, according to the Kodaira classification, we know topologically that this cannot admit a complex. That this cannot admit a complex structure. And then you can compute some of its cyber-witten invariant to conclude that it does not admit a symplectic structure either. But it does admit a stable generalized complex structure. And this is that is constructed. May I ask a question? Is this related in any form to something that we, in the context of physics, we call supersymmetry? Does this have the analog of is this the analog of K3 for you? In what sense, the analog of K3? In what sense, the analog of K3? Well, I mean, does this preserve supersymmetry? I'm not sure what you mean by the analog of a covariant constant spinner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly that. So generalized colour B Au, that is exactly the that we have a weight covariantly constant. But so generalized colour B Au is that it has a non-vanishing spirit. Is this a generalized colour BR? This is. This is not a generalized calabia. Okay, in dimension two, do you have a generalized calabia like K3? So I'm pretty confident that you can make a stable generalized complex structure on a K3 surface, yes. Say what? So you can definitely make a stable generalized complex structure on a K3 surface, if you like. I mean, a K3 surface is even holomorphic symplectic, which is sort of a very simple. Even holomorphic symplectic, which is sort of the version of so it would be very easy to deform the holomorphic symplectic form on a K3 to make it stable, generalized, complex. But so the reason why, somehow to mathematicians, this example is more exciting is because precisely it is not symplectic or complex, which of course K3 surfaces are. I didn't mean, I'm not sold on K3. I'm just saying, are there any other examples you know other than K3 or its deformation? Know other than K3 or its deformation, which is generalized complex structure. Oh, yeah, Lowe's. I mean, generalized club. Yeah, sorry. Okay, examples of generalized. So first of all, one example, so one way of producing examples is by taking any stable generalized complex structure you want and just looking at the degeneracy locus. So this is, for example, one thing that always happens. The degeneracy locus of a stable generalized complex structure always has a Has a generalized colour BR structure. If you were looking, I mean, I'm guessing that's not a satisfactory answer for you. If you're looking more for a catalogue of well, just one more example. I'm just thinking is there any other example? Yeah, so anything that looks Taurus-like. And I ask you a related question. So when you say this is Genes Compostache, just in the sense that even when you say Genes Calabiao, you mean in the sense that there is a single Piospino which is closed, right? Which is closed, right? Yeah, so admittedly, I've been laxed with that. So, generalized complex, for now, I'm just talking about a single generalized complex structure. And in that sense, generalized calabiao, again, just refers to a single generalized complex structure with a non-vanishing closed spinner. But so, when you want to talk about sort of internal manifolds for string theory, you want to have two compatible generalized complex structures that are both generalized colour BR. Yeah, exactly. So, I thought that would like. Yeah, exactly. So I thought I would clarify that regarding Carl's question because he's interested, of course, in getting that. Sorry, there cannot be anything in between for the case of K3. You either preserve the full super smart or half of it. There's nothing in between, right? I don't understand Alessandro's comment actually in this. So they, um, you either have, I mean, if you go down from 11 dimension to seven, you either have. 11 dimension to seven, you either have full superscript or half. There's nothing like three-quarters, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that, but first of all, she's considering six-manifold here. No, no, no, this is four-manifold. Sorry, am I misunderstanding? A CP2, CP2, CP2. That's four manifold, yeah. So at the moment, I'm talking about just a connected sum. Hey, it's a connected sum. Oh, my bad, my bad. Then in four dimensions, yeah, I think. So, are you going to also discuss cases with two? So, I So, I am actually not going to discuss much about generalized colour BR at all. So, I'm mostly looking at things that are not necessarily generalized colour BR, actually. Or rather, I'm not putting in that condition. I'm looking at stable generalized complex as the whole class, where of course it might be that it turns out that some things, in order to make some things work, In order to make some things work, I later have to put in this assumption, right? That might happen. But that's certainly right now, yeah, I'm not considering that so much. Yeah, Carlom is saying that in 4D, you're not going to find any new examples, but it could be that this is a building block, that then you can combine it and have a product with two more dimensions. And yeah, so that certainly makes sense. So, this example here. Yeah, makes sense. So, this example here is not generalized calabiao. It's also another comment. I mean, of course, some cases with one with only one can be acceptable if you then also show that you have appropriate Ramon-Ramon fields. But again, I would say this starts getting interesting in Dimension 6. Sorry to interrupt, Charlotte. You have about four minutes. Yep, thank you. Okay, so now finally. Okay, so now finally, how would we go about extending homological mirror symmetry to this kind of context? So, first of all, we need to study what the equivalent of Lagrangian sub-manifolds are in this. And of course, since the manifold is symplectic in most of it, well, it is clear what Lagrangians should be, and then you shouldn't just need to worry about how they intersect with the degeneracy locus. And there is some work on this, some stuff on this. On this, some stuff on this already in the original paper on stable generalized complex manifolds. And then there's, so in my PhD, I studied further instances of further classes of this kind of manifold and also showed basically how generalized complex geometry fits into this whole machinery that people in Poisson geometry are looking at, which concerns more generally singular symplectic geometry or Leal geometry. Symplectic geometry or Lie algebraic symplectic geometry. So, symplectic forms that blow up on certain loci, which is so stable generalized complex manifolds are instances of that. And so the keywords here are log symplectic geometry, elliptic symplectic geometry. And there's a whole host of authors that are working on this. So this is a very popular sub-field in Poisson geometry, not least because these kinds of Poisson structures are very close. Poisson structures are very close to symplectic structures, and many methods carry over. Whereas, of course, general Poisson structures, so in general, you can't say much about Poisson structures. So, this is a very attractive field of research from that perspective as well. And so, one approach for making a Foucault category would be to removing the degeneracy locus, leaving you with an open symplectic manifold, making a Foucault category for this open manifold, and then. Category for this open manifold, and then somehow trying to get like to put the degeneracy locus back in. And that is something I have looked at. However, it now seems that it is actually much better to leave in this degeneracy locus from the start and see how the whole scenario changes compared to something that's purely symplectic. And as a first toy example, what I'm looking at here is a log symplectic. Here is log symplectic surfaces. These are not generalized complex because so stable generalized complex surfaces are extremely boring. They actually, I mean, they can't really happen because the degeneracy logus will be two dimensions smaller, so a point. And that's not really so interesting. But we can make log symplectic surfaces where instead, so we still have something that's symplectic in the bulk, but then blows up on a one-dimensional co-dimension one submanifold. So in this case, on embedded circles. On embedded circles. And locally, this is what the symplectic form would look like. And so this exhibits very much the same kind of behavior as stable generalized complex structures do, but we can do it on surfaces, where, as I've mentioned before, the whole problem of defining Foucault categories is much simpler and, in particular, does not involve complicated analysis. So, differences to the symplectic case. To the symplectic case, include that Hamiltonian isotopes in this scenario are always the identity on the degeneracy locus. So, in particular, intersection points of Lagrangians with the degeneracy locus can never be moved. And this already means that the Foucault category will have a great deal more objects because, well, so before Lagrangians that in just the symplectic case would be indistinguishable because you can move them around into each other with a Hamilton. Bound into each other with the Hamiltonian isotopy. Now, if they have different intersection points with the Z, will not be able to be identified. And then we get this additional interesting case or interesting case in the end where two Lagrangians intersect each other inside the degeneracy locus itself, which is an intersection point that cannot be gotten rid of by means of Hamiltonian isotopy. And so there we So, there we then need to ask: can we get pseudo-holomorphic disks that start or end inside the degeneracy locus? The answer to which is no. But in order to make this well-defined, we suddenly have a phenomenon that we do not get in the symplectic case, where the homo, so where we basically need to disallow some Hamiltonian isotopes for equivalence and thus get morphism spaces between Lagrangians that are asymmetric. Lagrangians that are asymmetric. So the homomorphisms between L0 and L1 will not be isomorphic to the homomorphisms of L1 and L0. So this is something that doesn't happen for compact symplectic manifolds, but sometimes it's not entirely unknown. It does happen in the non-compact case, so the open case. And finally, while we can't have pseudo-holomorphic disks that start or end inside Z, they can go through it. And so Through it. And so this shows that when you have a manifold that is, well, in this case, divided into different connected components by the degeneracy locus, those two components are not entirely independent or not entirely separate, but they will communicate with each other through sort of holomorphic disks. And so this I have mostly done, but Have mostly done, but of course, so I will stop here and also not sure how and how far the details of this would be interesting to this audience. But I hope to have a preprint out about this in not too long. Thank you very much for your attention. Okay, let's thanks, Charlotte. Questions? Go ahead and shout out. So I have a comment rather than a question. I have a comment rather than a question. So there was this question about this Calabiyau examples. In fact, there are in six real dimensions, there are many examples. So you can consider nil manifolds, and these are all generalized calabiao. So these examples were found by Cavalcanti and Valchieri. So in fact, there are many such generalized Calabiao manifolds, even on compact examples. Compact compact examples. Could you post the link in the chat or on the Stack? Yeah, I can. Actually, we tried to, many years ago, we tried to promote this to vacuum because the Genesis Calabia condition is one of the conditions for a string vacuum. Then you you need to if you only have one pure spinner, then that's why I was asking uh whether That's why I was asking whether they had one or two. Then the other should not be closed, but the non-closure is related to Ramon fluxes. So then there is something to check and we tried with all the manifolds that you just mentioned. The result is that only one might work, but so far only with smeared sources. Sources so the physics is demanding, you see. Okay, looks like we're at 1242. Are there other kind of quick questions or comments? Dan, hold on. Yeah, thanks, Charlotte. Just a really quick question. You said that the generation locus always looks like some vibration over a torus. Is there an easy way for me to understand? Is there an easy way for me to understand why that's true? Oh, no. So, are you familiar with logs and plagiaric geometry? No. Not so much. Okay. So, I mean, basically, you can always essentially find this vector field, sometimes referred to as a reap vector field, in analogy to contact geometry. So, in the log-symplectic case, you just find this one vector field that then tells you it's fibered over. Vector field that then tells you it's fibered over S1. And so then for essentially generalized complex, what happens is that you basically have a second one of this. So you get a vibration over T2. This is proved in the paper by Qualtarian Cavalcanti, where they established the theory around a stable generalized complex. Thank you. Okay, maybe just one more was going. Hi. Thank you for the talk. Thank you for the talk. I just want to make a comment as a physicist having studied this field and what I realized is that what the mathematicians call homological mirrors in it is very different what physicists call. Namely, the physicists would not be interested so much in proofs of isomorphisms of categories and these kind of things. I'm aware of that. Sorry? I'm aware of that. Yeah. Yeah. So the physicists would be interested in actually. So, the physicists would be interested in actually in an equivalence of infinite mini correlation functions in a functional mirror map. And this goes far beyond what the mathematicians so far are discussing. The only case which was really treated, as you were saying, is elliptic curve, where all these maps can be written in terms of data functions, which happen to be sections of bundles on elliptic curves and so on. Only elliptic curves and so on, but almost nothing of this is known for Calabria three faults. So there is a whole infinite variety extension of the ordinary mirror symmetry, and I mean the function space for three faults, say if you consider intersecting brains, which has not been addressed at all in the physical literature. So this is a major mathematical and physical problem, I think, just as a comment. Thank you. Thank you. So, one question I have is that in the context of the usual collabia, mirror symmetry didn't quite work, namely, the category of collabia does not get mapped to collabia. For example, for rigid calabia threefold, the mirror is not a collabia. Are there examples where the mirror of a regular calabia is a generalized calabia and things like that? Or in other words, could this concept help you in doing those, or do you have a different way of doing it? To do it goals, or you have a different way of doing it? I do not know. Can anybody else comment? Yeah, the mirror of a generalized calabiao is supposed to be a generalized calabiao as well. So there's no example where a mirror of a regular calabia could be a generalized calabia. Because there are examples where we do know that the mirror of calabia is not a calabia. That examples of that we know. I think that the name that has been given to it and is calabia. That has been given to a general scalabial slightly misleading. So it's more like a complex manifold with C1 equals zero. I mean, that's a general, the generalization, that's what the general Calabial generalizes, which may not even... Now, it sounds, I know that what I just said sounds like a Calabial, but it's not because it might not have a compatible simpleton structure. Symplectic structure, or you don't need it for the definition. Or another example is just a symplectic manifold, which isn't even complex. That would be a genesca labial, but as you can see from this example, it's not quite the same. It's a lot less restrictive as a condition. So I doubt that it can be directly connected to. There's another to normal calabial to merosymmetry. Normal calabial to neurosymmetry. There's another conjecture which is kind of natural, which is that the symplectic, and I think Reddy Koncevich made this point long ago, that there might be instances of neurosymmetry where a complex manifold, which say one equals zero, is related by neurosymmetry to a symplectic manifold. And in that sense, well, okay, that's relating two generic calabias then, but not ordinary calabiar, which is a lot stronger as a cabalabia. Which is a lot stronger as a condition. Okay. I guess part of this confusion arises because basically there are these two versions of what generalized Calabiao. The one version where you use just one generalized complex structure, and then one where you have two that are both generalized calabiao. Sorry, can I follow up? What about the mirror of a calabiao with H fluxes? Clabier with H fluxes. If you fine-tune your H fluxes, that could just be a geometry again, right? Yeah. Like a club with geometry. You may try to look into that using mirror symmetry. There are two nice papers, what you just asked. One by Dan Waldom and collaborators, Gurieri, Yan Rui. We forget Waldom and someone else where they this sorry is it this yeah oh yeah thanks yes in fact I had listed all collaborators and I dare say there is a second paper with the uh where I further studied this proposal um and so they yeah so this would be the So this would be the proposal is that it becomes what is it called? What's the name for the resulting? Dan, what's the name of the nail? Half-flat. Half-flat. Thank you. You should have commented, no, myself. So so that would be H-fluxes with one leg along the SYD fiber, right? They should produce such a thing. They should produce such a thing, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. And it was very basic. It was just looking at things like superpotentials and trying to understand how you could generate the same superpotentials from the original one and the mirror if it existed. So they looked at for the perspective and they got this conclusion. And I looked at TDR. I used the SYK basically, the SYK. SYK basically the SYK feature and I'm while I more or less confirm the proposal. Okay, maybe let's move to the next talk. So let's thank Charlotte again. So Inyaki, are you there? Yeah.
