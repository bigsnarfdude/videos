So let's start from the beginning. So, if you have a rational map, let's say a complex variable, you know, in the end, you'll see that everything, all the examples I talked about are defined over not just the integers, but the integer zero and plus or minus one. So you can probably insert your favorite field by then. But just, I'm, I just, of course, I just forestall any difficulty. Let me just assume it's overseek right now. And so you have a rational map and a complex variable. It's a quotient of two polynomials. And the degree of the map will just be the max of the degree of those two polynomials. This is degree in the same sense that Zoe was talking about yesterday. And it's, I mean, the way that I like to think about it is just think of that as the number of pre-images. Is just think of that as the number of pre-images of a typical point under the map, any point if you're willing to count multiplicity. And from that point of view, it's very clear then that the degree of the nth iterate of the map is the nth power of the degree, because every point is preceded by degree points, and all of those are preceded by degree points, and so on and so on forever. Okay, so that's one variable. Now, I probably don't need to say so much to this audience, but in So much to this audience, but in several variables, a rational map is exactly what it ought to be. It's just a map whose component functions are rational functions of the variables. So for instance, let me just get an example up now. It's unnecessarily complicated, but it was once near and dear to my heart. This one. Okay, it shouldn't make you fall in love with it immediately. It's just two random rational functions of x and y here. So let me go back. Alternatively, you can write your map in homogeneous coordinates, and then all the components are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, no common factors. And we'll say that the degree of the map is the degree of those homogeneous polynomials. So in the example, In the example, it's kind of hard to tell by looking sometimes, but the degree of this thing is two. All right. And I'll go on and say that if you iterate, you can do this yourself if you like. The degree of F squared is not 2 squared. It's 3. And the degree of F cubed, I'll stop this after a minute, is 5. Is five. And after that, you know, you can figure out what the next term in the sequence is. You get Fibonacci numbers for this map. All right, so this is not degree in the sense that Zoe was talking about yesterday. That wouldn't happen, apparently. All right, so what's the deal? So a couple of warnings. This is not the topological degree of that. This is not the number of pre-images of a point. In fact, the example I wrote down is an. In fact, the example I wrote down is invertible. You can check it for yourself. The topological degree is one. That map is birational. And what degree is counting here is, in some sense, the number or size of the pre-image of a typical hyperplane, or in the example, a line under the map. All right. So if you pull back a line in the using the map in my example, you get some conic and so on and so forth. All right. And then the other warning. All right, and then the other warning, and again, this audience maybe I don't need to stress it so much, is that unlike endomorphisms, rational maps don't have to preserve dimension of sub-varieties here. So they can take a sub-variety and collapse it, and they don't even have to preserve closed points because they don't, like in the sort of standard smooth sense, have to be defined at a closed point. They just blow it up to some sub variety. So, in this particular example, you can check that F. You can check that f of what's good, x equals 2. Where does that go? That just goes to 0 minus 1. So a line goes to a point. And you can also find a point that goes to a line, but actually you just run this one backwards and you see f inverse has to take 0 minus 1 to something that's not a point to this vertical line here. Anything else I want to stress? Oh, yes, piece of notation. Piece of notation. Throughout the talk, I of F is going to denote the set of closed points where the map, you know, whose images aren't closed points, where the map is not continuously defined in the smooth sense here. All right, that'll be the indeterminate set. The only thing it's got going for is it's small, it's codimension two, so in two variables, it's finite, and that's that's a And that's a mercy. What else do I want to say? Oh, yes. Right. So, even though the degree sequence is behaving sort of strange for this map, it does have an asymptotic growth rate. You know, the Fibonacci numbers have an exponential growth rate. And it's the golden ratio. Golden ratio. Yeah, so there is something there. And that number I am going to call the dynamical degree of F. And I'll denote it with, thankfully, I didn't decide to denote it DD after Zoe Stock has me that name. I'm calling it Lambda. I got to warn you now, increasingly people are using Delta for this thing. I just haven't got with the program. All right, so here it is. All right, so here it is. In general, if you have a rational map of projective space, then what you can check is that at least you have this sub-multiplicativity property for the degrees. The degree of f to the n plus m is no greater than the product of the degrees of f to the n and f to the n. And because of that, the limit I just used to define dynamical degree just always, always, always exists here. Always exists here. All right, some number between one and the degree of F. I guess when I say one, I miss the degree dominant or something for this rational map. Okay, but you just solve it. Strict inequality can ensue. Yeah, so my talk concerns the following problem. Number one, how do you compute this thing? If you're handed a general map or a special map even, and then what values can it take? And then, what values can it take as you go from map to map? All right, we thought we knew. Well, we thought we had an idea. But before I get into that, I should try to sell the whole number just a little bit. I give you a reason to care. And the thing is, this is some sort of measure of the complexity of the dynamics of the map. I used a different pitch when I talked this past weekend, but here you might think as follows. You might think as follows. You might just say, Well, let's take the map, let's plug an integer point in in homogeneous point coordinates. It's a map of P2D, plug 2, 3, 5 in, and start iterating. And as you iterate, you get other integer points and you cancel the common factors and you watch how what's left grows. And you get this thing that people call the arithmetic degree. Called the arithmetic degree of the map at a point. It may vary from point to point. In fact, in that case, we don't even know that there's a limit in general. We don't know much at all, really. But it's kind of an easy computation to see that the arithmetic degree is controlled by the dynamical degree. And you could hope that actually the two are equal for a typical F and a typical point in your system. You think it through for a little bit, it's pretty plausible sound. A little bit, it's pretty plausible sounding. Okay, in fact, the way I first came to this was I was waiting. One of my collaborators, Art Bedford, kept digging up physics papers in which they would claim to compute this dynamical degree. And in fact, what they would do is compute the arithmetic degree because the light just seemed brighter there. And lo and behold, it kept working for them to compute the dynamical degree. So I was very impressed. Degree. So I was very impressed by that. The other thing I should say is more of interest to smooth dynamical systems people is that the first dynamical degree is also part of a series of complexity measures that dominate that controls the entropy of the map, at least when you're working over C. You can talk about topological entropy or the irrational map. So there was reason to care. Care okay, let me pause to catch my breath. So, why do the physicists care about this? Why do the physicists? Um, okay, yeah, so physicists, they are broadly interested in the question of when these maps are integrable, when they preserve like a rational vibration or something. And this would be in many cases, this what they're interested is when this dynamical degree is one, all right, and this was. All right, and this was some sort of marker for integrability for them. And then they, you know, this group of physicists got, you know, increasingly untethered from their, I think, maybe I'm being unfair, from their origins and, you know, just got interested in the number as a, you know. So is there a kind of non-integrability result that you can derive from calculating this? Yeah, sure. If it's, if it's like in two. If it's like in two variables, let's see, I want to be careful not to say anything wrong. I mean, I think it needs to be an integer if you're going to have integrability. Because then you're just going to have the degree is going to be the max of two sort of one variable degrees, be it you'll have a map on the base and you'll have a map from fiber to fiber. And those if the degree will be the max of those two. Okay, bonus slide means I'm going to. Okay, bonus slide means I'm going to skip it. Right, so some special cases where we know what the dynamical degree is, or we know something about it. Case zero is when you don't have any indeterminacy, when your map is really just an endomorphism of pK. And then the dynamical degree is the degree, full stop, just an integer. All right, so that's good. More interesting, albeit more restricted, class. More restricted class of maps are the monomial maps. These are like group endomorphisms, I think, of outbreak torus. But I just think of them as you have some integer matrix and you use or your map, each component of the map is a monomial, and it's a monomial in the variables. And it's convenient to encode all of these integer powers in. These integer powers in some k by k matrix. That's your monomial map. Oh, yeah. If you want to think, okay, so when I first saw people thinking about this for monomial maps, I thought, oh my God, I mean, that's just way too, it's a matrix. You have x to the a composed x to the a is x to the a squared. I mean, how could that be? I know how to deal with linear maps, but actually, if you're already If you're already tired of listening to me, try and compute the degrees of successive iterates of that one right there. It's x, y minus minus two. Yeah, the exponents can be negative for sure. Yeah, so there's a reason I'm using slides. Right. But anyhow, in the monomial case, you can work out that. Case, you can work out that Jenly Lin and Fav and Vulcan at the same time were able to prove that the first dynamical degree is just the magnitude of leading eigenvalue of A, the spectral radius of this matrix. Yes, sir. So this might be a very stupid question. So if you take a conjugate, take a conjugate of an endomorphism, will the degree change? The degree of. Oh, no, that's an excellent question. No, this is a conjugacy invariant. So not just a linear. So, not just a linear conjugacy, but if you take a birational conjugacy, so it doesn't look anything like what you started with, and you might change the actual degree, not the dynamical, just the degree of one iterate. Wildly, dynamical degree doesn't change. So, that's, yeah, I'm glad you asked that. Okay. Yeah, so another case we in monomial maps. Another case, we, monomial maps, I'm going to come back to. So, in this case, you certainly end up with a dynamical group that's an algebraic integer. Another case that we know about now are polynomial maps. Initially of the plane, in the plane, Fob and Janssen showed that the first dynamical degree is a quadratic integer. And that result is actually quite intricate. I mean, it uses some what we would now Uses some not what we would now recognize as sort of non-Archimedean ideas to get at it. And it was recently generalized by Den and Thau, another impressive paper, to higher dimensions. So we know about maps that are polynomial in affine coordinates. Finally, and this case actually kind of precedes the others, except for endomorphisms. If you have a birational map of the plane, a long time ago, Fav and I proved that That then the dynamical degree is at least an algebraic integer. And that too I will come back to. Okay, so a little more about dynamical degrees, how you get it, really. So one thing you can do to try to understand the situation, but one thing that turns out to be useful is to take your projective space and start blowing it up in appropriate ways. And then your map certainly lives. Certainly, lists of that block are defined in this issues, but they were defined in this issues to begin with. So we haven't really lost anything. You say then that on the blowup, the map is algebraically stable if the induced pullback iterates. Well, if F to the N pullback some sub variety is the same as pullback. As pullback n times that sub-variety, at least as a class in the Picard group. So if that happens, then it's not too hard to show that the first dynamical degree is the spectral radius of that operator. All right, so that's really how people, except for the monomial case, that's really how people compute these dynamical degrees in some sense. Agrees in some sense. But your answer, though, in every case, is the same. Yes, which is right, which is, as I want to argue, is a total fluke and a little misleading. So there isn't some blow-up where you could see it as being logically stable? Emphatically, no. Yeah, it's coming. Yeah, that's right. It's a great question. I mean, it seems like that should be the simple case. It seems like that should be the simple case. Right, so the other thing is that for maps and two complex variables, this algebraic stability condition, which sort of it's a functoriality thing, actually has a geometric counterpart. And it's pretty simple. So your map fails the algebraic stability condition if you have a curve and F collapses the curve. This is two variables, right? This is two variables right now. F collapses the curve, maps that point around for a while, lands in the indeterminacy set, and blows back up. And in effect, what happens, if this is going on in projective space, then what just happened is that this curve is defined by a polynomial, and that polynomial defines all the homogeneous coordinate component functions for the whatever iterate that is of the map. And the degree drops for that iterate. Drops for that to iterate because you've got to cancel that P out of there. All right. So, this is when algebraic stability fails, it fails for this reason in two variables. This is a picture at the level of the X or? This is a picture in X, in any X, including your starting point, P2, in this case. Right. So, is there anything else I wanted there? No. So, is there anything else I wanted there? No. All right. Yeah, so what Fav and I really proved then is that if you have a birational map on P2, then there exists a blow-up finitely many times, and you can make your map algebraically stable. In fact, once you see this picture, the technique you want to use is kind of clear. You want to just sort of fix this picture. I should have put this one at the bottom. I should have put this one at the bottom and the other one, the new one at the top. You just want to blow up all the intermediate points so that, you know, maybe at least in simple situations, you don't have this curve collapse blow back up thing anymore. What's the interest of working in X instead of working in P squared? Oh, okay. So the point is, it's not so much X versus P2, but it's if you have an X where this happens, you'd prefer to work in an X. You'd prefer to work in an X where that happens instead. So, if you have, so what I want to say is, you want to take all these points in, whoops, that's a highlighter. You want to take all the points in this kind of finite orbit of C and blow them up and make them curves. And then maybe C doesn't get collapsed anymore. Maybe it just, you know, you have curves going to curves. You have curves going to curves. And you haven't changed dynamical degree because it's yeah, and you haven't changed right this geometric condition for failure of algebraic stability doesn't happen anymore. Okay, yeah, so you want to just keep blowing up until you have this picture. It seems like a simple idea, and it would be if it always worked. Okay, so Fav and I could prove it worked for birational maps. We did not exactly just. We did not exactly justify what I just told you. We did something a little more elaborate, but people have revisited this since then. There's another proof of this by Langerona Rec, which is very top-down. They come up with some, they action on a cube complex and do geometric group theory stuff. And just along the way, oh, by the way, the map can be made algebraically stable. And that's nice. And even more recently, my graduate students. And even more recently, my graduate student, Richard Burkitt, came in to after I explained this to him once, he said, no, I mean, he said, I think I can make the original idea just show that it works. And he did that, but then he proceeded to do something else, which I thought was really cute. I mean, he said, well, consider this possibility. Graph the map. Again, just draw the graph of the map. And, you know, it's got. And, you know, it's got, you're blowing some things up, so the graph's kind of weird. Okay. If you want, you can think of the graph itself as a blow-up of your original space, right? So lift the map to the graph. Okay. If you're not algebraically stable, lift the map to the graph. Well, maybe you've made things better, maybe you haven't. But if you haven't, you can graph the lift of the map. So you can take the graph of the graph. The map. So you can take the graph of the graph and you can keep doing this. And you show that in finitely many steps, you get an algebraically stable map. It was very kind of an automatic way to do this. I thought that was cute. So yeah. Okay, so is that specific to P2? What's that? Is that construction specific to P2? It is very specific to P2 and to birational maps, as far as we know. As far as we know, yeah. So, um, the one so this theorem though does suggest that, you know, usually you're just looking to get your dynamical degree as the eigenvalue, some linear operator with integer coefficients here. And then the thing that really cements the intuition is this old theorem of bonafide performance came about the same time as Fav and I were working together that the set of all possible first dynamic The set of all possible first dynamical degrees is countable, all right, as you range over all possible maps, which is a countable set for very soft reasons because you can parametriz rational maps of a given degree by a variety. And if you look at F squared, those with a given degree of F squared are a sub-variety and so on and so on. As you take a descending chain of varieties, it stabilizes. It's countable for the same reason that real numbers with finite decimal expansions are countable. Numbers with finite decimal expansions are countable. Okay, so we all thought algebraic, but you need to look harder at the monomial case to see that all is not well. And Fav was the first one to notice this, that if you have, even in two variables, if you have a monomial map in two variables and you rig it, that the matrix has complex conjugate eigenvalues, and you want to make sure that. Values. And you want to make sure that the arguments of these eigenvalues are irrational. You normalize them by 2π, they become irrational. So it's like some irrational rotation built in. Then there is no way on Earth you can make this map algebraically stable by blowing up. And in fact, the picture is sort of the following one. You know, monobial maps are really good on the algebraic torus. So if there's anything fishy. There's anything fishy in two variables, it's happening where one of the homogeneous coordinates vanishes. Okay, if you look at what happens, these things, well, maybe one of these torus invariant lines maps to another one, but they can also map to torus invariant points, which can map to other torus invariant points, which can themselves blow up to. themselves blow up to torus invariant lines, no problem. You just blow it all up. The real problem is that the picture looks like the same spaghetti mess as before when you did no amount of blowing up to sort of separates out the torus invariant points from the torus invariant lines when you do this. And the reason for that is that this is the wrong way to look at it. What you really want to do is use the Is use the toric surface yoga to index each of these torus invariant curves by a rational ray in R2, which is really n sub R in park geometry. And what happens? So you denote the rational rays by sigma, and you take the torus invariant curve index by sigma, naturally enough, it goes to the torus. Naturally enough, it goes to the torus invariant curve indexed by A sigma. So it goes to some other ray, which may or may not be in the fan of your torque surface. It may or may not be a torus invariant curve in your surface. But these, as you map forward with an irrational rotation, these dashed rays fill up the picture. So no amount of blowing up will be sufficient to You know, capture all of the images of a torus invariant curve. And that's the root of the problem with this picture. Once you take the NR point of view, then it's clear you can't fix this. All right. But it's still the case that the first dynamical degree is the largest eigenvalue of a matrix. All right. All right, the other insight that you need to proceed here is that you ask yourself, what are, I mean, monomial maps are quite special and maybe just put them in a closet and leave them there and think about other maps. But in fact, they're not the only maps which are special in the way that you need. The way I look at it is they all preserve a certain two form on the Torah side, dx1, dx2 over x. dx1 dx2 over x1 x2 in affine coordinates okay but they're not the only maps that do that there are some other ones that aren't monomial at all there's especially some birational ones that also preserve this two form okay and those also um can be used to build examples that of interest here all right uh this map i wrote down it's again you should not fall in love with this expression Fall in love with this expression, but what I'll tell you is it's an it's it's an involution, it just inverts itself, and it's really just a linear conjugate of the sort of standard involution. I should call it maybe g tilde that just takes one over each coordinate. Okay, you just need to turn it a little bit so that it preserves this two-form, okay. Jan Lee Lin and I managed to prove that for such Managed to prove that for such maps, maps that preserve this two-form, not just monomial maps, you still have an action on this NR lattice. All right, you still have an action. It's not the action of a linear map anymore. It's piecewise linear. And it's actually, if you throw out the origin, it's a covering map of R2. In fact, in all the examples, we know it's a homeomorphism, piecewise linear homeomorphism. All right. And it governs. So not only does the map take torus invariant curves to torus invariant curves. Invariant curves to torus invariant curves, it does it according to this action again. So you have a nice piecewise linear way of accounting for images of torus and variant curves if your map preserves this two-form here. Oh, I meant to be using the pointer. Right. Now, for this map G that I just wrote down, if you If you check out what the action of what the corresponding action is on the torus, it's actually the, I mean, on torus invariant curves, it's the identity. It takes every torus invariant curve in every toric surface to itself by an involution. All right, so it's really tame. And so if you compose this G with one of the monomial maps, the action for that resulting map is the same as the action on a Is the same as the action on NR from just the monomial factor. You don't, the G is invisible from this point of view. Right? And for that reason, it turns out that the map you get can't be made algebraically stable by blow-up if and only if the monomial factor can't be. All right, so it inherits the same problems that the monomial map had. All right. All right. However, ah, yes, you can go to compute the degrees of this. It's possible using this action on NR to compute the degrees of the map, which I had my laptop do last night and then realized I didn't know how to import into Notability. So I took my, in a bizarre combination of old and new technology, I pointed my iPad at my laptop, took a picture, and I knew how to put that into Notability. So here are the first. Into notability. So, here are the first 56 degrees of the map. I'm sure you see the pattern. At least you can see what the dynamical degree is, right? You can just measure the slope of that line. That is the dynamical degree there. Once you know that, if I told you the scales on the axes. Right, so that was just high candy. Right, here's the theorem. Here's the theorem. Here's the theorem. That if, well, there's a formula, actually, a recursive formula for the degrees of this map. But what I'm interested in is the dynamical degree of the map. And the dynamical degree of this composition, g of x to the a, it satisfies a power series equation, a sort of odd power series equation. So you have some power series, it has no constant coefficient. All the other coefficients are positive integers, and they're not. Are positive integers, and they're not just random, they're not just any positive integers. They're the degrees of the monomial map, the monomial factor. So, this power series is really kind of the generating function for the sequence of degrees of the monomial factor. A little weird. So, the radius of convergence is so the radius of convergence of this thing is just the first dynamical degree one over. Degree one over the first dynamical degree for the monomial factor. But the dynamical degree of this map is the place where the power series equals one. As you go from zero to the radius of convergence, the power series, because the coefficients are positive integers, the value of the power series just goes from zero to infinity. So somewhere it crosses one. And at that moment, you have the reciprocal. You have the reciprocal, t is equal to the reciprocal of the first dynamical degree here. So I won't explain exactly where this formula comes from, but it's so you said these degrees satisfy a sort of linear recursion. No, they satisfy, no, well, they do. They do. It's a linear recursion that involves all previous degrees. It's not a finite recursion. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. In fact, even for the monomial factor, well, the degree sequence for the monomial factor does not satisfy a linear recursion. If it did, I guess, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, I guess it's just the same statement. Sorry. Right, the other piece, if you've bothered to mess with that monomial map I wrote down at the beginning, here's I wrote down at the beginning. Here is the solution to the homework problem. The degree of the nth iterate of the monomial map is so you take the largest eigenvalue, or you take the eigenvalue, some Gaussian integer for the 2 by 2 matrix that defines the monomial factor, take the nth power, multiply it by some other Gaussian integer, and take the real part. And take the real part. That's the degree. Except you do this with finitely many Gaussian integers and you max. And that's what messes everything up here. Okay. And this, if you want to know the particular set of Gaussian integers, which has nothing at all to do with zeta, I mean, that's it. But the particular set's not that important. What you should imagine, let's see. The symbolic dynamical system on the gamma that comes out of this. Wait, say again? I mean, so for each n, there's some choice of minus two, minus, plus, or minus. Exactly. Yeah, it's it's it's choosing among those in some sort of unpredictable way. And do you know what that unpredictable way looks like? Is there some is that coming into the theorem you're about to talk about? Yeah, yeah, you're into totally anticipating where this is going. Right, right. No, there's not, I mean, because Zeta. I mean, because zeta involves an irrational rotation, it's doing this in a not entirely foreseeable way. Right, so here is one way to state a theorem that Matthias and Jason and I proved a couple of years ago, right? So, this is a sort of, this is a proto, it's kind of the prototypical thing you'd like to prove for a power series that Prove for a power series that defines a transcendental function. If you've got a positive t inside the radius of convergence, then it may be that t is algebraic, and it may be that the value of the power series is algebraic, but it is highly unlikely that both of those things happen. And that's what we prove. We prove that those two things don't happen at the same time. And since one happens to be algebraic, the dynamical degree is transcendental. Dynamical degree is transcendental here. That's the gist of the theorem. Can you remind us what G is? What G is? Yeah. I will remind you by going. So this G, you mean? Yes, thank you. Yeah. I didn't know about you, but as soon as I go back to the previous slide, I forget what G is. But yeah, it's a birational. But yeah, it's a birational involution. That's that is, and it preserves that form. Does delta satisfy a differential equation? That satisfied. Lambda? Delta. Delta. You know, I don't know the answer to that. At one time, I sort of hoped that maybe that was a route to proving transcendence, because I know that there are transcendence proofs that use something like exponential function that satisfies a differential equation. Differential equation. But as far as we know, no. You have an asymptotic expression for the degrees. Well, yeah, that's what the lambda does. So there's an end to a power expression. There is in this expression. In the asymptotics for the degree of ecstasy, those integers. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right. So the restrictions on the power, if it satisfies differential equations, the restrictions are restrictions on how fast things can grow. Oh, oh, okay. Well, they grow exponentially. Yeah. Is that yeah, yeah, that doesn't anyway seem like a deal breaker. The fact that they're just kind of jittering around unpredictably is, yeah. Um. So, what kind of recurrence relation do the coefficients satisfy of that generating function? Can I look it up after the talk? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just like dig out the paper and remember. It's not too bad. But it's not one fixed recurrence of a finite number of proceedings. Right, yeah. Yeah. Proceeding. Right, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, maybe one other thing to stress for later reference is that the topological degree of this map is not one. It's the determinant of the matrix. And because of the condition that on the eigenvalues, you can't get determinant plus or minus one here. So it's not invertible. And in fact, if it were invertible, it would violate Fabeney's theorem. So you don't expect that. That. All right, so I need to explain why what the idea is behind this thing not being transcendental. So, the idea behind our theorem, in particular, why this dynamical degree is not algebraic. Algebraic is were gamma equal to, for instance, one, that set of things, then you'd have that life would be good. And the degree of x to the a to the n would just be the real part of z to the n. Which has definitely does satisfy a linear recurrence. Okay, so then you could sum the series, it would give you a rational function with integer coefficients, and we would not have a theorem, or we would have a different theorem, I guess. Okay, that's not the case. Suppose instead, I think this is really a productive way to think about things that gamma. Things that gamma is just plus and minus one, so then you would have these are just things that don't happen but are nice to think about. Then you would have degree to the out a to the n would be the real part of the absolute value of the real part of say to the n. And then there would be a dividing line in that complex plane. And maybe zeta is on this side of the diagonal. Is on this side of the dividing line, or every time zeta to the n is on this side of the line, you pick the plus one. And every time zeta the n is on this side of the line, you pick the minus one. Okay, and um it's bouncing around, but there are moments are there in using continued fractions or whatever your favorite thing is, where say the n is very close to real. Zeta n is very close to real. And then you will have that zeta n plus k is very close, at least direction wise, not size wise, is very close to zeta to the k for most n. And by close, I just mean on the same side of the picture. Okay, so you're always making the same choice of coefficient. Coefficient. Okay, so the sequence is nearly n-periodic and looks like the power series. You get a power series that looks like a power series for some rational function. Okay, but it's not. And for every close approach you find, later on you find a closer approach, an approximation, a better approximation by a different rational function. And this, you know, this is the whole yoga, I guess, in transcendence theory. If you're too well approximated by out. Theory. If you're too well approximated by algebraic things or rational things without being one of them, then you are transcendental. Okay, that's the idea. And I think, you know, I'm going to show you some more details, but that's the idea. That and meeting Jason Bell. Oh, that is a very fair statement. Okay, so how much do I want to say about this? What's this 50-minute talk or one-hour talk? 50. 50. Yeah, okay. I'll try to keep it in check here. More do I want to say? Okay, how about this? You do a little bit of algebraic manipulation to the series, which is, I think, all on the slide at this point. And for each J. Each j, you do as Tom suggested, and you just let gamma of j be whichever element of gamma that maximized this expression. Okay, your choice of a coefficient for the power series. All right, then if you if you incorporate the zeta into your positive number, you end up looking at this. Up looking at this power series for an analytic function, complex analytic function here. Okay, do a little more manipulation, and you can compare your function with one where you force periodicity in the coefficients. You compare it with a rational function, and you get a series which directly looks at the, you know, whether or not the coefficients of the original series are n-periodic or not. And you get to pick an n where that's. Or not. And you're going to pick it in where that's close to true. Okay. And you do a little. So the thing about the expression I have here is that phi of Z is, you're going to do a proof by contradiction. You're going to assume that phi at your T is an algebraic number. So this is just some algebraic number. And this was a rational function, but after you clear denominators, function but after you clear denominators it's a polynomial in in t all right so really you're looking at this is if you are so you replace t by this alpha you're you're looking at some polynomial in alpha with coefficients in some number field involving the elements of gamma zeta a couple of other things here all right so this expression um on this side is a polynomial in some algebraic In some algebraic number alpha by hypothesis by assumption, algebraic number alpha. All right, so the first thing there's an easier lemma that says you can pick an n using continued fractions. There exists for any, so that for any c greater than one, there are big intervals from n to c times n. For any c greater than one, an arbitrarily large n. For J in this huge interval, right? So you compare what happens before that interval with what happens after that interval. Happens after that interval, and you get an upper bound on the size of this difference here. And the upper bound is of this form. It's alpha, where alpha is the number of interest that I'm plugging into my PowerSpace 10 algebraic number. C is this C, and N is itself. Okay, so you get an exponential upper bound on the size of that difference. Okay, so further. Okay, so further assume, I guess I'm kind of already did this on the other page, that the value of the power series I was interested in, this should be a phi. Either this should be a phi or the alpha should be a t. Okay. Assume that's algebraic too. Okay. And pick a number field big enough to contain that number, contain everything in gamma, contain everything else in a finite collection of household objects, including kitchen sinks. Objects, including kitchen sinks. Okay, just big enough number field. And then what you'll be looking at is a polynomial with coefficients in a finite subset of that number field, a polynomial in alpha with coefficients in a finite subset of that number field. Okay, in that situation, you can invoke a theorem of a Verza. The form I've written down may or may not be. I've written down may or may not be correct, probably is not something a Verixa would recognize, and might well be offensive. And I've tried to suppress everything I could when I wrote it down. But the upshot is that if you have polynomials like the ones on the previous page in alpha and alpha bar, and coefficients in some finite subset of your number field, then you have a lower bound. Lower bound on the sum of these polynomials, where the absolute value here is just standard, you know, you embed the number field in C, and this is the Archimedean place, which is absolute value on C. Okay. And the lower bound is kind of the same form as the upper bound we had before. It's only there's a different, there's some number r less than one, so that the lower bound is given by, it involves the max of the size. It involves the max of the size of the polynomials, and it involves some additional epsilon, but in particular, it involves the sum of the degrees of these polynomials in alpha and alpha bar. All right, so it is the same sort of lower bound. Okay, so actually, if you assume, well, one second. So we only really apply it in nice cases. It in nice cases to when you have two polynomials, which are halves of the expression I'm trying to bound. Okay, and in that case, the theorem comes down to this sort of lower bound. So when you compare it, when you compare this with that, and right, and in this expression, Right. And in this expression, I have an arbitrarily large C to play with. There's no way you can have both at the same time. So that's the kind of contradiction that you get. I neglected to say that the lemma is under the assumption that the continued fraction expansion for the argument of zeta is good in some generic sense. The coefficients are unbounded in the continued. Unbounded in the continuum fraction expansion. We don't actually know that. Zeta is some Gaussian integer. This is the argument for Gaussian integer. As far as we know, nobody knows anything about the continuum fraction, the coefficients in the continuum fraction expansion. Okay, so I'm using an assumption that I don't really know is valid, but in order to explain the argument. If the assumption is not valid, the argument's way more involved. So it would be nice to know if they're Gaussian integers. If they're Gaussian integers whose continued fraction expansions actually or whose arguments have continued to fraction expansions with unbounded coefficients. Okay, so that's as much as I'm going to say about that, which is already probably too much. The thing to add is there's more here. When we first did this, we shipped the page. Did this, we shipped the paper off to some of the physicists who'd had the temerity to say what everybody else was thinking, and that is that these dynamical degrees are probably always algebraic. And so we shifted off and one of them replied back that no, no, we were saying for birational maps and your maps not birational. So for that, we had to jump to dimension three. And eventually, this was turned out to be an order of magnitude. Was turned out to be an order of magnitude harder. We managed to show that you can do the same thing in dimension three, only you can use a matrix that is invertible over the integers. And so this map, this monomial factor is birational. And so the whole thing is birational. So you can get birational examples too, as long as you're willing to increase the dimension. The one thing, it's The one thing, it's a lot less explicit. I mean, the matrix A is less explicit because you need all this additional stuff from the matrix. So, in order, and again, it goes back to dealing with this fact that we don't know anything about the coefficients in some continued fraction expansion. And to deal with that, we have to impose sort of no resonance conditions on the eigenvalues of our matrix. Matrix. We need some additional thing, which we call discordance, which is, I don't really want to write it down right now. And we also need, even for the power series formula, let alone the transcendence argument, we need to know that the orbits of finitely many integer vectors under the matrix avoid finitely many hyperplanes. All three of these things are just things about linear operators with integer coefficients acting on Rn. Rn. Okay, it's not really algebraic geometry at all anymore. It's just linear algebra in some sense. But because of that, it's sort of inexplicit, the matrix matrices we come up with. The best we can do is use Mathematica to come up with, to verify that some specific matrix with entries that are no bigger than 20 will be good enough for our purposes here. Our purposes here. So, um, yeah. Uh, oh, further questions. I guess let me just end with the question because there are a lot of them. All right, once you've done this, I mean, it's very natural to ask. So, not algebraic numbers, what's the set of all dynamical degrees look like? Maybe it's q adjoint pi, probably not, but we don't know. Um, it's uh recursively enumerable. What's that? Is it enumerable? What's that? Is it recursively enumerable? Yeah, I think you probably know better specific instances of this question than I do. Yeah. Yeah. To go back to this arithmetic degree I was talking about earlier. In our examples, do the arithmetic degrees happen to equal the first dynamical degrees, which is another way of asking, can these arithmetic degrees be transcendental? Degrees be transcendental. People have been brave enough to suggest maybe not, but I would bet, well, I'd bet against those people. Yeah, and here it would be, our papers would be much shorter and easier to read if we knew that there were Gaussian integers with irrational arguments whose Whose continued fraction expansions had unbounded coefficients. So it'd be interesting to know the answer to that. And finally, I think from my point of view, the most interesting question is, okay, maybe the dynamical degree is not always algebraic. Maybe you can't always make your rational maps algebraically stable. But after all, the examples we have have some extra geometric structure to them. They preserve this two-form. To them, they preserve this two-form. Maybe you could hope that there's a way to say, you know, the dynamic things can be made algebraically stable, or there's some additional geometric structure that's kind of messing things up for you. I don't know, but that's enough now. Thank you.
