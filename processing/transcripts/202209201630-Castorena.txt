Thank you very much to organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. And I want to talk about a, and I think is an interesting topic, at least for me and for my collaborators, that is a connection between two Between two concepts of stability, linear stability and vector bundle stability. And I want to sketch two results. I tried to make a gluing between two results in different papers. One of them is recently published. And one of the results is a work, a joint work with Hugo Torres in Zacatecas. And the second one is a collaboration. And the second one is a collaboration with Ernesto Mistreta in Paduba and Ubo Torres in Zacatecas. So let me start. I don't think that I have enough time to give all details, but I will try to be clear in the exposition. So I'm going to start C. Smooth irreducible curve or GNSG and I'm going to consider a line bundle B, I will take B to the space of sections. Of sections such that generates L or base point-free space objection. And this means that the evaluation map, I take a section at point P, this is locally. I evaluate the section. I evaluate the section. This map is surjective. This definition, I can give this definition also for a vector bundle. I mean, I consider a vector bundle. So the space subsection of a vector bundle that generates the vector bundle means that the space subsection of the vector bundles is. Section of the vector bundles is rejected. So sometimes I say baseball free, or sometimes I will say that generates, but it means the same thing. So is rejective this map and this is the surjection induce a sac sequence. And depending on the author or the book you choose, this is called this is the kernel of the evaluation map and it's called CCG bundle and some routers called Outdoors or Lazar fil Mukay bundle, but some authors deserve this definition when they are considered evaluation map on cutter surfaces. But you can in teleterator, you can find these two definitions. So So what is the two definitions that I want to give are the following. Let me recall the definition of stability, slope stability for vector bundles. C is for the moment, C is any curve. So, I will say that I'm going to consider the slope degree E over to rank A and is semi-stable. Semi-stable F we have this is for stability. This is for stability and for same instability can be less or equal. This is a classical definition of stability. This is the slope. And there is another definition of stability, no vector bundle stability, but is for line bundles or more general for linear series of line bundles on curves. But before that, let me Let me explain the following. Let I'm going to take a line bundle I consider B L this is Linear series of degree D, degree D is the degree of the line bundle, and dimension R and R is the dimension of section minus one. I'm going to assume B L generates L. So we have the SAC sequence we have if If I'm going to put is a proper for the moment, we don't know if this bundle is stable or not, but I consider a proper sub-bundle and this induces. And this induce this bundle defines I will take The image, I will take duals of B dual and we'll define a vector bundle using duals. This space W generates S dual and I can consider The evaluation map on S dual. And when we, and when I take duals, I will have contained in B. I will have FS, S is a sub-bundle, and I have this commutative diagram, and I will Diagram and I will call this diagram the buttler diagram of BL is just a definition by S. I mean, when I consider as a bundle, I start with a linear series that generates the line bundle. Series that generates the line bundle, I consider as a bundle of the kernel bundle of CCK bundle, and I get this commutative diagram. This commutative diagram I call Bootler diagram, and when is all the space obsession? I'm just going to fix Fix my notation of F In this case, this is M-BEL. For the rest of the talk, sometimes I will write commutative diagrams and with mean that automatically I will take in sub. I will take in some bundle of kernel bundles and I'm constructing this commuted jar, right? So vector bundle stability has a lot of applications in some branch in algebraic geometry. For example, For example, study the stability of MBL has implications and bring nether theory resolution minimal. Minimal conjecture a stability of the tangent bundle, the projective space restricted to an embedded curve and stability of the picture. Of the PICR. So, the stability of MBL is using in this context, for example, to study viril network theory, the stability of tangent bundle, stability of picker bundle, just for comments, some applications of MBL. So, but it's not too easy. There are results, but if you have a vector bundle. A vector bundle, and somebody asks you if the bundle is stable or not. You have to try to see why it's stable or not. For that reason, there is a new definition, no new definition, this definition that I want to write down is due to Monfort, but this definition is linked to testability in the following sense. So I will say I will say again, I start I start BL On a court sea, and I will say that. And I will say that B L is linear, linearly semi-stable if for any Linear series of degree D prime and dimension R prime we have that B prime Where D and R stability is a strict inequality, and for semi-linearly semi-stability, we can get equality or L specs. L is fixed. Yeah. It's fixed line bundle, but I can vary the subspace of sections, but I fix one space of section, and I have to compare this quotient for any sub-series contained in B. Oh, okay, thank you, thank you. No, it's for any linear series, of course. Of course, uh let me okay L prime of degree D prime and dimension R prime, we have these equality inequalities where Inequalities where W prime generates line bond on L. Sorry, sorry, thank you. So that is the definition of linear stability for a linear service on a curve. So if it's not easy to show that if you have the that M L The that ML or MBL is semi-stable or stable, we have that the linear series is linearly semi-stable or linearly stable. So the question naturally is when we have the converse. I mean, if I have a linear series semi-stable or stable in this sense, when we get the stability of the kernel bundle. Mistrett and Stoppino Gift conditions draw time the keyword. The equivalence between linear semi-stability and vector bundle semi But they give examples when the equivalence is not true. And they have the following conjecture. Let CB Agenus Curve BL Linear series D degree R The conjecture is if If D gonality of C times R then we have equivalence between linear Linear semi-stability of BL and vector bundle stability of MBL. The gonality, let me recall gonality or curve is the minimum of natural such that exists. Such that exists a degree finite map n to p1 is the the gonality of a curve and the condition the condition that they uh quite this is this condition because in the examples of mistreta estopino they show it when d is greater than gonality by r the equivalence is The equivalence is not truth. So, vector bundle stability implies linear semi-stability. But the converse, there are examples when this is not truth. So, the natural question is, this is true. So, I want to sketch that for general purpose will be truth. And I will sketch a contraxample using this, which is not true. And this is related with This is related with, I want to explain in which space or which cycle inside the modular space of Perth the conjecture fails. So moduli. So for me, general curve, okay, that I have an open statistic subset where our condition satisfies an open set. Satisfies an open set. So, thanks. Let me, maybe I want to be more precise because the conjecture is for a sub-vector space, but I will restrict to the complete case in order what's just when the space of section is all the space of section of L. For I don't. For an incomplete series, I mean when the subspace, the vector space is strictly contained in the space subsection of L is not, at least for me, is not too easy to get the equivalence. So, but for the complete case, this is true. And the sketch is as follow. Let me see. Let me see. Let me write down the Butler diagrams. This is the Butter diagram of all space objections as I explained before. So as I told you, vector bundle stability implies vector bundle semi-stability implies linearly semi-stability. So when we get the converse, so the first that I have to point is that if I assume that the line bundle Line bundle in other words is linearly semi-stable using the Butler diagrams and some computation of the slope. Necessarily, this bundle must be ranked greater than one. So to get the converse, I proceed by contradiction. First, I proceed by contradiction. I mean, if I want to show that ML is semi-stable, I will assume that it's not semi-stable. I will produce a line bundle, but this line bundle violates the condition to be linearly semi-stable. And in this way, I get the equivalence. So, in other words, let me Write down. I'm going to put the ingredients that we use in the proof. I will not give the complete proof because I want to expose one of the examples. But in this work, we use the following result. And again, L. L on a curve okay, sorry the theorem is this, and I'm going to extend. Theoretist, and I'm going to sketch which are the steps we use to prove. Let C be a general curve in the sense of moduli. Let L A generative linear series then linearly semi stabili is equivalent Two vector bundle of this is the conjecture for the complete case. I mean, this is the result for the complete case. And I just want to show that linearly semi-stability implies vector bundle semi-stability. Let me step one. We show the following let oops let C V any verb. First L I generated linear series, so I have an exact sequence I consider S As a bungalow of ML and let Q the portion So, we have the following multiplication map. For example, in the diagram bootloader, what is the okay here idealize this? I dualize this sequence, I tensor by the canonical bundle, and I take homology, right? I have the following multiplication map. So we have one. We have one is rejective if and only if zero q is the quotient of the sq if P is reactive. W is all the space of section of the bundle F if S is stable of maximal slope. Then we use the first result because for inter-proof it's very important to have that w is all space of section of the bundle F. Step two As I told you, the way that I proceed is by contradiction. I will assume that ML is not stable. So, step two, we have the following result. Is lemma one here is let C be a general curve L a degree D Line bundle Globally generated in other words based on free set R plus one the number of section then M L is ML is semi-stable. Under this condition, the vector bundle cannot be unstable, is at least unstable. Moreover, if there exists As a bundle S such that has the same slope, the slope of S is equal to slope of M L is semi-stable, but can be strictly semi-stable. Strictly semi-stable means that there exists a sub-bundle that attains to slope of ML. Then, Then the first homology group of L is zero. The rank of S that I will write by S is equal R minus one and three. And three the degree is G plus R and G over R is a natural number. This is lemma one, and for the following result, I will use one, two, and three to get the result. And it's the following. The second result is LEM2. Lem two again, let it be a general curve of genus G greater or equal than two, again, L pick D C globally. Generated a line bundle and set R plus one the global sections, the space of global section of L Then oops let as a bundle. In fact, lem one and two maybe can be write down as only one lemma, as ML as a bundle such that Such that then there exists a line bundle FS such that That such that the following diagram commute Spanish This is an inclusion. So, first dilemma uno helps to show that the rank of S is R minus one. The rank of M L is R. Of ML is R. If this is a trivial bundle of rank plus one, this is a line bundle of rank one. So the kernel has rank R. And lemma one tells us that the rank of S is R minus one. And only we have two options of the rank S must be two and must be one. Assuming Assuming this condition is strictly semi-stability, we get that the bundle F has rank one. So if I assume that the bundle, the bundle is semi-stable for lemma one, but if I assume that the bundle is strictly semi-stable, I produce a line bundle F that belays the To F that belays the condition of linearly semi-stable. And in this way, by contradiction, I show the equivalence between linear stability and vector bundle stability on a general curve. We have also Applying lemma one and lemma two, we get the decided equivalence. To show lemma one, we make use. We make use of classical Brilletter theory of line bundles on general curves and some computations on the slope and Brilletter numbers. And the same for to show lemma two, I have to introduce the Brinkletter number, the Brinkletter varieties. But for the moment, it's more or less a sketch of results that we use to produce. To produce the equivalence, you surprise that the question is: okay, these two definitions of stability are equivalents on a general curve. But we show it also that on a hyperelliptic curve Okay, the mistreta stoppino conjecture is truth. Not only in general curves, also on eperelliptic curves, the conjecture is true. But we have Truth, but we have two opposite cases. The modular space of curves is stratified by gonality. What it means, I start when a curve admits a degree two map to P1, we call it per elliptic, when admit a degree three map, we call trigonal, one admit a four degree map. A four-degree map, tetragonal or forgonal, et cetera. So I define the locus of curves in MG such that is I mean see admit A finite map of degree K. Adding base points, I have the following stratification. Hipperelliptics are containing an trigonal. MG for general for general could C C has it has bonality this number so this app The mistreta Stopino conjectures is valid here and is valid here. What happened between all Loshi, the rest of Los so find contra examples can be easy or not depend on the problem and here we And here we need a lot of numerical conditions to try one case, no, the second case, change the degree, change the numeral section, etc. So we have the following counterexample. Let C B B a smooth plane curve of degree seven the genus if fifteen bonality of C Of C is projecting from a point where I've had six points of intersection with P1. This induce a degree six map. So the curve has genus six and we have That on any component of okay, I have time. Maybe I have to introduce just notation in case you don't know. You don't know, but for the moment, in the black board to my left, and here, see any curve, I define a real network variety, locus or line bundles in peak DC such that Admit at least R plus one section. So following We show We show it the following. We show it the following. It's a classical, is using techniques of line bundles. Yeah. We show it the following. Okay, my counterexample will be in Genos 15. And I need the following. This is notation. Okay, let me. Okay, let me let me call a train Let C B a curve or genus G greater or Greater or equal than 11 angonality and greater or equal than phi. We need this hypothesis because in some moment of the proof, we use a Moon for Kim result that gives a bound of the dimension of this breed network variety. This bridge netted variety for G dependent of G, R and D. And for technical reason, we need technology at least five. A general element of any component. Component of satisfies one the line bundle is globally generated or in other words based on free, I mean the evaluation map. I mean, the evaluation map is rejective. The induced map observes that when I take in W2, I means that the line bundle has at least three sections. And in fact, we want three sections. The map, the induced map C to the image C bar is birational and C bar has only notes as singularities And three our L is linearly stable. Mistrette and Estopino, in one of their works, they showed that in this case, when I have a plane curve and any singularity has multiplicity less than the degree. Less than the degree of the line bundle over 2, the line bundle is linearly stable. This is one of the geometric interpretations of linear stability. We follow some ideas of Boisan and we complete the picture of the component, of any component of this brilliant variety, showing that this line bundle is linearly stable. It's greater at least greater 11 and gonal edify. So I will start. So, I will start. I stopped here. In this case, we produce it. Okay. I back again. Okay, now we consider a plane curve of degree seven, genus 15, Gornali T6. We are in such conditions. Then, We have that for a general element L in any component of fifteen one L L is linearly stable to the Cisiki bundle is not linearly semi-stable. For one and two, we have analyzed. For one and two, we have to analyze the diagram, the Butler diagram. The idea is the following. I just want to put one exact sequence and I want to write down a subloshi in M15 to finish. Okay, linearly stable is birational, is globally generated, I mean based upon free. I mean based upon free, we have this exact sequence. ML We have a canonical line bundle. I want to take the I have in P2, let me call B in this example. In this example, B will be O P21 restricted to C tensor this exact sequence and take homology, okay and I will have H0 B B I have a multiplication map B L is general in any component of 1, 2, 15. Okay? Ah, and I discontinue. It's not difficult to show. Is not difficult to show the proof okay, to get the counterexample is needed to show. To show, and this is again a brilliant classical Brill Nether theory using that I'm now that I'm in a general element in the sense that I am in an open condition in any component. So we show the following: the first homology group of L tensor. Fields homology group of L tensor B is zero. I use Riemann Rock to show that this space has dimension eight, this has dimension nine, the kernel is not zero, so B dual is injected in ML, B dual is a line bundle of degree minus seven, I can show that, so and uh And the degree of B dual is minus seven, and this is greater than mu ml. In this way, we get in in M M in the model space M fifteen. M15, we found a locus of curves. We don't know which kind of cycle defines, but there is some well-known elements inside this locus. This locus, what it means. The locus of curves of genus 15, which admit a line bundle with three sections and the grey 15, such that the kernel bundle, such that the line bundle is linearly stable, but the kernel bundle. Linearly stable, but the kernel bundle is not linearly semi-stable. It's not empty because any 15 degree seven curve, smooth plane curve is inside of this locus. So all image of the severity variety of smooth plane curves of degree 50, of degree 7 is contained in this locus. But this locus is contained in another interesting logic that is not well understood what it is. Not well understood what it is. It may be, at least for me, it's very interesting to try to understand the structure of this locus, the locus where this conjecture fails, right? What is the locus? This locus is contained in the 80s or 90s, I don't remember. Jonathan Wall showed it for any curve. C. Any curve. Given any curve, I have a natural map. I consider second stereo product power of the canonical or section of the canonical bundle. And locally, S F G, this is locally. This gave a global. This gives a global section of the power of the canonical boundary. This is now, this is called the wall map. And Jonathan Wall showed that if a curve is a hyperplane section of a country surface, this map is not surjective. Jonathan Wall showed that any That any smooth plane curve of degree greater or equal than seven is not in a catary surface and has wall map not surjective. So the locus that we found, the locus that phi is the mistreta stoppino conjecture in genis 15 is contained in the wall locus. I mean the locus occurs where curves where this map is not subjective. So if we call this locus where the map is not surjective as the wall locus, here let me call the mistreta estopino locus and here is the severity variety of smooth plane curves of degree seven and is very natural. It's very natural to try to understand this inclusion, which kind of cycles define this guy. In fact, there is no information what is the structure of the wall locus, but okay, it's a very severe locus is well study. So what is the a natural question is: okay, in some way, In some way, you are inside the wall locus, but you have line bundles where the kernel bundle is not stable. What is the relation from the point of view of vector bundles between the existence of some unstable bundles on smooth plane curves and the wall locks in this setting? Maybe in a different way. Maybe in a different way, or in a different setting, maybe. I don't know if there is a relationship, but at least in this setting, I think it should be interesting to investigate numerical properties or some rational questions about mistreta estopino locus antivolocus, at least in genus 15. 15. We tried to compute new counterexamples in other genus or for other smooth curves of degree different than seven, but we couldn't. And we don't know. Natural question is if we'll be only in very strange numerical conditions that we find counterexamples, very concrete counterexamples to Mistrette's topino condition. Mistreatastopino condition, or maybe using different techniques, try to study this cycle in MG. I stop here, and thank you very much. Thank you for the nice talk. Are there questions in the audience? Yeah, so before going to the before going to the long side, right? Do you guys know in the linear system of a smooth plane septics, degree seven, if O1 satisfies this condition, the refresher condition? Or does it have a dimension? Because it needs to satisfy it to it's a smooth plane curve of degree seven. It is more plain curve of degree seven, right? Yeah, yeah, it's with hyperplane section, but it needs to be linearly stable and not with kernel bundle not stable. Is that true for any smooth plane curve of degree seven of degree seven admit a line bundle which is linear stable with Kenner bundle not stable? I mean the image of the severity variety is included or Is inclined or the severity varieties of smooth plane curves of degree seven? Yeah, yeah. At least this gives you a local dimension of the mistret test of Pinolocus because the image of the severity variety of degree seven has dimension 3D plus G minus 9. I think 21 is dimension 20. I think 21 is dimension 21. This is degree seven. There's a very variety has dimension in 3D, making quoting from PGL2. And the general fiber has dimension G minus 9 using Moonforkin. 15 minus 9. This is 16. This is 27. Okay. Okay, you make the difference. And so the image has dimension 21, 22. I'm not sure, but we don't know the dimension of this locus. In fact, one of my students is trying to understand as well this locus and this one, but I think it's not so easy. Yeah. Yeah, for example, in this case, I have to show that any, I think, no, because, okay, no, I don't know, because I have to show that any curve of genus 15 with no sort. With no surjective wall map, admit a line bundle, linearly stable, such that, but I admit this is too complicated. But from the point of view of geometry of cycles in MG, I think it's interesting to study. I think this will be very, very local dimension in M15. I think you are talking.
