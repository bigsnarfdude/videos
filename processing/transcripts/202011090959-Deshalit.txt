All right. So thank you everyone for coming. Have a wonderful weekend. It's a pleasure to have Ehud Salit talk about difference equations over the field of elliptic functions. Okay, so thank you very much for inviting me to give a talk in this conference. I'm a newcomer to the field of difference equations. Actually, I was exposed to it about three years ago and I heard in Montreal Boris Lonchevsky give a wonderful talk about it. So thank you, Boris. And I'd like to talk about To talk about, just one. Let me see if I can just a moment. I'm going to try something. Okay, now it's better. Do you see it? Everybody sees the slides? Do you see the slides? Oh, you don't see the slide. Nope. It must have stopped. Nope. I must have stopped sharing somehow. Something happened. Let me go back and start sharing again. This is it now. Okay, good. Okay, the only problem is that your face is somehow blocked the slides for me, but that's okay. Okay, good. So I'd like to talk about difference equations over. I'd like to talk about difference equations over fields of elliptic functions. But to start, I will go over two theorems over the rational fields, which might be well known, but let's go over them as motivation anyhow. So let capital K be the field that is obtained from the field of rational functions by extracting roots of the variable x. And I view it as a subfield of k hat, which is the field of. K hat, which is the field of Poisson power series that is obtained in the same way from the field of Loren power series. And then we have the mahalo operators sigma and tau of raising the power x to x to the p or x to the q. And I assume that p and q are natural numbers that are multiplicatively independent. No power of pu p is a power of q except for one. And a Muller equation for a power series F in K. For a power series f in K hat is simply a linear dependence over the field K between the iterates of sigma on F. So that would be like a sigma Mahler equation. So you look at f of x, f of x to the p, f of x to the p squared, and so on. And if they satisfy such a linear dependence, you say that you have a Mahara equation. And around 1987, Loxton and van der Puten asked what can be said if a function if Said if a function, if a power series f in k hat satisfies simultaneously both a p-muller equation and a q-muller equation over k, and they conjectured then that it must be in fact in capital K. And this was proved about three years ago by Adam Chevsky and Bell. And I should make two remarks. First of all, it follows easily that if the coefficients are in fact in Cx, Are in fact in Cx and F is in a Laurent power series, then F is in Cx2. So the only advantage of working with these larger fields upstairs is that sigma and tau become automorphisms rather than just endomorphisms of the fields. And the second remark is that underlying the theorem, there is the multiplicative group of C star. Sigma and jar are endomorphisms of this multiplicative group. And K is really the field of rational functions on the universe. Field of rational functions on the universal covering of it in the algebraic sense. So there is an even older additive analog in which we can take k to be simply c of x and k hat the Laurent series field. And for sigma and tau, we take instead of mother operators p or q difference operators. So we multiply the variable x by p and q. And again, p and q should be multiplicatively independent. They can be Multiplicatively independent, they can be any natural, any complex numbers. And then in 1992, Bézivine and Boutaba proved that if f in k-hat, a formal power series, satisfied both a p-difference equation and a q-difference equation, then it was a rational function. So, in the original theorem, there were some restrictions, they can be lifted. They can be lifted. So, this time the theorem lives on the additive group, and sigma and tau are, of course, endomorphisms of the additive group. And k again is the function field of the universal cover, except that the universal cover is the additive group itself because it is simply connected. Now, the proofs of these two theorems were quite different and use a variety of ideas, but about a year or two years ago, A year or two years ago, Scheifke and Zinger came up with a uniform treatment of both of them, as well as of other similar results due to Romy and others that I don't have the time to survey. And this is what started me on the subject. And I should add that very recently, just three weeks ago, I think, Adonchewski drivers, Hardewin and Witmer posted on the archive a remarkable strengthening, but you'll have to wait too short. But you'll have to wait to Charlotte's talk on Friday to hear about it. So, I would like to talk about an elliptic analog. So, let us introduce some notation. If lambda is a lattice in the complex numbers, I denote by k lambda, the field of lambda elliptic functions. As you all know, it's generated over the complex numbers by the Varshta-Spe function and its derivative. And again, we would like to consider functions not on C mod lambda naught, but on its universal. not but on its universal cover so this amounts to taking the union of these k lambdas for all sub-lattices lambda of a given lattice lambda naught so this is our base field k and i should mention that it really depends only on the commendurability class of lambda zero not on lambda zero itself. And k hat will be again the field of Laurent power series, and we view K as a subfield of this much larger field K hat. This much larger field k hat. For the operator sigma and tau, we take the elliptic p or q difference operators. So we substitute pz or qz for the variable z, but of course, to keep the ellipticity or the fact that sigma and tau are automorphisms of k, we have to assume now that p and q are integers. And this theorem, and again, we assume that there are multiplications. And again, we assume that they are multiplicatively independent p and q, so multiplicatively independent integers. So, for the main theorem, I have to make a slightly stronger assumption. I have to assume that p and q are not only multiplicatively independent, but in fact relatively prime. But then you take an F in K-hat, a Laurent power series. You assume that it satisfies elliptic difference equations, so the same type of equations, but we're now the Type of equations, but where now the coefficients ai and bi are in the field k. Then the conclusion, you might guess that f is in k. Well, it need not be in k, but it lies in a slightly larger ring that I call r, which is obtained from the field k by adjoining the functions z, z inverse, and zeta z, where zeta z is the Weierstrass zeta function. It's a primitive of the Weierstrass square function. Square function. It's very close to being elliptic, but it's not elliptic. It's enough to adjoin Z of Z for one lattice. It's an easy exercise to see that once you adjoin Z of Z for one lambda, then all the Z of Z lambda prime for all the commensurable lattices is there. So this is our ring R, and that's the conclusion. So here are a few remarks. First of all, as I said, I do not know if I can relax the assumption. The assumption that P and Q need to be relatively prime. The theorem is optimal. The reason that I cannot deduce that f is in K is because, in fact, any F in R satisfies an elliptic Q difference equation for any Q. And I raise a question to which I did not give an answer, but you can ask for a final result. You can say, suppose the coefficients are all in a specific k lambda. Well, what is k lambda well what is the best lambda prime such that f is in r lambda prime where r lambda prime is as written on the slide now before i go into the details or any more discussions i want to emphasize two basic differences between the two rational cases and this similar looking elliptic case the first is that in the two rational cases the proof eventually goes by meromorphic Eventually, it goes by meromorphic continuation. You somehow show that f really represents a function that is meromorphic everywhere, and a function that's meromorphic everywhere on P1 is rational. So you're done. But here, even after we meromorphically continue our F, we're faced with issues of periodicity, which are completely of a different nature. The second basic difference or issue is that F in fact need not be in K. And as you saw, And as you saw, it the conclusion is that it lies in this slightly larger ring R. And this is related, as we shall see, to the existence of non-trivial vector bundles on the elliptic curve, which are invariant under pullback by these isogenies, sigma and tau. And these vector bundles were classified by Attia in 1957. And in the rational case, of course, every vector bundle over the multiplicative or additive group is trivial. Ease tree. So, are there questions so far? Okay, if I don't hear anybody, then I. Jason, if there's any problem with the connection, I rely on you. Okay, good. So, I'd like to switch from the language of equations to the language of different modules. Now, in the context of the three examples that we will be discussing, the two rational ones and the elliptic one, Elliptic one. This is only a matter of language, but maybe at the end of the talk, I will make a few remarks why, in other circumstances, the language of difference modules is really better than the language of difference equations. So, a difference module is the following. You start with an arbitrary field K and an arbitrary group gamma acting on K via field automorphisms. You let C be the You let C be the field of constants, the invariance on the gamma. And the gamma difference module over K is a finite-dimensional vector space M over K, which is equipped with a semilinar action of gamma. In other words, for any little gamma in gamma, there should be a linear transformation over C, which is semilinar over K, as you see in the first bullet. And of course, this should be an action. So the linear transformation associated to gamma composed with delta should be phi gamma. composed with delta should be phi gamma composed with phi delta. And the connection with the equations goes via the following basic example. So in the three examples that we have been considering, we let K be this field and gamma the group generated by sigma and tau inside the automorphisms of K. And the meaning of P and Q being multiplicatively independent is simply that this group abstractly is free abelian of Is free abelian of rank two. And then we have this power series at hand f, and we look inside k field at the spin over k over the global field of sigma to the i tau to the j f. So this m is obviously a k vector space that's closed under the action of sigma and tau because they commute. And the meaning of having simultaneous Simultaneous molar difference or elliptic difference equations for sigma and tau is simply that the dimension of this m is finite, therefore it is a gamma difference module. And under the assumptions of the three theorems, they will all follow from a similar theorem stating that this module M that we just described is degenerate in some sense. Degenerate in some sense. And the key point, which is food for thought if you want to speculate or contemplate over higher-dimensional analogs, maybe, is that the rank of gamma is two, while the dimension of the underlying curve or the transcendence degree of the field K is one. So in some sense, the system is overdetermined. Now, in the two rational cases, degenerate simply means that this M descends to the simply means that this M descends to the complex numbers. In other words, there is a representation of gamma over C, which simply means, of course, because gamma is Z squared, a pair of commuting matrices, scalar commuting matrices, constant, such that our M is obtained via a semi-linear base change, okay, a tensor over C with K and extend the action semi-linearly. In our case, in the elliptic case, the degeneracy will be more. The degeneracy will be more subtle, and this more subtle structure theorem will be related to those vector bundles that I hinted at before. So, as in linear algebra, it's useful to introduce coordinates and matrices. So, we have gamma, which is isomorphic to z squared, sitting inside the automorphisms of k in each of the three examples. We have m, which can be an abstract gamma difference mode. Which can be an abstract gamma difference module, or the one that came in this example here, right? But you can now forget about the example. And you express the action of sigma in terms, on a given basis, in terms of a matrix, except that traditionally it's people denote the inverse of the matrix of the Aij by A and the inverse of the matrix of the Pijs with B. Matrix of the Pijs with B. And then the only condition really that you have to check is that phi sigma and phi tau commute. And in linear algebra, this would mean that the matrices commute. In semi-linear algebra, it means that they satisfy this consistency condition. Sigma applied to B times A is tau applied to A times B. And if you change your basis, then in linear algebra, you would get conjugate matrices. Here you get twisted conjugate matrices. Here you get twisted conjugate matrices, which is called gauge equivalence. So you get A prime being sigma C inverse AC and B prime being tau C inverse B C, where C is the matrix of the change of basis. So as an immediate corollary, we deduce that the classification of gamma difference modules over K is basically the same as classifying consistent pairs AB. A B of matrices in GLRK up to gauge equivalence. And this, if you prefer, in the language of non-abelian cohomology, is the same as the determination of, by definition, the determination of H1 gamma GLRK. But we shall not be using this language. And I want to just make a side remark that at this point, if you replace GLR by another linear algebraic group G over here. Linear algebraic group G over K, then you would arrive at the notion of gamma difference modules with G structure. Now, I don't know enough to know if this has been explored. There is in the Addict Hodge theory an example of such difference module, which is called an isocrystal. And this has been explored in a paper of Kotwitz from 1985. But I mean, I'd be I mean, I'd be happy to know if this generalization had been explored. So let us start by discussing gamma difference modules over k hat, over the simpler field of power series or Poisson series. So either K hat is Poisson series with sigma and tau being molar operators, or in the other two cases, either the additive or the elliptic case, k hat is Laurent series field with sigma. Series field with sigma and tau being just the usual difference operators. And in the elliptic case, of course, for global considerations, they have to come from integers. But now, once we're dealing with the formal aspects, it doesn't really matter. So the formal structure theorem tells us that in all these cases, any gamma difference module over k hat indeed descends to C. Descends to C is over-determined in some sense. Or equivalently, in the language of matrices that we just introduced, any consistent pair AB is gauge equivalent over K hat to a commuting pair of scalar constant matrices. And this has been known for a lot of time, I think. And the proof can be found in various places in the literature. It's based on the theory of Newton polygons and slopes. Of Newton polygons and slopes. I do not want to go into it. There is a slight issue of uniqueness. In the Mahler case, the spare A0, B0 of scalar matrices would be unique up to conjugation. In the Q-difference case, there is the issue of what I think is called sometimes resonance, but essentially up to resonance, it's also unique. And again, in the theory with which I was more familiar. Which I was more familiar with F-e-So-Crystals. This is the old theorem of Manning and Died. So, how would the proof of the conjecture of Lochstone and van der Putin go following the ideas of Schefke and Zinger, of course. So, in this case, the Malor case, K is this field we discussed before, K hat, is the field of Puzzle series and sigma and Tor Mahor operators. Mother operators. And the theorem of Adomchevsky and Bell follows quite easily from the fact that not only over k hat, but even over K, any gamma difference module descends to C, is obtained from the finite dimensional representation of gamma by semi-linear base change. And I want to sketch the proof because our proof in the elliptic case. Our proof in the elliptic case will begin in the same way, but there will be differences, as I pointed out, at a certain point. So we look at the three points, 0, 1, and infinity. Why these three points? Because they are fixed points of the operators sigma and tau. And we introduce local parameters at these points. t0 is x, t infinity is 1 over x, and t1 is x minus 1. And we denote. Minus one. And we denote by O hat i for i being 0, 1 or infinity, the completion of the local ring of p1 and by k hat i the fraction field, the local field at that point, the complete local field at that point. And we start with some pair of matrices, consistent pair of matrices, describing our M in some basis. And by the formal structure theorem, we know. Formal structure theorem, we know that at each of these points separately we can make a gauge transformation, but with a CI in GLR of the completion at that point, so that the resulting AIBI are scalar, are constant. So for i equals zero or infinity, since we're dealing with not quite with right with With rational functions, we might have first to replace the variable x by x to the 1 over s, but this is a small point. Now, remember that we are allowed to replace a b by any gauge equivalent pair over k, because this simply amounts to choosing a different basis over k. And weak approximation tells us that we can find the matrix, one matrix with entries in k that similar. With entries in k that simultaneously approximates C0, C infinity, or C1 in the topologies of the corresponding local fields. And if we make such a gauge equivalence, such a change of basis, if you want, then we may assume that the Ci are in GLR are not only in GLR of K hat I, but in GLR of O hat I. And in fact, we will not need it. And in fact, we will not need it, but you may assume that they are as close to the identity matrix as you want. The next step, you do some estimates on the formal Taylor expansions and the local analyticity of A. I should say that under this assumption now, after the weak approximation, the A and the B will be analytic at the corresponding points, not just meromorphic. And of course, you use this. Can you? And of course, you use this. Can you see my cursor if I move over this? Yeah, okay. So you see, if you use this, for example, for A, this gives us a relation between sigma of Ci, which is Ci of X to the P, written as Ai times Ci inverse times A inverse. Okay, but Ai is constant, A is everywhere defined. So this gives us some functional equation, and we use it to And we use it to show that the CI are not only formally analytic, but in fact, analytic in some disks. And in fact, we can boost up the region of convergence, or rather the region of meromorphicity, using the functional equation. Because A is everywhere meromorphic, Ai is constant. So using this repeatedly, we boost up the region of meromorphicity. Of meromorphicity of C0 to the full southern hemisphere, C infinity to the full northern hemisphere, and C1 to P1 minus the two poles, the north and south pole. So now we have a large overlap. Okay, at the beginning these were formal power series, but now they overlap. So we can compare them on the overlap. For example, we can compare C0 and C1 on C0 and C1 on the punctured southern hemisphere, and we get this type of functional equation. And it is an easy exercise to see that from this functional equation, you get that C0, 1 in fact has to be constant. But this means that C1, which is this constant matrix, times C0, or C0 times this constant matrix, is actually neuromorphic or even analytic at 0. Or even analytic at 0, 2. And likewise, if you compare C1 to C infinity, you get that C1 is meromorphic not only outside the two poles, but also at the two poles. Therefore, it is a rational function, and therefore it gives you, it allows you to reduce the structure to the complex numbers. So this is basically the whole proof. And it's a beautiful idea of Chefkin Zinger. So let us start by discussing elliptic PQ difference modules or elliptic gamma difference modules. Sometimes I call them elliptic PQ difference modules if the group gamma is generated by this p-difference operator and gamma difference operator of low ranks. So again, let me remind you: k is this field of elliptic functions on all the covering of our given elliptic curve. The covering of our given elliptic curve. And forgive me for switching to sigma of f being f of z over p rather than of f times z. And likewise, tau of f being f of z over q. This is just to be consistent with my paper. This simply amounts to considering sigma inverse and tau inverse in the original notation. And let's start with rank one. So if M1AB denotes the AB denotes the one-dimensional module K times E, where sigma acts on E as A inverse E, and tau acts on E like B inverse E. You see, A and B are complex numbers. So you see immediately that this has the underlying C line, complex line C E as a complex structure. If we denote by M1AB this very simple. Rank one difference module that descends to C, then the proposition is that every rank one gamma difference module is in fact isomorphic to unique such M1AB. And this is already non-trivial because already the issue of periodicity, as we will explain, shows up here. In rank two, this is already. In rank two, this is already false. So I must admit, when I started working on it, I hoped to get a generalization. Well, in any rank, but after not being able to do it, I found this following counterexample. And this counterexample in rank two is prototypical. It turns out that this is really, really prototypical for all that's going on later. So let zeta be this Weierstas zeta function. So you can write it as the You can write it as the logarithmic derivative of the Varschwa sigma function, or up to a sign it as the primitive or aprimitive of the Varschlass pair function. And since the Varschaus spare function is periodic, if you move the variable z by a lattice vector, omega, and subtract zero of z, then you get a constant. This constant is traditionally called the Legendre eta function of omega. It's a homomorphism from the lattice to the From the lettuce to the complex numbers. Let g p of z be p times zeta of qz minus zeta of pqz. So you see immediately that this now is elliptic. This one, this function is lambda elliptic, right? Because if we change z to z plus omega, both p zeta qz and zeta p qz change by the same number. Change by the same number. And similarly, let gq be the function that is obtained by reversing the roles of p and q. And let a and b be these matrices, very nice matrices, 1 gp0p, 1gq0q. So you can check they form a consistent pair, and therefore they correspond to what I call the rank two standard special module. module. So explicitly it is k squared with sigma acting via multiplication by a inverse on the vector obtained by applying sigma to the coordinates and tau is acting by b inverse times the vector obtained by applying tau to the coordinates. And in this rank two case you can show, or this will be a special case of our main theorem. Main theorem that every rank one elliptic PQ difference module either admits a unique C structure or up to a twist by a rank one module is this standard special module or isomorphic to this standard special module. And this is an exclusive or right this these M2 This these m2 stand.a b are not cannot descend to c do not admit a c structure so maybe i should ask if there are questions so far or jason nobody has been sending you anything in the chat okay i hope this is tell me if if i'm too quick or too slow or okay good good so let us start with So let us start with the general classification theorem. So now that we have seen what happens in rank 1 and 2, let M be a rank R module over K of general rank represented by consistent pair AB and some basis. So as I promised you, we're going to follow the path of Schreifgenzinger. And the first step is much easier because instead of considering 0, 1, and infinity, 0, 1, and infinity, we have only to consider 0. And we find by the formal structure theorem a C in GL R over K hat such that if you apply gauge transformation using this matrix C, you get a commuting pair of scalar matrices. So this is the initial step. The next step is again the same, but we do not have to use weak approximation because we are only dealing with one point, so it follows. One point, so it follows just by the density of k in k hat that if we approximate this c very well by a matrix of global elliptic functions d, and replace a b by a gauge equivalent pair with this d and c correspondingly with d inverse c, then we may assume that c is in glr of o hat. And as before, it follows from this that now after the From this, that now after this gauge equivalence, A and B will be analytic at zero. And the next step is again the same. Estimates on formal Taylor expansions give us exactly as before the fact that the C is analytic in some small disk. And still, the next step, the fourth step, is again as before. You use this function equation, which basically tells you that c at p times z is a times. times z is a times c times a zero inverse, okay, to boost up the domain of meromorphicity. Okay, it's well meromorphic continuation, not analytic, because A might have poles far away from zero. But of course, once you, you know, you first have it at radius disk at radius epsilon, then radius p epsilon, p squared epsilon, eventually you cover the whole complex plate. Plate, but you're faced with a big, big difficulty because now you're faced with an issue of periodicity. If you want to prove that C, this would not be the case, but if you wanted to prove that C is periodic for some lattice lambda commensurable with our lambda naught, then you'd be facing a problem. So the The key idea is that something of the periodicity is saved. And to explain this, I want to introduce some sheaves, but these are sheaves in the classical topology of C. So script M is the sheaf of meromorphic functions, script O is a sheaf of holomorphic functions. G is the sheaf GLRM, sheaf of R by R invertible matrices with entries in meromorphic functions. Entries in meromorphic functions, H is the subsheaf GLRO and F is the quotient sheaf, sheaf of cossets. So let's note, first of all, our C. What do we know about this matrix C so far? We tortured it enough to know that it is globally meromorphic. In other words, it's a global section of the sheaf G. Now, the sheaf F has a nice property. Has a nice property that its sections are discretely supported because, right, because the poles of meromorphic functions are isolated. And what are the stocks of f at each point psi in the complex plane? They're GLR of Laurent power series over GLR of Taylor series. Okay, maybe you would argue that I have. Okay, maybe you would argue that I have to insist on convergence, but because I'm taking these cossets, it's okay to write it like this. Now, this is a very well-known object. This is called an affine Grassmannion, and they play important role in many branches of mathematics, but I don't know much about them except that these are affine Grassmannions, and I won't be using much about them. Now, we can identify the stock at Xi. The stock at ψ and the stock at xi plus omega via translation. And we call a section of any of the sheaves, but in particular of the sheaf F, of the sheaf of F inverse Mannyans, lambda periodic, if under this identification, the germ of the global section xi is the same as the germ at psi plus omega for every xi and any lattice vector omega. And we denote the lambda periodic sections. denote the lambda periodic sections by gamma sub lambda. And another terminology we will call S prime a section a modification at zero of s if it only differs from s at the point zero. In other words, if when you restrict this global section to the huge open set, which is the complement of zero, it agrees with s. And here is the first theorem, which I call the periodicity theorem. Well, seen it not be periodic. Well, C need not be periodic. But the image of C, remember C was a global section of G. Okay, let me remind you: G is GLRM, H is GLRO, and F is this sheaf of F-I-in-Grasmanians, GLRM over GLRO. So as a global section of G, C need not be periodic, but as a global section of F, its image is lambda period. Is lambda periodic for some small enough lambda, provided you allow a modification at zero. And this modification at zero is a nuisance, but you really have to do it sometimes. So, and as an example, what this means, let's take the case r equals one. F is the simply the sheaf m star over O star, and via the degree map, it's simply z, right? But z somehow discretely at each. Discreetly, at each point, discreetly and discontinuously, you put Z. And CZ is simply a global meromorphic function. What do you know about it? You know that C of PZ over CZ and C of QZ over CZ are elliptic functions. That's the input in this case. And the corollary would be not that C is periodic, but its divisor is periodic. This is what it means to talk about the image. What it means to talk about the image of C bar as a global section of F in this case. However, when R is one, you can invoke Abel Jacobi. And it's a little exercise to show that in this case, in fact, the modification at zero translates to multiplying by some power of z, z to the m for some m times cz would be periodic. But in rank two, this is already not the case. So let us see what. Case. So let us see what we have done so far. Fix some lambda and let's introduce the Adelic notation. A lambda is the restricted product of these completions of the field K at xi, these fields of Laurent power series around xi, restricted as usual with respect to the ring of To the ring of holomorphic functions of Taylor expansions, and let Blackboard bold O be the product of the O xi hat. So S, I denote by S, I didn't say so, but I denote by S this modification of C bar that the periodistic theorem gives me. So this S is a longer periodic global section of N. Periodic global section of f and this is simply an element of glr of the adeques of lambda. The adeques is a ring. You can take glr of the adeques of lambda over glr of this subring of the adeles of lambda, the everywhere holomorphic adeles. Now, to what extent this S is unique? Remember that C is determined by M only up to left multiplication. Up to left multiplication by a global matrix, a matrix of globally elliptic functions. So, right, this would be the gauge equivalence or the change of basis. So, this gives us a well-defined class in this double coset space of GLRA lambda over GLRO lambda on the right and over GLRK lambda in the left. And this is a very familiar double coset space. It's called the complex points of the state. The complex points of the stack ban R, but these are big words. It's what it is: it's a double coset space, and it classifies isomorphism classes of rank R vector bundles on the elliptic curve C over lambda. And remember, this we can do for any lambda that is small enough as given to us by the period ST theorem. So to sum up, M gives us C, yields S, and the class of And the class of S in this double-coset space depends only on M, and it's a class of a certain vector bundle. And the functoriality tells us that for all lambda small enough, these E lambdas, these vector bundles, are compatible under pullback, and also they're invariant under multiplication, or pullback rather, via the isogeny P or Q, if you want. Now, in general, vector bundles over varieties are very difficult. Bundles over varieties are very difficult to classify, but luckily, Attia, in a beautiful paper in 1957, classified all vector bundles on elliptic curves. And one thing that he proved, he proved many other things, is that for any R, there exists a unique optoisomorphism, a unique vector bundle that's denoted F R on C mod lambda, on the Lipped curve C mod lambda, which is indecomposable, doesn't break up as a direct sum of vector bundles, has ranked. Sum of ecto bundles has rank R, has degree zero, and it admits non-trivial global sections. And in fact, any other rank R degree zero in decomposable vector bundle would be a twist of this one by a line bundle of degree zero. So this allows us to deduce quite easily that given this m, we can attach to it an invariant that we call the type, which is a partition of r into Which is a partition of R into R1 plus R2 plus Rk. Let's arrange them in increasing order, it doesn't matter. Such that for all small enough lambda, this vector bundle E lambda is isomorphic to FR1, direct sum FR2, and so on, direct sum FRK. It's of a very specific form. And moreover, you can really write down using complex analysis a matrix in one R language. A matrix in one R lambda representing this F R. And it's the matrix U R, unipotent matrix, which is the exponential of the Vashtra set a function times N, where NR is the nilpotent matrix with ones just above the main diagonal and zero elsewhere. So this is the matrix I plus zeta times n. plus zeta times n plus zeta squared over two factorials times n squared and so on right you you have all these diagonals above the main one and they're multiplied by zeta to the i over i factorial so it's a very explicit nice matrix of course this sum is finite because n is nilpotent and in fact it turns out that m admits a c structure if and only if If and only if its type is 1, 1, 1. In other words, if and only if this vector bundle B lambda is trivial, I haven't told you, but of course, F1, the Atea vector bundle of rank 1, is the trivial vector bundle. So E lambda is trivial if and only if the type is 1, 1, 1. So from now on, let us assume to simplify the presentation that The presentation that the type of M is at the other extreme. Okay, so there will be, of course, a lot of combinatorics that has to deal with intermediate partitions. But let's assume that the partition is simply R equals R. In other words, that E lambda is already in the composable. So in this case, the global section S, remember, it was, we interpreted it as a global section of one R lambda. Global section of 1 r lambda, but now we know, thanks to ATIA, that it's also the global section. Sorry, it's also represented by UR. It's a double coset that's represented by UR. Now you can change it on the left by a matrix, an invertible matrix with elliptic functions as input. And then you can deduce that C of That C, well, S is not quiet C because of this modification at zero. So except possibly at zero, C is U R times D, and D now must be everywhere holomorphic because it should correspond in one R lambda to something in this subring O, or rather in GLR over that subring O. So So let us change the scalar matrices that we have arrived at in the beginning, A0 and B0 by a gauge transformation using this D. And we get matrices that they call T and S. And then you can deduce that T and S are actually globally holomorphic. And you finally get rid of this annoying. Annoying ambiguity at zero, annoying, there's a little dilemma here, but you get T and S, which are in GLR of globally meromorphic functions, and your A and B that represented the module. Of course, they are matrices with entries in elliptic functions, are given by URZ over P T U R Z inverse or U R Z over Q S U R Z inverse. S URZ inverse. Okay, so remember this equation one is very important. And now comes the second deep theorem, the key, what I call the key lemma. And this is that after a mild operation, which is conjugation by scalar matrix commuting with UR, okay, this is allowed, this equation one forces t and it. Forces T and S to be of very special form. In fact, up to a constant A or B that corresponds, of course, to a twist by a rank one module, they are simply the diagonal matrix 1P P squared up to P to the R minus 1, or 1Q, Q squared up to Q to the R minus 1. And now comes the main structure theorem. In the case where the type is R, if the Type is R. If the type of M is R, then up to a twist by a rank one module, M is isomorphic to what I call the rank R standard special gamma difference module. So you have seen it before for R equals 2. This was exactly the example with which I started. And the more general setup is this one. So you have explicit T and S. Explicit T and S. You see them here. You have a very explicit UR, and you get some explicit A and B that involve these functions GP and GQ and some factorials and some nice formulae. They're upper triangular, because everything here is upper triangular. So, well, if the type is R, M need not be, need not Be need not descend to the complex numbers, but still, it is of a very special shape. So, here are some final remarks before I spend a few minutes. I want to give you two slides at the end about what I call fun with elliptic functions, the proof of this key lemma. It's really fun. So, the first remark is that, as I said, the key lemma and the periodicity theorem are the main technical steps. Technical steps. As I also said, when the type is arbitrary, not 11111, and not R, anything in between, a more complicated structure theorem exists, but it's still completely explicit and enough to give us the main theorem. And finally, that the theorem that asserts, the theorem with which we started the talk, asserting that F, a power series F, satisfying simultaneously an elliptic P difference equation, an elliptic - An elliptic Q-difference equation lies in this R follows from the main structure theorem applied to this M. And of course, now you can see where at least where the zeta function comes from, the functional zeta function, it comes from its appearance in this matrix UR. So if there are no questions, I will give some time for questions, but if not, I want to just show two more slides. Show two more slides and prove the Kilimani special case. But let's see if there are questions about the formulation or about the logic of the proof. Yeah, no? Okay. I hope everything is clear. Okay, good. So here are these two slides that I promised. Here they call fun with elliptic functions. And I will give you the proof of the key lemma when r equals 2. So forget about the theorem. So, forget about the theorem, just the key lemma. So, the key lemma had the following input. We had an equation which we called equation one. Let us go back and see it here. Okay? That basically rearranging it says that A times U is U at Z over P times T, where A is one of the A and B, that is a matrix of elliptic functions, giving us, of course, the structure as a gamma difference module. As a gamma difference module. And T is this matrix that we deduced is everywhere holomorphic, including at zero. And U is this very special case of UR, which is one Z of Z one. Good. So let's start exploring the consequences of this identity. You start with the lower left corner. This gives you C of Z equals gamma of Z. But C is everywhere elliptic. It is elliptic, and gamma is everywhere holomorphic. elliptic and gamma is everywhere holomorphic. So c equals gamma equals a constant. Now you do bootstrapping. Why do I call it bootstrapping? Because you use what you have proved about c before, that it is constant to improve and show that c is in fact zero. C equals gamma equals zero. And for this you take the lower right corner. So bootstrapping step, lower right corner. Lower right corner tells you that c times z of z plus d of z equals zeta. Now, take the sum of the residues in both sides over a fundamental domain for the elliptic curve. You see, delta is everywhere holomorphic. It need not be periodic, but it's everywhere holomorphic, it contributes nothing. D is elliptic, so the sum of the residues is zero. Zeta has some of residues which is not. Has some of residues which is non-zero, so C must be zero. So you reduce that c is zero, and now you are left with the equation d equals delta. So d is elliptic, delta is everywhere holomorphic, so they are constant as well. Now go to the upper left corner. Now we're allowed to rescale everything because we still have the freedom of twisting by M1AB by a rank one module. So let's rescale so that this constant delta equals d. This constant delta equals z is p, and now looking at the upper left corner, you get az equals alpha z, and again, for the same reason, it is a constant, both entire and elliptic. And finally, you look at the right upper corner, and you get the equation A zeta plus B is P zeta z over P plus beta. So here is the only place where you have both zeta z and zeta z over p. As e over p and you take again the residues and sum them over a fundamental parallel p-pad, and you get that for the residues to sum up properly, the only possibility is that A is what was alpha also, is one. But then Z of Z minus P Z of Z over P is maybe up to a sine. Is maybe up to a sine what I called before gp. And this is an elliptic function, and this should be beta minus p. So beta again is both elliptic and homomorphic, hence constant. Finally, to get rid of this beta altogether, you conjugate everything by an upper triangular scalar matrix that's allowed, and you end up with t equals 1, 0, 0, p and a having this very particular. And A having this very particular shape. And you can guess that S is 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, Q, and B is 1GQZ0Q. So the general rank case uses exactly the same principles, only the algebra and the bootstrapping. It's not two-step bootstrapping, it's R-step bootstrapping. But basically, it boils down to these same principles. Okay, so I think I'm three minutes above time. So thank you for your attention and please stay tuned for Charlotte's lecture on Friday. Thank you very much. All right, thank you for the talk. Any questions? Let's see the chat. May I ask a question? Hi, yep. Hi. I was wondering if it would be reasonable to include the data function in the base field so that you will have some kind of analogous statement or if you're Yeah, you know, I think that's a very good point. So, as I said at the beginning, I'm studying these things from a Dao point of view or from the point of view of this Picard Visa rings. I think the answer is absolutely, you're right. Absolutely, this should be in some sense the better field. Maybe let's stick to rings because this is a slightly more precise. Because this is a slightly more precise result that this ring R, you do not really need to take the field generated by Z and Z. But I think you're right. I think that this field somehow has better properties and that could be another formulation. You're absolutely right. Thank you. I'm very happy to see the faces of everybody, finally, because I was reading for the last year papers by people that I don't know, and/or looking at papers, people that I don't know. So now I see their faces. Oh, hi, Joe. I see Joe Silverman. I do know you for many years. Yes, yes, yes. And Moshe Kaminsky, I do know some people here. Zoe, probably from her visits to Jerusalem. So is there any other questions? Aye. Is there sort of general Hilbert theorem 90 that might sort of explain this non-abelian cohomology or interpretation or? Okay. Okay, so who was asking? It's me. Oh, Jason, hi. Okay, so yeah, so the concept of a gamma difference module, of course, is very general. Maybe I'll use this opportunity to make the remark that I wanted to make at the beginning. And if gamma is a finite group, then what Hilbert's theorem 90 tells us is exactly that the theory of gamma difference modules is void. Is void. That's one way to interpret Gilbert's theorem 90 as saying that there are no non-trivial gamma difference modules of finite group because, right, that's basically what Galois theory will tell you, that gamma appears as a finite Galois extension, and then you invoke up. So, in a way, all this business, in the language of Of Gao cohomology, you can think it as a failure of Hilbert's theorem 90 in cases where gamma come from some dynamical systems in a way. I imagine the interest in these operators comes somehow from questions in dynamics. What I wanted to say is that. There is the language of equations and the language of modules. And of course, this is like in PDEs, you know, you can either work in the language of partial differential equations, linear, of course, only linear PDEs, or the language of D modules. And for this gamma that we talked about, which is Z squared, a billion of franc two, this is completely equivalent. But you could think, for example, still in the For example, still in the rational case, what would be a good theorem not of two Mahler operators or two Q-difference operators or two shift operators, as in the paper by Schiffke and Singer, but what would happen if you consider one Mahler operator and one Q-difference operator. And it turns out that the Galois group generated by these two now is generalized dihedral. And it's generalized dihedral. And it's generally dehedral in a way that it is not enough to write two equations for the molar and the difference operators. You really have to assume that this module is finite-dimensional. And if you want to express it in equations, I think I might be wrong, but I think that the number of the minimal number of equations that you would need will depend on P and Q. So there are cases, I think, where really this language of difference modules. Language of different modules gives you a better way to formulate theorems than the language of equations. If I may, I will have another question.
