The group that we found here. Yeah, so this is about a joint work with Miami David, Tomek Grebiak, and Marik Mandel. It's about a system that I was interested in when I've gotten my PhD. Okay, so the usual difficulties. So we'll be starting with a fluid-based model for tissue growth or tumor growth. So what I mean by this is that we have two cell densities, M1 and N2, in some Two in some at some position x and some time t, and they essentially evolve according to two mechanisms: some mechanical pressure that drives the dispersal, and then there's some growth dynamics. Okay, so cells die or they divide. And so, there are several ways how we connect, or how we can connect the pressure and the velocity. So, one way is to couple it through Nadia-Stokes, another way is to couple it through Brinkmann's. To couple it through Brinkmann's law and yet another that we've just seen earlier through Darcy's law. And I'll be interested in these two viewpoints. And what I want to present today is essentially how we can go from Brinkmann's law to Darcy's law. And as a constitutive law, we say that the pressure, as a pressure, we use as a proxy the total cell density as Jose already mentioned in the first talk. So this is a system that I started studying in my PhD. System that I started studying in my PhD. So today we'll eliminate all the non-local terms. But essentially, this doesn't make the problem much easier. The difficulty lies in this general parabolic term, if you will. And what we see up here here, this rho plus eta, these two densities, this is what I will call throughout as n1 plus n2. And you can think of that as it doesn't matter which cell density occupies a space, any density will contribute to. Any density will contribute towards a pressure. So, this is the idea behind this term. All right. So, the system that we'll be considering is essentially this one. I just added some, and there's some growth dynamics on the right-hand side. And so, here we have this velocity field that introduces some coupling. The velocity field satisfies what is called Brinkmann's equation, the solidic equation. And here it couples to the pressure gradient. Okay, and so there's essentially. Kim. And so there's essentially the two dynamics encoded that I mentioned earlier. So we have this pressure-driven dispersal, okay, because it couples through the velocity, and then there's apoptosis and mitosis in these growth terms. And this is also where the coupling happens. So we have this joint population pressure that appears both as an argument of the growth rate and in the velocity itself. Okay. And so the goal. And so the goal today will be to let go to zero and essentially to go from Brinkmann's law to Darcy's law, what we've written here. Okay, so formally we can just kill this term nu. We set nu equal to zero. What is left is that the velocity is minus the pressure gradient, and this is Darcy's law. And what we obtain in the limit is essentially the system. So you have just this gradient and then the total population, this triangle population pressure. And this is what we want to show. And this is what we want to show rigorously. And so I'll show you in a second that the problem is also, as Jose foreshadowed, that we go from a transport type equation to something that is a degenerate parabolic. So this is the difficulty here. So about the system, I just want to show you some simulations. Here's a case where we have intrusion. So the green density essentially invades the red one and pushes it. Invades the red one and pushes it aside. But I want you to pay attention to the sharp interfaces that we see. Here's another one, a displacement example. So this one grows faster and then it starts pushing the other species away. But in both cases, you have this occurrence of a sharp interface. And this comes, you really suffer a dramatic loss of regularity at this interface. And this is just in 1D. And then, so since Jose was mentioning the group in Princeton, they did these cell experiments. They did these cell experiments, and this is exactly also what Jose showed earlier with these patterns. What you see is you have these sharp interfaces in these tissues, and this is kind of like replicated by this type of junk population pressure. So, this is something that can be replicated. And now you see that this sharp interface will cause some issues. So, what is known, and how does this relate to the literature? So, essentially, there's three communities I can identify. Three communities I can identify that this relates to. So there's steric particles and included volume interactions. So essentially, if you have disks with a certain radius R, and they just perform a random motion, but they cannot overlap. So we have these black disks. Each of them has an annular region, the yellow one. And this is the volume that the black disks assume. So imagine you have two coins, then you cannot move them closer. Well, you can move them as close until they touch. Move them as close until they touch. Okay, and then if you do a coarse graining, what you obtain is a linear term, linear diffusion coming from your Brownian motion, and then this volume exclusion term gives you this higher order contribution. So this non-linear diffusion. This is what I wanted to point out. And so there's been some seminal work by Maria Bruna and John Chapman. Essentially, these papers where they study. Papers where they study the anisotropy and the volume exclusion effects and how a non-linearity emerges. And if you have a closer look, you can identify directly that this is the same but for two species. Then people were also interested in this type of equation from a different point of view, namely from non-local approximations of this degenerate parabolic equation. So this is kind of what we'll say also. So, this is kind of what Losé also showed earlier. You start with a particle system with a damped Langevin dynamic, then you perform a mean field limit, and now we have this kernel K epsilon that essentially we want to damp epsilon to zero and K should go to a direct delta. Okay, so typically what's assumed is that K has this double convolution structure and it converges to a delta. So, we have a curve like this, it becomes stiffer and stiffer, but on a very narrow region. But on a very narrow region, and they have highly localized repulsion. And what you obtain formally substituting a delta here is the sky, a non-linear diffusion. And so in a stochastic setting, if you have non-local interactions plus some Brownian motion, this has been studied by these authors. But what I want to highlight is that very recently, or more recently, this has been studied by itself without any diffusion. And this goes back to an idea of the Goon. And this goes back to an idea of De Gon and Moustier as a deterministic approximation of diffusion equations, this kind of thing, using particles, just particles. And then, okay, the community evolved. There's this Comtendieu paper by Maskalik and Lyons, and then later Bosser, Antonio, and Tecati, unfortunately, who's not here, also worked on this, Francesco, Petakini, Martin Boga, and Jeremy. And so essentially, And so essentially, they studied this type of system and then also more general nonlinearities. And the difficulty here is really you go from something that is essentially a first-order equation to something that is second-order, the general parabolic. And then there's the third kind of realm where this result connects to. This is the general cross-diffusion systems with these internal layers that I've just shown you, with these sharp interfaces. So it's equations of this type, and one of the Equations of this type, N1 and N2, they respond to the joint population pressure, and the growth dynamics is also related to the joint population. Okay, and so this is an old system, it's been proposed in the 1980s, first mention it, and then been studied by Michel Berch, Güten, Hilhorst, Pilitian, Murai, Sohara, many people, but always under the assumption that you're bounded away from zero, so you have like positive solutions everywhere. Positive solutions everywhere. And then during my PhD with José, Simone, and Filippo, we were able to remove this vacuum assumption, a no-vacuum assumption, and we could do an existence result with vacuum as initial data. And then subsequently, there have been a range of new techniques introduced by the Guiasdas, by Benoit, by Price and Shu, Yuan Shu and Matt Jacobs, and they all have different strategies. Both have different strategies showing existence. But essentially, there's only two ways how you can deal with this. Option one: you show a strong compactness of N1 and N2 and weak compactness of the pressure gradient, or vice versa. You show weak compactness of the individual species, but strong compactness of the gradient. And this is where we're sitting because with this invisit limit, while we were able to model these size exclusions, we have a non-local to local. Exclusions, we have a non-local to local limit for this cross-diffusion system, essentially something like this. And it's another way of showing existence to this system. Okay, and so the starting point is our Frinkman system, the coupling to the Frinkman law. And now just let me allow to rewrite this slightly. I will introduce a potential W. Okay, so I have this potential W, it's related to the pressure, and then I replace the velocity by the gradient. And then I replace the velocity by the gradient of w. So I just want to have this switch of viewpoint because I will use facts or like knowledge on this potential w. But I've only rewritten the system. And there is some assumptions on the growth rate. It should be a decreasing function. Let's say like this. All that is written here is you have something like this in mind. It's a decreasing function. It has one zero for biological reasons. For biological reasons. And yeah, okay, some regularity should be C1. Okay, and then the starting point is we start with some with unique, weak solutions to this equation. So weak solutions, as usual, we put the derivatives on the test functions and we include the initial data. And so what's known about this is that there is L infinity, L1, L infinity, L infinity data. The same holds for this potential. The same holds for this potential W as given here, the potential solution to the Brinkman equation. And moreover, this has a kernel representation. Okay, so this W can be written as K convolves M and K satisfies this equation. And now you can see that as nu goes to zero, we have K as a Dirac, i.e., we go to Darcy. And this is why I say that this is a way of approximating your degeneric posture. Your degeneracy fusion system non-locally, but for systems. And what's important in this thing, in this argument, is that this has elliptic regularity because it satisfies an elliptic equation. Okay, so if you just look at the estimates that we already have from the known theory, then an application of Bana-Halla Oblu gives you directly weak limits of the individual species from here and also for the sum. And also for the sum, okay, because both are bounded. And on top of that, we know that the weak limit of w, which is also bounded uniformly, must be a naught. Just by comparing, you take a test function, you integrate it against w, you use the convolution structure, put the convolution on phi, and then you have that this guy converges strongly to phi, and this guy converges weakly. So we can identify limits. That's all we're saying, which makes sense because if nu goes to zero, you just. And if nu goes to zero, we just convolve with a dira. So this is what is known already. So we have limit objects here, here, and here. Question is: what about m? What about gradient w? And this is what I want to present today. And this is the result. So assume that initially n log n, so the entropy is bounded. Assume that you have some second moments, and assume that this non-local energy, this quantity, is uniformly bounded in you. Quantity is uniformly bounded in u. This is also in relation to this flow interchange technique. We don't use it like this, but this is kind of what's hidden there. Under these assumptions, there will be an element, a naught, L2, with a one derivative, such that we have strong convergence in the total population, and we have strong convergence of the gradient as well. And so the technique I've seen in two contexts. One is very recently in a very nice paper by Matt. Nice paper by Matt, and another context at a school that you organized in Lapila that was just last autumn by Philippe Bohr. When you do the H2 convergence, there's a similar argument. Okay. Okay, so what are we doing? We take the entropy and we study the entropy along the flow, the Brinkman flow. So we substitute that, V by D T of the entropy. We do a chain row, differentiating the log, get this line. Get this line, then we substitute our equation and integrate by parts. And then what we obtain is we get gradient log n times n is gradient n. And we integrate by parts once more, because in principle in the limit, the transport equation doesn't have a gradient mu, a gradient n, because it's not parabolic. But we can integrate it on the test, on this potential w, which has to derive. On this potential w, which has two derivatives because it satisfies an elliptic equation. And R is just all the lower order terms. So, as far as this talk is concerned, we can forget about them, but we have to treat them carefully. Maybe we do it rigorously. So, we have that the entropy is dissipated in this sense. So, this is the first statement. And as I was pointing out, we don't have information on the gradient n, but we can integrate it on w, and there we know what this object. On W, and there we know what this object is. And so we can make this rigorous, saying that the entropy is dissipated in this sense. And I just want to show you really briefly the steps. So we do a viscous approximation, a regularization. We add a small diffusion. Then we show that we have second moments and the bounds on n log n, essentially. And this is stable with respect to epsilon. And then we show that the sequence in terms of epsilon is compact. Terms of epsilon is compact. So we can remove epsilon essentially. And this is using the strategy that was introduced by Jabin and Bergachem for nonlinear continuity equations. And so at the level of approximations, we can justify all the integrations by parts. So we introduce this regularized entropy. It's localized because we have to use compactly supported test functions. We shift the log. We remove all the problems essentially. remove all the problems essentially. So we can use it as a test function. We can, yeah, now I'm skipping a lot of stuff, but we manipulate all the error terms in the weak form. And then first we let epsilon go to zero, we remove the viscosity, and then we shift the log back. And then we arrive at this version, this local version of the entropy dissipation, but you still have this test function sitting around here. And then as a final step, using monotone convergence, we just use a cutoff. We just use a cutoff, right? And then we let that ball go to infinity. And so this can be, we can do this, and then we get a global version of this entropy dissipation. So this is the first ingredient. And then the second ingredient, well, so the first step towards getting the strong compactness of the pressure gradient is strong compactness of W. W, just to remind you, It's just this quantity. So we want, well, if this guy converges weakly, we want that this guy converges at least strongly. But this guy depends on a small parameter as well. So it's not as easy as saying, okay, but there's a convolution. The convolution changes also. So if we have a sequence of potentials associated, we can show two things. We have some spatial regularity and we have some temporal regularity. And this already reeks of. And this already reeks of a banlion. So you do a barlion and you extract a convergent sub-sequence strong, the convergent sub-sequence in L2L2. And by the a priori bounds, we also know that the gradient converges weakly to W0, just because the uniform L2 bonds. And now I want to remind you that we already know that the weak limit of W is a naught. It's like as if we didn't have the convolution, okay? Have the convolution. So, in fact, we know the w will converge strongly to n0 and the gradient will converge weakly to the gradient of m0. Okay, and this is already a gain of information, but we're not entirely there yet. So, how do we do this? Well, and this is uh this Brinkman equation is really beautiful. I hope I can convince you at least of this. So, what we do is we expand the square and we integrate by parts. Then we add and subtract the first term. So, we add term so we add n subtract or well subtract n and add n and then we observe that there is a brinkman equation sitting right there in the second term right so n minus w is just minus nu the plus w this has a sign so we remove it so what about this first term the first term is exactly the dissipation of our entropy we know that the log is bounded we know that the right hand side is bounded i mean we show so the sky is actually bounded So, the sky is actually bounded. And so, we have spatial control uniform in the sky. And then, because it's of the specific type, we test against a test function. And then we can put this in L2. This is in L infinity. L2, as we've just proven, is bounded. So, essentially, what I'm saying is this has an L2H minus 1 control. And so then we get exactly all the statements that I made. W converges strongly. converges strongly. With this information, we know W it's not too far away from N. So we expect that also N converges strongly, and this is the next step. So as mu goes to zero, nu will converge to n naught. And so what we want to show is, well, first w and n, they're kind of close. So we expand the square. And you see here, we already have kind of a Brinkman equation popping up. So we'll substitute that. And we get a Laplace done. That and we get a Laplace W with a small factor nu in front. Let's expand this. Now it's got two terms. This guy is the term that is bounded by the entropy. Okay, this is a constant as far as we're concerned, times something small. And this has a sign. Okay, so we integrate by parts. We have a great minus a gradient squared can be removed. In other words, this guy has the sign, it goes, this is bounded times new. So whatever the limit is, it will. So, whatever the limit is, it will be the same. And so, if we compare a new and limit, we squeeze in a w nu, then we know that these two things go to zero. We shrunk from the merger here, and this proves that this error or this difference goes to zero. Okay, so if we revisit our weak form, now we can pass to the limit in the nonlinearity, because we know what the limit is. limit is remains to show gradient w converges to gradient of n0 and this is the final step in this argument we want to show that this not only converges weakly as we know from the the a priori bounds but indeed it converges strongly so how do we do this so again we start with this uh this gradient w term okay and then we integrate by parts And then we integrate by parts. We add and subtract an n. Again, this is what I meant by the Brinkman equation, it's really beautiful because there's something inherently like it's nice, it always works in your favor. We add and subtract this term to recover Brinkmann term here, which has a sign. Okay, so this can be removed from the equation once more. And we're left with the dissipation. One part of the dissipation of the log entropy. Dissipation of the log entropy for the Brinkman system. So let's summarize that. The gradient of W squared is less than n la plus w. But also, if we sorry, so here I did it explicitly actually. So this is the dissipation. So I can bound my gradient W by this lower order terms and then the final and initial entropy. Initial entropy. So let's keep that in mind and observe that the same type of estimate holds for the heat, the sorry, the porous medium equation. So we take the log entropy and now we take the limit equation and evolve the entropy along a node, a limit. This is the general parabolic equation. And it has a very similar structure, but it holds with equality because there's no terms that we have to toss when we approximate. Okay? So this holds with an equality. Okay, so this holds with an equality, and then we have the final and initial evaluation, and this is the dissipation term. And so now, if we say that either the initial data does not depend on u or we have the appropriate bound, so we can bound this by this guy, we can combine these two estimates and stack them together. Okay, and so now we have grad w squared is less or equal grad n naught, the alleged limit, plus the difference in the lower order terms, plus Difference in the lower order chance plus a difference in the final time. So let's zoom in on this. There's not much to zoom in on, actually. What we prove is that these terms are small. And so now you can already see or start appreciating. And this is similar to what Matt was doing and also what Filippo has been doing. There's two steps, if I remember correctly, when you show in this time approximation, you have a bound like this. What you can do is, well, on the one hand, Well, on the one hand, if you pass to the limsup, you know, the lim sup will be less than the limit itself. Nothing to be done. But also, the norm is a convex function, and we have weak convergence. So law semi-continuity tells us that the lim int will be larger than the limit. And lim sub is always larger than lim int, and you have convergence of the norm. And this is what you need. So now you have a weak limit with the norm convergent, and therefore, quad w must converge. Therefore, quad W must converge strongly. Okay, and so this is kind of like at the end of the time, but also at the end of the talk. So we talked about, sorry, all of these terms. This guy was never an issue, the first one, because we had weak convergence. Now we have a duality weak strong. And we know that n itself also converges strongly, posing no issues to pass to the limit in the nonlinearity. And so as mu goes to zero, we can do the Springman to Darcy limit. We can do the Springman to Darcy limit obtaining the weak solution to our gross medium type system, okay, or if you will, a non-local approximation of this cross-diffusion system, the general cross-diffusion system. And to connect with what I said initially, so if we think of this kernel as like a characteristic length scale of interactions, we have derived an efficient model, sorry, for size exclusion. We can think of it as a monologue approximation after. Local approximation of this cross-diffusion system, or it's yet another proof of existence to this type of system. Okay, and with this, I'd like to finish, and I'd like to thank you all for your attendance. Thank you very much for your very fascinating talk. Other questions, comments? Please continue. Yeah, so it's a good question. And so once we found this union of tricks that makes the machinery work, then we became a bit blind and just finished. But then, you know, upon second reflection, you observe that the Brinkman law for essentially, so let me write the question so that it's clear to everyone. Here you can put a P of N and you get a And you get exactly as nu goes to zero, you have still the W converges to P. The only thing that is different, you want to study the evolution of P. I went with the pressure variables that you wrote in the very first thought on Luz. So if for instance, if you have like M to the gamma, okay, you study with this equation for the pressure, you get something like this: plus gamma P plus P plus. P plus lower bulletins. And we observe that this has also an H minus 1 bound. And then you can use again a compensated compactness type argument to also show this for nonlinearities like this. And would expect that even more general nonlinearities shouldn't cause an issue. But we're not quick enough to see. But the key thing is really this entropy dissipation and you Really, this entropy dissipation, and you know, being able to stack these two dissipations in the right way to get more convergence, like some of you know. Any further questions or remarks? Please? So, there's a thing that you just mentioned in a musicoid also work with nice incompressibility. So, yeah, so as far as we see, there's not many constants that estimates that depend on gamma, right? So, what you're asking is: can we let, so this is another very interesting. We let so this is another very interesting limit, singular limit, gamma to infinity. And so, what Matt is saying: if you divide by gamma here, essentially, and you have appropriate bounds, then you know that p infinity plus infinity is zero. Or well, maybe it's and some sorry, yeah, the growth here. Okay, so you have a sylliptic equation essentially. So you have a sylliptic equation essentially. Well, okay, so to answer the question, we haven't done the estimates, but all the things that we do doesn't seem to depend on gamma in any bad way. Just like this limit will also work for general gamma. But I can't say for sure, but it's definitely something to investigate. Okay, I don't see any further questions at this moment, so we thank Marcus once again. I don't know if you need it.
