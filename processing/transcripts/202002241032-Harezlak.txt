So before I start, actually, I would like to thank Ashkal and Chipran and all the other organizers. You know, it's great to be here and finally to see some snow this winter. We didn't have much, I live in Indiana. And before I actually go with the talk, as previous speakers, I had a bit of a hard time deciding, you know. Of a hard time deciding on what to present. And I'll just present a snippet of what we've done over the past few years. But let me start actually with some of the history, and this connects with some of the people in this room and how actually I started all this research. If you ask me seven years ago what's wearables, what's, you know, I have no idea. I had no clue what this is, I had no clue that there's a I had no clue that there's research done on that. And then actually, I went on my sabbatical in 2013 to Hopkins to work with Chipian on brain imaging. Lo and behold, after a few months, you know, he introduced me to wearables. And this is something I like to tell this story because it's Jasek is not here. So, Jasek Rubanek, who will be giving a talk later, he was my postdoc at the time, and he actually. And he actually joined me at Hopkins during my sabbatical. And we got this email from Chiprian. And it was a weekend trip to New York. And we're on the top of the Rockefeller Center building. And we said, okay, this is something we should look into. So, as I said, the rest is the past six, seven years. I had a lot of fun working on such data. And one thing that And one thing that we concentrated on was raw axolometry data. And this is something that not many groups have been working on those times. Now there are more groups working on it. But let me tell you actually what we have done. And again, this is one of the pieces of research or one of the kind of pieces of the puzzle that we're trying to solve. So basically, let me. So, basically, let me read what's in red there. So, we've been working on different physical activities, for example, walking, walking recognition, driving recognition. This one was more of a problem that got... We're always asked when we're presenting this walking recognition. Can you actually differentiate based on wearable devices, either wrist-worn or hip-worn, if somebody is sitting Hip worn, if somebody is sitting or standing. This is seemingly a simple problem. I mean, you would think that something like that would have been solved a long time ago and the accuracy of such an estimation or prediction of such activities would be a simple thing. Well, if you think about something worn on the wrist, this is actually not as simple. And why are we concentrating on the wrist? Well, one of the things is it's the placement. It's the placement where participants, especially in big studies, are the most compliant. If you have something on your hip, or if you have to have something, let's say, glued to your chest, like I've never got something glued to my chest, sorry, never. Or if you wear something on your ankle, it's kind of not as convenient. So, wrist was our kind of placement. So, what I will present. So, what I will present here, and this is again, please do ask questions if you have any questions during the talk as well. What I'll present, what I will concentrate on is really the sitting versus standing. The method for that. We have a manuscript, it's still kind of being... We sent... We had it reviewed where we'll be sending the revisions for that soon. So, yes, in this group, I don't have to convince you. Group: I don't have to convince you that wear box arometers are great, why they are great. We can extract data that are objective. We hope to extract information that's objective, but at least the data should be objective. They're easy to wear. Those devices are pretty cheap. That doesn't require you going to the lab and spending time in some chambers or in a lab where the measurements. Lab where the measurements would be very expensive. There's this other thing, and this is not in this presentation, but I work with another investigator who is interested in injuries from running. And this is something it's very hard to have a human observer kind of noting, okay, this was this run, there was something weird during this run. So she puts accelometers which measure observations. Observations at about 300 hertz. I work on another project where we are interested in concussions, and these concussions are in college athletes. So this is like my traumatic brain injury. In football, there are helmets that are equipped with sensors. Those sensors measure acceleration at 1000 Hz rate. And it's actually very important because if we want to get instantaneous measurement, Instantaneous measurement of the heat, we need such a frequency. So, well, again, I won't talk about all the observational studies in clinical trials. There are experts here in the room who can talk about that, but there are many of those studies these days that use wearables. Now, so we talked a bit about the placement, and I think that pretty much covers all kind of ways. All kinds of ways, it's never all, but major ways where the devices can be placed. So, we talked about the chest, we talked about the hip. There's actually today I will be talking about devices placed on the thigh and on both wrists. Sorry, both wrists, hip and thigh. This will be different devices, actually. So, I mentioned earlier in one of my comments, we ran a study where the participants had devices placed on the ankles. Is placed on the ankles, and it was great for detection of warning. I mean, this is the best place, but for other activities, it's not as great. So, I don't think we have seen this data. Actually, I'm glad I'm presenting that, you know, as one of the first speakers, because if I presented that tomorrow, probably you would have seen something like that a few times already. But this is data, actually, that we are kind of gathering on the extra ramp. Gathering on the accelerometers that we are using. And those accelerators, we usually set them to measure the acceleration at about anywhere from the tens of Hertz to 100 Hz. So here, this is the situation that, you know, after a while, after looking at such data, it's like if you remember the movie Matrix, you know, you had all those things kind of going down, the symbols or something like that. It's like, I can look at this data kind of as a movie and This data, kind of as a movie, and say, okay, somebody's walking, somebody stood up, or something like that. Of course, you cannot detect all activities, but something like that, you know, some experience you can kind of see that. So here, as I said, we had one paper on driving, we had a few papers on walking detection. And here, this doesn't look as similar to each other, but both of those kind of signals, they are periodic. Driving signal, of course, the periodicity is high. It's of course the periodicity is higher than for walking. However, if we look at the harmonics of the signal, actually harmonics of the walking signal will be overlapping with driving. I think it's important to mention here that this is a RISC device and if you worry at the heat from what I understand from the ATEC or at the other body location, you cannot actually detect driving. Yes, so yes, maybe just a very important point. That's a good point. That's a very important point. That's a good point. And I have till quarter to four minutes. Four minutes. Four minutes. Okay. So let me finish here. Okay. So it's one of the devices that we use. This is actually Gini Active. And again, these are the data we concentrated on the vector magnitudes. So like the Dr. Herring presented kind of the kind of such measurements. But again, we're taking them. Such measurements, but again, we're taking them every kind of like every observation unit. Now, for this particular project, I will skip a few slides here. What we did, I can answer all the questions. I'm here the whole week. We summarize this data, and because this is sitting and standing, we don't Sitting and standing, we don't really care about the activities changing within like a second or two seconds. You know, we really want to discover bouts of, let's say, standing. And before I show you the results, how much time do you think we're in a standing position? Those people who know please not answer because I'm looting some people here. How much time so let me restrict it to biostatisticians and statisticians. How much time do you think we're spending per day, on average? Think we're sending per day on average? Not much. Can I get the number? Is it two hours? Is it ten hours? Is it two and a half hours? Yeah, I like that. Less than an hour. 90 minutes. Less than an hour? Four hours. You're not even walking out. Yeah, but that guy knows too much. I know him. From this study, and this is a study of older adults. So if somebody said here, So, if somebody said here, I'm not pointing fingers. If you said you stunt under an hour, this is a study on actually, sorry, what these adults were 70 plus. They're on average standing about five and a half hours per day. You mean by being upright or like walking is that? Yeah, not walking. It doesn't have to be walking. Like, you know, just not sitting or lying down. So walking or something. Walking is counted. Walking or not. Walking is counted. Walking is included. But we don't walk much. We might be walking half an hour, an hour per day. That's, you know, that's, you know, hour, maybe an hour and a half. But, you know, and I get some. You disagree. I love a lot. These are 70 plus year olds. Okay, so basically what we did, the algorithm that we developed, our results are in blue. They kind of had silver standard from. We had silver standard from a device that was placed on the hip, so it was glued, it was stationary. Here we report the results from right wrist. So for majority of these people, this was dominant head. So our algorithm did pretty well where we agreed with the silver standard. What I'm presenting here is the average number of minutes per hour spent in a non-sedentary position. So, you know, during the day, and again, During the day, and again, these are retired people, so and I'm not standing this was videos activity, I'm not saying this is video activity, or this is an activity that, you know, somebody was running or doing, you know, crazy stuff, but just noting the sentenary position. So in the, again, this is on average, during the the most kind of standing time hours, it was twenty, twenty some minutes per hour where these participants were standing. As participants were standing. Okay, so let me go to the I have to give thanks. The majority of this work was done with my postdoc, Martin Stronzkevic, who is now working with JP Onella at Harvard. Data and a lot of collaborative effort is with Dr. Glen from the University of Pittsburgh and of course the group at Hopkins, Dr. Skańsha and Urbanek and Sipon. Doctors Khaenjan, Urbanek and Siponikov. Thank you. Also, for those of you who are interested in labelled activity data, YARIC and YATEC have done this fantastic study of 32 or 36 people for one hour each, where they went through a lot of different types of activities that are labeled by a human observer. And the data is available online, and Marta Cash could help you. Matacache could help you download the data and work with it if you want to write an apple. Well, can you all speak though? My understanding is that even these studies of the 32 or 36, I mean these lab-based studies, it's a totally different ballgame to detect these different activities in the wild. So this was not a lab-based study? That was a three-year-old all I was talking about is a filling activities. We have kind of Activities. We have kind of, and this is again with collaboration with Dr. Linxi. So actually the data that I first started working on was the study that she and I don't know, Jennifer, you might know more about the study, the DECO study, or you can... Tammy Harris. Yeah, I know Tammy Harris was leading the study, but it's a kind of it was the study of seventy plus year olds and they were actually uh had both in the lab and Both in the lab and acronym activity or the wild activity. So, a week of wearing the devices outside of the lab. So, this is still a great resource for so what data did you use to train your models in this one? So, here we used the cross-validation. So, we're training on part of the data and we're we were uh testing that on on the other part of the data. Is that the hour worth of simulated free living or no no no, this is all free living. Okay. No, no, no, this is all for the demo. Okay, so you were using the active call as the yes, we so yeah, sorry, I skipped that. So come on. We used Actifol placed on a heap as a, we call it silver standard. It's still not, you know, it's pretty much when you are, and maybe I'll just tell you about the idea behind that. We wanted to develop a method. Develop a method that, I mean, of course, these days, kind of deep learning and other kind of methods are much more popular, but we wanted to extract limited number of features from the data that would be informative of the kind of the behaviors that we cared about. And this is wrong picture. What we did, we extracted the position, so the direction of the sensor in one of the directions, and standard deviation of the raw accelerometry data within short time periods. And again, because here we don't care about sub-second or you know five-second activity, the windows we used were from 15 seconds to like 90 seconds. And this was driven mostly by this device. By this device, that gives you summaries in 15-second intervals. Is that the one on the tie or the hip? This is on the tie, it's glued on the tie. You said it was worn on the hip, but you meant the one. There was one on the hip as well. The standard was the act of shallow on the thigh, right? The standard that we used was the active on the thigh. This was glued, you know, permanently, and this was for seven days. So again, the issues with the rush and so on, there were issues with that as well. There were issues with that as well. And we noticed, we have another paper on that, some of the participants actually removed this device and glued it kind of the other way. We can detect that actually. We have an algorithm to detect if somebody didn't follow the study design or the I think we should thanks very much. I think we should go to the next one. I'll be here. We are not on a super, super tight schedule, but I just want to make sure that you guys can see. I can put it on here if I can. I can put it on here at Chatsuk's room. Jeff, are you showing us a chair? I will absolutely try. We'll absolutely try.
