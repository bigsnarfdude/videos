But I'm going to take you upscale from the subcellular cytoskeleton to multicellular networks. So these are some of the other systems that I have recently worked on. So my interests range go from the subcellular scale, like these were the myosin stacks that Sasha briefly mentioned. So I will also briefly mention that our working hypothesis for how these stacks form was through long. For how these stacks form was through long-range interactions between the myosins through the deformations of the intervening cytoskeletal elastic medium. And I am happy to talk more about these different projects with you if you're interested. So during some of my dinner table conversations, some of you were curious where Merced is. So I put it on the map here. So this is where the University of California is. Here. So, this is where the University of California Merced is located. It's kind of straight east from the San Francisco Bay Area. And here are some of the local attractions: Yosemite National Park, Sequoia Big Trees. And this is one of the newest universities, research universities in the U.S. and started only 20 years ago. And we have in our physics department, we have 20 faculty, seven of whom are working in soft matter and biological physics. So if you are or if you're interested in, if you know students who are interested. If you know students who are interested in applying, we are open for PhD applications right now. So please talk to me or send us applications. And the other quick advertisement is that I'm a co-organizer of this seminar series. It's an online seminar series exclusively for postdoc speakers. So it's a great opportunity for young scientists to highlight your works. SLAM stands for Soft, Living, Active and Adaptive Matter, and Mechanics of Cells and Tissues is very much part of it. And this is like just when I joined part of the LA. Just when I joined, part of the university was still being built. So we are very new and we are going to expand more in the future. So, this is an old experiment in this field, which shows from Stoppack and Harris, which shows that cells that are put on or cultured on top of a thin rubber sheet, they actually produce forces and wrinkle this rubber sheet. So, this was way back in 1980, but more recently, it has been shown by, for example, in this famous experiment. By, for example, in this famous experiment by Dennis Dishard and Adam Engler, that if you put a stem cell on substrates of varying stiffness, the elasticity or stiffness of the substrate determines the lineage specification of these stem cells. So in very soft substrates, it can become neuron-like. On very stiff substrates, it can become bone-like. And substrate stiffness has been found to be an important predictor of what a cell likes to do. So cells care about their mechanical environment. So, cells care about their mechanical environment. And another example here is the work of Asi Zemmel with Sam Safran and Dennis Tisher that shows that the stress fibers, which we heard about from Sasha, actually get polarized at some optimal substrate stiffness. So, very stiff or very soft, they're not as polarized. And this is something that's going to be important for me as well. So, the question that I'm asking here is going to be relevant for vasculogenesis. So, in the early stages of blood vessel formation, these are endothelial. Vessel formation, these are endothelial cells, they form these clusters which organize into networks that then finally become these blood vessels. So, the question I'm asking is: how do these cells that are initially dilute and far apart from each other, how do they find each other to form these clusters? And there are experiments, like I have chosen only two, but there are several others which show that there is a substrate stiffness dependence in how well these networks are able to form and self-organize. So, the top row is an older experiment by Califano and Cynthia Reinhardt-King, which shows that the cells kind of remain isolated on the softer side, like 2.1 kilopascal. But when you make the substrate stiffer, they are able to find each other and form networks. Whereas this more recent work from Rudiger et al. at LMU Munich, they find that the cells remain far apart on very stiff on stiffer substrate. This is 5 kilopascals. Substrate, this is five kilopascal, whereas they form nice networks on 0.5 kilopascal. So, this, of course, depends on what the substrate is coated with, like the density of collagen or fibonectin. But we are clearly showing you that there is a substrate stiffness dependence, which can suggest to us that mechanical forces or interactions are involved in these network formation. So, the two main questions I'm asking: how do these cells find each other from an initially dilute? Each other from an initially dilute culture, and then why or how does the network formation depend on the mechanical properties, specifically the stiffness of these substrates? And by way of introduction, I just want to say that this idea that cells can interact at long range with each other through the mechanics of the substrate is known or established in certain contexts. So this is a very beautiful experiment by both Tahir Saif's lab at UIUC and then also Shaleet Sleeve. And then also Shelley Sleeves' lab at the Technion, where they showed that two cardiomyocytes that are cultured far apart from each other can actually synchronize their beating mechanically. So, here is a very clear demonstration of that. So, this is a cardiac myocyte, which is quiescent, not beating. And then the experimenter can come and with a mechanical probe, just tap the mechanical substrate, and that wakes up the cell and it gets synchronized with the beating and starts beating at that frequency. So, there is no chemical signaling involved, and it's a very clear. Signaling involved, and it's a very clear and remarkable demonstration that cells are, in principle, able to communicate mechanically to, in this case, synchronize their beating. But there are other experiments, also like this old work by Reinhardt King, which shows that how two cells interact depends also on the stiffness of the substrates. So on softer substrates, 5.5 kilopascal, they will repeatedly approach each other, move away, and make these repeated contacts. Whereas on stiffer substrates, they will move away from each other. So it's a kind of Move away from each other, so it's a kind of effective repulsion. And of course, we have seen some images like this, which shows us that cells can actually pull on tethers in fibrous collagen matrices and interact at long range in that way. So this is the theoretical model that I'm going to use. And this has also been shown, I think, by Professor Bauhuaji, that you can think of a single polarized cell that is exerting traction on its underlying substrate as a force as exerting. Underlying substrate as a force as exerting a force dipole, so a pair of equal and opposite forces, that's the vector F, and separated by some distance A and by a vector A. And basically, these dipoles arise from these contractile elements in the actomyosin cytoskeleton that Sasha talked about. So, together, these mini dipoles that are in the cytoskeleton can polarize in this elongated cell and create like a macroscopic dipole at the level of the cell. At the level of the cell. So, then just to illustrate what the deformation pattern looks like in the underlying substrate, here I show you the strain field that is created by dipole 1. Forget dipole 2 for now. So let's think of a cell that's sitting here at the center of this image and then pulling along the x-axis. So here along the x-axis, it's going to create tension. That's in blue. The matrix is going to be stretched, whereas in the sides, it's going to be compressed. And this pattern, this orientation. And this pattern, this orientational dependence is depends on the Poisson's ratio, which is how compressible a medium is. So if it is incompressible, there are these extra regions that are needed to keep the substrate incompressible. So mu is 0.5 is incompressible, and as you go lower, it becomes more and more compressible. So in addition to, okay, so I already talked about, you can make analogies with electric dipoles that physics students typically like. This is a long-range strain field that decays. Long-range strain field that decays, like the electric field of a dipole. But the important point for us is that two dipoles sitting here and here can interact at long range. So, the minimal physical model that was proposed long ago by Schwartz and Safran, they both spoke in this conference, is that the dipole stress exerted by cell two can interact with the strain that is created by cell one at the position of cell two. And this gives a minimal physical interaction, which is like a dipole-dipole interaction. Which is like a dipole-dipole interaction. So it depends on the dipole moment squared. It goes as one over R cubed. And then the two mechanical parameters are the Young's modulus E and the Poisson's ratio nu. And there is some complicated dependence on the mutual orientation angles of these dipoles. So, I mean, the cells will therefore tend to acquire a configuration, but the elastic energy of the substrate is minimized. But you can think of this biophysically as a cell getting aligned. Physically, as a cell getting aligned by the strain in the substrate that is created by another cell. So if we accept this idea, we can then, this is where my student, Patrick Noir, who has recently completed his PhD and moved on to do a postdoc in UC San Diego, comes in. And he teamed up with Ajay Gopinathan's group in UC Merced to look at agent-based simulations of active matter. And he created this sort of agent-based simulation where each Sort of agent-based simulation where each cell or part of a cell can be thought of as a disk-like entity or agent, which is also a dipole. And so this bar in the middle represents the axis of the dipole. And then each cell interacts with its neighbors through the matrix within some sort of interaction radius. So the dynamics of each cell is given by its translational equation of motion. So that depends on this substrate-mediated elastic force. And then we just have a static force that just does. Have a steric force that just does not, that keeps the cells apart from each other and translational noise, whereas the orientation, the turning of the cell, is influenced by the torque that comes from this same elastic interaction, and there is also rotational noise. And note that since these the noise is not thermal in origin, these the rotational and translational diffusion can in principle be different. They're not coming from underlying thermal fluctuations, but to reduce parameters, we will just To reduce parameters, we will just think of them as having some common underlying source. They both represent the noisy dynamics of the cell. And so the main important parameter, non-dimensional parameter that jumps out of the model is this, A, what I'm going to call A, it's the balance of the elastic interaction strength with the random noise in the system. And for cell culture experiments, for typical experiments, these quantities can be estimated. So the dipole moment comes from traction force measurements, and these values are. Force measurements, and these values are shown for a typical substrate stiffness of one kilopascal. And the effective temperature, so to speak, that represents the noise in the system can also be estimated from, say, the effective diffusivity of a single cell that moves around and friction at its adhesions. Of course, there's a whole range in these values that depend on cell type and substrate stiffness, but I just show some characteristic values here. And so, this is the simulation that Patrick runs. Each of these is a dipole, which is fluctuating. This is a dipole, which is fluctuating, and then he does an annealing. So he's lowering the effective temperature, the noise in the system slowly. And then you can see this pattern slowly emerge. So, and he has also labeled the dipole direction in yellow. So if you think about it, this is not surprising. And there's like old work going back to Pinkers and Dijen that talks about how little dipoles will align to form chains and networks. There's work by Truce. And networks. There's work by Tusti and Safran, and later works in simulation that try to find the thermodynamic phases in these systems. So they have a prediction for how there's a phase separation between a liquid-like phase rich in junctions and a gas-like phase, which is rich in open ends. But I'm not going to talk about that here. I'm going to focus on the biological implications of these structures. So let's focus on this one first. The important parameters, again, are the effective elastic interaction that will depend on substrate stiffness and cell traction and the vertical axis. And the vertical axis is the cell density or the number of cells that I have. And this is for one of the Poisson's ratio values. The other value gives similar behavior, and we will talk about the differences between them later on. Essentially, the important point is that to get these networks, you need to be in the top right part of this phase diagram. So you need strong enough elastic interactions relative to noise, as well as you need large enough number of cells. So if you have strong interactions but less cells, they will form these sort of chains. These sort of chains that have open ends, whereas if the interaction strength is low, then they just remain gas-like, they don't self-assemble like this. Okay, so now one of the important metrics of network formation is the percolation order parameters. So this is commonly used in statistical physics. So, for example, can I have a path that spans the whole system size and goes through the network? If you have one, that gives you a certain If you have one, that gives you a certain percolation probability. So, Patrick measures the percolation probability by doing many simulations. And this is the packing fraction of the density of cells. And you see that when you have elastic dipolar interactions at either of these two Poisson ratio, there is like a sharp transition where you go from not percolating to percolating at a pretty low cell density. And just as a control, we did this control simulation where the cells and these agents are not dipoles, they're just sticky. These agents are not dipoles, they're just sticky disks. So they move around, and when they find another partner, they will just form adhesions. But doing it that way, in that random way, you need many more cells or agents to form these, to get to the percolating stage. So the message to the biologist, to the tissue engineer is that by having these dipolar interactions to the substrate, you are able to form these networks much more efficiently than just cells randomly finding each other and forming contacts. Next, we wanted to translate this into We wanted to translate this into as a function of the elastic modulus. So, for that, we use this phenomenological formula that people use in the field. That has we can talk about how, what is the justification for that, but it's basically based on the observation that cells, when the substrate is very soft, this E is small, then the cell doesn't pull much. It's kind of doing a displacement homeostasis. But when you increase the substrate stiffness, the cells increases its. Else increases its traction and then the traction saturates. So the dipole moment is therefore a function of the substrate stiffness. And once you do that, you get these peaks in percolation probability versus substrate stiffness. So the idea behind this is very simple. When the substrate is very stiff, then it doesn't deform. And so you don't have this mechanical interaction and the networks don't form. On the other hand, if the substrate is very soft, the cells don't pull hard enough. And similarly, you don't have these interactions. And similarly, you don't have these interactions. And then the width of this peak depends on the noise and the cell density. All right, so now we want to make a connection with our predictions and experiments. So we went to Kara McCloskey's lab at UC Merced, they're a vascular tissue engineering lab. And so what they could do for us, this is a very standard experiment nowadays. You can just put, they cultured HUVEX, human umbilical vein endothelial cells on top of these polyacyl. Cells on top of these polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffness. And these are the images from their experiment, and this is Patrick's analysis where he binarizes and skeletonizes these images to identify the percolation, to quantify it in terms of the percolation order parameter. So you can see very clearly here that when the substrate is very soft, the cells remain isolated. They don't form clusters. If it is very stiff, they start forming clusters, but these clusters are more compact, whereas Clusters are more compact, whereas like they form like they spread a lot and they can form direct contacts and they become more compact clusters. Whereas in this intermediate stiffness, they form these nicer networks. And you can also see this in the qualitatively in these binarized skeletons. But we also quantified it and we show you two examples at two different cell seeding densities. So this is a lower density and this is a higher density. Lower density, and this is a higher density. And you can see that with increasing substrate thickness, these data points do show a peak. And the lines here are predictions from simulations for these three different packing fractions. So the packing fraction, I'd like you to think of as the percent area covered by the cells. Now, in the model, that and the elastic interaction are separate parameters, but in the real world, they're not decaying. They are not decoupled because cells also spread more in very stiff substrates. And that's why we didn't go to higher stiffnesses than this, because then they form these more compact clusters. Whereas our model really applies to situations where you have dilute clusters or the cells, dilute cultures where the cells are interacting at longer range with each other. So we do show this optimum that is which was not shown in previous works. shown in previous works the previous works showed different works showed different stiffness dependencies and so this sort of kind of puts them on a unified footing and uh this is uh showing you a classification of the different structures that we observe so isolated like this and chains like here and networks like here so we quantified this in terms of the percolation order parameter and also the anisotropy or the elongated nature of the cluster Or the elongated nature of the cluster. So, combining these two measures, we created this composite order parameter. So, the background color is the prediction from the simulation. There are hundreds of simulation data points here that we interpolated to create this color scheme. And then we use the order parameter to classify it. So the larger value of the order parameter is the percolating networks. This region here is the open chains. And this region here on very low substrate stiffness and low density is the isolated. Is the isolated. And you can see that the experimental data points to a very good extent lie in their predicted regions. So the networks we found in experiment lie in the predicted network region and so on, except maybe these two data points. So these two data points are predicted to be isolated, but they in fact form chains. And then we think this is again because this is that sort of intermediate packing fraction where the cells can spread towards each other and have such short-range ecosystems. Have such short-range effects that were not included in our model. Okay, so this is the comparison that we did with the experiment, but then there is some interesting prediction that may be relevant for future experiments where we show you the difference between the important role that Poisson's ratio might play. So, a lot of these substrates, most of the experiments, have a Poisson ratio that is higher than 0.3 or close to 0.3. Than 0.3 or close to 0.5, so they're incompressible. But people are also beginning to create hydrogels that have lower Poisson's ratio to possibly explode this effect. So, to get a sense of why these structures look different, like why is new 0.5 so different from 0.1, we show you some simulations where we put these dipoles on a lattice. So, we don't let them move around, we just let them rotate. And we see that they have very different equilibrium ground states. So, here they will form these long chains. Will form these long chains, whereas here they will form these short four rings. So, this was already identified by Bishops and Schwartz and Staffran long ago, but we are sort of showing you the new thing that we did here is we let the cells move around and self-assemble into these networks. We also asked, yeah, so we see that there is also some difference in the branch lengths. So, because these line up kind of form these nematic strings, you Of form these nematic strings, you get like longer branches here, whereas these form more compact ring-like structures. And that's why the branch length is shorter. But here is another metric that we did, which is these ultimately these have to form blood vessel networks whose function is to transport, right? So we want to relate the structure to the transport property. So we looked at how robust these networks are. So we remove, we cut bonds from this network and see like what is the Network and see, like, what is the size of the largest cluster that remains? And we find that the new is equal to 0.5 case is actually way more robust than the new is equal to 0.1 case, and this is because of all these little rings. So, this may have some implications for biological transport functions. Now, I'd like to quickly switch gears and show this movie, which and talk about how this dipole model might also have implications for durotaxis. So, this was already shown by Rickard Allert. Already shown by Rickard Allert. This is an experiment where you see collective durotaxis from Javiya Xavier Trepar's lab. And this is the cartoon of their mechanism, which is kind of very simple to understand. So think of yourself as being the cell cluster and you're pulling on both sides, on the softer side and on the stiffer side. And then you're able to stretch the soft spring more and the stiff spring less. And so your center of mass sort of shifts towards the stiffer side. So I would call this a short-range mechanism. Call this a short-range mechanism because, for this to work, the cell cluster has to sort of straddle the soft side and the stiff side. So, on one side, it has to feel the stiff substrate, on the other side, it has to feel the soft substrate. So, this is, and then there is a more recent experiment on durotaxis, which shows that it also depends, the extent of durotaxis also depends on the adhesion. So, this is like weak adhesion versus strong adhesion. And you see that in weak adhesion, there is less durotaxa. Weak adhesion, there is less durotaxis. So, this is like a spatial probability distribution of the cells after 24 hours. So, there is some durotaxis, but the extent depends on properties like the ability of the cell to adhere. So, we think that we can sort of try to build a statistical model for durotaxis, which can give us these probability distributions, because it's not a deterministic process. And so, we go back to this old classic experiment that Ricardo Dallert also showed. This was one of the Dalat also showed. This was one of the first demonstrations of durotaxis, but for a single cell. So he showed you that when you are on the cell on the soft substrate, you will crawl over to the stiffer side. But there is another observation in the paper, which is very interesting, that is, if you're a cell that starts out on the stiffer side, you will basically realign or reorient with parallel to the interface, to the boundary, and you're going to remain on the stiffer side. So, that to us suggests that there is some Us suggests that there is some torque that is realigning the cell close to the interface, and also this is something that has not been checked in experiment. But we are raising this question, can a cell that is sitting far from this interface still sense it? So without having to sit on the soft and the stiff side simultaneously? So, and interestingly, there is some analogy between the durotaxis and viscotaxis. So, micro-swimmers like bacteria actually swim along viscotaxis. Actually, swim along viscosity gradients. And it has been shown that there are both long-range and short-range mechanisms involved there. So, for example, this work by Vasily Canceler's lab shows that an algae that is swimming can sense like a sharp interface in viscosity from far away and then reorient its swimming. So, there should be some analogies there. And here is the analogy from the theory side. So, this is Ulrich Schwartz's paper, where he shows that this is a dipolid and elastic medium, whereas this is a swimmer, a bacteria. Whereas this is a swimmer, a bacteria that is close to an interface. So, in bacteria, it is quite well established that these bacteria can undergo hydrodynamic interactions with their boundaries. Specifically, to preserve the boundary, to maintain the boundary conditions, you need image dipoles. And this was the same calculation that was done by Ulrich Schwartz. So, this was a purely static model, but they predicted that a clamped boundary, which is a boundary, you can think of the cell being on the soft side as tele. Being on the soft side, as feeling a clamped boundary because the substrate on the other side is very rigid, that cell or that dipole is going to be attracted by the boundary and is going to be aligned perpendicular to the boundary, like shown here. And for a free boundary, that is going to be the opposite. So this kind of explains what Lowe et al. showed long ago. But now that's where we come in and where my student Shuaya Bose comes in, and he does a very similar model that I showed you before, an agent-based simulation where the cells are. Simulation where the cells are disk-like agents that are able to move around and also reorient. But now, instead of interactions between cells, each cell is interacting with its boundary. So, this is more like a single-cell simulation. So, if I play this movie, although it looks like there are many cells, this is really a gas of cells. They're not interacting with each other. So, they're being attracted towards the boundary and they're also oriented perpendicular to the boundary. So, this is interesting from Boundary. So, this is interesting from an active matter point of view as well, like how active particles interact with their boundary. And in this case, when there is an elastic torque and attraction also present. Here, we confine the cells into this region. So, this can be realized in an experiment by micro-patterning the substrate so that the cells are not able to go over to the stiffer side. But, of course, we did simulations where we let the cells go from soft to stiff side, and you see some representative simulation trajectories. Representative simulation trajectories. So, the cells were initialized on this side, but most of them ended up on the stiffer side. It's all because of this elastic torque and attraction that was already predicted by Ulrich Schwartz and co-workers, but we are now doing these active particle simulations that will allow us to collect data and compare with experiments if someone is interested in doing them. And now, I quickly want to mention the contribution of Xin Pang and his student Hai Chin here, because we started thinking of these. Because we started thinking of these statistical physics of these agents that are moving in some elastic potential, but then they have a confining boundary, and then they can escape from this boundary because they have some random motion. So in some sense, the escape from the boundary is allowing the cell to become adurotactic. So although there is an elastic force that is trying to make them cross, they will of course have their own persistent random motion, which can allow them to escape this tactic potential. them to escape this tactic potential and this may have general implications for other kinds of taxes so this is uh very quickly my student shubaya's simulations where he's varying the elastic interaction strength and you can see that the escape time increases with that and these lines are they just come from a modified version of crammer's potential so you have e to the barrier height which is given by a in this and here in each dashed line we have done the calculation for a fixed angle whereas Calculation for a fixed angle, whereas in the real simulation, the cell is probably experiencing many different angles, but you can see that the data is well constrained by this. Also, this was just for without any self-propulsion. So the problem becomes more interesting from an active matter viewpoint when there is a self-propulsion. So there is work by Yarif Khafri and Julian Tailleur, which shows where they calculated the probability of escape of an active particle across a potential barrier. Active particle across a potential barrier. So there is in between these two points C1 and C2, the activity, the self-propulsion alone cannot make you cross the barrier. So you need help from the effective diffusivity of the noise to help you cross over. But after you cross this point C2, then the Peclet number or the self-propulsion can help you cross the barrier. So basically, there is a Peclet number which represents the self-propulsion of the cell or the agent, and that lowers the effective potential barrier. So this is Hai Chin's work. Hai Chin's work, where she took the simulation data from Shubayo and worked together with him and applied this theory to show that you can actually explain the simulation results for active particles very well with this theory. So this theory needed to be adapted for our potential and for the fact that the cells are able to change their orientation. But the important trends are clear: that there is an exponential dependence on the barrier height, but there is also a negative exponential dependent. Also, a negative exponential dependence on the Peclet number. So, as you increase the cell propulsion of the cell, they're able to escape this barrier more easily. So, with that, I don't know how I'm doing on time, but this is my last slide. So, I have shown you how the cells on linear elastic mediums behave as dipoles and how that can explain some of the biologically interesting self-organization behavior. But as we heard from Paul Janmi yesterday or the day before, Yesterday or the day before, biomaterials, including biopolymer networks, are non-linearly elastic. So they all strain stiffen, for example, when you apply shear strain. So we are also thinking about the non-linear elastic properties. And former postdoc Andrei Zakharov, who actually also worked with Len before Pisman before coming to us, showed in this very nice work. To my knowledge, the first demonstration with experiments in blood clots that tissue can actually strain. Tissue can actually strain soften under shear before it stiffens. So, there's an intermediate softening regime here that occurs because of fiber buckling. So, I'm happy to talk more about this with you if there is time later on. And I would like to conclude with this experiment, which is done again by Tahir Saif at UIUC. These are fibroblasts that you're seeing in a non-linear elastic gel. So, this is a collagen gel. And here, also, they form networks by spreading towards each other. Spreading towards each other. And one of the important things they saw is that as you this is, let's think of this as high cell density and low cell density, and this as how much the gel is able to contract or compact. And they find that up to there's a critical number or density of cells below which the cells don't form the network and they're not able to efficiently contract this gel. But as soon as you go over some critical density, they're really able to form these networks and contract the gel. So we believe there is some sort of percolation phenomena that is happening. Percolation phenomena that is happening here as well that we are trying to model. So, with that, I would like to conclude by acknowledging my collaborators and the two students who did a lot of work on these two directions, Patrick and Shubayo, and funding agencies. Take any questions. Thank you.
