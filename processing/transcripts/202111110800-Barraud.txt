Okay. Well, thank you, and thank you for the invitation. And well, I should start with an apologize. There will be no symplectic conformal stuff in this talk, just about symplectic geometry, real usual symplectic geometry, and Novikov theory. Okay, so first, let me start with the broad picture. It's always The broad picture, it's always interesting to have a way to relate the topology of a manifold and geometric or dynamics phenomena occurring in it. And what I have in mind, of course, is Morse theory and morphomology. You know that Morse theory relates morphology relates dynamics of the gradient flow of a Morse function to the To the homology of the manifold, for instance. And you also may know that the Fleur theory just mimics this and relates the dynamics of Hamiltonian isotopes to the homology of the ambient manifold, at least if the symplectic manifold is monotone, for instance. And okay. Okay, and it turns out that if you have one form, well, if you do more theory, you are studying the flow of a gradient, so an exact flow. And if you relax the exactness condition, you get a closed one form, and you can look at this flow. And globally, the dynamics can change a lot. And what you get is Novikov's, well, the algebraic environment that. Well, the algebraic invariant that is interesting in this case, at least for me, is the Novikov homology of the manifold with respect to this one form. And you have an algebraic invariant that depends only on the homology class of the one form and the choice of the covering. And you can relate it to the dynamics of this close of the flow of the gradient of this one form. And it turns out that. And it turns out that on the symplectic side for floor theory, it's also possible to relax this exactness condition. And if you start with a symplectic isotopy, you can run the FLOR IDs and set up a FLUR homology. And this is what Lei, Jon Van Lei, and Caro Orno did. I don't remember the year, but I don't remember the year, but sometimes ago. And you can indeed relate the Novikov homology of one form, which is the flux of the symplectic isotopy, to the dynamic of the isotopy. So in particular, to the fixed point of this isotopy and flow tubes associated to it. And what I'm interested in is, in fact, what happens when you change the algebraic environment on the left and you move from the Left, and you move from the homology to the fundamental group. And it's well known that the Morse theory allows you to describe the fundamental group of your manifold in terms of dynamics of the gradient flow. Yeah, in fact, the Morse theory gives you a full cell decomposition of the manifold. So you can describe essentially any algebraic invariant that is defined for, that is associated to a cell decomposition in terms of. Associated to cell decomposition in terms of the dynamics. And it turns out that it's also possible on the symplectic size in Fleur theory to describe the fundamental group, at least generators of the fundamental groups, of the fundamental group out of periodic closed orbits of the Hamiltonian isotopy and floor-theoretic objects. And so, the natural question is: what happens if you relax this exactness condition? Is exactness condition, then it turns out that it's possible to define, to twist the definition of the fundamental group by one form to obtain a Novikov fundamental group associated to a close to a degree one cohomology class. And it has the same properties, well, similar properties at the fundamental group. In particular, you can express it as in terms of the index one critical point of the one. Critical point of the one over one form that is Morse. And in terms of the flow, if you take a metric and you find you get you use the gradient of this one form, you can interpret the Mos Novikov fundamental group in terms of the dynamics of the flow of the one form. And the question I'm interested in today is about this question in the symplectic setting. In the symplectic setting. So if you have a symplectic isotopy, you have this flux invariant, which is a closed one form. So you have Novikov fundamental group associated to it. And you would like to relate this algebraic invariant, the Novikov fundamental group, to the dynamics of the symplectic isotopic. And it turns out it's possible at least when the flux is not too large. Not too large. So for small flux, it is possible. And this is what I would like to explain. And I would like to explain what this size means, this not too large condition. Okay, so I hope it's clear. The statement I want to explain is that, well, for each line, you have a theorem saying that for the algebraic invariant you have on the left, you can express it, you can recover. You can express it, you can recover it from the geometry of the dynamics on the right. And I want to say, explain why it also holds for the last line if the flux is not too large. Okay, and I will recall what the flux is and so on. Okay, questions? So, and the plan of the talks will follow these slides. I will recall what the morse, how you can see the How you can see the most fundamental group and the flow fundamental group and the most navigable fundamental group, and so on. So, let's start with the most fundamental group. So, this is well known, but of course, it's worth mentioning it because this is our guideline for all the talks. So, it's a good thing to start there. So, we have a closed manifold and most functionality. And a Morse function on it, and a metric such that the pair is Morse male, so it's a condition that the stable and unstable manifold are transverse. And to explain the fundamental group from the Morse theoretic point of view, you usually suppose that f the function has a single minimum, which is at the base point. This is the easiest situation because there, if you look at the index one critical point, they are unstable. The unstable manifold is exactly a loop because you have two trajectories going out of the index one critical point, and they go down to the minimum, to the single minimum. So you just have to choose an orientation, but these two arcs form a loop. And so each critical point, index one critical point, can be associated to a loop. And then these loops generate the fundamental group. I will not discuss the relations. I will not discuss the relations because the relations in the flur setting are much more complicated. And they are still a work in progress, unfortunately. So at least for the generators, the generators in the MOS setting are just the index one critical point. And the proof, the visual proof is just that if you start with any homotopy class, you pick some loop representing it and you perturb it so that it And you perturb it so that it only intersects the codimension one stable manifold. So it only intersects the stable manifolds of the index one critical points. So that when you push it down by the flow, well, almost everything goes down to the minimum except some point that gets caught by the index one critical point. And if you look at somewhat carefully at what it means to go to the limit, then you see that when you push down your initial loop. Your initial loop by the flow, what you get at the end is just a concatenation of loops associated to the instable manifold of the index one critical points. I hope this is okay. But in general, of course, you may not have a single minimum and the base point may not be at a minimum. So, in general, what I call a MOS step, the instable manifold of an NX1 critical point, is a path. Critical point is a path, oops, sorry, is a path from one minimum to another. So you have to concatenate such paths to form loops. And moreover, if the base point is not at a minimum, if you want to start and come back to the base point, you need this piece of flow line that goes from the base point to the minimum that is below it. For generic choice of the base point, this is what happens, right? This is what happens, right? Okay, so these two things: the instable manifold, the mat X1 critical points, and this piece of arc associated to the base point form paths in the manifold. And you can, what I call a MOS loop, is just a concatenation of such arcs that start and end at the base points. They form a set, you can make a group out of them, and of course. And of course, they evaluate in the manifold, you can evaluate the homotopy class in the manifold, and so well known fact that the evaluation map here is onto. You can generate the fundamental group with these special loops. I hope this is okay. So, now what about the fleur version of this? So, the setting is: you have a symplectic, a closed monotone symplectic manifold and a Hamiltonian, and an almost complex structure. And you suppose they are generic, so the almost complex structure, it's a bit technical, but you allow it to depend on parameter. But okay, I will not insist on that. And you suppose that they are generic, so that all the flow modulite spaces you are using are. Spaces you are using are cut out transversely and they have the expected dimension and so. And I can define the analog of a Morse step in the flow setting in this way. So I will explain later, but formally it's just something like that. So you have this model I space, which I note from y to the empty set. What is it? It's a set of Of configuration of solutions of the flow equation, just the usual flow equation, but you use this cutoff function key to kill the Hamiltonian term on half of the tube, on the positive end of the tube, let's say. Okay, so when such a solution of this equation has finite energy, it has to converge on both. So the source of these maps, U, are just. These maps are just infinite cylinders, right? And if has finite energy, then in minus infinity has to converge to a closed orbit of the Hamiltonian isotopy. And to plus infinity, so near minus infinity is just a usual Fleur tube. And near plus infinity, it becomes holomorphic. And near plus infinity, it has a limit, which is a point. Which is a point. And I write the empty set here to mean that I do not put any constraint on this point. It is free to be anywhere in the manifold. Okay. Okay, so it's a space of solution of these trajectories. And then in this moduli space, when the index, so there is an index for the closed orbits. And when the index of the closed orbit is one, this moduli space has dimension one and And I look what I call a step is just a component of this moduli space with boundary. Okay, so it's might be a bit brutal for definition, but there is a way to think of it where it's very similar to what we had in the Mohrs case. In the Mohs case, we were using the instable manifolds of the index one critical point. Of the index one critical points. And one way to think of the instable manifolds of critical points is to consider them not as a collection of points, but as collection of interrupted trajectories. So if you look at this point where my pointer is here, instead of thinking of it as a point in the manifold, you think of it as an arc of trajectory starting in Y and stopping there. Topping there. And it means that you are solving an ordinary differential equation, which is the equation of the gradient flow. But you just introduce a cutoff function to kill the gradients at some point. Well, when S crosses zero, for instance. And it means that you follow your trajectory and then you stop. You just don't move anymore. And this is an Don't move anymore, and this is an interrupted trajectory. And maybe you need to be somewhat accustomed to flur equations and so, but it's very similar. It plays the same role. Somehow, you can think of the floor configurations on the right as kind of interrupted floor tubes, but you have to use a holomorphic disk to interrupt the tube. I don't know if there are questions at this point. Yeah, maybe, but maybe. Point, yeah, maybe, but maybe I already asked this question several times, but just knowing the ends, so what you know where I'm pointing, but you don't see where I'm pointing. But just knowing the cylinder going through X and the disk, it's enough to know the component you're living in, right? Yes, yes, right. Because you have a blue, so yeah, you mean if on the on the picture on the right here, I have a broken trajectory. Right here, I have a broken trajectory. Yes, so just knowing this is the same as knowing the step, right? Yes, right, you're right. So I have a broken configuration and I have a gluing theorem that tells me that this is the end of a one-dimensional mobile space. And if I do the gluing, I have to end on another broken configuration. And this is my step. Yes. And so why? So the interesting part is that when you do fleur homo. When you do fleur homology, you just consider the tube here. And maybe if you put an augmentation on the fleur homology, you are considering also these capping of the X. But the difference, the boundary operator just counts the tubes themselves. And you know that at least up to two there is an even count of tubes. But here, the gluing and the one-dimensional modelite space tells you how they. You, how they come pairwise, and this is the difference. You've got an order on the configurations which you don't have in the boundary operator. Yes. Yeah. But you could just define like steps as being flow of tubes plus an augmentation rate. Ah, but you said that. They come by pairs and I need a pair. Come by pairs, and I need a pair. Okay, the unit is nowhere in the one-dimensional modelized space. Okay, this is well, this is an interesting uh remark because this is where the difference with the homology heights they come by pairs, okay. Yes, but so what is the picture on on the left? Uh, what is the corresponding you see? I'm confused why it's just oh, it's just because you know what is the second pair on Morse because all. There on morse because out of the critical point, you already have two things that leave that escape. Okay, yeah, there is only one component. In the most case, there is only one component. And the point is, the difference in the picture is that under X, for the most case, you should have an interrupted trajectory coming out of the X. But of course, it's a minimum. So this interrupted trajectory here is just X itself. You have the orientation is just the point here. The augmentation is just the point, yeah. Yes, okay, yes, I think Leia question. So, Jean-François, I for uh I read your paper, but I forgot why you use a clause monotone symplectic manifold. You cannot extend for general case you use a phenomenal group under the conditions that monotone, monotone is yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe, maybe you can. I mean, for the Hamiltonian isotopy, for this setting here, somehow the bubbles are two co-dimensional and we are only interested in one-dimensional modular spaces. So formally, you can. It's just that setting up floor theory in the non-motopone case is a hard story, and I don't need that at the moment. Okay, so okay. Okay, uh, so um, I just explained what a fleur step was, but in fact, it's a fleur step associated to a periodic orbit to a closed orbit of the Hamiltonian isotopy. And in the Morse case, we saw we also had steps associated to the base point. So there is one special step, which is this one. And unfortunately, you also have to consider steps, other steps associated to the base point. Associated to the base points, which are configuration like this one. So you have an index zero orbit which has an augmentation and a co-augmentation that goes through the base point. And when you do the gluing here, you've got a one-dimensional model space that has to break, that may just collapse to a constant sphere at the base point. It is the step in the middle, but it could also break to another configuration, similar configuration. Another configuration, similar configuration. And these are the steps we have to consider. But if you take these two, these three things somehow into configuration, then you can define, just like before, floor loops, which are concatenations of floor steps that start and end at the base point, meaning that you use this path in the middle to start and to come back. And these, okay, they are defined as moduli space. Okay, they are defined as moduli spaces, but of course, at each curve in this model I space, you have a point, a preferred point which is the value at the plus infinity end of the tube. So you obtain a path in the manifold. So you can evaluate a flow loop into a loop in the manifold and consider its homotopy class. And then the theorem is that the evaluation map is onto. Is on two okay, so it means that every homotopy class of loop in M can be realized as a sequence of steps. Okay, don't hesitate to interrupt if you have questions because now I move to the Novikov fundamental group. So, what is the what I what do I call the Novikov fundamental group? So I take the same situation. I have a closed manifold, and instead of a function, I have a one form, a closed one form, which I interpret as a function which whose value can change when I go around a loop in the manifold. So how does it go? I have my manifold, I have a closed one form, and yeah, I need an integration cover for this. An integration cover for this form. And of course, there may be typically two choices for this integration cover: either the fundamental, the universal cover, sorry, or the minimal integration cover for the one form. And each choice will produce a different invariant, a different fundamental group. But this is very similar to what happens with the Novikov homology. With the Novikov homology, where you can each choice of a cover of an integration cover gives you a different Novikov ring, and each ring gives you a different homology. So you have as many invariants as choices for the integration cover. Okay, so we have this. We have our one form and an integration cover for this one form. And what we can do is do is when you when we pick a level so on the on the cover on on the on this m tilde now the my one form is exact so i take a primitive function it becomes a fun the differential of a function f alpha and if i pick a level for this function i can collapse everything below this level to a point and i take the fundamental group of the space that remains Of the space that remains with base points, the point I did collapse here. Okay, and okay, for each level, I can do that. And as you can see, you see in the picture, if you move the level up, you have a morphism from the fundamental group associated to a lower level to the fundamental group associated to a higher level. Okay, and this means that these groups, this. And this means that these groups, these fundamental groups, form a system of groups, a projective system, and you can take the inverse limit, the projective limit of these groups. So it means that you're looking at paths that somehow comes from how deep you want. These limits produce a very complicated group, a huge group, somehow, but this is what. Group somehow, but this is what we called the Novikov fundamental group. Okay. This is with Agnes Keld, Roman Golovko, and Hung Van Li. And the theorem is that this group only depends on the cohomology class alpha and the choice of the covering, and it has the same Morse interpretation. The same Morse interpretation somehow. So if you take a metric that makes your, and you suppose that one form is Morse, and you take a metric such that the pair is Morse male, then the fundamental group is generated with, quote, because I will have to say something about that, by the instable manifolds of the index one critical points of the one form. In other words, we have a similar picture. In other words, we have a similar architecture. But of course, the generated here means kind of special because this Novikov fundamental group is absolutely not finitely generated, no way. It's a huge group because you first have the deck transformation. So each time you add a generator, you can act on this generator by deck transformations and you have to add it again. And you have to add it again. So you need to add each copy of your generator by the DEX transformations. And moreover, you have this completion. You take a limit, which means that you do not consider words with finite letters in the generators. You really need infinite words. But up to these deck transformations and the completion phenomenon, the The unstable manifold of the index one critical points are enough to generate the Novikov fundamental group. Oh, sorry, I spoke about the proof. Yeah, the main ingredients of the proof. So I will not discuss the proof here, but the main ingredients are the first one is always the same in Novikov's theory. It's that if you take two primitive of classical. Of two classes that are cohomologous. Well, you take two classes, classes in two one forms in the same cohomology class on the manifold M below, downstairs, and you lift them to the covering and you take two primitives. Then you know that the difference of the differentials is exact. So the difference of the functions is bounded. This is a key ingredient to everywhere. To everywhere in Novikov theory. And the other point is that the unstable manifold of the index one critical points do generate the fundamental group of the intermediate spaces we were looking at, the spaces where a sublevel was collapsed. And this comes just from the same thing as in usual Morse theory. You just push everything down by the flow and you see you get what you want. But this point is. But this one on the picture that you had before, the fundamental group, is it zero or is it big? Which in this one? Yes, because it looks like you can kill everything when you go. No, no, you cannot. You see, you see, if you take this red pass, take a I'm sorry, but I don't know how to draw on my PDF. Yeah, unfortunately. I can imagine I did not open it with the same with the good. Opon it with the same with a good application. So if you take an x1 critical point here and you flow down on one side and on the uh for the other direction you flow on the other side. You see what I mean? It's kind of a ladder and you go up on one side, you cross at one level and you go down on the other side. This will give you a pass in the limit. This will give you a non-trivial loop in the limit. At every level At every level, it is non-zero and it does exist. Ah, you mean it's not a loop, what you say, it's a path, right? Well, it's a loop from minus infinity. It's a loop when you when you collapse, yes, yeah, okay. Yeah, at each level, it's a loop, but it's not a loop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a path from minus infinity to plus infinity, to minus infinity. Okay, okay, and the elements look like this. So the generators look like this, they are just passed. Look like this. They are just passed from minus infinity to minus infinity. But in the limit, you can get very wide loops. For instance, the highest level you can reach is not bounded, for instance. It can be really huge. Okay. But and this generator you describe is not the same. No, it's not. Okay. So if I just do the No, it's not okay. So if I just do the ladder one step before, that's the action of the data formation of the loops. Okay. Okay. So here you see one easy way to see it in most Novico in this setting is to suppose, just like in the Morse case. In the Morse case, to see it very easily, you suppose that there is only one minimum. And the analog in Novikov's theory is that you suppose that there is no minimum. No minimum. If the one form is non-trivial, you can always manage to have no minimum. Then the index one critical points have unstable manifolds that just do what I said. You start flowing out of your critical point and then you never stop going down and you go down to minus infinity. And on the other side, it's the same. So each instable manifold is a pass from minus infinity to minus infinity and just goes through one index one critical point. One index one critical point, and these are the generators, yes, yes. And anything that is a loop at some point, it dies, right? Yeah, it does not, yeah, yeah, yeah. It has to reach deeper and deeper levels, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. But of course, if you have a loop, you can always pick a path from the base point to minus infinity, and this loop will survive. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's. Will survive. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, there are simple choices and so on. Can I ask? So, in this thing that you've constructed, so you have this action of this of the deck group here on this object. What is the correct algebraic structure that this has? Is it like it's a module over something? Or, you know, I guess what's the right algebraic structure that this has? Just to me, it's just an action of the deck transformation on the group. But maybe there is more, but if you have a loop, you can shift the if you have a loop, you can shift the loop. I don't know how. I don't know how yeah it's a morphism it's a morphism of group right yeah okay they each deck transformation is an automorphism of the group so it's a representation yeah of the deck in the automorphism of the group okay so this is the Novikov group fundamental group okay Okay, and there is a Huravitz morphism, and it has all essentially. Well, you have to be a bit careful about the Hurvitz morphism because you have this limit process you have to explain. But what, for instance, you want to take the abelianization of the group, but you could take it before or after the limits, and you have to take it before, if I remember correctly. You have to be careful, but up to that, you have every. Up to that, you have everything you want. Okay. And I have this. So now let's go to the Fler Novikov version of it. So the setting, we pick, we have our symplectic manifold, which is monotone, and we pick a symplectic isotopy. And we consider And we consider the vector for generating this symplectic isotopy. And you plug this vector in the symplectic form, and you get a collection, a family, a one-parameter family of closed one-forms. And when you integrate, you get a closed one form. And the cohomology class of this one form is the flux of the isotopes. Okay, and the theorem we are looking for, aiming for, aiming to. Aiming to, I don't remember. If the flux is small enough, then the components of the model I spaces of what play the role of the unstable manifolds of the index one closed orbits in the FLER setting do generate the Novikov phenomenal group. Okay, and yeah, even if you are not. Yeah, even if you are not interested in the fundamental group, but just in homologies. Well, maybe it showed later, but in Fleur homology, there is a morphism. When you want to compare Fleur homology to Morse homology, you have several strategies, but one of them is using the so-called PSS Tunikin Schwarz salamonomorphism, which does not exist in the Novikov setting. In this symplectic setting, it does not exist. It does not exist. But everything I'm saying, I will explain now could be used to say that such a PSS morphism can be defined as long as the flux is not too big. Okay, so the required ingredients for this construction, so they are the same as for theory, you need some genericity. You need some genericity to ensure that everything is scattered transversely. And this is okay because it's essentially the same as usual. You need what we used not so long ago from the question of Baptiste, you need a gluing construction to describe the boundary of the modelized spaces, and it's exactly the same as usual. But you need compactness, and here we are in trouble because, of course, because covering Of course, because the covering space is non-compact, the primitive Hamiltonian we are using are not bounded at all. So we have no energy bound. And we do not expect any energy bound because in the MOS setting, the model I spaces are not compact. We see that obviously the unstable manifolds can go to minus infinity. So there is no bound at all. And however, we want to. To we in the MOS setting, we have no compactness and still we can define something. It's because the depth, the value of this function f alpha, is proper on the model I space, which means that if your model I space is non-compact, if the energy explode, you expect that the model I space, the evaluation point of your curves should go to minus infinity. This is the behavior you want. Maybe it's You want. Maybe it's non-compact, but you want that above any level it should be compact. And unfortunately, there is no reason a priori because there is no convexity or anything like that in this setting. So there is no reason why the plus infinity point of a curve could not go up, for instance, even if the energy becomes very high. If the energy becomes very high, we know that some points of the curves have to go. That some points of the curves have to go down, but some may also go up and control a prairie. So, this is where we need to say something. Okay. So, we go to, we have our choice of covering. So, there, the one form, oh, here I cheat. We also use. Here, actually, we also use something from the work of Hong Van Lei and Caru Ono to make the one form constants, this one form minus omega xt dot. We can manage that the cohomology class is constant. I didn't mention that. Okay, it's a technical preparation, if you want. We can manage to have a constant cohomology class. Class. And we pick a Hamiltonian on the covering space, generating the isotopy. And there is a well-defined action on the covering, which is as usual. I'm never sure about the signs. So it takes both the average of the Hamiltonian along the trajectory and the symplectic area of a capping of the trajectory. And we look And we look at the flow equation. What plays the role of the gradient flow lines of the flow lines of the gradient of the action are the solution of this flow equation, which are tubes satisfying this. And I just made the cutoff function explicit here, just a function that is one for s less than zero and zero for s bigger than one. And the energy is just. And the energy is just the L2 norm of the derivative of u in with respect to s okay. This is the preparation. And it's well, in Fleur theory, it's well known that the energy is exactly the difference of action between the two ends of the tubes. But here we have no end at the bottom of the tube. We just have a holomorphic capping. If you do the computer. Holomorphic capping. If you do the computation, you see that it the energy is the difference between the action and the average value of h in the cutoff radian. Because this density here, q prime ds dt is a density, it has mass one, okay, because and so this is the average of h in this region. So you know that if the energy goes to plus infinity. If the energy goes to plus infinity, you know that this Reagan has to go deeper and deeper in the covering in average. But unfortunately, going down in average is not enough for us because we want to evaluate at a point that goes to minus infinity, and we need to chose a point. Even if we know that there are points, we have to find a coherent way of picking one all along the modelized space. So we need some pointwise control of this. Of this depth. In fact, we will have to evaluate that plus infinity. So, what we need to prove is that if the energy goes to plus infinity, then the depth of here it's an h, it should be an f alpha because h also depends on t okay, f the depth. Okay, f the depth of the point at the point at plus infinity on the tube goes to minus infinity. This is what we are trying to do. Is it okay? Okay, so the first lemma, so I will become more technical, more and more technical, I'm sorry. So the first lemma is that there is a loop which is, we know that the in average In average, the curve is very deep, but the first lemma is that there is a loop that is indeed deep. Namely, you can find an S in the S0 in the holomorphic part of the tube, where the whole loop associated to S0 at the level S0 is very deep, by which I mean that it's Deep by which I mean that it's deeper than the action of y minus half the energy plus some constant, maybe. Okay, this is the first lemma. And how does it go? So it's very sketchy, but what we can, what is pretty easy is to see that if we take the average depth of Of each loop on the cylinder as a function of s. Okay, for each s, I have a loop and I take the average of f of the Hamiltonian function on this loop. This function of s has to be very deep on a large animal. So, what does it mean? It's at least, I don't know, it goes down by maybe half the energy along a tube, a portion of the tube here. A tube, a portion of the tube here that has lengths, maybe I don't remember if it's half the energy or square root of the energy, but a long tube, a tube that is longer and longer if the energy goes to plus infinity. So we know that on a very large part here, the average of the Hamiltonian is low, is very low. But suppose now that the maximum that known of these loops is Of these loops has its maximum deep, it means that all the loops are stretched on the covering, which means that they all have a point where the derivative is huge. And if the derivative is huge, you can find a small circle, a collection of small disks around these points where the derivative is huge and manage to have them all disjoint. Disjoint and then by the Schwarz lemma, you know that each such disk has to contain some energy, quite a bit of energy. And then when you do the sum, well, you've got a constraint. You have a large many disks with large area, and this has to be the total area of these disks has to be less than the total area. And this gives you a constraint, and you see that. Your constraint, and you see that there has to be at least one loop that is deep. Okay, I'm sorry, maybe it's not very easy to understand this way, but I can explain more if you want. It's pretty technical. This is the most technical part. And now I can turn to the explanation of the not too big, where does it come from? So now we know that one. So now we know that at least one loop goes very deep. In the holomorphic part, it is very deep. And we just want to control that, the remaining part of the holomorphic disk here does not go up too high. And here is the following observation. If you suppose that it goes high by some height hm. It means that, yeah, I need to define a slice first. Okay, so just to make things easier, suppose that my one form is rational so that the I can suppose that oops and I take the minimal cover so that the dex transformation line is just Z and Just z and then you can take one period of the one form and consider two levels that are corresponding to just one period. Okay, they are just one period apart. And now my covering is just a collection of such slices, and each slice has a depth, a height, which A depth height, which is one period. So if my disk wants to go up by an height h, it has to cross to go through all these slices a certain number of times. And this number of times is about h, the height here, divided by the height of one slice, which is essentially the size of the flux, the norm of the flux. I can control it by the norm of the flux at least. By the norm of the flux, at least. Okay, so you have, if you want to go up by a certain amount, you have to cross a certain number of slices. And the smaller the flux, the high number of slices you have to cross. But now, if you have a holomorphic disk that crosses a slice, which means that it has boundary at the bottom and boundary at the top, it has to have a minimum. It has to have a minimal area. You cannot do that with arbitrarily small symplectic area. So it means that the energy of my curve is at least the number of slice times, well, the minimal area I need to cross one slide, one slice, sorry. And from there, you get that the height is a height you can by which you can go up. By which you can go up is essentially controlled by the ratio between the flux, the size of the flux, and the minimal area you need to cross a slice time the total energy. And if you do, put everything together, you obtain that the h the depth of the plus infinity point here is at most, well, the action of y. Of y minus a coefficients times the energy, and this coefficient is you have this one-half. Okay, it's just a technical thing, but you have to compare it with this ratio between the flux and the symplectic area. And this, if the flux is not too small with respect to this symplectic area, then this term is indeed positive. And the plus infinity point goes to minus. The plus infinity point goes to minus infinity in the manifold. So the consequence is that if the flux is small enough, as soon as you have a sequence of trajectories whose energy goes to plus infinity, then the point where you want to evaluate goes to minus infinity, and which means that the height is proper on my model I space. So if I consider everything above I consider everything above some level, so all the curves that evaluate above some level, this gives me compact moduli spaces. And this is all what we need. So from there, you can define the notion of loops above some level. And you can compare with the MOS loops, which require not exactly these configurations, but hybrid configurations like this. But it's also possible to control them, and you obtain that the flow loops do generate the Novikov fundamental group. Okay. And as a last comment, as I said, okay, these moduli spaces here can are exactly those. Well, if you take, no, not these. Well, from Mars to The same configuration, but here you put a closed orbit at the end, or in one direction, or in the other. If you continue these moduli spaces, we are using here by a FMOS flow line. These moduli spaces are exactly those you need to define the PSS morphism. And the fact that the death is proper on these moduli spaces here, exactly what you need to have well-defined. Need to have well-defined PSS morphisms. So it means that you, okay, instead of comparing when you want to compare Novikov homology, Novikov flow homology to Norse Noviko homology, you can do the PSS and it's well, you have a well-defined PSS if the flux is not too big. Yeah, I think I still have time, but I'm a bit short. I'm a bit short, but I don't know if you have questions at this point.
