All right, thank you all for coming this morning. See, it's dark in here, very calm. I'm trying not to wake you up too quickly. So, this is joint work with Millie Yakimov and Robert Lowitz on a paper that appeared this summer. If you have any questions, don't push it again. I pushed it. If you have any questions, just stop me and ask questions. I just hope to keep this down to her. Okay, so what is this about? Well, this is motivated by brains. Everybody likes breedings. Five ratings. Everybody likes ratings. I can get lots of different applications of them, but one of the main applications appears in statistical mechanics. So, if you're interested in studying exactly solvable models, this natural donor appears to quantum mean Baxter equation. Apparently, we're doing the whole first conference on this next year. And in order to find solutions to that equation, it goes hand in hand with finding solutions to rate equations. And these solutions are called MR matrices or L matrices. On our matrices, or all matrices. Now, what's cool is that there are nice categorical ways of capturing solutions to the Pointier-Baxter equation. We can use graded minoidal categories. If you wanted something a little bit more concrete, you can use representation categories of quasi-train-beroff-boucher-processor quantum groups. Now, if we wanted to kick this up a notch and delve into statistical mechanics with a boundary, what's naturally going to occur is the boundary quantum meaning factor. A boundary quantum meaning factor equation. This is also called the quantum reflection equation. And solutions to this equation involve write equations and also some additional equations. But the solutions are captured by what's called K matrices. And what's nice is that there's also a category of solving these equations using braided module categories. So I will go through what this is. But if you wanted something a little bit more But if you wanted something a little bit more hockey, then you might want to be interested in studying reps of co-module algebras, and there's a way of talking about what these are quasi-triangular. So I will define all of that. Okay, so we all like braidings. Now, what is our favorite example of a braided limodal category? Is it? Vector sets. Vector. Vector set. No! No! Vector spaces. Super vector spaces. Super vector spaces. No. What appears the most in tops? Like all of them? Vectors! Centers! Centers! Centers! Centers! Yeah, we like centers! Why? You could take anyone loyal category and build something that's greater. You didn't read my mind. Okay. In any case, we wanted again to delve into something a bit more hostile. To delve into something a bit more hoppy, we can take a penodal category of a modulus over a Hof algebra, and we could build something greater, namely by taking the center or taking reps of a nice quasi-triangular Hof algebra that you've built up. So, of course, motivated by this stuff in yellow here, one natural question is: is there a way to cook up a braided module categorical? Does that make grammatical sense? Cook up a braided module categorical? Cook up a braided module categorical analog of these two gadgets here: your dream fill center and your dream fill tuple. So that's the goal of the talk. All right, so let's get into braiding since we all like them. We have a monodal category. I'm going to denote it with a D. It's braided. You have a natural isomorphism given by C. I draw my diagrams going downwards. And you want this to be compatible with the optimal. And you want this to be compatible with the operations that you have available. So if you have a tensor product, if you stick with tensor product in the first slot, you have to give some rules to it, and here's the rule. If you have a tensor product of objects in the second slot, well, here's your rule. So I think we all know what a braided monoidal category is. And of course, this gives solutions to the braid equation. Now, for our favorite example of a braided minodal category, how exactly do we build it? Well, Build it. Well, the objects are objects in our category C, but we pair it what's called a half gradient. So this is a natural transformation that's natural in X. Natural, I'm going to take it natural to be in the first slot here, where if you take a tensor product of two objects in the first slot, you have the compatibility conditions given by this picture here. So your objects are basically pairs of an object in the C and a natural transformation. Your morphisms, you see. Your morphisms, they send one pair to another, and basically you have morphisms in C that are compatible with the half grading. And if you wanted to make this monoidal, what we do is we use the second equation here. So if we have two pairs, we tensor them together. The half grading here is just defined by this rule. Braiding is given by, well, if I have two of these pairs and I tensor them together, I get this pair, and I can flop across a tensor product and get this pair, and the morphism is just given. And the morphism is just given by, again, the half-braining. So, this is a really, really clean construction that we're going to generalize. I'm not just going through this to teach a class. There's a method to the madness. All right. So, everybody also likes representations. Module categories I think will appear in almost every talk here. If you have a minor category, a way to represent it is by using a module category, which is a category that's paired with a certain Paired with a certain action pointer. That's compatible with the operations that we have available. So when we put these two notions together, you take a linoidal category, you can cook up something that is canonically braided, or you can take your linoidal category and cook up a representation of it. One actual question is, can we complete the diagram? Can we complete the diagram? Is there a way of taking a module category and making it Category and making it graded in some canonical way so that it's a natural representation of, let's say, the Druidville Center. Alright, so that's what we're up to. Any questions so far? Okay. Okay, so what exactly is a braided module category? What exactly is it? So first of all, we have to start off with a braided category and call it D, and we could take A. And we could take any module category of it. And what a braiding is, is an extra natural transformation that basically instead of swapping across a tensor product, we stay the same here. Now I'm going to denote this braiding with this picture here, again, going downward. Where here I'm really making the M line thick to denote a pole so that this behaves well with the braiding of D. So the axioms are: if I have our The axioms are: if I have your tensor product and see the first slot, I wrap around the pole two times, I under braid, wrap, over braid, wrap. It's basically like taking this string here and scooping it over. Secondly, it needs to be compatible with the action in the second slot. So if I wrap around these two lines here, I basically just drag this line over. Alright, so these diagrams might be familiar if you. These diagrams might be familiar if you do some rep theory with, let's say, brain groups of type B. Oftentimes, you do your brain diagrammatics with holes. Okay, so that's what we're interested in cooking up. So here's the first result, the main result of the paper. We're going to take a module category over an arbitrary braided manure category and cook up something that's canonically braided. So it's going to behave just well, the construction. So it's going to behave just well, the construction is pretty similar to a Drinkfeld center. And we call this a relative center because it's motivated by taking or by finding solutions to the quantum reflection equation. So what do we do? The objects are going to be objects of our arbitrary monodal category, and we're going to compare it with a, it's almost like a half braiding, we call it a reflection, where basically whenever you have X and Y in your first slot, it's going to satisfy. And y in your first slot, it's going to satisfy this rule here. Your morphisms between these two pairs, again, it's pretty similar to the Dreamfeld Center setting, where your morphisms are morphisms in N that are compatible with your reflections. And then we also want this to be a braided module category. So I have to give an action, I have to give a braiding. Well, the action is given by just acting on him, as you would expect, and your reflection. And your reflection is defined by this rule here. So everything is just keen. And your brain is given by the brain that you would expect. So that's the first name result. Any questions? So what's cool about this braided monodal category is that it has really, really nice features. So if you take D to B, a braided tensor category, you know when it's exact. It happens. That happens to be when you choose that M is exact and finite, you get that this category is abelian. You also know that when M is exact finite and D is finite, you get that your module category is finite as well. And you happen to have that this module category is semi-simple when these features are reflected by D and M. So it's just everything is really unique. Now, the way that we got this result was that you can actually realize this module category as sort of a center. Category as sort of a center of a bimodal category due to grenom. And with this result, we actually get that the relative center is a representation of the train false center here. So it's written in a vertical center, and you are saying a relative center. What is writing? I think you are saying all the time a relative center, and what is written here is a vertical center. I'm just wondering what is. Reflective, reflective, reflective. I've got this habit of doing this. What I write is correct. What I say might not be correct. Reflective. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Apparently I did not have enough coffee. Relative sensors. Oh, no, because I really picked on relative sensors. That's why. Different, sorry, that's a different paper. Reflective sensor. I have to get used to saying that now. Okay, so we have this cool construction where we take an arbitrary monodal category. monodal category and we build a graded monodal sorry take an arbitrary module category and build a braided module category so again our our goal is to have a diagram like this we start off with a manoeuvre category we canonically build something graded or take a representation and we want to complete the diagram can this be rephrased as some kind of you know induced representation procedure reduced representation procedure induced representation procedure Yeah. So that doesn't just work for the center, but for some other braided category into which? Oh, yeah, no, that's exactly what I'm going to explain. It works for any braided monodo category. So this construction, if you take your braided monodal category to be the center, we get a natural representation of the center with this construction. Or on the other hand, if you take D to be an arbitrary braided monodal category, Rated minor category, you cook up, I'm sorry, and we take D to be an arbitrary rated monoidal category, and take M to be an arbitrary module category, we can cook up a natural rated representation of D. Okay, so everything tends to work out. Am I going too fast? No. Yes. If every pull C with left notification, what will be this E of them? Z of C. Okay. Yep. Thank you. Any other questions? Voice from Robo. All right. Okay, let's go to the hop case. Okay, let's go to the Hof case. So the call that if you have H or Hof algebra and you want to take the Dreenfeldt center of HMOG, we get that it's really represented by a nice quasi-triangular Hof algebra in the Dreenfeldt double. But a way to actually get this braided tensor or braided monodal equivalence, I think the best way is to go through the category of yet a Drunfeldt model because it's a nice sort of middle ground here. So just to remind you what it is. So, just to remind you what it is, you take Hochbelter for a Yetter-Druffbelt module is basically a triple where you have that M and dot is a module, M and delta is a co-module, plus some compatibility conditions here. So what this gives you is that you can sort of use the H module structure here to get a copy of H here. You can use the co-module structure here to get a copy of H start. Get a copy of H star with an op. And the compatibility conditions between your module and co-module structure, really, this corresponds to the relations of your dreamfeld double. They're complicated because these relations are complicated. And this Hof algebra ends up being quasi-triangular. So we want to mimic this for the relative. Reflective, oh my god, reflective center. Reflective center. Reflective center. All right. Okay, so this is what we're after. So again, I just want to recall what happens in a Hoff case. We want to stick in a reflective center on this left side and get something that's quasi-triangular over here that represents that module category, that braided module category. So something that represents a braided module category is a quasi-triangular Hof algebra. Categories of quasi-triangular Hof algebra. And a way to get one is to start off with a Hof algebra that comes up with an R matrix. So that's going to be some element and two copies of your Hof algebra satisfying these three rules here. And this element gives us a brain with this correspondence. So it's going to be a similar game that's played in the module category setting. Okay, so this is what we want to do. We want to take a reflective We want to do. We want to take a reflective center over some braided module category with respect to some module category and cook up some nice quasi-triangular algebra, whatever that means, that represents this category. But I don't want to take any arbitrary module category, and that's too hard. Let's stick with something that's pretty hoppy. I mean, this was mentioned in Parshitz's talk. Let's take a co-module algebra over M. I mean, this is actually. M. I mean, this is actually, I think if M is exact, all the module categories basically look like this anyway. So if we take a left co-module algebra, it has this collection, you can get that the category of modules over A is a representation of this Brady category, which is given here. So this is going to be the N that we're at. I'll just stick this in here. Now the game is, I want Now, the game is, I want some quasi-triangular gadget to make all of this business work. All right, so what exactly do we mean by a co-module algebra being quasi-triangular? This is actually a new notion. I forgot to mention that braided module categories were introduced by Brochet in 2013, so it's a decade old. This is even newer. This is just a few years old, introduced by Stephanie. Introduced by Stefan Coat. So if we take a left co-module algebra, we call it quasi-triangular. It has something like an R matrix, except it's called K matrix. So we're going to have some invertible element, K, and L tends to B, satisfying three rules that come from the quantum reflection equation. So with this type of element, we can get a braiding. We can get a braiding. Braiding, we can get a braiding on a module category. So just like R gives us a braiding of a monoidal category, these elements K give us a braiding on a module category. Whatever we're after, we're going to stick in a quasi-triangular called module algebra here. Okay, though, so here's the second main theorem. If we start off with something that's quasi-triangular at Hoff, finite dimensional to make everything nice. To make everything nice and globalizable and all that. And we take a left co-module algebra. We can form this reflective center. It's a gradient module category over L mod. And it's going to be actually represented by a quasi-triangular homologu algebra, which we call the, not the relative algebra, the reflective algebra, reflective algebra. And the way that we build this, or the way that we get this equivalence, is by going through. Is by going through a category that kind of behaves like Yoder-Drinkfeld algebras. It's a triple where you have some modules and co-modules with some compatibility conditions. This is called the category of Hofway modules. Let me go through the details. So you notice, instead of just taking my L, I put an L hat. What we need to do is actually adjust L a bit. It's a module coalgebra. It's a module co-algebra over L. It's equal to L as a vector space, but it's sort of twisted in a way. This is related to Shami-G's transmuted Hof algebras or covariantized Hof algebras. It's just the Hof algebra that happens to work or the co-algebra that happens to work. So that's what L hat is. A Hof-Doy module. Again, it's a triple where if we start off with a If we start off with a co-module algebra, A, and a module co-algebra, L hat, what a Hof-Boy module is, is a module over A, co-module over L hat with some compatibility conditions here. So then we use this to actually build what our reflective algebra is by again using A to get a copy of A, this L hat to get a copy of the dual of L hat, and this cross product algebra is what actually represents. Product algebra is what actually represents this category. And it's quasi-triangular. And it's quasi-triangular. Any questions? Yes. Somehow related to taking gender-driven models over another random category, for example, over another gender-driven model? It could be. It would be like so. Yeah, because it seems like you're nesting too close to our house. So we are sort of. So, we are sort of modify Yedder-Dreamfield modules over VEC. Here, we're going in this direction. But you can go with taking Yedder-Dreamfill modules over some other category. So I guess we could kick this up a notch and complete the diagram in a way, sort of going in an off-boggling direction. Any other questions? Okay, so we achieved another goal where if we start off with Another goal where if we start off with an arbitrary quasi-triangular Hof algebra, we have a canonical quasi-triangular construction, which we look up double. Or we can take a, I guess, a cold representation of it, and we can complete this diagram by now hooking up a, from an arbitrary co-module algebra to a, or building a quasi-triangular co-module algebra, which we call the reflective center. So this is a quasi-triangular co-module algebra over. Quasi-triangular co-module algebra over L, and it's also co-module algebra over the Drunkfeldt double. All right, so what's really cool, I mean, talking about special cases, if we take this A to B K here, we just get this copy of this L hat star, just this in play. But this, when you take A to B just the ground field, you actually get something really interesting. Interesting. So again, I just get this type of algebra here. What you can do is this is a cold module algebra over L, and it's quasi-triangular. You can form the whole category of these structures. And this particular algebra is an initial object in this category. So it's sort of like a universal quasi-triangular envelope, if you will, in this category. Just like the Dreamfold Double is for. Double is for quasi-triangular Hof algebras. I want to keep this short because I know it's a half an hour, but that is all I want to say. Thank you very much for listening. Okay, thank you. Do you have any questions or comments? Can you use this to actually write down some new solutions of the landfills equation? Yes. I didn't do it. Yeah, I mean everything in the paper is very, very explicit. Yeah. There's a lot swept under the rug. I try to make things look easy, but it was actually very hard to do. I have a question. Kelsey, may I ask a question? Absolutely. Yes, so the drifted center of C is Marita equivalent to C tensor with C cooperate. Yes. By taking factors. Uh by taking functors from C. Uh so this uh category that we discussed, which is a Z of C model, corresponds to some C by model. Yes. What is that C by model? Can you say that M tensor M dual or M tensor C or what is it? Could you repeat your question? So you're saying that so Z of C is root equivalent to Z of C dual of C? No, Z of C is equivalent to C cross C O, is it? Yes. C opposite. Yes. So that means that there should be a bijection between bi modules over Z or C and bin modules over C. Yes. So I'm asking what corresponds for your category under this bijection. That's what I'm looking at now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know the answers of that just yet. Yeah, so the next thing I'm going to do is. I have some guesses, like could be M tensor M2, for example, or it could be M tensor C, or but more likely M tensor M2, I don't know. I don't know. The thing that kind of trips me up, though, about that is so I guess, so you're comparing Z of C with C, I guess, bar tensor C, but there's two copies of C. With this construction, we don't have two copies of A. We have a copy of A and a copy of L. So we kind of have a copy of C and a copy of M in the construction. Of M in the category. I don't know if it's exactly M tensor M on the nose, maybe tensoring over C. I have no idea. I have no idea. I think this would be important to answer this because then it connects to things that we know well already. Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, that's, I mean, that's something I'm currently thinking about, but I got stuck precisely at that point. What place are we going to do? Precisely at that point. What plays a role of C box times CR? Yeah. How about the exactness of these exactly? No, that was a question we actually had in our paper and then I took it out because I got stuck. That's all I know so far. Now the exactness is open. So in the Hof algebra case, you So in the Hof algebra case you exactly the characterization of exactness for co-modular algebras. So that case that case, do you know maybe it's easier to look at that case? Oh you mean like oh the Hof case when is this whole modulo algebra exact? Right in that case there's a criteria of exactness. Oh that's yeah that's something that I didn't do yet. Something that I didn't do yet. Which is a natural question after flying it and semi-simple. One very nice kind of commodial algebra are those of Kala objects that correspond to fiber pointers. Do you know what you get in using this construction for this particular kind? Because you should have some categorical center. Have some categorical interpretation, perhaps. Yeah, I don't know. Everything that happens for Drinkfelt Center should happen for this as well. I have no idea. I have no idea. Yeah. If you take like your half-algebra is just a group algebra, and your commodity algebra is maybe, I don't know, an incos algebra of divergence or something. Do you get a quantum group with this, or similar, or like some? Like some modified version of the quantum rule? I mean, I again, something that we just did this in July is lots of interesting questions. That's something I was actually thinking about giving a student just less time to compute. Or you, you're not a student. Do you want? Seriously, if you want to work on this, I need help. But yeah, it's something concrete. Something concrete would be nice to know. Yeah, just taking like L to be a group of algebra, A to be a group algebra, see what happens. Yeah, that's harder than a stupid one. What are we talking about? Yeah. Do you have any more questions about that?
