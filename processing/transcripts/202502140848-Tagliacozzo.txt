And then take marginals if you want to think about the reduced density matrix if we start from a pure state and this reduced density matrix is mixed, its level of mixture can be measured through several entropies, for example, the Renee entropies. And then we say that that state of A was entangled with B. Okay, the state of A is entangled with B. And the result is that when we trace out part of the system in B, Trace out part of the system in B, we get some mixture coming from the fact that the original was correlation. But the important thing is that before tracing out B, we need to have a kind of joint state for A and B. And so in a nutshell, entanglement measures the correlation among different constituents at the same time. How do we, before going to this temporal version, how do we actually construct such joint state in Construct such joint state in quantum field theory in a many body system. Well, the idea is that typically we are interested in equilibrium states, and the equilibrium states are somehow described once we know what is the Hamiltonian that describes the system. So, imagine that you have an Hamiltonian, the sum of local terms. Here, local could be two-body, three-body, but as soon as far as they have a finite support is fine. So, imagine that you have such a situation. A situation, then you expect that at equilibrium your system will be, if this amount of generic at equilibrium, your system will be in this thermal state. And the object we are interested in is actually this exponential of beta H. That again, it's an extremely large operator, if you want, since H acts on the full Hilbert space, in principle, is an extremely large operator. But given the fact that the Hamiltonian is local and a certain approximation, for example, Under certain approximation, for example, we can split these large operators into n power of kind of smaller operators in the sense that they perform evolution for very small delta beta, where beta is Euclidean time. So you divide your total Euclidean time in n steps. And then this operator here is almost the identity, is very close to the identity. Very close to the identity. If you want, it's identity plus delta beta h plus delta beta square h square and so on. And then this implies that it's exactly one of these cases in which, despite it being a very non-local operator, there's this sparse structure. So it can be represented as a matrix product operator. And so an infinitesimal time step of this Euclidean time can be encoded like that. And as a result, if you want. And as a result, if you want, your temporal, so your thermal state can be described by the contraction of a space-time dimensional. So space here is horizontal and Euclidean time is vertical. You see, you have n-step, as we had before, space-time tensor network. Okay, and so you see this space-time tensor network, if you want, encodes the Encodes this thermal state. And now you see you have both bra and ket degrees of freedom. So it's a density matrix. And now you can actually take partial trace, as we said before. So we have the full state. And now, if you're interested in just a region, let's say A, that is in this case represented by this three-central spin, then we can obviously take partial trace on the complement of A. Partial trace on the complement of A, and this gives us somehow a cylinder of tensors with a cut. Okay, and that's actually the same thing that you have in field theories. Now, if you go from the lattice to the continuum by taking some kind of continuum limit, both in space and time, then rather than having a discrete tensor network, you have a path integral on a surface, a space-time surface. So, this would be, again, space run horizontally and Euclidean time run. Horizontally and Euclidean time along this circumference. And our thermal state would be such a cylinder whose configuration depends on the state of the field on these two boundaries. And then taking a partial trace means gluing this cylinder onto the complement of A, in this case B, that is represented like that. So we have a cylinder with a slit, and this would be the density matrix that we use to study entanglement of the region A. Study entanglement of the region A. Any question up to this point? So, this should be just a summary to fix the notation. Okay, so I keep going. And so now we get to, so up to now we talk about traditional notions of entanglement. If you want, now we go to what is temporal entanglement. Well, basically, the idea should be similar. So, the idea is: can we measure correlation? So, the idea: can we measure correlation rather than at the same time among different constituents? Can we measure correlation among the same constituents at different times? Is there an equivalent to entanglement that is somehow a blind measure of correlation between the system? And the relevance of that comes from several fields. So, for example, from the field in which I work most, the computational approaches. This question about the scaling of temporal entanglement has some consequences on numerical methods. And I will, so we have a paper on that, but I will try maybe to mention something slightly later. There are reasons from all of graphic field theory in the sense that this temporal entanglement should play a similar role to what entanglement plays in LDS CFT, but in this case, in But in this case, here some geometric properties of the bulk of your holographic theory. And then there are foundational questions about this joint state at different times. It's called states over time. That has to do with the specific role of time in quantum mechanics. Specific role of time in quantum mechanics, and there are several reviews on that. And so, there are several perspectives on this object. I will give you a kind of a computational perspective. So, the idea, I'm not sure, you see the things or do you see it covered by the Zoom? You see it? Okay. So, here the idea is that we can repeat the construction. The idea is that we can repeat the construction that we had before, but we now go out of equilibrium. So we take some initial state rho zero and apply an evolution operator exponential of i, the Hamiltonian, for which rho zero is not an eigenstate. And we have all our state in time. Okay, so we have rho of t is now u dagger t rho u of t. And now this is real time. And obviously, if we want to, so this would be on the field theoretical. This would be on the field theoretical path integral. If you want to compute local observable at time t, then you have to take the trace of rho of t times the observable. And here, the observable, I draw it like this small bulb here. And again, this is a cylinder in which you have the initial state, the evolution forward in time, and if you want, the evolution backward in time on the back of this cylinder. But again, you have a similar cylinder. And you can either take this picture or you can take the tensor network picture. Can take the tensor network picture that it's equivalent, okay? Um, and now the idea is that, uh, similar to what you can do in space, you can now cut this path integral along an arbitrary, actually, a line, right? In particular, this line can be a temporal line, and you can even divide the path integral in two different boundary path integrals. Now, if you want, we have degrees of freedom on these temporal cuts here on both L and R. Here on both L and R. And we can interpret the expectation value of our operator as the overlap of two states. But now these two states live in time. Okay, so the Hilbert space is the tensor product of the Hilbert space of a single constituent over different time. And you have one state on the left and one state on the right. In the path integral literature, these are called influence functional, but it doesn't really matter. So it's a kind of, we can interpret them as. It's a kind of we can interpret them as a time-like vector, and then in the same way in which we can make partial contraction, if you remember our thermal state, we can decide to make partial overlaps of these two states, so left and R. We can make these partial overlaps that we call them reduced transition matrices, right? Because there will be a transition matrix from R to L and then you can just make some partial overlap and all. Just make some partial overlap and normalize them by the full overlap, and this gives you some reduced transition matrix. Okay, and this reduced transition matrix more or less plays the same role for temporal correlation that the reduced CT matrix play for spatial correlation. So now, if you would insert some operator as some arbitrary time here, you could just compute the expectation value of the correlator of that operator with the one that we put at time t. The one that we put at time t by taking the trace of that operator with this reduced transition matrix. Again, how these objects are defined depends on the path integral that you are computing. For example, here, I was computing the path integral for the expectation value of a local operator, but I could compute the path integral that would give me the four factor of the evolution operator, so the trace of u, for example, and open a cut somewhere. And that's still could be interpreted as the. Could be interpreted as the partial overlap of two temporal states. And so we can still interpret this object as a reduced transition matrix. The important point is that this reduced transition matrix is actually not a density matrix, it's not a state, because in general it's not positive definite, it is not even a remission. Okay, so it's an operator, if you want, that is not an hermit operator. And so the question is, what is this object? question is what is this object and what are its properties um nevertheless we can still compute what we call generalized entropies so with the same formula they would compute entropies for a positive definite state semi-positive definite state right in which you in which you would diagonalize it and compute moments trace of rho squared and things like that we could for example compute the generalized so the trace of these of these The trace of these reduced transition matrix square. And this would imply computing again a path integral on a replicated Riemann surface, right? You would have two of these cylinders and along what was the cut before, they would be glued in the standard way that you glue reduced density matrices, right, for computing Rainy entropies or sales entropies. And so you would go from one sheet to the other. From one sheet to the other along the cut. And this is a perfectly well-defined object, even though maybe this reduced transitional matrix cannot be diagonalized because it's a strange operator. This object, in principle, you can compute them for any arbitrary integer n. And again, if you want to compute the entanglement entropy, then you can just make the analytic continuation n going to one. Okay, so let's see. Let's see. Um, so this is the setting, and now let's see what we can say about this object, these generalized entropies that are computed through these generalized reduced transition matrix from the point of view of field theories. Okay, and the idea is to use the machinery of conformal field theory to give prediction on this entropy scale, for example, with the sides of this piece that we don't contract, this block in time. Okay, here, the path integral we start from is that of a Losh Mi-Teko. So we have. That of a Losh-Miteko. So we have the volution operator exponential of i minus h t, and we take his matrix element between the initial state. In our case, these are product state, but it doesn't necessarily need to be. So it's just the matrix element of the evolution operator. And then obviously, one can interpret this like a complex value partition function and define the equivalent of a free energy that should be intensive by taking the log and dividing by time and spatial extent. Time and spatial extent. And here, since we want to apply the machinery of conformal field theory, this H here will be critical. So it will be a critical Hamiltonian of a spin model, either Ising or POTS, for example, in the numerics that I will show. And so again, now the setting is this one, in which again, we have our evolution operator for an infinitesimal time step, delta t, then we pile it up several time steps until we get to large t. Time step until we get to large t. And then we have this initial state on the top and on the bottom. And in principle, we can directly go to the thermodynamic limit because this tensor contraction in that case becomes an eigenvector equation. So basically, you identify your transfer matrix that is a transfer matrix that transfers the state of the column into the next one. Of a column into the next one, so it's a column to column transfer matrix, and then this object again is non-remission in general, so here we'll have different left and right eigenvectors, but if it has a spectral composition with a gap, if you multiply it enough times, you would get the leading eigenvectors. And what we are assuming here is that these leading eigenvectors can be represented as this matrix product state. And so if you assume that, you can kind of write You can kind of write an algorithm that tries to find this leading element vector as a matrix product state. And then you can just compute this reduced transition matrix as partial overlap of this left-right matrix prostate in the same way you compute again partial overlap between two states. Okay, so the strategy would be: we can construct these transformatics from the From the evolution operator, and then we try to find the leading left and right eigenvectors and characterize their partial overlaps. This would be the strategy. Okay, so from the point of view of a conformal field theory, it is a very simple exercise, given the results that are already in the literature. So, basically, what we are dealing with is this path integral on a strip. So, as always, in order to make contact with the lattice, if you have some. With the lattice, if you have some initial state, some finite correlation lens, you will start from a boundary state in the conformal field theory, evolve it with some Euclidean time beta zero, and then take the evolution operator and sandwich with the same thing. So this would be the geometry you have to study your CFT on, and your reduced transition matrix would be this geometry with a cut, with a vertical cut. With a vertical cut, okay, and again, the extent of this cut is t, whether the extent of the full evolution, if you want, is large t plus two beta zero, if you want. But then that's basically all you need to know, because then you just apply machinery of conformal mappings that is well known since the late 70s, early 80s. And so you basically know. And so you basically know that the physics of the strip is related by this conformal mapping to the physics of the half-plane. And then you immediately use standard machinery to get the prediction of, for example, the form of the two-point function in that strip. And typically it has this form here. And then with the standard trick, that rather than taking primary operator, you take... Rather than taking primary operator, you take a twist field, and here, sorry, there is a typo, there is a 12 here, 24, with this with the scaling dimension, it depends on the central charge and the number of replicas. Then you immediately, and then at last, you do your identity continuation from Euclidean time to real time that is represented here by this line here. You immediately get to this prediction that actually was already Let's say, given in the several papers in the Takaya and IG group the year before our work. But basically, the interesting thing, you see that we have this generalized entropy. So let me briefly describe this formula. This generalized entropy is a complex function. It's a complex function of both your length of the temporal interval and the total The total time you evolve your system. And it has an imaginary part that is constant proportional to the central charge. And the real part really look like the standard scaling of the entanglement entropy at equilibrium. So the only footprint of the fact that we are out of equilibrium comes from this complex pre-factor. Complex pre-factor. And here that's the numerics that we have done. And you see on the top we have the IC model, on the bottom, we have the POTS model. This is small t divided by large t, so size of the interval divided the total length of the evolution. This is the imaginary part that should be constant at this line here. You see there is some kind of extra time dependence. Independence, and this is the real part. So, the agreement with the real part is perfect. On the imaginary part, there are still some boundary effects that our CFT formula don't predict. Probably they come at higher order in 1 over t. And then, so that's our conjecture. But you see that the agreement with the real part is perfect. We have this pre-factor here that is the central charge. And so, again, Is the central charge. And so, again, there is something in the auto-equilibrium dynamics that, if it can be measured, encodes the same universal properties that you have at equilibrium. But again, doing the auto-equilibrium dynamic for a critical system is much easier than getting the ground state of a critical system because of the critical slowdown, right? So, if there is some way of extracting universal information from the dynamics, it's much easier. Sorry? Can I ask a question? Can I ask a question? Yes. So, so in this numeric, so these are results for the Loh Schmidec? Yes, yes indeed. And for, I mean, what is the initial state? Okay, so it depends. The results actually depend on the initial state. So here now I think this is the panel in which I have upspin everywhere. So, if you want to use free boundary condition, I think, on both sides of the strip. Obviously, since this is a boundary conformal field theory, the results depend on that. But basically, what depend on that are more the final side, so the correction on the top of the CFT formula than the CFT formula. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. And so, yes, what I wanted to show here is not only that at the critical point things work as expected, so you see this logarithmic increase of the sign. So, it means that this temporal entropy all increases logarithmically with time. But as soon as you move away from the critical point, you see that you observe something that we would call area law of the temporal entropy. And this, from the computational point of view, is very important because it tells you that in this Because it tells you that indeed this answer of matrix of temporal matrix per state that I've been making in order to compute this Los Schmitecho is correct and actually can go to pretty large time and compute Los Schmitecho numerically for very long time, something that before our work seems to be exponentially hard. Okay, so there is also this computational side of this result. And so again, generalized temporal entropy seems to grow at most logarithmically in these Loshmit echo scenarios. In these Los Miteco scenarios, implying that we can now compute Los Miteco for fairly long times with polynomial resources. And so that's computationally irrelevant if you're interested in computing this Los Miteco. And now, do I have still five minutes? Because maybe I'm already out of time. So I wanted just to show you how To just to show you how you can measure these things in an experiment. And the idea is that you can actually extract this temporal entropy as the expectation value of a remission operator after appropriately designed quenches. And so let me explain you how it works. So again, imagine that you are interested in computing the purity of such a situation in which you have a local operator here and you have the path interval. And you have the path integral cut along a time-like surface, and then you glue two copies of that. So now you have two copies of this local operator. But if you follow closely what's happening in time, it is as if you started with a replicated system, as you expect. So you have two copies, so you have two replicas of your system. And then let's say that your system is divided into left and right. And then along the during the time in which you have. Time in which you have the cut and you have glued the two copies of the reduced transition matrices, then it turns out that the left half of your system interacts of your first replica interact with the right half of the second replica and vice versa, because you have this Riemann surface. But then, as soon as the cut is finished and you have taken the standard overlap, then the left part of your first replica interacts with the right part of the first replica and the right part of the first replica interacts with the replica. And the right part of the first replica interact with the right part of the second. Sorry, each replica interacts independently. And then at the end of your protocol, you have to measure on both the replica the same operator you started from. And so this kind of encodes these things. And basically, you can see that all you have to do is to measure this local operator after this specific quasi. So you start from your initial state, you have a system that Initial state, you have a system that in which the interaction follows the yellow pattern for some time, and then you quench it again because this Hamiltonian doesn't necessarily need to be the same Hamiltonian that your equilibrium state was equilibrium state of. And then you quench this pattern of interaction again, and you measure after some time t. And actually, that's exactly what I represent here. So, in blue, I computed this generalized purity. Generalize purity using this matrix per state in the same way we did for this Loshi Miteco scenario, now for this quench scenario. And in this yellow dot line, I did the quench in the replicated system, and you see that there is absolutely no difference whatsoever. Okay. And so the message is that it's very easy to measure these generalized entropy in experiments. And now it's interesting. And now it's interesting to try to. So, on one side, we now know that this generalized entropy encodes some universal features, like the central charge of the CFT. And now this indeed could give rise to a simpler auto-equilibrium protocol to extract universal information of critical systems. I think I stop here because I don't have time to go into that. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Can you hear me? Yes. I just have a, I'm not familiar with this topic. I just have a really important question. So maybe I missed it. What's the physical presentation of this temporal state other than it's called? So my understanding, my naive understanding from these topics is like a computation of two, at least, for you to compute some time-dependent observables using, you know, but what are the physical phrases other than for computational purposes to the other? Yeah, I think that's a very legitimate question. Actually, I think it's still an active field of research. So, what are these states over time? Given that actually the relevant thing, again, the relevant thing is not really the single state, but the overlap between this left and right state, right? So, what is the ontology of these objects? I think it's still an open question, right? And indeed, I know of some people that have found upper bound on the correlation function in time based on these generalized entanglement measure and things like that. But I think it's still a very open question. So what are these states telling us, besides, as you say, being maybe a relevant computational tool to simulate the dynamics? But it is something. But it is something that we are currently working on, and for the moment, I don't have much to report besides this scaling of the entropies in the critical case. Yeah, I wanted to ask a bit more about this lotion echo. So, if you take a sort of a lattice model and you take some sort of generic state and you sort of time evolve it, then you sort of create a lot of. Then you sort of create a lot of sort of excitation, so you're not really necessarily looking at the sort of low-energy properties of this system. So, how far are these sort of CFT formulas applicable? So, you've got this nice agreement there, but maybe that sort of depends also on the special state you're choosing to compare. Yeah, so indeed, so there is a bit of that in these buffer zoning, if you want. Buffer zoning, if you want. So in our case, typically this is used, as I said, to make contact of finite correlation length in the initial state in the quench scenarios. In our case, it's really necessary if you want to put a UV cutoff in your dynamics. And we are actually studying the effects. actually studying the effects of this beta zero in terms of so the finite beta zero effects on on of our results as function as you say of the boundaries so in the in the different boundary sector or the things and we we have reported the results in our in the appendices of our paper but we can't say that we really understand the scaling of these of these corrections Of these corrections. So, in a way, as you say, one would expect that the auto-equilibrium dynamics is mostly dictated by finite energy states. If you indeed take some boundary state that is sufficiently in the middle of the spectrum of your things, you would expect that the CFT has very little to say about that. It turns out that if you regularize it a bit with beta zero, well, everything works smoothly, and then you can take beta zero. Smoothly, and then you can take beta zero to zero, and still things somehow converge polynomially to what you expect. But the power that dictate that approach are not what we would have expected from standard file size correction. And so if you want to have a look and drop me an email and you have any idea, so we have these results in the appendix of the preprint, but we don't have a clear understanding of Don't have a clear understanding of so there are clear power law scanning with this beta zero, so meaning that in principle one could be able to go to beta zero going to zero, so in the middle of the spectrum and still have some CFT prediction plus correction, but we don't really understand the exponents from first principle. You're welcome. Question related to the logarithmic growth and sort of implied. And he sort of implies that tensor network methods could be used to compute the Lauschman echo at least because I think that's the message. So if you want to compute the Lauschmid echo, then the idea is that you can use this idea of defining this transfer matrix and looking for is leading eigenvector as matrix per state, given that the State, given that this generalized entropy only grows at most logarithmically, then this bond dimension is small by definition. And then you can compute it for a very long time. Yes, that would be the message. To really update exponentially long times compared to what we're just used to. Well, it's still polynomially expensive, so exponentially compared to the one that you would get by doing the evolution of the state, yes. By doing the evolution of the state, yes, but it's still, you cannot. Well, this is an interesting question. Can you go to infinite time at finite bond dimension? So, we expect that there is something similar to what we call finite entanglement scaling at equilibrium. So, we expect that this also works out of equilibrium, but we still haven't worked on that. But in principle, you can go to a very long time already by increasing the bond dimension only polynomially. Yes. And that's a comment that's always. Maybe I can just comment that sort of we have a paper on the ocean and echo where we exactly calculated it using this transfer matrix about, I don't know, what is it, now, 12 years ago or something like that. So where we used exactly this method of defining the transfer matrix and calculating the notion they go from. And by using also mathematical state as the. Yeah, we defined exactly this transfer matrix and then sort of use that basically the entity matrix anonymization group to calculate the osmotic data. Okay, great. So, if you can send me the reference so I can add it to our preprint because I wasn't aware. Yes. Thanks. Yes. Yes. So I have any signature? You know, the people were interested a couple of years ago in the non-analyticities of the Logitech function of time? Time, yes, this dynamical quantum phase transition. Yes, yes, we do see actually. So, indeed, so it's a very interesting question. So, here, if you look at these things, they're actually always from the sides in which you don't see the QPT. So basically, it means that, you know, for example, here I started from a paramagnetic state, and then I quenched either to the critical point or slightly before, and then everything. Slightly before, and then everything works as expected from the CFT. As soon as you get to this non-analyticity, since our formula are based on analytic continuation of the equilibrium results, actually they don't coincide anymore with what we see numerically. And we still are trying to make sense for what you see. So basically, the message, I think there is a paper, a couple of paper already out that describe this the QPT as first order transition, so level crossing in this transfer matrix. Level crossing in this transfer matrix. And so basically, the idea is that actually, once you encounter one of such level crossing, the CFT prediction don't work anymore. So you see something different. So that's something that we haven't published, but we have observed. And the reason we haven't published because we still don't make much analytical sense of that. But it's clearly there. So the fact that we can, the fact that we can. So the fact that we are using analytic continuation means that we can use it only when there is a certain analyticity in this plane. Yes. But that was exactly the main topic of our paper from 2013 where we recently looked at the crossing of these eigenvalues in the transformation sense. Identify the network of phase transitions of landson. Yeah, exactly. So this we clearly see, we see these crossings, and indeed. Crossings, and indeed, I had seen that it was already seen in the papers. So, yes, if you can please send me the reference, I will be very happy. Okay, thanks. Yes.
