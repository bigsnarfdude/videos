Okay, it's working now. We can see the full screen mode. You're muted, so please you mute yourself. Okay, so thanks. Can I start? Yes, please. Yes, please. Okay, good. Okay, thanks. So thanks for inviting me to attend the BIIS workshop. So I'm Li Cheng from Shen Jiaotong University. Jiao Tong University, China. And the title of my presentation today is about post-scale modeling of multi-phase reactive transport process. So there are five parts in my brand talk today, introduction to the polyscale modeling, and the application of the polyscale modeling to the process electrodes in CO cells and application to carbon dioxide sequencing. Carbon dioxide sequencation and application to toflogration, and finally, the conclusion. So, first, introduction to the polyscale modeling. So, actually, a post-mediary is a material that contains plenty of pores between solid skeletons. So, you can find the solid parts, the blue parts are solid, and between the solids are the pores. As a pause. So the study of transport processes in process media can be traced back to 1856 by Henry Dash. At that time, he conducted the experiments of fluid flow through a plus medium, and he finds that there is a linear relationship between the pressure gradient and the velocity. So he proposed the Dussy equation. To the Dussy equation, so and the proposal conception of permeability. So, you can find in this equation, he used the probability to represent the capacity of a pulse media for fluid flow through. So after that, people studied the transport process at the IV scale. So, usually use an effective transport property to describe the capacity. describe the capacity of a pulse medium for a certain transfer process such as permeability for velocity or for example or effective second activity for for the heat transfer so in such a way you can find that in at the iv scale we do not need to rather uh resolve we do not we do not you need to resolve the details of the process structures but it usually finds that uh the The microscopic or the underlying transport process will affect the system performance. Thus, it is very important to study the at the post-scale transport process. So we, in our group, we develop post-scale methods to study, to directly resolve the post-structures of the post-media and then start at the post-scale transport process inside the component. Process inside the complicated structures of post-media. So, the general steps for post-scale simulations can be include the four steps. The first is to obtain the realistic power structures and then to develop the post-scale model and then to analyze the post-scale results. And finally, to improve the improve the to modify the structures of the process medium and thus to regulate or manipulate the process and finally to improve the system to finally to improve the system performance so the first example of our post-scale study is that is that is a transport process taking place inside a protein exchange member field cell so it's a schematic this is a schematic of the field cell so the it's Of the fusion. So it directly converts chemical reaction to electricity. So this is a schematic of the structures inside the electrode, including the nanoscale structures of the catalyst layer, the nanostructures of the microscopic pulse layer, and the gas ethnic layer. So as besides such complicated structures, there are multiple processes in there are multiple processes including the multi phase flow a transfer mass transport phase change electrochemical reaction and electron and broaden conduction so all these processes are coupled together coupled with each other and take place in such structures so currently it is quite a challenge for current experimental techniques to perform such in-situ experiments so in our group we develop the post-scale modeling without Modeling without a method to study the multiple transport process inside the electrodes. So the first one is a catalyst layer. So the catalyst layer actually has not complicated yet least understood component inside a field cell. So you can find that this is the SEM image of SEM image of a catalyst layer. It consists of a packet carbon particle with a diameter of about 40 nanometers. And on the surface of the carbon particle, the PT narrow particle with size of about one two narrow size particles are loaded on the surface of the carbon particle. And then the platinum and carbon particle structure is covered by a thin ion film of about a 10. I almost film about 10 nanometers. So and then the remaining parts between the carbon particles are the poor are the void space for oxygen transport. So in our group, first we construct the complicated structures of the catalyst layer including the carbon-park carbon phase, the platinum phase, and finally the iron. And then we study the transport, reactive transport process in such complicated In such complicated structures. So, first, you can find that the oxygen first transport, force transport, transport inside the pores between the carbon particles and then arrives at the surface of the carbon particles, dissolves at the pore-ion interface, and finally arrives at the platinum surface for electrochemical reaction. So from the power in After the pore and IOLOME interface, the transport, the local transport is very complex. First, the concentration is not continuous. So you can find that from the port into the iOLOMER, the concentration undergoes a sharp drop across the interface. And besides the diffusivity of the oxygen inside of the pore and inside the armor, are quite complex. The difficulty the difficulty inside the gas phase is about 10, about five orders of magnitudes higher than that inside the IOMer. And finally, at the interphase, oxygen undergoes a non-equilibrium dissolution reaction. So you can find that the interfacial transport process is very complex. So in our group, we developed a post-scale model for such quite complex process. And then Process and then we studied the local reactive transport and to predict the limiting current density. So, for fusion, the higher, a higher current density, limiting current density is desirable. So, we find that if we want to obtain a higher current density, we need to use more platinum. But you know, platinum is very expensive. Platinum is very expensive. We will reduce the platinum, the amount of the platinum. You can find that the local transport resistance is increasing. That means the current density is reduced. So we try to use our POSCO modeling to study the effects of porosity, radius, or ionocycles, try to optimize the structures of the catalyst layer. So to reduce, to reduce the To reduce the amount of the platinum and try to enhance the mass transport, thus, to improve the cell performance. So, we conducted a lot of POSC modeling and try to optimize the structures. So, to try to reduce the transport resistance. And finally, we study the effects of the liquid water because inside the catalyst there, oxygen, the electrochemical. Oxygen, the electrochemical reaction will generate liquid water. And the generated liquid water inside the pores will block the pathway for the oxygen. So we try to understand the effects of liquid water on the oxygen transport. So first we develop a post-scale model for the liquid water condensation. You can find that as the relative humidity. As the relative humidity increases, first the small pores will be filled by condensed water and then large pores. So you can find that as the IH or the relative humidity increases, more and more pores will be filled by the liquid water. So on one hand, liquid water will block the pores and let us give. And that is not desirable for the oxygen transport. But on the other side, because there are lots of platinum inside the carbon particle and the ion cannot enter the carbon particle, so you can find that these platinum cannot be used. But if liquid water is generated, the liquid water will connect to the carbon particles, will connect the platinum particles to the outside eye olmer and these. Outside iOMer, and these platinum particles can be used. So, in this way, liquid water is desirable for the electrochemical reaction. So, we also performed lots of post-scale simulations, and we find that as the relative humility increases, the local transport resistance can be reduced, thus the cell performance can be improved. Okay, these are the papers publication. other papers publication but public published it based on our post-scale modeling work okay another example is apply our post-scale modeling to the carbon dioxide sequencing in broad formation or exploit oil reservoirs. So you can find that for the for the CO2 sequestration Sequestration on subsurface. There are four trapping mechanisms, including the structure trapping, capillary trapping, solubility trapping, and the mineral trapping. And inside of the four trapping mechanisms, a multiple phase reactive transport process with structure evolution took place. So in our group, we developed such post-scale methods to study the multi-phase reactivity. is a multi-phase reactive transport process. Okay, the first one is the POSC modeling of supercritical displacement of oil by the supercritical carbon dioxide. So this is the structure we did using the Volonoid structures. And as we then performed letters bottom color gradient employ the LB color gradient model to simulate the Model to simulate the multi-phase flow inside the flow structures. So the boundary conditions are for the top and bottom boundary are the periodic boundary condition. And at the left, the supercritical CO2 is introducted. And for the right boundary, we use a fully developed boundary condition. And in order to In order to study the effects of the structure heterogeneity, we also add lots of fractures or local logic pulse into the domain. And we find that with pulse heterogeneity added, the recovery efficiency of the oil is reduced. And we also developed POSGO method for surface flow inside of the process media. So you can find that in the first liquid water is used to displace the oil. And at the end, in the pulse lock, the content of the water is very high and the content of the oil is very low. And then we further inject the subclick CO2 into the domain to further displace the liquid water. To further displace the liquid water, to displace the oil. So you can find that in this system, the red part is the oil, the blue part is the water, and the green part is the supercolytical CO2. You can find that the oil is displaced by the green phase, that is the supercoid CO2, and the oil can be recovered. Okay, we also We also pro a very possible method, the solubility trapping. So you can find this is the supercritical, the bubbles of the supercritical CO2. And inside the brine, the bubble will be dissolved and the concentration of the aquiface CO2 is increased. So we also try explore the relationship between Explore the relationship between the saturation and the specific interfacial area between the brine and the supercritical CO2. And this is the relationship we find. And finally, we also performed the post-cal modeling of the dissolution of lock. So you can find that in such process, the lock is dissolved by the fluid. So actually, this process is kind of a... actually this process process is can is controlled by by two uh non-dimensional dimensionless numbers the first one is a peck number and the second one is a dunk number and we we changed the pack number and the d number try and and find the different dissolution pattern including phase dissolution homogeneous dissolution and channel dissolution and we further studied the effects of undissolved mineral for example Mineral, for example, this mineral can be dissolved and this mineral cannot be dissolved. So you can find that when there is undissolved mineral inside the lock, the dissolution pattern is quite different. So usually we find that the undissolved mineral surprises the positive feedback between dissolution and reactive transport. And we, in our group, we also develop a multi-phase develop a multi-phase reactive transport model post-scale model for the and visa solid dissolution so this shows a multi-phase flow around a solid particle and the solid particle can be dissolved by the biospecies species species inside the red phase. So you can find that the liquid water is injected into the system and the lock is dissolved. The lock, it dissolved in the red phase. And this is the evolution of the species reactant concentration. And this is the evolution of the product concentration. And we further applied the Post-scale model to a much more complicated phase. There are multiple channels inside the domain. And you can find that. can find that the liquid water is injected into the system and the lock is dissolved and this is the reactant the concentration of the reactant and this is the concentration of the product okay and you can find that we uh developed a comprehensive post-scale model for the trapping and for the For the trapping and for the solubility trapping and for the mineral trapping process. Okay, and the final example is we apply our Post-scale modeling to the topology optimization. So in our group, we developed a Pulsar model for the topology optimization of connective heat transfer problem. So we developed the forward. We developed the forward simulation based on the Leximo method and the adjoint simulation also based on the Latin method. And we use a Lagrangian multiple method to calculate the sensitivity calculation and to update the structure. And for example, if we, this is a problem about the try to try to try to To minimize the pressure drop, the liquid water enters the domain from the top left and flows out of the domain from the bottom right. So initially, there is no solid inside the domain. So we want to minimize the pressure drop and there is a restructuring of the volume of the fluid. That is the volume of the fluid. Fluid that is the volume of the fluid should be smaller than 10.4. And this is, you can find this structure evolution using our topology optimized method. And this is the, you can find this is the final structure we obtained liquid water from the top left and flows out of the land from the bottom right. And this is the structures that can reach the minimal pressure drop. And we also apply our topological. Our topological optimizing method, the post-fuel model to optimize the structures inside the domain with natural convective heat transfer. So there is a here is a heat source with high temperature. So we need to add solid structures into domain to minimize the temperature of the heat source. So we performed post-field modeling. We performed post-field modeling on the different Grasshopper number and obtained different structures that can minimal the temperature inside the heat source. So these are the different structures we obtained using our Post-Scale method. Okay, finally, I want to make a short conclusion on my presentation. So actually in our group, So actually in our group, we developed a post-scale multi-phase, multi-component reactive transport model or transport process inside post-media. We applied our model to fuel cells to the reactive transport process on the subsurface and also applied the method, the model, the Post-Scale model to the topolog optimization problem. Uh, problem, so that's all. Thanks for your attention. Thank you, thank you. Let's thank Professor Chen. Quite a lot of topics. Enjoyed it. Let's see if there are questions, few questions, because we were a little short on time, but let's take a few questions from audience as well as from Zoom. Let's see if there is any question on the Zoom. Zoom audience can post their questions in the chat or on. Post their questions in the chat or unmute yourself and ask questions. If not, any questions from the audience over here or Skillflow? It's quite a lot, though. This multi-channel, if you go to your multi-channel setup where your water is ejected, yes, the very first, yeah, the right-hand side simulation. So at the outflow boundary condition, could you explain a little bit what is happening over there? You know, you okay, so the droplets can. You know, you okay, so the droplets keep merging. Is there a gravitational component to it that the thing is sinking towards the bottom? Actually, there's no gravity force in our simulation. And for the left, for the right boundary, we use we use the fully developed boundary condition. Some of these, the distribution in the outflow chamber of these red and blue phases is it's getting very difficult to kind of. It's getting very difficult to kind of understand. So, what's happening this to the blue? I see red right after that. So, is it like the outflow boundary condition? Yeah. And I'm assuming that the top and bottom are still walls, right? Okay. Yeah. Right at the exit, right at the exit, just the blue face just sits there for a while before actually your red face moves out. Your red phase moves out. So it is, is it physical? Like what's happening in this outflow part of the box when these two phases are occupying such large continuous volumes? I couldn't understand what was happening in the outflow. That's my really the like if you could explain what's happening in the outflow. Okay, thanks. Yes, I think I actually thanks for your question. I find the behavior of the proof is here is a little The behavior of the proof is here is a little strange, right? If I use a fully developed boundary condition, it should be flow out of the domain very smoothly, right? It looks like it speaks to the solid wall boundary condition, but I think should be fully periodic. I will double-check that. Thanks. Okay, thank you. For the single particle, it's just For the single particle simulation, I think here it is normal, right? It is reasonable. Yeah. Yes. It flows out, flows out. Here it looks very strange. Thanks. Well, thank you, Professor Chen. And for the interest of time, let me first thank you because all the Chinese colleagues that are joining remotely, they are in a very different time zone. So I truly appreciate you finding time and participating in a first workshop. What's the time over there where you are? Where you are. It's midnight, one o'clock. One o'clock. Okay. I truly appreciate, I truly appreciate your participants in the Park Workshop and then giving a talk at a very odd hour. So gratitude from our side. I know we had speakers lined up from all different parts of the world on this day and truly appreciate that. Thank you so much, Professor Chen. So So
