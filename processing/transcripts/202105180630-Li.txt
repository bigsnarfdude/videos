It's my pleasure to introduce Professor Hai Song Li from Tsinghua University. He will talk about curvature flow for hype surface in hyperbolic space and their geometric applications. So, Haison, please. Okay, good. First of all, Okay, good. First of all, thank you, Professor Yuxin Dong, for introduction. Also, thanks for the invitation, giving me this chance to present our workers, joint workers. Today, I will talk about covering flows for hype surface in hybolic space and their geometry application. Let's begin. So, my talk will divide it into three sections. The introduction and our center of thinking quality. central function quality in herbolic space than the locally contributed strike covision flow and geometry applications let's begin suppose n is a dimension manifold m is an n-dimensional half surface with a unit normal vector nu and the principal curvature is kappa i the curvature flow is a smooth family of embedded half surface satisfied this kind of equation partial This kind of equation, partial x equals minus f u. The f is called the smooth function of the principle curvature because it is a split function. So there are several famous examples. The most famous curving flow called the mean curving flow. Just choose a speed function equal to mean curvature. equal to a mean curvature function. Then there are some examples called the gauss curvature flow. Just choose the curvature follow is the gauss curvature. There are also famous followers called inverse mean curvature flow. Just choose the speed function f equal to minus one over h. Also, there are some other kind of flow. For example, volume preserve mean curvature flow just satisfied this phi t. satisfied this phi t set to preserve the volume and the flow so i give some example the first example is you use the curving flow can give the proof of aristocratic thinking quality this result belonged to the penguin guan and jung fanli they use the inverse curvature flow can prove following the class in the classic Alexandro Finch inequality that can give the peruse of V V k omega and v l omega the inequality v k omega equal to the integral e k minus 1. e k minus 1 people call it the k minus 1 mean curvature function. V k omega is called the co-mass integral of the smooth domain. So here they give the inequality. that gives the inequality between the V K omega and the V L omega for the closed K convex and the starship domain for the domain in Euclidean space. So there are some really workers by Professor Alec Chang and Wang Yi and also by Professor Chu Guohuan for the use of optimal transport method. more transportant method to prove this kind of equality but with an ado equal zero for the k plus one convex domain so in my talk i want to give some uh some result for the allison function quality for domain in hyperbolic space not a euclidean space the second topic we want to we want to study how to find a new optimal geometry Optimal geometric inequality in hyperbolic space for heb surface by use type surface curvature flow. In this talk, I will describe my recent joint work with Hui Ying Xiang, the professor in Beihan University, also professor Yungwei, and the USTC is the University of Science and Technology of China. So now I began to talk about the science. Now, I began to talk about the second section about Alexandrofinkian qualities in hybrid space. So, for a domain on the hybrid space H minus M plus 1 with a boundary M, the core mass integral we write as W chi is defined as a measure of the set of total geodesic dimension subspace which intersects M. So we can write the We can write the WK as a linear combination of integrals of the case mean curvature. So, W0 is just equal to the volume of domain. W1 equals 1 over the area of the M. WK plus 1 can define by integral Ek and WK minus 1 by inductively. So, this definition of This definition of the core mass integral for the domain in hyperbolic space. So the very, very famous formula is very important. Use the variation formula under the flow, the variation of W L equal to the unit F E L d mu t. Here F is the speed function for the flow. So in this joint work with Professor Yong. Joint work with Professor Yungwe and Professor Chang Wee Xiong, we get some following result. For the smooth bounded two convex touchy half surface in hyperbolic space m plus one dimension hybrid space, you can get the following optimal inequality. Interval E2 is bounded by area of m plus only n over 2 over n. Over two over n and that m with the po is n minus one over n. That's only n is the area of the unsphere unsphere. So our equality, inequality two is a is a sub condition very good. It's too convex and suspicious. Inequality was generalized later by Professor Yuxinge and Wufang Wang and Wujie. They can prove some. here they can prove some following result for the closed h convex hyp surface in hyperbolic space they can get a low bound of the integral e to k this inequality three is the inequality hold if and only if m is your desk sphere but which i just remind you in the in quality two our condition is two convex and suspicious but for the quantity but for the quantity in quantity three that condition is a horror convex horror convex means the principle curvature a lot less one two convex means that first mean curvicher is positive and the second mean curvicher also positive so so the complete family of alexander function equality for co-mass integral in hybolic space was proved by the professor This was approved by the professor Wang Guofa and Xia Cho in 2014. So they give the inquiry between the case core mass integral W chi omega and the relation with the L integral core mass integral W L omega. So this inequality is also sharp. Then quality could and if and old if omega is geodesic ball, but I is geodesic ball but i just mentioned that condition also h convex means horror convex means the perceived curve cannot less one so so it's famous conjecture here so compilation the previous result people want to prove the following conjecture one suppose omega is domain on the m plus one hyperbolic space with a bounded m bounded k minus one convex and the static domain. People want to prove the following quality is hood means have the inequality between the WK and the WL. So this inequality is hood if and only if omega is your desk ball. For this conjecture, just the solved took you my note is the In my note, is the red line. One case is KQ3, L equals Y. This conjunction was solved by Professor Yung We and Chang Weu and myself. The other case is solved by the last line, red line, is K equal 2, L equals 1 is for the one convex and the starship. This is by Sam Brando and Punfi Gua and Jung Feng Li. There are other case that The other keys, the art case just get the passion result. For example, for the the for the L equals zoo, K is a bigger zoo and a lot less, a lot bigger N. For positive section curvature, this gets partially data through the by Professor Boangius and the Xiu Dong Chen and the Yungvi, and the other case is also partially that. Also, pattern in that. So, this conjecture for general keys still open. So, would just care three, L1, or K2, and LOC1. So, the next time, I will talk some results on the data about the locally constrained curving flow and it is geometry application. So, in this section, we describe application. We describe the application of a new type of curvature flow. Here we consider the hyperbolic space and the vapid product Hm plus Y equal to R plus cross Sn with the metric G bar equal to D R square plus lambda R square and times the caloric metric of the unit sphere. Of the unit sphere. So here, lambda r equals xin qi r. So there are some famous follow introduced by Simon Brando and Configua and Jung Fangdi in the pre-printer. For the any K-convex and starship addition hypersurface M0 in M plus one hyperbolic space, we consider the following flow. Here the context pedal function is lambda prime. the function is lambda prime ek minus one of ek minus u so use this function as a speed function they can they consider this kind of flow w prime is just a coaching jr u is a support function so why they consider this function their purpose wants to prove the approach and the conjecture i mentioned before so the flow The flow formula for the flow is designed based on the following mean causing inequality mean causing formula for closed hype surface in hyperbolic space. So that's that's the third line. Integral lambda prime ek equal to integral u e k plus one. This is female formula. Why they design the flow for the flow file? Because by use this mean Because by use this mean caused formula, they can prove the flow file preserves the case core mass integral, WK, and also can prove that K plus 1 core mass integral WK minus K plus 1 is decreasing. So use these two properties, they can solve the conjecture. But if they can prove that this kind of flow is convert, there are some convert. Is convert, there are some convert convergence. So we will see what happened. First thing I will check whether follow is a preserve the WK because you can make some calculation. Derivative WK equal to integral lambda prime e k minus y over e k minus u speed function times e k equals zero. Y by use of Newport formula. Also, we can check also. So we can check also derivative w k plus one equal to integral w prime ek plus e k minus one ek minus u times ek plus one. We can check by you use simple inequality. We can check it's a lot less it's a lot big lambda prime ek minus u e k plus one is equal to when use Minko's formula again. By use formula again. So the goal to prove the convergence of flow to geodesic field for any star shift and the K convex hype surface, then prove the Alessandro function quality for each cap surface, mean conjecture one. This is the goal. But there are some difficulty. However, so far the convergence can be proved only for the hip surface. We can satisfy this. We can satisfy the strong C1 condition, unless KQN means if KQN, their goal can be reached, they can prove their convergence. But if K lot KN, they cannot do it because there are some obstruction. They cannot get the good estimate for the C1 estimate. Now, I will see all that. So join the work with the professor. So, joint work with Professor Ying Xiao Hu and Yung Wei, we can prove if elation have surface is horror convex, mean the principle curvature not less than one, then the smooth solution of the flow file remains to be edge convex for all t positive. So use this kind of theorem, we can prove that the conjecture is true. Is true. That means under condition H convex. That means we can give a new proof of one Gofan one and shot without that proof of the conjecture for the H convex. So mean contribution or mean contribution, we can use Bohenji's generalized tense maximum principle to prove H convictity can be preserved under this kind of law. And this kind of flow. But Sam Brendo and Tung Fi Gua and Chung Fan Li want to prove this convergence of this flow, the field for the K lot N. But for the arbitrator K, we can prove under the strong condition, H convex, we can prove this flow converges to geodesic sphere. So we can give a new proof of the Guoform one. Proof of the Go formula and the Shato's result. Convergence result also can be proved some new optimal geometry equality. We just hit one result here. There are some other result. One result we get it here. Use our flow. We can prove. Suppose M is the closed edge convex hype surface M plus Y hybolic space for any K, for any M from 0 to K. From zero to k, then there are some weighted integral inequality. Means left-hand side is integral W prime ek notless HK plus one composition Fm inverse Wm omega. W omega, Wm is the core mass integral, but the left-hand side integral W prime EK will be called the weighted. the weighted integral because it involves lambda that hk plus yr is the is a is a function you define this way in particular if m equals one we can get equality seven means we get we can get the integral number prime uk and the relation with the area so this this equality also opt Quality also optimum because quality hold if and only if MGO death scale. So, this is one kind of application of our convergence with that. So, is character one the inquiry seven is proved by the Lima and Garot for the mean convex and such behavior surface later for K is order the perfect using Go and Guafa. using girl and the graphon one and the wuji can prove for seven for the edge convex so for the general case or without giving affirmative answer to a conjecture proposed by professor yuxing and guofang wang and wujie in their paper 2015. so so now i will put talk some other results so is from a previous So is from a previous lecture with a litchan to define the weighted curvature integral for the bounded domain omega in hyperbolic space with a boundary smooth boundary m w0 prime is just integral u u is part function is integral n plus 1 lambda prime and w k prime is defined by integral u e k equal to w prime Ek equal to W prime Ek minus one W n plus one prime you just defined by the integral lambda prime En so here is the definition involved the lambda and the lambda function. So we call that the weighted curvature integral. If a low lambda involved, we call it the curvature integral. So we can make some calculation for the derivative. for the derivative of this weighted curvature integral and flow. Flow is x per the speed function is f. So we have this kind of the formula. So our purpose is wanted to prove some Al-San function type and quality for weighted curvature integral in hyperbolic space. So we can have a look. So we can have a look. So what we get. So in Julia, Julia, Perfect Julius Layer and Perfect Chateau, they introduced the following locally inverse covid flow. That follow sphere function is right as it. For the hypersurface hyperbolic space, that proves some smooth convergence to geodesphere centered origin for the starship and the M convex. For the starship and M convex type surface, they prove some inequality is that give some equality the integral lambda prime eye is bounded by involves the right-hand side involves the integral of the lambda prime. So we can see the right-hand side quality as a weighted volume. So that gives some equality between the weighted curvature integral. Curvich integral and weighted volume. So, use previous definition, we can write down the result as W2 lambda prime and W0 lambda prime. W2 lambda prime and w0 lambda prime give some equality. So, okay, so the last five minutes we will give all the double before that. I also Before that, I also see that Professor Junior Slayer and Shashidat that give some kind of the weighted area and the weighted volume, the redishing, the inequality between the weighted area and the weighted volume and the reducing W1 prime and W0 lambda prime. So, okay, we introduce a new concept. This concept for the This concept for the Habsurfing hybrid introduced by us for a Hepsurfing hypothesis, if the second fundamental form satisfied HIGL not less U of the lambda prime GIGL, mean the principle curvature not less than U of the lambda prime. We call it a static convex because we suppose the hype surface is. suppose the hype surface is static u is positive so static convex is stronger than the strict convex but is weaker than the edge convex we can see it so this concept introduced by us is just between convex and edge convex so we we prove some result we can see the result before that we just prove propose a conjecture suppose omega domain on the omega domain on the m plus one hyperbolic space is static convex domain then we hope to produce some following quality give the equality w k lambda prime and w l lambda prime some this kind quality is very similar to relation between the k core mass integral and l core mass integral so what we get we introduce a new flow the recent work with new flow the recent work with a professor Ying Xiaohu in Beihang University. We introduced a locally contravention flow. Partial X equal to Y minus U Ey of the Lambda Prime U. Speed function is Y minus U E1 of the Lambda prime. Okay, we can prove this flow is a can preserve the weighted volume means the derivative W zero lambda prime is zero. This is in some This in some sense is inspired by the mean curvature flow type, mean curvature type flow by introduced by Peng Fei Guan and Jung Fang Li. Their flow just preserves the volume. Or follow it preserve the weighted volume. This is somewhat different. So, okay, two associations that uniform C1 and CZ. Cy and the C z or C Y C Y azimute, we can prove following the double. We can prove this kind of flow and also the Julie Schaus flow, the static convex can be preserved. Means if an Elisian hype surface is static hype surface. So either the perfect Julie Sha's flow or the flow we introduced here, the static convex is preserved. So, okay. Is preserved so okay. Use this technique, use this mean property. We can prove some results. I just go through it. So we can prove, I just see that conjecture. The conjecture is true for the K for K and the L equals means we can suppose the hype surface, a static convex half surface in M plus one dimensional hyper space. We have the incorporated. We have the inequality between the Wk lambda prime and W0 lambda prime. So, okay, the idea of the proof is just make some observation. This flow preserves the weighted volume, also make some calculation, and we can prove with that. So, we also can prove, we get some equality that this. this Wk plus Y lambda prime can compare with the coherence integral give this inequality so so this means with that so this is some of the reference we get about this area so we joined first people joined with Professor Yung Wei and Chang Xiong and the second paper is joint with co-author is the Professor Ying Shanghu is Binghan University. Hu is Binghan University. Third people is rich people is joint with the blind youth and Yin Hang Hu. And the first people is mainly that I present here in the first part of the talk is joint with Professor Ying Shanghu and Yung We. The second part of my talk is based on the last paper with joint visit by Ying Xiaohu and about geometry in quality for start. Geometry in quality for static convex domain in hyper space. People are already unlucky. I think I should start here. Thank you for your attention. Thanks, Professor Li. Are there any questions or comments? So I'd like to ask a question. You mentioned the convexity is preserved by the curvature flow you consider. How about the star shaped property? Yes, yes. Also preserved. Yeah, first the same because for this kind of because for this kind of first assembly should prove that static is a static property is preserved means that the support function positive is a can be preserved thank you so any question I don't, I have a question. Yeah, please. Okay, okay, go ahead. In your joint work with Wei Yung and Hu Jinxiang, you assumed H convex, yeah? Yeah, yeah, we use this condition, H convex, yeah, so. What is the difficult point? The difficulty is just treated by Sam Brando and Peng Fei Guan and Jung Feng Li. They cannot get the silver estimate. They are already proved. Starship preserved and Conserve preserved and k convex convex is preserved, but they cannot get as a silver estimate. So they have some condition, means some kind of changing condition. Just put the illusion have surface. So I think the thing that condition is artificial. So this means Diff Card. See my semi-mid. You mean that if you can get the C1, you can solve the conjunction, solve a conjunction completed. Oh, I see. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, your message.
