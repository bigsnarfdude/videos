     They're in the ocean. We also know that bacteria live in and among us. So, for example, they're in our guts, they're in our teeth, and often they are not pathogenic. They are thought to be necessary parts of our community. And they're also those that cause disease. So, you know, like the Jacob. Cause disease. So, you know, like the Jack in the box strains of E. coli. There are also bacteria that are part of our long-term residency that, when they get to the wrong place, can cause disease and virulence. And that's what one of the organisms that we study today, on my group, Proteus Mirabilis. And we specifically study it because its collective behavior is tied to its virulent interactions. So Proteus mirabis is thought to be a long-term member of the human gut. However, when you look at microbiome studies, When you look at microbiome studies or metagenomic data sets, it's at a very low frequency. And as far as you can tell, its consistency is probably less than about 1% of your gut microbiome under healthy conditions. For people, though, who have long-term indulean catheters or other structural obstructions or immune compromisation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, we can find that protease will escape from the cut and as a group. And as a group move into your bladder, and so, for example, on a catheter, they move on the outside of this catheter. That movement requires the elongation of the cell from one to two microns all the way up to 10 to 80 microns. And that's visible here in this transmission electron micrograph that we have inverted the colors. Now, Proteus Mirabis is named after the Greek god Proteus, who was known as a shapeshifter, and because it was so miraculous. Because it was so miraculous. On the image that you see here, the white bodies, the thick white bodies, are the cells themselves. And off of those bodies are these are the long flagella. And so for the non-microbiologists in the room, those are just thinking of them as giant legs. So they're basically like giant millipedes. And when they are on a hard surface, like a catheter or even a viscous material, so much, you know, really something that really allows for a lot of surface tension, these bacteria through a These bacteria through a genetic change, developmental change, will elongate and grow 40-fold while continuing to replicate their chromosomes. And then they'll make all of these flagella hairs that stream behind them. And those flagella allow cells to align against one another and form into what is called a raft. And those rafts allow for cells to move rapidly on a surface at microns per second. And so that's demonstrated here. And so that's demonstrated here in this movie. And so, like Allison, I'm actually going to show quite a few movies, partly to get people to think about what's going on. So, this collective motility can be imaged using a standard wide-field light microscope. And so, to do these images, the cells actually move on top of the nutrient surface. We use a hard auger, so usually 1.5% auger all the way up to 4%. And then you inoctric the cells on top of. And then you inoculate the cells on top of that. And then you have to have nothing on top of them on top of that. So once you add a cover slip or anything hard on top, the cells will actually stop moving. So you're looking at images where most of this is done with air microscopy. The cells are here are in dark black, and the gray is the nutrient auger background, if you can see with my hand. This movie sped up about 10x real time, and this was taken by former graduate student, Christina Sak. As you can see, the cells like to move in these Uh, like to move in these streams along one another, there's a black screen for every time there's a loop, and they move fastest in the streams in the center where there are more of them and slower when they're by themselves. We can see this again in this movie here. This one is actually sped up much less. And again, you can see that the cells where they, when they are elongated, those are the ones that are moving. They move fastest when they're in streams, when they're short, as in the top left-hand corner. Short, as in the top left-hand corner, or when they are only a few to a body, they actually stop. So, this motion requires this hard auger. This motion requires cell-to-cell contact and it requires alignment of the bodies. This motion of microns per second allows for the population over the course of 24 hours at body temperature to cover a full five centimeter distance. And that's represented here with this plate. And so, this is a hard auger plate. And so, this is a hard auger plate that's 1.75% LB auger, so rich nutrients, but very hard. Again, the surface is such that if you press down on it, your finger kind of bounces back up, but you fill up your finger and it's almost completely dry. There's no wetness added. My former graduate student, Dr. Jacob Osterman, took this movie. It is a compilation of frames over 48 hours at room temperature just to slow things down. We start off with 10 to the 8 cells in the We start off with 10 to 8 cells in the center, which is what you see here with that dot. This plate itself is a 10 centimeter diameter plate. And I'll let the movie play and then say some more after. So how Proteus covers occupies these distances is that it goes through an oscillation between long cells and short cells. And you can see it, for example, right here. There are bursts of periods where those long cells that There are bursts of periods where those long cells that we were seeing in that last movie are moving without dividing. They're just moving, moving, moving, moving, moving. But then, for periods that we don't fully understand, for example, right here, they stop moving and the cells become short through division. And if they're retained on a hard surface, then they'll re-engage. And so, this is called the swarm developmental cycle, and it's depicted here on the left. I want to remind you again that we see collective migration and motility when they're elongated. That's going to be a migration stage. They're elongated, that's going to be a migration stage. And when they've stopped, that's when, in general, they're dividing. So, in order to actually build those big colonies as they spread outwards, it requires cell-to-cell interactions and communication. And this is really the basis for, in my opinion, most populations. Once you go from having one individual to having two individuals, suddenly they have to interact with each other in general, and there has to be some acknowledgement, sorry, some social interactions. Social interactions. And so we can see that this can be true regardless of your genetic background. In this case, we're actually using all wild type, but on the left is the phase image. Again, the cells are in dark, the grays, auger background. And on the right, we have in this population, we've mixed in about 10% of the cells are constitutively expressing a protein called red-flossing protein so that they turn, that they look magenta in this overlay. And about another 10% of the cells are... 10 another 10 of the cells are expressing green fluorescence proteins. So, again, they look green in this overlay, and then the rest of them are unmarked, and so they're dark. I hope you can see that just unlike populations where cells are just dividing and kind of moving out, because these cells are migratory, as the population is building, cells are exchanging their partners and mixing. We now know from work in my group and others that cells can distinguish cell from non-self, and this is occurring via a protein exchange. And I'll explain that in details on the next few slides. And that this identity information is actually impacting population expansion on global and local levels. And so for the talk today, I'm going to give you two short vignettes about how identity information is doing this. But I need to give a little background for the audience. For the audience. And so, one thing I want to note that I'm going to do everything as diagrams and graphics for the next few slides. However, this is based on a large body of work that incorporates genetics and protein biochemistry and sorts of other things. And if you'd like to have the experimental details, which we're always happy to share, they're in our publications, or you can always feel free to contact me during the meeting or afterwards. So in Proteus, I'm going to ask you to remember a few different things. Going to ask you to remember a few different things. What we now understand for non-lethal recognition in Pertius and how this and the identity information I'm going to talk about today is that there are two main players. Well, three, but there are two main protein players. There's that rectangle here that's in blue with a dark blue band. That is the message, identity message, and it's just a large protein, which is well conserved across the protease family, except for that dark blue band where they have very little sequence identity. Very little sequence identity. So, think of it as kind of a secret code. There's the arrow stepping to the right, which is how they get things from one cell to another. It's a big sword called a type 6 secretion system, and it's basically a way to transport things from cell to cell. And then finally, there's a receptor or receiver protein that interprets that information. That's the oval right here. And again, welcome service in the family, except for that blue band. In order for the message, the rectangle and the The message, the rectangle, and the oval to see each other as the same identity, they need to actually have the same belt color. And so, what we know from the work in my group is that the message gets delivered from one cell, a donor cell, into the recipient cell. If the recipient cell is a sibling or genetically identical, the two proteins, the message and the decoder, will bind due to that belt region. And that allows for the migration of the full colony. Migration of the full colony across the 10-centimeter diameter plate. And so that's depicted here on the bottom left. Now, genetically, we can modify this system. We can introduce errors and ask the question, what happens if instead of receiving messages that you can understand, what if every single cell in a population receives an identity information, identity message that it does not understand? And in that situation, again, the message is going across to the transport system. Across through the transport system. But now, because those salt colors are different, one is orange, one's blue, they don't bind. And that recipient sells that, oh, I don't know who you are. And when the entire population engages in this lack of recognition, we see an 80% reduction in the population-wide expansion without seeing a reduction in either the ability to go between long and short or the instantaneous velocity of the cells themselves. or the instantaneous velocity of the cells themselves, or in the final cell density, final cell viability of the population. However, if you remove that ability to receive that message by removing the transport system, we recover population expansion. And so the summation of all of this data is simply if cells are around, protease cells are around cells where they're constantly receiving information that they can understand and constantly getting that message. Understand and constantly getting that message: oh, you're my sibling. You get productive expansion. If you receive messages that you're non-self-indifferent, it's reduced by 80%. And if you don't know, because you can't hear anything, public space and expandment is fine. And so we're going to tackle the two things I'm going to tell you about. It's going to tackle two different questions. One, how can cells escape this identity base? How can cells escape this identity-based regulation of swarm expansion? And then, second, how does this recognition impact population behavior, specifically swarm expansion? Now, please do interrupt me if you have questions as we go along. And I will also tell you about some of the questions that we have. And I'm sorry, I can't see people's faces. And so I will try and speed up our speed based on questions. Can you share it? Can you hear us? I can hear you now. Yes. I can hear you now. Yes. So, quick question: if you look at the single cell behavior in these two situations, does single cells move normally or single cell also move less? Right. So when we look at this situation, what we find, if you look at any instantaneous time, we see cells that are moving similarly. However, this is a big caveat, and I'll talk about this at the end. Caveat, and I'll talk about this at the end. We have not done long-term tracking because of the challenges with these rapidly moving cells on top of the surface and the fact that they change cell shape. And so one of the things that we'd like to do is, and one of the reasons I'd love to talk to folks here is that we would like to build a more robust model. There is no good model for either the proteus wild type behavior or the behavior within of individual cells within each of these conditions. Thank you. Okay. So let's talk about how they can escape. And so, again, I'm giving you the two prototypes. If every single cell receives a method, you can understand, you get large expansion. If they don't, you get this non-self expansion. So this is work from a former graduate in the lab, Dr. Chala Dator, and it's now been published. But I'll tell you, I'm going to tell you some of the highlights from this and where we're going next. So, one of the beautiful things about being a geneticist is that we can screw around with the insides of these cells. And so Chella asked the question: okay, so if cells are not able to move and expand as a population, what can cause them to do it? Can we find naturally occurring mutations that allow them to overcome this constriction? And so, in order to do this, we do what's called an unbiased experimental evolution, where we take a plate such as non-self cells. Of non-self cells as seen here on the left, and we parafilm it and leave it for a week. And what you can find after a week is you see these spurs where suddenly they're able to expand out again. And you can see each of these mutants that are coming out are not exactly the same. The reason this happens is that, as I said before, these cells, this is non-lethal. And so these cells are actually growing from halfway in the center of the cell. They're just unable to expand. And so we can then take each of these. So, we can then take each of these first and we can perform whole genome sequencing to ask what's the cause of mutation. Of course, the child did this over several independent experimental steps. She screened through all the data, and one of the one I'll talk about, the key data I'll tell you about today, were mutations that happen in a gene called SDAC, the protein of which is depicted below. Now, SDAC, we found that it had all these mutations we found in black. The mutations we found in black were ones that destroyed the protein, and we found two that allowed for the protein to form, but was non-functional. This SDAC protein was nothing known in Purdue, so we turned to E. coli. And what we now know from E. coli is that it's an inner membrane serine transporter. It's a proton symporter. And so in other words, as serine and protons are coming into your paraplasm, SDAC is moving and actively transporting it into the center of the cell. Into the center of the cell, where it goes to central metabolism through the actions of serine deaminases. A chala showed this was a cause of mutation by introducing the lesions of SDAC into different backgrounds. And so to explain the graph here, on the y-axis is the swarm radius, the distance from the center of our noculum to the end of that swarm, that mature swarm. Each dot represents an individual experiment and the horizontal lines immediately. And the horizontal line is the median. Sorry, is the mean. On the x-axis, is each population. This is the wild type population that we've talked about several times, BB2000. And you can see it has a form radius that ranges depending on the experiment. The non-celf population we've talked about before, and again, it has restricted population expansion. What Achala did was that she genetically removed this gene. So she went in and cleaved it out of the chromosome. And when she does that in the non-self background, she is able. Non-self background, she is able to rescue my population expansion. And then, if she reintroduces that gene on the plasmid under either native or inducible control, this is the native control, we can see again that we have a restriction in population expansion. So simply the presence or absence of this STAC gene is enough to tell the population go out or not go out. Archala went on to further show that in fact it's not the serine transport. Not the serine transport capability, but in fact, it's how this protein interacts with the message. And so that data is summarized here. And on the y-axis, it's again form radius. You've seen the data from the in the red on the last graphic, where this is all in the delta, sorry, in the non-self background with the delta SDAC. If we don't have SDAC present, the cell is going to be able to expand. If you do have it present, it's restricted. If you do have it present, it's restricted. What she can do then is say that rather than having, rather than just looking at the wild type SJAC, she can make mutations in this protein and ask whether or not those mutations change population expansion. Now, just to clarify how SJAC works is that it works like a jumping jack. So, SJAC, when it's in open format and ready to receive serine, it'll have its arms open at the top and its legs closed at the bottom. But once the serine proton has not But once a serine proton has nestled into the center of the cell, it closes and that allows for the SDA, for the serine and the proton to come out. But that means that the domains in the paraplasm are closer together. And so we've depicted below each of these single point mutations what the orientation of that SDC transporter is. So there's a jumping jack one here, and these two mutations make it such that jumping jacks faster and has a bigger, and it can accept a whole bunch of other amino acids. And it can accept a whole bunch of other amino acids. This one locks it into an open format, so the domains are apart in the paraplasm, and the pink one closes it, so they're not. How you can read this graph is that the three, the green and the blue samples where the SDAC samples the open orientation for all of these three variants in this background, swarm expansion is constrained. But if you don't have But if you don't have expansion, if you have a closed orientation, the warm expansion is returned. And so, in other words, population expansion in this cell can be controlled simply by altering a single amino acid in this receptor. So we can toggle them from being cells that are able to expand widely and rapidly or cells that are constrained. And the molecular mechanism I show here, which is simply that the message is likely using this as Message is likely using this as a landing pad to allow for the message to be integrated into the population. But the takeaway I would like for this crowd is that with these genetic tools, we can tweak whether a cell is large or a cell is small. And the part that was most surprising to us in all of this was that these interactions, we thought then, as was just suggested in the talk, we thought these Suggested in the talk, we thought these interactions would clearly lead to difference in the local interactions. That these outputs, that if you don't have any migration, the cells will be in one state. If you have migration, there'll be another. And that's not what Atala saw. So one of the questions we have now in the lab is that how do we one go from local interactions to global outputs? So on the top, I should sorry, I shift left to other one. So on the top here, on So, on the top here, on the left is phase, and on the right is just SJC with an M cherry. And this is simply so you can see where the protein is. It's a way for us to localize the cells. So this is the wild type, and this is the mutant that opens and closes rapidly. Both of them give you a plate that look as immediately to the left here with the constrained migration. If we look at an actively moving swarm, so for example, out of the outer edge right here where the arrow is, you can see. Edge right here where the arrow is, you can see that there are differences in the single-cell interactions. However, you still see elongated cells. I can tell you that we still see motility, even though this is a fixed frame. While this population here at the bottom, where you can, which is this mutation that was closed, again, a single point mutation here, where you can get rapid expansion. Here we see that the cells again are elongated. And for us, one of the biggest differences. Elongated. And for us, one of the biggest differences we see is that it looks like there's more streaming, but we don't know how to measure that well. And so, again, we'd love some advice. The analysis of this data set, you can't tell a lot from static images and even from short movies. And not only that, the analysis requires dynamic spatiotemporal data. And so as we are gathering larger and larger movies of these streams, we need help in figuring out how to actually track individual lung cells, especially as they're Especially as they're interchanging between neighbors. Excuse me for a second. Okay, so in the last few minutes here, I want to switch to then how can we start going from local to global? And this is looking at population behaviors. And this is work from former postdoc Dr. Murray Chipping. And he asked the question of really what's different between Of really what's different between normal swarm expansion and decreased swarm expansion on the cellular level. And I'm going to summarize his data, all the molecular data as follows. What he found through RNA-seq as well as direct implementation was that if you are cells that are receiving information that you understand, you increase all the factors necessary for migrations, that's flagella, all the things necessary for. All the things necessary for flagella, etc. And you also increase your expected virulence factors, and that just keeps you going. However, if you're receiving messages you can't understand, and this is to be consistent pressure, meaning that you have to be constantly receiving it from your neighbors, we find that how the cells respond, not only is it that they're uptaking it through SDAC, but they're also increasing a signal alarm in bacteria called PPGPP. It doesn't really matter, but the point being is that this is a Really matter, but the point being is that this is a rapidly metabolized, metabolizable compound that allows the cells to go into a stringent-like state or state where they don't have to grow without dying. And so if you're receiving this message, you can't understand, you're turning on this alarm, and this causes the cells to basically start forming, moving into a biofilm-like state. So they start forming fimbriae, they start hunkering down, they meet a lot more polysaccharides, and they're able to survive over long distances. Survive over long distances, long periods under antibiotic pressure. And so for that, to show the antibiotic persistence is specific for self, what he did was that he harvested cells from a swarm, he let them grow, he hit them with huge amounts of ampicillins such that they should die off, and he measured survival over time. On the y-axis is the cell viability shown as CFUs per mill or coloniform units per mill. Shown as CFUs per mill or coloniform units per mill. And on the X axis is survival after hitting with lethal doses of ampicillin. In the boxes are the populations where every single cell is self. The X are populations where we've removed all identity factors. And in the magenta circles are populations where every single cell receives a message that's non-self. And what Murray found was that there's a 50-fold increase in survival for non-self. And so this ability. And so this ability, this switch into a stringent like lifestyle is helping to protect the cells from environmental threats. And this effect is only seen on surfaces. It's not seen when they're grown into stationary phase and liquid or the transport machinery is disabled or signals are removed. In other words, this is contextual. So when the cells are receiving a message, So, when the cells are receiving a message they understand under swarm conditions, that is when they induce this alarm signal and switch out of being in their happy, go lucky swarming stage and hunker down. And so there's a prediction that can come from this data. And it's simply that if you mix together then populations where half the population is able to engage in the social communication and understand their neighbors, and half the population can't, well, the population that can't engage in that social interaction. Population that can't engage in that social attraction are going to be left behind or at lower density. And so we can test this. And so we can mix together at a one-to-one ratio cells that are giving and receiving a signal they can understand. So we call it the self-population with cells that don't have any of this information. And so we call them noivinity. For purposes of ease of looking at individual cells, we only At individual self, we only label about 10% of the population, and they're labeled as follows: red is for the population that is self, and green is the non-self. I've shown you a complete plate at the below to show you where we're looking at the microscopy images, and the microscopy images are right above it. At the first swarm front, when they're first actively moving out, what we see is a one-to-one ratio approximately of the self-non-self population. By the time they have gone through one stopping stage and move to the next one, One stopping stage and move to the next one, we see fewer of those green cells. And by the end, by the third swim front, we see very few of them at all. We can calculate this data and measure it as a ratio of red of cells. And here I've just switched the colors just so the overlay is a little bit easier. Blue is the self-population. Orange is the non-self population. And here's three different readouts of the data. I want to remind you that on, so on the y-axis, it's the ratio of non-population. The y-axis is the ratio of non-self to self, and on the x-axis is time, but time is also space for Proteus. And so, in gray are the periods where they're actively migrating. In white, oh, I'm sorry, in white are the periods where they've stopped moving, which is depicted here. Migration, not migration. I think the first thing you should take away is that these periods are not, they are not synchronized in Proteus to our chagrin. So, we have to always do this data with this tracking each time. Nonetheless, what we find is that the ratio of the non-self. We find that the ratio of the non-self population is falling during the periods of where they've stopped and they're being winnowed away. So that the final geospatial spatial location is that the self-populations on the outer edges of the swarm where there's rich media, fresh media, and the non-self is constrained. This is not due to the fluorophores themselves. We find that if you have self-self populations, we see no loss there. No loss there. So, what's happening, and how is this happening? And so, to do this, we can do the same experiment, but now instead of using labeling every cell that's non-self as green, instead, what we do is that we have a reporter for when that alarm molecule is being turned on. And so when that alarm molecule is being turned on and they're saying, oh my goodness, I'm meaning non-self, when is that happening? Again, at a one-to-one ratio, where we start at them in the center and we look at them over time. And what we find is as follows. we find is as follows. In blacks, in the blue squares will be the mixed population I just told you about, and our control is going to be in orange. On the y-axis is the mean reporter intensity. So that's just when is there going to be cells turning green, and on the x-axis is time. And what we found is that these populations don't scream that they are around something different until they're in those periods where the cells have stopped. This is those same periods where we see the cell, the rapid drop. Same period where we see the cell, the rapid drop-off in participation in that social behavior. And so, what that tells us is that this response to non-self is transient, it's not happening all the time, and it's actually only happening during swimming stages. And so the matter of identity, that message that they don't receive, if we actually never let the cells stop and we just use, there are ways that we can cause them to make that population migration go, either genetically or experimentally. Genetically or experimentally, under those conditions, we never see winnowing. We only see winnowing in situations where the cells have to stop, divide, and re-enter into the developmental stage. And so what that tells us is that as Proteus is migrating out, when they're moving along one another, we now understand that that's when they're dropping off these packets of information. These packets of information, if they are received by a sibling, allow for the cells to re-engage like these blue cells back into. Engage like these blue cells back into the social behavior and elongation. But those non-self cells instead are told, no, no, no, no, no, something's wrong, stop. And that leads to an exclusion. So that can ask you, I hope that it allows you to also start thinking about what happens when you have error or mutations within a population. Are errors and mutations tolerated and allowed to go back into outward migration, or are they winnowed away as well? Okay, and so. Okay, and so I just want to end by why we think that this is really this kind of information is important. So this here is a light microscopy image taken at 40x. In gray is the nutrient background and the embossed is are the cells themselves. And we've speckled in self, all these cells are genetically identical except for 10% that are expressing green forest and protein. And the reason why we think that this identity recognition is important. This identity recognition is important to recollect the migration. Sorry, this is about 5X real time, and this was thinking by former graduate student, Dr. Martha Zavita-Rivera. Why reason we think that identity and recognition matters is that unlike in quorum sensing, where you can have a small molecule that is diffused away, for proteus, when they're doing their collective migration, it is on these rigid surfaces, hard arger, for example. And in those situations, a fairly diffusible signal. A fairly diffusible signal will probably diffuse rapidly away from the cells themselves. Instead, what's happening for these cells is that these interactions are dynamic over a time and space, and we don't see them making these beautiful kind of biofilm, large three-dimensional structures. We see that with this collective motility, really seems to be constrained to a two-dimensional style surface. And so, we are positing that as these cells are moving along. That as these cells are moving along, they're dropping off packets of information. And those packets of information are stored for later developmental choices. This dropping of information, we do not know whether or not it happens rapidly or slowly. And we also have very little understanding of how frequently they're exchanging this information amongst partner pairs or whether or not, and then. Or not, and then whether or not that exchange is dictating the size, for example, of these aligned rafts. One last thing I'll just say quickly while we're talking about population behaviors is that, you know, my favorite part about Proteus is that this is actually a filtering effect. The reason that we see that migration out, that population expansion, is because you're seeing the elongated cells, the cells that have been allowed to go into social behavior, they're the ones who filter to the. Behavior, they're the ones who filter to the outer edges. All the other cells are left behind, and that's like 80 to 90% of the population. It's again, it's only the cells that are developmentally in the social stage that get to engage in the social behavior. Okay, and so with that, I'm going to take any questions, any further questions. We are really interested in understanding how these bacteria integrate signals. We start, we do it both by genetic manipulations, even down to single nucleotides or single. Nucleotides or single residues inside the cells, all the way up to trying to understand them from a more macroscopic scale. Thank you. Okay, any questions? So again, if you're on Zoom, just unmute yourself and ask. No need to raise hands or anything. Thank you. Well, it doesn't sound like anyone's saying anything. May I say something again? Okay, again, I'm Alethea Barbara. Sorry, I'm also remote. But this is a really, really cool talk. I have a couple questions. The first one is, in the last video you showed, what was the difference between the green cells and the gray ones? So the green ones, sorry, in this video, the green ones just are making something called ones just are making something called green fats and protein constitutively, but otherwise they're identical. So everybody has all the same genetics. And we do that because, as you can see, especially when we're doing this is, I'm sorry, I just paid on my own microscopy. I apologize. But as you can see, one of the challenges we have is tracking individual cells because they change shape, right? They don't stay nice and rigid like most bodies. They like. And so the fluorescence allows us to track. Fluorescence allows us to track those individual cells, so we speckle them in. Okay, but they're not, it's not that one is genetically different from the other. No, yeah, exactly. Okay, and then I had a question about the, do you know what the reasoning would be, like why the cell would not want to would not want to do the expansion if it, you might have said it, but I missed it if you did. Why it might not want to expand if they're genetically different. Yeah, so let me clarify. So let me clarify first of all is that I don't know why things don't want to do what they do, right? Okay, but in all seriousness, so there are a couple of different things. One is that it has to do with disease. So a colleague of mine has done some polymic, has asked the question, what's necessary in Proteus for polymicrobial urinary tract infections, which is how they usually cause diseases mixed with other bacteria. Mixed with other bacteria. And they found that these genes were essential for that. So if you don't have these identity genes, you do not do well in trying to cause disease in a mouse. And that's, and I suspect that that's because these genes help with that collective migration. So it allows, it helps with this theme to go faster up. What's happened, and then the other part of the data extension is that the data in the field is that when you look at individuals, whether it's a dog or a human or whatever, you only find one genotype of proteas. Find one genotype of proteas. And so it tends to be a lone wolf, you know, tends to like to be by itself. However, that's not necessarily true in the environment. So we think that our best rationale for the two reasons why this happens is one is bet hedging. So not every cell in the population actually makes that message. Some don't. And so it's possible that, and you know, there are all sorts of genetic reasons why that might be the case, but for those cells that don't make the message, they're going to be the ones that are more resistant to. Going to be the ones that are more resistant to things like antibiotics, etc. And so, you have a certain percent of your population then that never engages in it and is kind of always sitting ready for some threat. In terms of mixed populations, we think that it actually has much more to do with combat, right? So, then when you have two different wild type strains, these aren't the only factors they have, they have other virulence factors. So, one of the ones that they co-regulate with this actually causes cells to die through killing. Cells to die through killing DNA. So you can imagine that if you slow down the foreign cell and then you hit it with something lethal and kill it at the same time, that might be more effective. But again, you know, I can, these are just examples to tell you. I don't think that any of the data strongly supports that it has to be one or the other. Okay. Okay. Well, very cool talk. Very cool talk. I have more to say, but I'll say it later. We can talk later. Later. We can talk later. Cool. Thank you very much. Thank you. So, I have a couple of questions for the same movie. So, first of all, like maybe I'm fooling myself, but it looks like it's much less than 10% of cells outside of it that are labeled. Is it because they grow slowly with GFP, or what's the reason? Yes, there's definitely a fitness problem with GFP. So, if you have brain-fortunate protein on the cells, Protein on the cells, they'll grow, but there's a fitness defect. Okay, so my second question is: again, I might be fooling myself, but it looks like cells move much better when they're in contact with other cells as compared when they're on their own. So is that real and do you understand the mechanism for that? That is 100% real. And that is one of the big questions in the field. That is one of the big questions in the field. We don't, people don't understand. I can, the best model that we've seen is that when they are aligned, the flagella can form kind of large ropes. And so there's this beautiful, they're beautiful EMs that Colin Hughes' group has made from the UK and was scanning electron microscopy. And if you haven't looked at them, I highly recommend everyone go and look at them immediately. They basically looked at rafts of Pertius and the flagella are bound. And the flagella are bound in the same heel, in the same pitch across the bodies. It's just gorgeous. And so, you know, he argued that it was the force of those bundled flagella. It's a little, you know, one of the places where this falls apart is that I don't know if you see it in the movie yourself, but I can often see cells go in one direction and they spin off the other, or they'll go in opposite directions of each other. And so that makes the, we don't understand that part that, you know, that's the one little flying ointment. You know, that's the one little flying ointment of those beautiful rats. Is it possible for you to like take down those mobile cells, mix them at relative low density, and watch how those drafts, how like from people from single cells to small groups and how they sort of aggregate in there? Is it possible if you have moments like that? Right. So we can't do it with small groups. And we have tried a huge amount of microphoidics with abject failure. Abject failure. So, what we can do though is that. So, what you're seeing here right now is the very edge of the, so on the bottom left-hand side, that arc you see, that's the edge of the noculum. And so, if you take cells that are coming from liquid, they need about three to four hours of developmental change before they'll elongate. And that's because they're switching the developmental pattern. But once they've done that, we can then see from the edge of the population, especially we can start. Population, especially we can start seeing cells emerge. And so, especially situations like this, where we have some of the cells in green, the best that we can do is we can see the green cells kind of get longer and then watch them go out. But we don't have a good way, the class experiment that you're talking about, we don't have a good way of doing that. Thank you. Any more questions? If not, let's thank all the speakers for this. For the in person, you guys can go get your coffee as well. We'll be in 10:50. So try to keep it on schedule so you'll have a little bit of a shorter break.
