From the University of Minnesota. And he's going to talk about Maury Materials from Palming of Mari Skills. Okay, so first of all, thanks very much to the organizers, especially Vincent. And yeah, it's been really lovely to be at this meeting. Okay, so let me next just turn to the various collaborations that I've had. I just want to pay tributes to these people. So we have first Victorian. Tribute to these people. So we have Shabbat Tron and Daniel Asset at LSU, and then this is our group at Minnesota Center, which you can see is clearly significant. Okay, so let's just sort of remind ourselves why we're here. Okay, so we're interested in these Moiray materials, these stats Jude materials with small insulated twists, and they have these sort of interesting properties that they're sort of generically HP. That they're sort of generically abryotic, which gives them interesting ergodic properties. They also have this approximate crystal structure over the large-scale Moray pattern, which allows us to think of them as crystals with a large unit cell. Okay, so this is sort of cute, but actually what's really exciting is that these systems realize a lot of very interesting physical phenomena. Interesting physical phenomena, and there's sort of this hope that we can maybe use these materials as platforms to gain some insight into some very deep physics. Okay, so I want to sort of situate the work that I'm doing relative to the broader fields and these broader goals. So I just say, okay, so this talk is just about understanding single electron models. Single electron models. And why do we care to do this? It's because we really want to go towards accurate models and computations of these many body properties, which are, I think we agree, are the most interesting properties of these materials. Okay, so I'm just going to talk about two things in this talk. So the first thing is about mechanical properties of Moirian materials. So here I'm going to present on a new I'm going to present on a new formulation of the relaxation problem, and the idea is to, you know, this is the starting point to go towards phonons and electron phonon coupling and these kinds of things. And then the other thing I'm going to tell you about is sort of a perspective on these Moira-scale continuum electronic models. And so, I mean, this originally started just from, you know. I mean, this originally started just from asking the question: how can you take this aperiodic atomic scale system and somehow converge to a model which is actually periodic, even for incremental twist angles? And yeah, so we sort of developed a perspective on this, which is sort of a mathematical modeling perspective in terms of the system being in a particular parameter regime. And this allowed us to maybe clarify. And this allowed us to maybe clarify the range of validity of these approximations. But now, what we're really interested in doing is really pushing on and developing a systematic framework for improving and correcting these models. All right, so let me talk about this mechanical problem. Okay, so we know that when you have a twisted biolay, When you have a twisted bi-layer, the atoms in each layer start to feel some interaction with the atoms in the other layer, and they want to move into a more energetically favorable configuration. We know that this affects the atomic structure, and then, in fact, also the electronic properties. Okay, so I'm going to talk about, as I said before, a new formulation of this relaxation problem, which in a sense is exact. Is exact in a way that some other formulations, well, I would say the common formulation is not. Now, okay, so the sort of idea is that there are these works of Cashino and works from the Caxiris group. And this is a mathematical work studying sort of the same model as this Caxiris group model. Zeros group model. And I'm just going to point out that actually there's a bit of a difference between our formulation and the previous formulation. And I don't want to suggest, I'm not trying to sort of criticize the previous formulation, I think it's very, very sensible and obviously describes a lot, but I just want to point out that I think in some sense this new formulation is more is potentially better, let's just put it that way. Is potentially better, let's just put it that way. Okay. Alright, so what are we doing? So we're going to consider atoms in some material. Okay, so what are the positions of the atoms? Well, you know, they're just given by your Brave laces vector R plus tau. This is your shift for the sub-lasses. And then you're going to allow each atom to move according to a displacement function which we call upper. We call URL. And of course, this depends on the cell, depends on the sub-lasses. So somehow these are your atoms before you've allowed them to move. And they're moving according to some vector attached to each atom. So this is your UI. Now, you first look at this and you think, okay, how can you even do anything? Of course, maybe you make some big supercell, you have thousands of atoms and so on, you do something direct. Something direct. But okay, what we're interested in is trying to get to a convenient and compact expression for this mechanical energy. And the idea is that then you have something where you can obviously minimize over the U's, and then that will be your relaxed configuration, and then you want to expand that energy and powers of U to get to model photons and so on. Okay. Okay, so this is the model. Okay. So we work with an energy density. All this means is we're summing up site potentials for... Okay, so think of, okay, so this BR, this is a ball. So we're fixing some part of our system with radius r, and we're going to Radius r, and we're going to sum up these site energies for all the sites within the ball, and then we're going to divide by the volume of the ball. So this is why it's an energy density. What is the size energy? Okay, so we're just taking a totally general interatomic potential. So what is the input to the interatomic potential? It is literally just, right, so these are the positions, right, R plus UI and R. Positions, right? R plus ui r. It's literally taking as input the vectors between every pair of atoms in their relaxed configuration. In a sense, it's really exact. Now, of course, you need access to some intratonic potential. Okay, this is an assumption. But if you assume you have a good intratonic potential, this is exact. Okay, so. Okay, so then, so the idea is we're going to take this limit. Now, if I had, okay, let me make a comment on this. So, of course, if I have a periodic system, this limit just converges to some energy on a unit cell, right? What's interesting, and you may say, okay, I mean, it's just a bilateral system. Let's just take a supercell. I have a periodic system. Okay, this will converge to the integral of the supercell. But of course, you don't actually have to do that. So there's this. So, there's this mathematical result which actually allows you to pass to this limit even when you have an incommensurate twist angle. Now, I just want to comment. So, you could say, well, okay, supercell calculations, we think they're fine. But actually, there's another advantage to this, which is that even if you're not sort of specifically interested in getting incommensurate angles, the parametrization that you end up with is very compact and it's independent of the twist angle. So, you know, there may be some. The twist angle. So, you know, there may be some range of angles where the supercell is huge. And this is, you know, my point is just that I think the formulation is quite nice, even if you don't specifically care about the problem of computing at incommensurate to assignments. So, okay, so is the energy clear? So basically you're just trying to calculate a local property. Just trying to calculate a local property in an unbounded system. Yeah, exactly. Rather than bounding it. Yeah. Exactly. Sum over I and sum over the other atoms? So I, this is sum over layers. And this is sum over sites within a pool. Like the atoms will interact with all the other atoms. Oh. Yeah, oh ah, okay, no, yeah, yeah, okay. That's that's a very good that's a really good clarification clarification. Okay, I have two glayers. Clarification. I have two layers. Here I'm just looking at the inter energy between the layers. But I can do the same thing just for intro layer. And what I'm doing is I'm taking a ball, and actually the ball is only in one layer. So the site energy of each site in layer one is knowing about all of the positions in layer two. And then I'm taking an average of that over layer one. So call that the interlayer energy from the point of view of layer one. Insulator energy from the point of view of layer one, there's also an insulator energy from the point of view of layer two. That's why there's a one-half. That's why there's a one-half. Thank you. And sorry, and you assume these facebooks drawers and why is you? That's exactly right, yeah. That's right. Yeah, otherwise this labeling becomes problematic. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Alright. So then, okay, so what are we So then, okay, so what do we do? So, I want to emphasize, right? So, I'm presenting a theorem here. I'm presenting the simple version of the theorem. So, alright, so assume that the layers are incommensurate, and I'm going to assume further that these displacements can be expressed through some continuous functions ui, which live on the Maury unit cell, such that the atomic displacements are just given by evaluating these continuous functions. By evaluating these continuous functions at the dist registry of those atomic sites, maps back to the Moirai cell. Now, why is this a simple version? It's a simple version because actually you don't quite need to assume continuity. There's a way you can do this in a weaker function space. But actually, I don't want to emphasize this part because actually the energy we get to, even without all these technical aspects, is already new. Is already new. Okay, so I want to emphasize that. Okay, and then the point is: okay, once you get to this point, so now there are these well-known results in mathematics, okay, it's this thing called the Bokov theorem. So, okay, so I'm listing, okay, so of course this is a very well-known thing in special theory, but I'm just listing some names of people who have applied this specifically to bilayer materials. And okay, so you apply this, and it just tells you that this limit of taking these balls, the radius to infinity, actually converges, and it gives you an integral of something over a Mohr A cell. Some, and this is what I mean, right? This is our compact energy. And of course, we have explicit formulas for these, so I'm not showing them right now. Not showing them right now. Okay, now what is this good for? Well, okay, so now you can take your energy, you make some kind of, okay, so it's important to emphasize, we pass to the limit without making any kind of Cauchy-Born approximation, actually. But of course, once you do, then you get this nice energy, which you can just solve. You end up when you look at the oil. End up when you look at the Euler-Lagrange equations, you just have an ellipsic PDE. So you can compute the minimizers in a quite straightforward way. I want to take a moment to just compare in a bit more detail how does this energy differ from the energy which people mostly use, which as far as I know, goes back to this Kushino paper. So the idea is you're going to integrate over a Mori cell and you're going to integrate this energy which is given by what's called the GSFE, the generalized stacking fault energy. And how does this work? You evaluate this energy at some basically some interpolation positions of the atoms on the other layer. So essentially what you're saying. So essentially what you're assuming is that the energy does not know about the actual positions of the atoms. The energy is only interaction through the disregistry, which is a totally continuum object. Now, how is our energy different? What we have here is actually it's an energy that still knows about the positions of the atoms. It's sort of morally the idea. So we get to an integral. So we get to an integral of the mower A, but in a sense, the energy is still knowing about the positions of atoms. So yeah, so to characterize the different approaches, so on one hand, we have an energy where the layers are interacting through an interpolated distrogistry, and on on the other side, we we have an interaction through a uh interotoid potential uh evaluated at the sequence of all uh interotoic displacements. Its rhetoric display sets. Just a comment: this is a wonderful approach because this GSFE is something you can calculate based on DFT and so on. And our approach requires an instrumental potential, so there's advantages and disadvantages. Now so i i if I just look at these two energies, these look very different, okay. These look very different. And we sort of stared at this for a while and we tried to think: okay, we really want to give some simple take-home message about how these energies look different. So we just said, okay, what is the GSFE? The GSFE is something which is periodic with respect to the other layer. So let's just introduce some function v and just cook up a periodic potential with respect to the other layer. And then let's do sort of the same thing for our interatomic potential. For our interatomic potential, let's cook up a simple inter-atomic potential, which is just going to be a sum of pairwise interactions. So now we've got everything down to this one function v. Then let's plug this into both of these energies and see what we get. It's actually interesting. So you see that once you do some manipulations, you end up with the conclusion that these two energies differ only. differ only in where the displacement function is evaluated in the other layer. Just this, instead of, so you can see here, right, so you have a1x plus u1 a1 of x, sort of a position of something in layer 1, you have a2x plus u2. So you can sort of see that, you know, this should be a2 of x, right? You should be evaluating the energy of the twisted and relaxed location. Of the twisted and relaxed location, like this. And this energy, when you go through it, it's actually evaluated in a different place. By the way, these A1 and A2, these are just the matrices whose columns are the last factors in the different layers. Any questions about that? By the way, there's a question of if these things are actually equal, perhaps in some limits. If the twist angle is going to zero, A1 is approximately A2. So you would think these things would converge. Actually, we believe that they don't. And the reason is that you also have your MORA is expanding at the same rate. So this is something we thought about a lot. And yeah, we're actually not able to show that these things converge. So, like, converged means are. Okay, so what you might hope is that you have these two energies and they depend on a parameter which is the twist angle. And as the twist angle goes to zero, they actually coincide. And we don't see that actually. So it remains to do numerical computations and see how. And see how this makes a difference, but just as a. Yeah, they don't seem to exactly agree. Go ahead. So, from a physics point of view, you can think of this interlayer energy as some van der Baals, you know, you can look at like induced dipole, induced dipole interactions and integrate over both of the layers. And that's, you know, how it's calculated from DFT. So, like, do you think both of these energies are the same physical origin and are just defined technically? Margin and just defined technically differently, or what's the difference from a physics? That's a good question. I don't have a great answer, except that, yeah, presumably they should describe similar physics, but I think just there's somehow more degrees of freedom in the instrotypes. Yeah, maybe we can talk about it later. That would be great. But that orange one is not symmetric or layer one. Symmetry for layer one and layer two? Expression. Ah, two with reflection, A1, like a layer of layer. Yeah, well, yeah, yeah. So there will be two interlayer energies. There will be this plus the other one with A1, one switched to A2. It's like the energy felt by atoms on layer one because of layer two, and vice versa. So so the full energy will be symmetric. I'm just saying this this term will not symmetry. This turns out that much time. Okay. So um uh all right so this this is the end of uh talking about relaxation. So Talking about relaxation, so please any questions, we're all moving on. Let me ask you a question on the minimization of the functional. Right. You say it's elliptic, I'm not sure what sense, but if you have a functional with some kind of convexity somewhere that tells you that you want it, that's what you mean by ellipticity. Yeah, yeah. Some kind of convexity somewhere that is a unique solution. Yes, exactly. Because there's no gradient, I'm not sure I understand where you're just. I'm not sure I understand what you're just going from. Well, it's just coming from. Okay, so once you do this, morally, this is grad U. It's after you've passed to some kind of limit of the gradient, then I guess the potential matters. You don't have uniqueness of the solution for any kind of inter fee interconnect on the arbitrary function. No, that's why I'm asking. No, this is just. You assume that your potential is sufficiently complex that is easy to get. Yeah, yeah. What practice can you do without the Oshibora automation? I'm really glad you asked that. So, so yeah, so you can imagine, yeah, okay, so can you just minimize this, right? And I mean, essentially, yeah, okay, so then you need to develop some kind of existence and uniqueness theory minimizing this energy functional, and okay, so we don't. Energy functional, and okay, so we don't know how to do that. It's not like a standard thing. I, you know, I don't believe it's a standard thing, but it's interesting who asked the question, right? Okay. So let me move on. Okay, so something that I've been quite interested in is the systematic derivation and Systematic derivation and clear kind of understanding of the range of validity of these so-called Mari-scale reductions. So it's just a basic question. Okay, you can start from some twisted byless system, take any kind of model, but the simplest model is a tight-binding model. How can this thing, which is, in principle, for an incremental irrational twist angle, is not periodic, how can this thing converge in some sense to something periodic? Something periodic and periodic. And okay, so we have this paper here, which is a rigorous analysis of the error in passing between the models. And I'll just take a little bit of time to recap this result. We also have this result, which is a numerical verification of this result. And then I'm going to talk a little bit about how things generalize when you want to include. How things generalize when you want to include higher-order corrections and relaxation and so on. Okay, so here, this is the setup for our first results. And here, we just wanted to make things as simple as possible. Actually, these assumptions are not really necessary. But, okay, so we take our twisted bilayer Hamiltonian, we just take nearest needle hopping within each layer, and then for the interlayer terms, we take. For the interlayer terms, we just have a two-sensory approximation. Hopping amplitudes just depend on the distance. And you can sort of imagine, okay, this is a model, you non-dimensionalize it, you end up with dimensionless parameters. You have the ratio of the insulator Hawking energy, which I'm going to call h, and you have the twist angle. You can ask about the properties of this model as you vary the. The properties of this model as you vary these parameters. Then you need one more ingredient, which is you need to know that you're looking near to the direct points. So again, we're just trying to study the simplest setting. So we just look at the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, and we pick an initial condition which is very peaked around the direct point. And this creates another parameter. Another parameter which we call epsilon. It's just the width of the wave packet in momentum space. Now, of course, we all know if you have something concentrated in momentum space, it's going to be spread in real space, like this. And the scale over which it spreads is, of course, one over epsilon. So this is, yeah, so you now have three parameters, right? You have your insulator hopping, you have your twist angle, and you have the spread of. Angle and you have the spread of your wave packet. Sorry, what I mean is the wavelength of your wave is like one, but the scale of decay of the envelope function of the wave packet is like one over epsilon. Do is we just say, okay, let's so, right, so this side T up here, this is the solution of the type line. Side C up here, this is the solution of the type binding model. And now we're going to propose a solution of the type binding model, which is going to be this, where F only knows about this continuum approximation. So we're just starting with a wave packet and only allowing the wave packet envelope to evolve according to continuum model. And then the rest of this side BM, this lives in the same space as the solution of the Spaces the solution of the original type binding model with the same initial condition, and we can bound the error between these two L2 functions as a function of these various parameters. So you've got the wave factor width, you've got the twist angle, you've got your insulator hopping. Do this, of course, there's going to be different error terms. These are the things that you neglect when you pass to the continuum model. So, first of all, you make a linear approximation of dispersion. This creates error, which is like epsilon squared. So, by the way, so in physics, I know this is called the gradient expansion, right? Or k dot p. And you're going to drop these higher decision, you're going to drop. So, the other thing that happens is you drop the longer range. Thing that happens is you drop the longer-range momentum space hopping, and you also make what's called the local approximation, where you essentially only keep the leading term when you turre expand k in the interlayer hopping. And the remarkable thing is that there's kind of an obvious parameter regime where all of these errors balance. It's when the interlayer hopping is like the wave packet spread parameter. Spread it parameter. In that case, you sort of optimize the error and you see that there's convergence as epsilon goes to zero. Okay, so we say that we sort of established the regime of validity where this model is accurate. And actually, I should say, so this is another very important condition. You sort of think of this as the wavepacket envelope is assessing spatial spread. We want to balance this with the more simple. Simple way to think about why you need this. Okay, so this is, yeah, so let me contribute to this, obviously, a very nice approach by Eric and so on to get to the same model. Okay, I want to make a quick comment. So you may ask, okay, why on earth are we just studying this type binding model? The reason is that actually there are Reason is that actually there are some very excellent type binding models produced by the Caxiris group, specifically for twistophyle graphene. Okay, so we didn't actually implement this, but the point is that there is some good reason to study type binding models. Of course, yeah, there's some limitation here, which I'm not denying, but I also want to sort of stand up for why type binding is sort of an acceptable approximation to call it. All right. This is about numerical just checking numerically if this theory holds. Yeah, please. Just a comment. The epsilon squared time is great, but time of order one are not important. What's important is times of order one over epsilon. Yes, that's right. Because that's when that's the really that's really the time scale in which anything happens. That's right. Yeah, so this is this. I completely agree. Right. No, I completely agree. Yeah, so you so you have convergence over time scales up to two minus delta, right? One over two minus. Yeah, but the yeah, that time scale is t over epsilon. At time t nothing happens. You don't see anything propagate. They just propagate by three three atomic uh layers. That's uh what you have to wait for at time one over epsilon before you see anything. But that's precise enough to capture the times itself. Size enough to capture that for the second. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, right. If you just did epsilon t, this is nothing useful. That's right. If you had epsilon t, that would be useless. Okay. All right. I don't want to focus on this. Okay. So what I've shown so far is somehow a different perspective on things that are sort of known. But I think that. But I think that I'm hoping that we sort of use this as a point of entry to really start producing the best possible continuum models that you can have. We believe that the way that we think about these models will allow for really systematic, including corrections and so on, into these continuum models. Okay, so what are the things you would like to do? You would like to include all To do, you would like to include all higher order and relaxation corrections, you'd like to generalize to other materials. And I'll just mention that actually, you know, so we have this waypacker result, but this is not, you know, we can also go further than that. Okay. So let me just make a comment. So, all right. So this BM model, where it comes from, is basically we have an expansion of our model and we're keeping the order epsilon terms. Order epsilon terms. If you balance the order of epsilon terms, it gives you a VM model. Now, you can ask, okay, so what are the error terms? What do they look like? And as I showed before, all of the errors balance. They're all like epsilon squared. And you may sort of think, like, oh, maybe this is some property of this model, right? You can always expand it in powers of epsilon. That's actually not quite true. So some of the errors, they will always go into powers of epsilon. Of epsilon, but this error term where you truncate the momentum space stops, this does not follow the same pattern. You end up with these error terms which do not have an integer power of epsilon. So basically, the reason is that, okay, if you look in the reciprocal, the Mari reciprocal, you look at the Mara. Look at the Moira reciprocal massive space. The amplitudes of the hopping depend on the distance from the origin to the given k-point. And okay, so the nearest neighbor k-point is actually one half the distance to the next nearest neighbor. But actually, if you go to the next nearest neighbor, this is root seven, and this is why this so this perspective actually doesn't generalize to higher higher powers of absolute. Higher powers of epsilon. But that's okay. It just means that when you go to higher order, you just have to sum over all the momentum hops. But if you do that, you can still systematically expand your model and get sort of higher order BM models to any order. And I just want to comment: when I was first sort of thinking about this, I was wondering, maybe, as you calculate these corrections, you see sort of You see, sort of corrections coming from if the twist angle is commensurate or incommensurate, but we don't see that. We believe that the expansions to all order are more A period. Okay, how do you incorporate realization? So, this is just a matter of modifying your matrix elements. So, you know, you take some hopping function which depends on the distance. Now, it's not going to only depend on the distance, it's going to depend on. On the distance, it's going to depend on distance, but with this correction from the relaxation, and okay, so again, you know, this is sort of an old story, but we know that actually this relaxation really does affect the insulator hopping. It really enhances the AB hopping compared to AA hopping. And okay, so there are, right, so there's terms which are arising just from keeping corrections in the type binding model, but there's also these. Type binding model, but there's also these terms which come from relaxation, they look a little bit different. But fundamentally, these can all be systematically included, and you keep Moirier periodicity. And okay, so what we'd really like to do is we'd really like to develop an analytical understanding of how the relaxation affects things like the regularity of the Hawking functions and so on. So that's ongoing, but the point that we're at now, But the point that we're at now is there are these very strong papers where developing these high-order continuum models. We believe that we've caught up, right? We understand everything that's going on with the new models, and so now we're in a position to hopefully do something new with all of this. Okay, so I'm maybe. This is just a comment that by playing around with relaxation, we can realize these sort of known results, which is that when you add relaxation, the bands of the DN model get flatter. Okay, let me add one. So okay, so you know something you might you might like to do is is ask, okay, so we have this very nice continuum model for graphene and so on. Continuum model for graphene and so on, but maybe there are other materials where you can have integer continuum models. And this is something I've been looking at with Solomon, and we think the sort of, so both in terms of the application, just like, okay, just writing down an interesting model, but also in terms of the mathematical analysis and modeling, parameter regimes and perspective. It's also interesting. You get interesting you get you get models which where certain terms are oscillatory due to the due to the these these gaps being opened up term okay ah this is last last thing so I want to just comment that actually so we have this route to the these continuum models through dynamics through wave packets that actually there's some There's some already some old brothers of the old technology that can also do this. So, this is this very nice paper from 2018. It's about how you, I mean, actually it's exactly what Daniel just talked about, in fact. It's about how you can calculate density of states. So, this is just for tight binding models, but basically by sort of restricting to some energy window and controlling the error. And yeah, so then this is the other. So this is the updated version with relaxation. And so we have some work on how to, in this formulation, in particular you're looking at the density of states, you're not looking at dynamics, also make the same approximations and converge to the VM model in this formulation. Okay, so I'll just stop here and just say, okay, so this is what I've And just okay, so this is what I've just to remind you what I've what I've talked about, and just to mention some other interests of mine that I didn't have time to talk about. Okay, so I'll stop here. Thanks. Thank you. Go back to the slide with the hopping, like the 2D plot. Yeah, this one. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, what? So, what? This is a momentum space. Okay, so think of it this way, right? So, you have a hopping function from, let's say, sublassis A, like an A site to a B site, or an A site on there, too, right? So you have, so think about you have like a matrix of functions, right? AA, A, B, B, A. So, this is showing H A A, and it's showing it in the Fourier domain. Oh, okay. So, so think of So think of, you know, so in real space you have something decaying, and in moments of space you also have something decaying. Of course, the decay rate relates to the regularity of the function in real space. So what's happening is when you have relaxation, decrease the regularity of the copy function. So your fruition becomes much more spread. And the other thing that happens is, so this is consistent with the AB regions expanding. AB regions expanding, AA regions contracting. You also see the magnitude is much bigger in the AB popping. Yellow, this is red. This is showing that it's becoming more, also more diffuse in real space too. Yeah, so when I said we want... No, no, no, this is only the free transfer. Both free transfer. Go ahead. Just for fun, do you have a number for the ratio? For the ratio, because that number usually matters a lot. Of course, yeah, of course. So, oh gosh. I mean, it'll be in this paper. It's in progress, right? Sorry, well, well, no, okay, so I should say, I mean, these conversations would have been done a few years ago. Yeah. Just of this. And this paper is. Yeah, so I guess these come. I think these comes. Those pictures in that paper. But these computations were done by Stephen earlier, right? They were done by Stephen for this paper. And what is being plotted exactly? So this is, you know, Sanders H, certain hopping parameters in the type binding model starting from a type binding model.
