Let me follow the quite rapid and start saying something about mathematical general relativity. Maybe some of you know the topic better than me, so I will say something I learned it last month. And mathematical general relativity tried to study the solution last time to the equation. And that is the space-time that moved by gravitational. More by gravitational system through the solution of this equation involving the curvature of the metric, the grain of the metric. And we know by the work of Chuqui-Bois that this system of PDEs can be interpreted as initial value program for a partial differential system. And the initial data set is a triple MGK. MG is our money management. MK is the second fundamental form of The second fundamental form of my starting manifold inside the rich space-time. These two tensors are not cannot be chosen freely. The reason is that they are constrained by projecting the isotope equation onto the initial data set. And the constraints again are in some sense physical. They determine that they are an expression of the energy density and the momentum density. Okay, a condition we can we always assume is that the some sense we have this we have a counterpart of the Newtonian requirement to have the negative energy density and this is called dominant energy condition and to simplify this setting I can assume that my space is time-symmetric which means that the set Is time symmetric, which means that the central fundamental force is zero. This gives some simplification. For example, apparatorizations are minimal surfaces, and we know many stuff about surfaces. Moreover, the energy density becomes equal to the spar curvature, and the momentum density is equal to zero, so dominant energy condition simply becomes non-negative spar. Okay, another requirement we can impose is that my system is isolated. Is that my system is isolated, and this means that at infinity, at large distances, we don't have too many gravitational inputs. The case where we don't have any gravitational influence is the flat case, so in some sense, being isolated means that your space is asymptotically flat. What is asymptotically flat? Well, in asymptotically flat space, In a compact, everything would happen, you can have some topology. But as soon as you cut out the compact set, you became the formula tree minus both, and the metric converges to the flat metric with a given order of distribution and an even spring. That depends on cadence. Just an example to explain the notation. The case C11 asymptotically flat means that the metric converted to the metric is controlled by x to the power of minus 1, and the derivative of the metric is controlled by x to the power minus 1. So every time you add an order of derivative, you must add one order of speed. Speed. Okay, so my setting will be the following. I have an isyptoclat space with a negative scalar curvature and with a boundary which is connected uttermost and minimal. Ultimate means that there are no other minimal surfaces closing my boundary. And the first question is, are there any examples where these conditions are not trivial? And the answer is yes. And this will be the model's mix. And this will be the model's mix. Sparsis solution is a one-parameter class of manifold that depends on the quantity M, which is a non-negative quantity, and the space is diphomorphic to a three-man all of radius to M, and the metric is of a flat. And the more the bigger is M, the more the space is squared. This space is color flat, is a scar flat asymptotically. It's a scalar flat, asymptotically flat, and it has minimal outermost boundary. The quantity M is as a well-known physical meaning that is the mass of the black hole whose horizon is, whose boundary is the bar beyond. And in this case, you have one interplay between physical quantity and the geometry of the space, the sense that the mass depends on the radius of the space. Depends on the radius of R. Okay, so here we have a notion of mass. So, in general, we would like to have a general notion of total mass of my gravitational system. So, how can I introduce it? And the idea is the following. For example, you can imagine to integrate the the energy density and energy density. I think that integrating it integrating it, you gain the total mass. You gain the total mass. And in the case of MC match, we have equivalent to integrate the scalar curvature, but this is not a good choice. And the reason is that there are some physical meanings missing. For example, you don't have superposition principle. The reason is that why it's not present that the scar curvature is not linear, linearly depending on. So what I can do, I can assume that I'm close. I can do. I can assume that I'm close to the flat space and then I can linearize my operator near the delta. And so if I pass into coordinates, I gain a divergent operator on which I can apply divergent theorem and I gain definition of the ideas. This was defined after Arnold Desert Misner in 1961. And well, it's true, it's the definition. It's true, is the definition, but here I'll cheat it. The reason is that I say I can pass into coordinates, and this is not always the case, in the sense that the limit will depend on the coordinate I choose. And while this doesn't happen when we have enough hydrogen factor condition, and if the space is a one tau greater than one half, Greater than one half, my the the paddy and mass is a well-known metric. So I can use I can use as a notion of total mass of the space. Well, first question is this mass non-negative. I expect that it must be negative, but here I integrated the scalar curvature in the very beginning, but then I did some computation. Then I do some competition, so it is not clear whether this quantity is negative. And the answer was given by Shene-Yao in 1979. They proved that under further asymptotic conditions, we can show that the mass is not negative and it's zero if and only if we are. There were many other contributions. Theorem 7. Of course, in many books by Lee, and recently, there are two books by Verikazaras Puli and Ster and Agustini Mazzio Ronzio that use in some sense lead harmonic functions. So, in some sense, potential theory is coming out naturally from style, mathematical level. Okay, but in general, we But in but in general we can say something. For example, if we are in a smart place, the mass, the anti-mass is equivalent to the mass of the of your black hole. And so we would expect that in general, if you have a black hole, if you have a boundary, if you have on your manifold, the total mass is at least the mass of the black. And this is a well-known. This is a well-known inequality called the Panama case. And it was true for this version by Wisconsin-Mannen that for C-1 symptomically flat Riemannian manifold with a lower bound also on the rich equal to tensor that vanishes at infinity, they prove that the Riemannian variation equality. The Riemannian paris inequality is true, and the equality, this equality holds if and only if the space is part. Also, this equality has other contributions by Bray took the theorem for varieties, and this group was extended dimension up to seven by Bray Lee. And recently, it appears this new group by. Previous this new book by Agustiniani Mantegani Samurai that uses nonlinear potential. So that's where nonlinear potential theory comes in play first. Okay, but I will by now I will now show you how whiskey man improves. Assuming everything is smooth, everything works well, the idea is the following. The idea is the following: you can take your starting set, you can evolve it using inverse micromorphic flow, which is a family of micromorphisms evolving with this law here, where the flow is expanding and the velocity of the flow is portion of the now. You can consider the Okin mass, which is this one here. Why consider this mass? It's simple. For example, at the very beginning, on your boundary, since the boundary is minimal, the Okimas of the boundary is exactly the left-hand side in the quality. But adding this deficit in parentheses gives you some other two properties, other two properties. The first one is that First one is that the Oki mass is monopolon decreasing along the flow. The reason is simple. You can compute the derivative of the Okik mass, and what you get is a term which is non-negative by Gauss for the theorem, and another one that involves the straight-second fundamental force, the scalar curvature, which is non-negative by assumption, and the tangential derivative of the mean. Tangential derivative of the mean curvature, and these are negative. So the derivative is non-negative, and the quality is more negative. The other important property is that, since we have this best sheet here, you can control the asymptotic behavior of the Okinbus using the asthmatic assumption G by the APM bus. The APMOS. And so putting those together, you get that every boundary is controlled by the APMOS. But there is some problem. The reason is that we are using different morphisms, and in general, differ morphism would develop similarities, and so we cannot compute them testing. A way to look from this problem is the following: instead of considering geometric evolution, Geometric evolution, you consider lettuce. So you take the function depth w from m to r such that this the zero level of this function is exactly the starting level set of and flow and then you evolve it by simply taking the sample levels and you define the voltage surface as the boundary box. Now what you what should Now, what you lose is the control on the regulatic surfaces and the topic surfaces, but you gain something which survives those surfaces. Well, but you want potential, you want something that which, for example, the Yoki masses decreasing, so you have to assume something more on the function W. So, in some sense, you have to choose the function w in a smart way. And so left equals end with Mark Wayne function. And so new linear potential theory and equal string potential theory. So on one side of the looking glass, we have the linear potential theory. For simplicity, I will assume B less frequent than 2. And on the other side, we have the increase in incursion. The level is the theory, the potential. The potentials are solutions to this partial differential equation. And instead, on the other side, we have the one Laplacian equal to the gradient. So the boundary include conditions are the same. In the case of the inflation flow, since the Walla flash is exactly the big curve actually, you see that. You see that this actually works the way detected by the inverse flow, in the sense that the inverse of the speed, which is the gradient, is proportional to the inverse. Okay, there are some similarities and something different. Let me show you cause and cause of the flows. First of all, peak potentials are in some way easier to Some way easier to find in the sense that their solution to a partial inflection could be a classical sense. For example, if you take the exponential of the function, you get something which is pure model. Conversely, if you take the evolutionary fluid solution, it's intended that no star that manifests has flown by mixed by this. By this. Okay, something about regularity. We are more functional and we are more regular than it is. They are C1 beta everywhere, and they are still away from the physical set. And we have also some control on the second derivative, in the sense that the ingredient is in some somewhat space. So potential are way more easy on on the On the linear potential theory, then in the equation flow resolutions. Okay, on the other side, we have some better regularity for the letter set of which investigators flow that in general are C11 and they minimize the pilot and more concept of take them, while p potentials are only almost the sense that. In the sense that the gradient can vanish only on a set which is negative for the 12. But they also have some similarity. As I said before, if you consider these two energies, the p-capacity, which is the inner of the normalized factor, normalized factor, the Q-the and the perimeter of the set, they both they both go disponentially along the along the wave flow. The sense that the capacity bomb disponion is along the potential and the minimum of the boundaries. Here the starting uh the starting level is the 30 option ICGAL and not the permit of the closed set. The configuration of loss set my single is the solution to the problem of minimizing the perimeter and maximizing the ordinance time of concept. It was in this view. You can some fruit can be extended to pay from one. Extended to be from one to three because we are diminishing three, so after that, I think that's the potential. Uh, for simplicity, I assume less than two, we processing. Yes, just for simplicity. And so there are some similarities. In some sense, you can see that previously, which will flow is the one version of the language. The line. So you can imagine it can pass with the doesn't pass the link as well. There are some of these results in this direction. One is about the convergence effect. If you take the kit capacity and you send it to one, you actually can get the perimeter of the 500 minimized galaxy atomize effect. factor in particular since they both evolve exponentially you can also prove the convergence of hooks at every level at every level second one was proved by marijuana setting this uh in this setting this setting uh the functions that we are uniformly fixed and they converge the inertia information flow uniformly on compact subsets Uniformly of compact subsets of this one. This result was proved after the work of Moser on RN and Kaucherini in the non-negative section. So now we know that we have some interplay between non-delectronic theory and the new control. What I would like to do next is if I improve finite And I show you mostly for a long industry to version flow in this new sense. The one along the weak computation with the industry flow is kind of similar. So I can show you in a minute, not right now. I prefer to start with the one along the Torinum. And as I say, the district. And as I say, this proof was introduced by Crustiani Mantegaz and Mattiolozzio, where they use this function here, something related to this, that they call for simplicity p-occupas. And I will show you in a minute why. That is in some sense a p-version of the occupants. And they prove that if you evolve your set along the level set of Set along the level set of the piermonic solution, what you get is something which is monotonic decreasing for regular values of the function. But these regular values seem quite strange. Maybe we can do something more, and this was what we did in a work that's not yet on a tibe with each. For the five with its web, that you can prove actually that almost every level of the picopassing potential is a curvature value. So curvature are well defined and not that. And moreover, you can also prove that the derivative has some lower bound with that is well defined. So it's an integral. An integral of again three specific fundamental form, we have again the scalar curvature, we have the derivative, the mental derivative gradient, and we have an extra turbulent. And this was for our savings. Since this quantity here is not negative, you actually get the group of moments. So you have two moments and on the the you know the the letter set of the and Set of, and you have an expression that's just the formula. Okay, now let me compare the two formula, the one for industry flow and the one for people. So, as you can see, there are some similarities. First, they are Okay, as I say, there are some similarities between the two formulas. For example, the first term on multiplying everything is quite similar since we have this result of convergence. Moreover, there are three terms here that are quite quickly the same. But we can the same, but there is the surface, the scalar curvature. And this last one is the same as soon as you realize that the mid curvature is the gradient along the work. But in the in the last one, there is another term here. There is another term here that, in some sense, compute the definition between the gradient and the minker chip. And our starting idea was to cancel it out since it's negative, but let me say something. You may get you may try to send the limit and send this point. The limit assigned this quantity to the limit as big as one and try to cover the formula. The reason why you cannot do that is that, well, maybe it's calculated to converge, maybe you have some lower simplification for the traces form, but you cannot make the last term converge. And the reason is that we only know that the the the WP converges to W one only locally conformally. Only locally informed. So you have no control of the and so you cannot prove any the last of the radar first. So you have some sense of you want some lower semi-continuity for the gradient of the module of the p. If you don't know if the gradient converges you don't know if uh whether the if the the gradient of the modulus is never seen. These levels and so, but here you know say something more because there is this p minus one that I say below that has p tension one goes to zero. So in order to have this quantity bounded, the terms in the parentheses must be zero. And this is saying that the gradient in some senses converged to the path. Let me see, let me say something more. The convergence of The convergence of the energies implies convergence of areas. And since we have that this goes to zero, it's enough to multiply both terms by p minus one, and you have the last term must go to zero, you have also equibound windmore energy. Now if you have something, some some levels that the burge in area and as equibounded windmore energy, you can prove very fun compared to this. Verifants for almost every and in particular the mean curvature converse with the but the limit of the mean curvature the mean curvature of the limit is the grid function so the idea is that now we can use again this this fact here and since the mean curvature and gradient are aligned this show that the mean curvature The mean curvature and the gradient inverse zero in a weaker set and for x in a suitable large sets. And what kind of x we would like to place there? Well, we would like to place there the normal unit, normal vector field. And the convergence of area also imply the convergence of the field. The conversion of areas also imply the convergence of the unicorn event, and so we can put all them together. I want to get is the following. Now, take the integral of the gradient. The integral of the gradient can be integrated as the gradient times the normal unit. Now, since by one, the normal unit that converges strongly to the network. Petrophy converge strongly to the limit and the gradient converge weakly as the weak curvature. You can replace them with this formula and now you can use weak convergence of tree to get that the limit is h1 times 1, but h1 times 1 is exactly the modulus. And we have almost done integrate the using the integrate.using the water formula integrate use current using quarter formula and what you get is the the antronorm of the gradient versus the anti norm of the gradient and this is enough to prove a strong convergence in x but now the gradients are bound that this they be bound that they uniformly bounded and so you can prove it to convergence in every q or q less than possible. Less than possible. And you can also pass the limit to every term significant. So, what we gained is some axiom that involves convergence and a new proof of, a different proof of theorem. So, the gradient of W P converged to the gradient of W1 in N log for W2 less than possibility. Moreover, the boundaries converging. The boundaries converging sense of perifold to the boundaries of limit and the derivative of the occupant of the industry flow as this. Okay. Okay, we have everything. Now it's time to find the Java wiki, and the other Java wiki is the money person. What we have done about it. Before starting to show you the theorems, I have to introduce some other the first one was introduced by Wisconsin, and this is the isoperman, this is the electromagnetic mass. Instead of computing in a physical sense the total mass of your space, use a geometric sense, and the idea is that you And the idea is that you can compute the density, the isoparametric inequality of our tree, and you divide by something that has the same speed. Here we have f to the power 3 minus r to the power 3, so something that was less r to the power 2, and so i divided by something with the sixty. Okay, this computes this uh this is in some sense the mass of the Sense the mass of the set. If you want to compute the total mass, you can take this init as on an exhaust, but this depends on the exhaust. So to have something which is invariant, you can simply take the strict of all possibilities. Similarly, you can define this almost the same quantity with the capacity. So instead of considering equality, you consider the S capacity. equality to possibly as you can see and we have the pretty same uh the same the same uh this was introduced by Jeremy only for equal two and this is a well simplified okay what we gain with these two definitions of mass well isoparametric mass and isocapacitive mass are Well defined without any asymptotic assumption. So we don't have to assume that we are C1 tau asymptotically flat in order to have well established. Moreover, for model solutions on transparation space, the isoperiogramic mass, the isopathic mass decide with the mass of transparation. So it's a good question. It's a good question whether the equivalence with the idioms more general setting and whether the minor parallels inequality is very good also for the high-speed mass. So let's see what was known in literature. The first result was about well Well, if you compute the experimented mass along the uh coordinate spheres, what you get is whenever the eigenmass is defined, the aspirant mass converges with the eigenmass. This was a theorem by and in particular, since you choose a particular exhaustion, that you have that the added mass is controlled by the isotopic mass. The same happens for the isocapacity mass, or at least the For the isoto capacity mass, or at least the two isocapacity mass and the previous calories. And the last result was wonderful result by Jerry and D. They proved that as soon as you can control the origin mass of every media in a given class, then the isoperiometric mass passes the same. So, in particular, if you If you if you add these theorems three theorems with the proof by Wisconsin-Mann and well, you know that the occupant mass of every set is controlled by the endian mass, so endian mass is controlled by the isoprometric mass, and we know by the first theorem that also the converse is true, and so you have the equivalence between this. If it is one of this, the second theorem can be extended to everything less than two. But at least in my setting, and so you have the some kind of banana pairs in equity. So to sum up everything, you always have the control of the adding mass with the adult mass. If you assume something more, you also have the opposite. More, you also have the opposite equality, and there are many parallel equality falls under the assumption. But we still, again, don't know what happens below the assumption. And with the two words, together with Matthia and the Vezo, we prove the following statement. So, as soon as the NGM. So, as soon as the NGM mass is well defined, so as soon as we have the dispute of space is C1000 degree flat with average of the one-half, then the experimenting, the Riemann-Persian equality holds for every concept of mass and the whole concept of mass at the matrix. Some remarks before showing you the main idea. Of course, as I said before, the eddy mass is controlled by the isocapacity mass. By the isocapacity mass, the isocapacity mass is controlled by the isoprometric mass. And this is quite simple because as soon as you have a sharp isopromatic inequality, you can always prove a sharp isovisocapacitic inequality. And the idea is that you can take a ball in R3 that has the same volume of your omega t, the goal does. The Golden Subset, and since the definition of the isoperiometric mass gives you a sharp isoprometric inequality, you can simply integrate this isoperiometric inequality to compare the capacity of these balls with the something like this. And so, what you get is a sharp isoca inequality which. Isotopac inequality which involves the isopermatical mass. And this says that the most the isotopic mass is the isoperometric mass. So what remains to prove is that the isoprogenetic mass is controlled by the M mass. And the reason is that if you put all this and it will put it together, you get the Together, you get the strain of inequalities, and since the last and the first are unequal, then they are. And the idea to prove this last statement is that we would like to apply generic ending results. So, we have to control the occupant mass of every omega in some class by the ending mass. So, what's the main problem in this? Well, the reason is the following: on one side, we are Is the following. On one side, we have the investment conversion flow that well behaves with the occupied mass, so we know that the occupant mass is increasing. And if we assume something, we are more on the metric, we also have the asymptotic control at infinity with the idea of mass. On the other side, there is another proof using pure potential theory that says, well, if you take the twoking mass, If you take the twoking mass, you have something which is monotonous decreasing, and now you have this flowing, you know, flow goes along with the solution of a Laplace equation. So harmonic functions are in some sense more regular, and so we can prove refinedly to asymptotics. And if we use them, we can improve the drawing mass control. The drawing mass is controlled by data mass without furnace, but you want to control the document, not the furnace. So, what can I do? Well, let me show, let me see what I have it here. Well, I have this red term here, which is almost the same area with millimeter, and there the capacity. And the turning power there is something which is not. Is something which is not active. So the terms in parentheses are controlled one by each other. The one of the occupant mass is controlled by the one of the two options. And so I can use this to control take Omega, evolving using the flow. So you get local density of the Omega. Get you at the city of the oak mass. Now, stop at some time t and control the oak mass of the level key with the true occupas at the same level. You can do that by multiplying by the express here, right? And now the true mass is controlled by the ending process. You are throwing off this along the concentration. The transcription and what it remains to prove is that this is bounded, but the idea is that they are going to run spheres and the capacity of the run spheres are the same. And so you control everything. Okay, so little recap. Previous result holds Result holds if above this threshold with our result, we fill this gap, but there is still something missing. What is missing is what happened below this threshold, not for the ideal mass, which is not fine, but for the isopermatic mass and the isopropyl mass. And so this is actually first thing I show you the I show you the last buttons, the first one. And we show that as you have some notion of Wikimbus maker with flow, here I say Wikima speak flat, but this can be proved, you have a nice problematic version of the finite person with its logistic quality modes definitely your uh spot of mass equal to the mass. Equal to the aspirating mass. And the idea is very simple, I will show you in a line. It's the following. Take the aspirating mass, and if you use a particular exhaustion, you can control with the leaves in it along the distance. And this is it this is its expression here, and this this the the susoni is the one. The Susson is the one given by the image frequent flow starting at the boundary of the manifold. Now you can simply use the lock-down theorem. Well, a generalization of the Lochback theorem that those hypotheses are ensured by the fact that the term field below exponentially grows, so it goes to plus infinity. So every time you have something divided by something that goes to plus infinity, you cannot supply it. Moreover, Moreover, if you compute the derivative of the area, you get the area itself, since it is exponentially flowing. On the other side, if you compute the derivative of the volume, you get the integral of the speed of the flow, which in this case is the inverse of the inverse. Now, use all the rest of order inequality to control the integral of the inverse of. The integral of the inverse of the big curvature with this quantity here, and now these two terms can collect outside the parentheses. And here, what you get by working a little bit is something that may recall you the okimas. Well, it's not the okimas. Mass. Well, the double delta mass is the difference of the squares difference. So you can complete the difference squares by multiplying and dividing by the same quantity plus. And what you get here is different squares, that is the term appearing within the moon mass. And there I use verified asymptotic behavior of the beam curvature to show that this convergence. Show that this converts to 6π, and for the very same reason, the 2 and the 3 below can be cancelled out. And so what remains is exactly the equipment. Now in mass of one also. Okay, we have some similar result for the isocapacity mass that is controlled instead That is controlled instead by the peak of the boundary. Here we have to some remark. I have to assume something more because if we try to do the same step for these quantities, you realize that you need two belongings. And the second one requires another technical assumption on the Attending assumptions on their stock be able. At this point, we are not able to remove, even we leave it. Another thing I would like to say is that this isotocapacity manipulation is not sharp. It becomes sharp as it is one where it covers the previous one, the ISP one. If you want a sharp version of this, it Want a short version of this equality using in the speaker version flows by Ray and Yao and Xiao could be less than two for the ADM mass and in the previous work with Matthias Lorenzo for the isopermanic mass when the energy mass is fine. If instead you want a proof using Bollino linear potential theory, there are two proof by CIE two that this is the affair appear to be. This is the affair a few in advance kernel, and but Roslip Yao improved the sharp version for the admin mass again, but we waited for the shock circle. And to conclude, this is the last slide. Let me say about the equivalence of masses, because some missing. Of course, we proved the equivalence. We prove the equivalence provided the adding mass is defined, and there are cases where the adding mass is not fine, but simply have isoperometric and isotopic mass. We would like to say that the distance side, what we were able to prove is that they converge one to each other, but they are not and another important thing is that I say that I always assume that. I say that I've always assumed that my boundary is connected. The index interventual flow, in some sense, is able to jump all the horizons. And so you can control the perimeter of the larger horizon with the isperman mass and the ideal mass. This idea cannot be implemented in the semantic theory, at least at this point. The reason is that in theory, In this particular is going more a dramatic than the previous one. We are if we don't know how to jump to horizon without the space. And to conclude, let me say that this is a step forward in the direction of studying the geometry, because isoprometric magnetic equality doesn't require any almost significant consumption metric. And uh if you want to see something more on this topic, Something more on this topic, but wait, let's wait for it. Let's go to it. And so, with this, I conclude and I thank again the organizers and thank you.
