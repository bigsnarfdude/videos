to give this talk give this talk here uh here there uh at the workshop uh like mari said it would would have been better in person but online is also fine okay during the talk i will present our reason some of our recent results obtained in the collaboration with richard sabo and gregoriosiotopoulos richard's former phd student from edinburgh and also with my colleagues from belgrade voira Also, with my colleagues from Belgrade, Vojara Dovanovic, Nikola Konik, and our PhD student, Georgi Bogdanovic. So, since this is the last day of the workshop and it's Friday evening in Belgrade, I will skip the usual introduction because we all know why we want to do, why we are motivated to do non-commutative geometry in one way or another. I'll just briefly mention the original motivation from Heisenberg, who was worried about the divergent electron self-energy. Divergent electron self-energy, and he was suggesting that the way to cure this would be maybe to introduce non-commuting coordinates. Nowadays, we moved quite a lot from this approach. Well, quite a lot. Nowadays, there are quite various approaches to non-commute, what we call non-commutative geometry or non-commutative space-time. And we heard a lot about some of these approaches during this workshop. We heard a lot of talk about non-commutative spectral geometry. Talk about non-commutative spectral geometry. We heard about fuzzy spaces and fuzzy onions. We heard about matrix models, especially today from Harold. And we also heard a bit about what I would call star product representation in talk of Marco de Cesare, for example. And what I will, the approach I will discuss in this talk is the star product representations. And all the conclusions, all the remarks that I will be making. All the remarks that I will be making will refer to this approach. So they will not refer to matrix models, quantization of theories in matrix models or in fuzzy spaces or whatever. It will just refer to star product approach, let's say. And just to briefly summarize the problems or the features of this, some of the features of this approach, one of the most studied examples of quantum field theory, non-commutative quantum field theory is the scalar non-commutative quantum field. Field theory is the scalar non-commutative quantum field theory with Moyal Veil or Greenwood Greenwood Moyal Veil. Star product, the action is written here. These stars are just the Moyal Vale star product. This product is non-commutative. It's associative. It has a good commutative limit, so it's an expansion in the deformation parameter. So when you do the standard quantization, like people did in 99, in the beginning of 2000, what comes out is that there are two types of diagrams. There are two types of diagrams. Planar diagram. Oh, sorry, it does not work like this. Okay, we do it like this. So there are planar diagrams, and they behave. So this is just an example of a two-point function at one loop. Planar diagrams behave, it turns out that they behave like the diagrams in the ordinary commutative quantum field theory, that means that they are UV divergent. On the other hand, non-planar diagrams, they obtain this phase factor that comes from This phase factor that comes from the non-commutativity, and this phase factor makes them UV convergent unless the external momenta, this p here is small or the non-commutativity parameter, this theta, this is our deformation parameter, goes to zero. In that case, they reduce to the ordinary commutative result, which is UV divergent, and that is what we call UVIR divergent. call uv i r divergent or uvi i r mixing because for small external momenta the diagram becomes uv uv divergent and in principle it's not a problem if it's just this diagram the problem arises when these diagrams become part of larger diagrams and then you cannot really control what happens in momenta and divergences are introduced and therefore this theory in this way is not really renormalizable and there were quite some attempts to cure this or Quite some attempts to cure this or to understand at least this problem better. I will mention some of them here, probably not mention all of them. So, one possible way to make this model better behave was invented, was proposed by Ross and Wolfenger around 2004. More or less, they modified the original action by adding this oscillating term, which is quadratic in coordinates. Coordinates and then and it's also proportional to the inverse of the non-commutative deformation parameter. So, this it happens that then this term makes this model re-normalizable and this model modified model has now very nice behavior and so on. But no extensions to gauge theories have been done using this modification, to my knowledge, let's say. Then there were claims that if one carefully Claims that if one carefully analyzes non-communistic quantum field theory takes care of weak rotations going from Euclidean to Minkowski spacetime and so on, then the UVRI mixing is not present. And this was done by Dorothea-Bans and collaborators again, around the same time or less. That's the first half of around 2004-05 more or less. Then there was work of Okel who basically in his algebraic approach. Basically, in his algebraic approach, he claimed that if you have a non-commutative quantum field theory with braided statistics, that is, among other things, equivalent to ordinary quantum field theory with ordinary statistics. And if you would have like non-commutative quantum field theory with ordinary statistics, then that would be equivalent to the commutative quantum field theory with Brady statistics. He had this diagram of equivalence of theories. Anyhow, he was suggesting that. He was suggesting that, so if there is an you have an occupative quantum field theory with Brady's statistics, then there will be no UVIR mixing. But again, his results were, to my knowledge, again, only for scalar field theories. So they were not extended to theories that have also gauge symmetries. And then, partially motivated by his results about this braided statistics and results there, people started discussing what had. Started discussing what happens when you twist-deform the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. So, you deform twist-deform statistics. Can this remove UVRI mixing? And there was quite a lot of work with Balachandra and his collaborators, and then also other people. I spelled Gaetano's last name wrongly. If Gaetano is here, I'm sorry. So, work of Balachandra and collaborators, work of Gaetano and Julius, and also. Gaetano and Julius, and also work of Patrizia, Fidel, and Paolo. They were discussing all of them what happens if you twist the form the algebra of creation and inhalation operators, meaning you deform the statistics, whether that changes something in the UVRI mixing. And the claims, some of the claims were that UVRI mixing in the scalar field theories can be removed in this way. In this way, and also Balachanjan and his collaborators had a paper about the gauge theories, whether the claiming that if you twist the form the statistics there, and you have a gauge theories with matter, and then in the S-matrix elements that describe interaction of gauge fields with matter, the UVRI mixing in the abelian case is absent, but it reappears in the non-abelian case. So, these are also some partial results. Results. And, like you see, there is no really definite conclusion, and especially there are no definite conclusions for gauge theories. For the scalar field theories, there are quite a lot of results, but gauge theories that have gauge symmetries, they haven't been analyzed so much and not with so much success. Now, the question is whether our recent work now concerning these problems using a bit different methods will just add to the confusion or will it contribute better to the understanding. Or will it contribute better to the understanding of the problem? So I will try to convince you that our work will help understand the problem, solve the problem, hopefully, but and not add to the existing confusion somehow. And hopefully I managed to do that during the talk. So the building blocks of our approach, there are three of them. So first building block tells us how we introduce the deformation. Is tells us how we introduce the deformation, second building block tells us how we construct field theories, and the third building block tells us how we quantize them. So the deformation or non-commutativity, non-commutative space-time, or non-commutative differential geometry, we introduce using the twist formalism. And we heard a bit about twist formalism in talk of Marco de Cesar and also, I think, also in Paolo's talk briefly, maybe. Briefly, maybe. And I will also say something. It's a well-defined way to deform symmetry of algebras, and then this can be extended to the deformation of module algebras. And it's one way to construct non-commutative differential geometry. So once we have the non-commutative space-time, non-commutative differential geometry, how we put some physics on this? And there, there are various approaches. And what we started doing recently. Doing recently, I think from 2018, we started looking at this L infinity algebra approach because there were results that saying that any classical gauge field theory is fully described by the corresponding L infinity algebra. I will tell a bit more about that during the talk. And then we decided to follow this approach and we will see that it's not enough just to have an L infinity algebra, we will have to deform this L infinity algebra. We will have to deform this L-infinity algebra using the twist formalism. And this will give us really a very strict way to define our theories. They will not be very, they will be not, we will not get some arbitrary terms. They will all be strictly defined by the L-infinity algebra. And then how do we do quantization? Because again, quantization can be done in different ways. What I was showing before was just using the standard Feynman. Using the standard Feynman rules and techniques to quantize an action that has star products here. Is this a good way or not? Well, maybe it's not. And then again, recent results, recent results and also the duality between the L-infinity algebras and the BV, Batali-Milkovitsky formalism, which is used to quantize theories with gauge symmetries and Gauge symmetries and reducible gauge symmetries, open symmetries with open algebra. So it's a very nice formalism to quantize theories that are not simple, let's say. So using the Bivi formalism and homological perturbation theory, which is an algebraic way to quantize theories, one can quantize, I would say, in a well-defined way these theories that we obtain from Brady. These theories that we obtain from Brady-Dell Infinity Algebra. And I will explain each of these building blocks separately. I will first tell something about the twist formalism, then about L infinity algebras, then this is already my outline. Like I said, the twist and then the L infinity algebras. Then I will give examples of two examples of braided non-commutative field theories. And I will explain really during the talk what we mean by braided. Really, during the talk, what we mean by braided non-commutative field theories. So, the word braided is used in various settings. I will really tell specifically what we mean by this. And then, when we give these classical examples, then we will go to the quantization and explain shortly this third building block, the B V quantization, and then give present results concerning the quantization of braided phi to the three field theory and braided quantum electrodynamics. Well, U1 gauge theory coupled to. A UN gauge theory coupled to fermions. Why do we want to discuss phi to the three and not phi to the four? Because of calculational simplicity, let's say. Everything can be done to phi to the end, basically field theories, and we have also results for phi to the four. But for some reasons, we have more results for phi to the three, and that is why I chose this example. Okay, and finally, of course, I will try to give conclusions. So, let's start with our building blocks. Building blocks. The twist formalism, I will not spend so much time on this because we talked about it quite a lot. And, like I said, Marco and Paolo mentioned something. So, the twist deformation goes back to Dreamfield, and it's a way to deform your symmetry algebra. So, you first promote it to the universal enveloping algebra, and then it's a hof, it has a hof algebra structure, and then there is a this twist, you can introduce the twist operator that lives in. The twist operator that lives in two copies of the universal enveloping algebra, and you can use this to deform the original Kof algebra. The twist has to fulfill certain conditions like the cos cycle condition and so on. What we demand especially is that the twist, which now encodes the deformation, starts with a unity and then has higher orders in the deformation parameter. And in this way, we obtain our perturbative picture, meaning that our deformations will always be deformations of the Will always be deformations of the commutative space-time, and the limit to the commutative space-time is very well controlled. We just put the deformation parameter to zero, and we are back to the commutative theory. Then, using this twist deformation, one can, like I said, one can deform the symmetry of algebra, but one can also deform module algebras on which this symmetry algebra acts. So, like algebra of functions, algebra of differential forms, algebra of vector fields, and so on. On by again applying the twist, and then this deformation now introduces a new product in the module algebras. For example, if this product is the point-wise multiplication between functions, then the application of the inverse of the twist introduces the star product. And here I give just the example of the twist that introduces Moyal-Weil star product. It's here. This star product is not commutative. Not commutative, and the non-commutativity is controlled by the R matrix because having a twist operator, then we the twist introduces an R matrix in this way. Sorry, go back. No? Okay. In this way, and this R matrix is triangular. So we know how to control the non-commutativity in the products of deformed products of module algebra. And in this way, we can construct the deformed algebra of functions or differential forms. Algebra of functions or differential forms of vector fields and so on. And like I said, the R matrix encodes no commutativity. We will see later that we will use the twist deformation to also deform the L infinity algebra essentially in a very similar way. And then this R matrix will appear also there. So this was very briefly about how we introduce non-commutativity. So it will be encoded in the star product that will be visible. Will be visible, so to say, and the R matrix will control the non-commutativity. Okay, how do we define field theories on such do we lost con do we lost can you hear us the brackets of thirty? The brackets of third Maria, sorry, for a couple of for a few seconds, we missed, we could not hear you. Okay, where did you miss me? Just when you start talking for that slide. So if you could start again, probably. Like, I mean, less than a minute, so it's not long. Okay, so did you hear anything about it? Yeah, the next one. Aha, this one. Aha, this one. Yeah. Okay, but this I just started. Just started. Okay. So the D L-infinity algebras are the way to introduce, well, we use it as a way to introduce physics on this non-commutative space-time that we, so the non-commutativity, the information we introduce using the twist formalism. The physics there, how we write the actions, equations of motions, what are the symmetries of our field theory, and so on. For that, And so on. For that, we use the L infinity algebra. And Larissa in her talk yesterday mentioned briefly L infinity algebras and she also gave some historical references. I also have some historical references here. I will not repeat all of them. I will just repeat what she also said: that there is a duality between the Batalin Milkovitsky formalism. Batalyn Milkovitsky formalism and the L infinity algebra picture of a field theory. And this duality is basically the reason why any classical gauge field theory can be this is fully determined by its corresponding L-infinity algebra. And that was shown by Holmes and Swieber in their paper. And also this explicit BV and L-infinity duality was nicely Nicely reviewed and developed in the paper of Branyo and his collaborators. This BVL infinity duality was also used by other authors, also Koncevich in his proofs of formality theorems and so on. Some recent results where people use the L-infinity algebra approach and there is duality with the VV formalism is the application to quantum field theories. It came out To quantum field theories, it came out that one can nicely calculate correlation functions and scattering amplitudes for the quantum field theory at the tree level, at loop levels, using this homological picture or the L infinity models. And then once people obtained the amplitudes, then they also started thinking about this double copy prescription: how we get the amplitudes for gravity from the gauge theory, and that was. And that was these are these recent papers of Bartin and collaborators. So it turns out that this L-infinity algebra picture of field theory has quite a lot of applications. And the first time it was discussed in the context of non-commutative, for example, gauge field theories, was in the papers of the group from Munich, Ralph Blumenhagen and his collaborators and Vlad Koprianov, of course. Cupriano, of course. And then they discussed the L-infinity algebra for the non-commutative gauge field theories using the consequences star product, so for non-constant theta. And their construction was basically, they were just constructing step by step the whole L infinity algebra, adding brackets one by one in order to satisfy all the homotopy relations. And in their approach, they're their approach there their L infinity algebra of non-commutative gauge field theories was really had infinitely many brackets what we tried to do or how we started looking at the L infinity algebras originally we wanted to I think it was in 2018 we wanted to analyze non-associative theories and then we thought L infinity algebras would be nice because they have higher brackets and then non-associativity can go in higher brackets but then Activity can go in higher brackets, but then we move to the to the gravity theory, gravity, Ernst-Cartan gravity. Then we constructed the L-finity algebras for classical gravity and then developed it also for the non-commutative, non-commutative in this twist setting, Einstein-Cartan gravity, the L-infinity algebra. And that is how we came to the notion of non-commutative break. The notion of non-commutative braided non-commutative field theories. And then we saw the next step, obvious step, was to look at the quantization of these theories. And that is really the most recent work that we are doing still, is still also work in progress. So I will briefly now review the commutative, the classical L-infinity algebras, and then define how we deform them. Larice in her talk avoided giving any definitions of L-infinity. The definitions of L-infinity algebra. She just referred to the V-V formalism, but I have to give some definitions because this is really essential. We use them to construct field theories later on. So what is an L-infinity algebra? It's a Z-graded vector space and it has graded anti-symmetric multilinear maps, which we call n brackets. So these are our brackets. And they are anti-symmetric, anti-symmetric, because this depends on the convention that we use. We use the convention. On the convention that we use, we use the convention that they are anti-symmetric, they are graded. This is this part here, and this is just flipping them. And we see the degree of this element. These brackets are not completely arbitrary. They have to fulfill certain homotopy relations. And there are, in principle, there are infinitely many homotopy relations. I wrote the first three because they are somehow illustrative. So the first tells us that L1, the first bracket, squares to zero, and then that makes this original, this space. makes this original this space V and L1 a courtian complex. The second homotopy relation tells us that L1 is a derivation of L2, which is nice. It's a graded derivation. There is this degree here. And then the third homotopy relation tells us that this last line here is just a Jacobi identity because there are L2 brackets here. And this line and this line is, you see, they're L3 brackets. So this third one. L3 brackets. So this third homotopy relation tells us that the Jacobi identity is violated if we have L3 brackets. So it's you could call it Jacobi, Jacobi up to homotopy. Or you can read it also as L1 being a derivation of L3. It's not because you have this here, this Jacobi identity here. So, and then you can also write higher order homotopy relations with higher order brackets. With higher-order brackets. So we have brackets, they have to fulfill homotopy relations, and in principle, that is enough if you don't want to look at the action. So if you only want to, in your theory, if you want to, so to say, analyze classical field theory, you have your equations of motion, you want to look at the solutions and so on. This is enough. But if you want to quantize the theory, you would have to have an action. And to write down an action, we have to introduce one additional structure. We have to introduce one additional structure, and that is pairing. And this pairing has to be cyclic. So then, with this pairing, cyclic means that we can commute elements cyclically into the, so this is the, like, so V0 is here, then it goes to the, comes here, V1. So basically, this one goes in front. So you can do cyclic permutations. Of course, there are some minuses arising from all the degrees of fields you have to go through, but this is an. But this is an additional structure, and with this structure, then we have a cyclic L infinity algebra. How is this structure used to construct field theories? So in principle, if we want to look at the gauge field theories, this big vector space can have V0, V1, V2, V3, so that they all have different gradings. And you could say that we say that gauge parameters or ghosts. Gauge parameters or ghosts in the Vivi formalism they live in V0, then gauge fields that live in V1. Mauer-Cartan elements, which give equations of motion, they live in V2, and then net their identities related with these gauge parameters or goals, they live in V3. Now, why do I have dots here and dots on the left and dots on the right? Because you can have gauge theories that are reducible, meaning that you have You have ghosts for ghosts and so on. So, if that is the case, so you don't only have ghosts, but you also have ghosts for ghosts, you would add here V to the minus one, which will include ghosts for ghosts. And on the right-hand side, you would also have to include nettle identities for this gauge parameter, so that you would have a v4 and so on, depending how to which order is your gauge theory reducible. So, you can incorporate all this, but like we will. Like, we will, we will, for the time being, work with irreducible gauge theories. So, this is our space, let's say. And then, gauge transformations, equations of motion, action, network identities, second networid entities, the ones that are related with the local gauge symmetry. They are all written as an expansion in this, in L brackets. So, the equations of motion, they're just basically mouse. Equations of motion, they're just basically Mauer-Cartan element, and we just say it's equal to zero, and that gives us the equation of motion. The action is written using the pairing, and the cyclicity is important because you want to have a variational principle. So, you do a variation of this, and then you have to move the variation through this pairing somehow. You have to use cyclicity, and that really gives you this for the equations of motion, gives the pairing between the variation of A and equations of motion. Okay, so it's a nice. Okay, so it's a nice structure, can be used to describe, like I said, all classical field theories. And how do we deform this? Because we don't want to analyze classical field theories, we want to analyze non-commutative field theories. So again, the vector space remains, so what I'm introducing now is a Brady de L-infinity algebra. It's basically a generalization of a quantum Lie algebra done by Voronovic and also. Done by Voronovic and also Majid. And it starts, the vector space is the same. So, if we have an irreducible gauge theory, it has these four elements. The brackets are now twist-deformed, meaning that they are anti-symmetric, they are graded, but they are also braided. That is, when we write here two elements and we flip them, there will be this minuses and minus one to the degree. And minus one to the degrees of the elements, but they will be in our matrix, the one that is defined from our twist and so on, because we are flipping the order of elements. And as an example, here I wrote an example of L2 bracket. Imagine that you have a non-abelian gauge theory where rho is a gauge parameter, A is a gauge field, and then there is this commutator, which is basically an. Commutator, which is basically an L2 bracket. And this L2 bracket, using this formalism, will be deformed into this star bracket. So we compose it with the inverse of the twist. That is the way how we define the formation always. So this is f to the minus one here. And it comes out that this bracket now is not really symmetric, it's braided symmetric. So when you flip row and A. Flip rho and A, so this here, when you flip them, you will get an R matrix here. So we will not really have an anti-symmetric commutator, we'll have braided anti-symmetric commutator. What is nice also about this bracket is that it closes in the corresponding Lie algebra. So if you want to calculate this explicitly, saying that rho lives in the Lie algebra, A also lives in the Lie algebra, and you write it explicitly, what this commutator is. What is this commutator? It turns out that really it is valued in the Lie algebra. And that is different compared to the star commutator that people usually use when they define non-commutative gauge theories. So the star commutator is really fully anti-symmetric. When you flip rho and A, you just get a minus, but it's not valued in the Lie algebra. It's valued in the full enveloping algebra. It also has anti-commutators, so you have... Anti-commutators, so you have to introduce the enveloping algebra. And that is what we saw in the talk of Marco de Cesare because he had like two Fear binds, which came exactly for this reason, because the star gauge transformations were not really closing into the Lie algebra. And he also had three spin connections. One was valued really in the sigma matrices, and then there were two parts that were valid in the unity and gamma fives. In the unity and gamma fives, and that is because of this reason that was not closing in the Lie the commutators do not close in the Lie algebra. So, unlike this, our braided commutators, or if you want our braided brackets, now they will close in the Lie algebra and that will have some important effects on the theories that we are constructing. Okay, so this is the This is the these are the brackets and their braided properties. The homotopy relations also change. So the first one, the L1, the L1 bracket does not change because there we don't we don't braid anything. And again, it squares to zero. This star is just to say that now it lives in the braided L infinity algebra. L1 also remains the derivation of L2. So the second homotopy relation does not change. The third homotopy relation changes and it changes changes. And it changes the part with the Jacobi identity where we have this L2, L2 brackets. Then, when we flip elements, we will get R matrices. So, basically, the Jacobi identity part will be deformed, and this part with L3 remains the same. And then also higher homotopy relations will get. Maria, sorry to interrupt. 10 more minutes, 10 minutes, Planck's five for questions. Okay, then I will try to be. I will try to be very fast now. Sorry, I thought it would be faster. Okay, and then additional thing beside these brackets, we also have to introduce the cyclicity and that we can do again using the twist formalism. We just have to restrict to the twists that render this braided pairing strictly cyclic because of the variational principle. And all this defines the strictly cyclic braided L-infinity algebra. And then this braided L-infinity. And then this braided L-infinity algebra we use to construct braided non-commutative field theories. For example, for the scalar field theory, we just write the ordinary L-infinity algebra and we write what is the braided version of this. And for the scalar field theory, we don't really see the difference between the action that I showed in the first slide. So this is just a star product of phi to the three, four, whatever. To the three, four, whatever degree, and the differences will appear at the quantum level when we do the quantization. So, in the scalar field case, we don't see the difference between the braided field theory and the ordinary non-commutative field theory. In the braided electrodynamics, we will see the difference already at the classical level. So, we will what we call braided electrodynamics is just a U1 gauge theory with a spinner field, and then we can write the Spinner field, and then we can write the field, the brackets, and then the action using this prescription has this additional part. And this is really different from what people do when they somehow discuss the star electrodynamics. There, the U1 gauge theory, because of this non-closure of the star commutation. All star commutators in the algebra. The U1 gauge theory in the star product, in the star approach, becomes a non-abelian gauge theory, while in our approach it remains abelian because the U1 remains just U1. So there will be no photon self-interaction. And then photon-fermion interaction is a bit different. So it has these two parts, one has R matrix. So we see already differences when we use the L infinity algebra to construct our braided non commutative theories. Our braided non-commutative theories. Okay, of course, when we do the quantization, this will also reflect there because we will quantize in abelian gauge theory and not non-abelian gauge theory. So there will be no photon-photon interaction. The quantization, and this I will really do very, very briefly. We will use the homological perturbation theory deformed in such a way that the In such a way that this encodes our braided deformation. And this braided BV formalism was developed in papers of Richard and Alex and Hans in 2021. And there are a lot of technical details. It's basically BV formalism, but completely algebraic. So the BV action we will construct using the L infinity approach, but then the objects that appear in the BV. But then the objects that appear in the Bivy formalism, like the anti-bracket and the Bivy Laplacian, they will be defined in a completely algebraic setting using the pairing and their properties. Because we, in the ordinary BV formalism, if you open the book from Weinberg, this maps like the bracket and the BV Laplacian defined using the functional derivatives over fields and anti-fields. We cannot do that because then we would have to worry about the. We then would have to worry about the order of in which order we put fields, anti-fields, the braiding, and so on. Instead of that, we use completely algebraic maps and define them in such a way that they fulfill all the classical properties. And the correlation functions we calculate using the homological perturbation lemma. This I skip completely. I'll just tell you the formula for the correlation functions. This is in the coordinate space, in the momentum space. The homological perturbation lemma, now braided, of course, deformed. Now, braided, of course, deformed, tells us how we can calculate correlation functions. And for this, we need two objects, so to say. We need, well, three. We need this H, which is called contracting homotopy, and basically it's propagators. We need the S interaction, which introduces vertexes and this antibracket with it, and we need the Vivi Laplacian, which encodes the Breded Wick theorem. The Bredidwick theorem. So, all this, they are here in this formula basically, and this formula has to be expanded, and then we calculate correlation functions. In the scalar field case, so this is how we, well, I described what we do, but I guess I don't have the time to go through this. I can just mention this. So, we calculate interaction action, which basically tells us how the vertex looks like, and we obtain. Vertex looks like, and we obtain this phase factor here, which is kind of expected because of the non-commutativity. And this vertex is braided anti-symmetric. When we flip two momenta, it will get this phase factor. So this is important. And then here come the results. At the tree level, because it's five to the three, we have one point function, two point function, three point function. This is just the usual propagator. This is the usual tadpole, and this is the vertex. So this two tadpole. So this two, that colon, the propagator, just the commutative one, the vertex, has a phase factor. So it is this term here. It has a phase factor of momenta, and that is somehow to be expected because it's a non-commutative field theory at one loop, two point functions at one loop. So when we really write what the homological perturbation lemma gives us, it comes out that when you expand the whole When you expand the whole formula, we obtain disconnected diagrams, reducible diagrams, and the diagrams that give us one particle irreducible part. So, disconnected diagrams we don't consider. The connected and the reducible connected and irreducible connected parts, they are written here and here. And you can see, maybe you don't, but this one, the last line is this part here. This middle line. The middle line is this reducible diagram. None of them has a phase factor. So there are no contributions from non-commutativity in the two-point function at one loop, in phi to the three. The same result holds in phi to the four. So that means that there are no non-planar diagrams and no UVRI mixing at one loop at the two-point function. And that's consistent with what Ocul was saying in his papers. Then the three-point function at one loop, again, the whole four. Loop. Again, the whole formula gives these kinetic diagrams, these reducible things, and the one that is really one particle irreducible. And if you look at the one particle reducible, that is this, so this line, this line, and this line. No, no, sorry, I'm sorry, this line and this line, just there is a phase factor, but this phase, so there is a contribution from the non-commutativity of the three-point function in one loop, but this contribution, it's all it's a This contribution, it's a phase factor in external momenta. So it does not mix external and the loop momenta. Meaning, again, there is no UVR mixing at one loop in the three-point function. And then just to be sure, before we make any definite claims, we started looking at the two-point function, the two loops, and these are really completely preliminary results. We calculated one diagram only, so this one, when you expand the whole. This one, when you expand the whole formula, there are quite a lot of terms, but this one, and it comes out that it's really commutative. So, two-point function two loops seems that it's just a commutative result. And we could conclude, preliminary at least, that there is no UVRI mixing in phi to the three. So, the two-point function remains completely commutative. The three-point function, the vertex correction, gets a phase factor, but on Phase factor, but only in the external momenta. So no UVRI mixing. So the question, and that's again completely consistent with what Okel was claiming in his paper. Is this boring? Maybe it's not. We really have to carefully analyze the whole theory and maybe also look at the scattering amplitudes. Although it's a scalar field theory, so it's not maybe that much interesting. So, Mary, do I still have a couple minutes or two? Minute minute or two? Uh, one minute if possible, unless you don't want to use your questions time. Okay, so I'll try to do it like this. So the in the electrodynamics, I just tell the results. One can calculate, again, using this homological perturbation lemma the correlation functions. And we calculated the two-point function for at one loop for the photon and for the fermion, that is, we calculated. For the fermion, that is, we calculated vacuum polarization at one loop, it's completely commutative, and we calculated fermion self-energy at one loop. Again, it's a completely commutative result. It comes out that also then in the electrodynamics, at least in two-point function, one loop, there is no UVRI mixing. So the theory is abelian. There is no photon-photon interaction. There are no non-planar diagrams. There are no non-planar diagrams. Ghosts decouple completely, so there are no ghosts appearing here. This, I'm mentioning all this because it's different compared with the star electrodynamics or the non-commutative U1 gauge theory that people were considering earlier. So far, it seems that concerning the two-point function, we just get the commutative results. We haven't calculated the vertex correction yet. This we have to do, and then we would, it would be very interesting. And then it would be very interesting to see if we can, what happens if we try to calculate some scattering amplitudes, like Compton scattering or whatever process, do we get any non-commutative contributions? And how do they look like? Maybe they all vanish because there are these phase factors and hopefully they don't. But let's see. Okay, conclusions or outlook somehow. What I tried to describe, and I was not really, I did not plan my time very well. I'm sorry for that, is the approach. Uh, is the approach that we use to define first non-commutative field theories and braided non-commutative field theories, and then also I try to describe how we quantize them, and I gave some preliminary results on our calculations. So, in order to construct non-commutative braided non-commutative field theories, we use the L infinity algebra and the twist approach to deform this L infinity algebra. Deform this L infinity algebra to the braided L infinity algebra, and then the field theory that results from there is the braided non-commutative field theory. Quantization is done using the algebraic braided BW formalism and the braided version of homological perturbation lemma. And so far, it seems that concerning the scalar field theories, we get the results that were claimed by Okel in his paper. So there is no In his paper, so there is no UVRI mixing. All the results are commutative, apart from this vertex correction that obtain phase factors, but they are, like I said, again, I'm repeating myself, they are just phase factors in the external momenta. So, however, in normalization, there is one tricky point in phi to the three because of this tadpole diagram. The tadpole diagram in phi to the three in the commutative setting is taken care of in such a way that you introduce a linear temp. Such a way that you introduce a linear term to the action and then you cancel it by the counter term when you do the renormalization. Here, if we would like to introduce a linear term in the action in our L infinity algebra approach, we would have to introduce L0 bracket. That could be done in principle, but I don't know how much that would change our picture because then this L infinity algebras and our curved L infinity algebras, Lada knows a bit more about these things. So somehow. More about these things, so somehow this is a bit tricky and that has to be studied carefully. And then, like I said, scattering amplitudes, measurable effects, phenomenological, whatever things. Future work, we of course need to understand this whole setting better in the results that we are obtaining. And of course, we would like to generalize all this to non-abelian age theories to study young males or turn Simons. And there, There, I guess we would get, I expect, somehow different results because of the non-abelian nature. And also, like Balachandran was claiming in his paper, that they don't see UVRI mixing in abelian case, but they see it in the non-abelian case. So, let's see what happens in our case. Okay, so that's all. I hope I'm not too much over time. Thank you very much, Maria. Thanks. Any questions, or comments, or remarks from people? Comments or remarks from people in the room or from people online. Is anybody online who would like to say something? I don't see myself anybody having raised a hand, but just in case. Maybe I say something. Yes, please, please. Both Maria. Both Maria. Yes, something similar we also find with Julius with a very different approach, namely operator approach to 15. Maybe you remember. I wonder whether this might be related. Anyway, this is always connected with proper, I mean, with twists. I mean, with uh twists uh which uh fulfill uh the strict uh cosarical conditions so leading to um triangular yes um i think it's not completely related with the well of course we use the twist that uh gives a triangular matrix and so on but it's not i think it's the different way it's it's different the quantization that we are using somehow because we use this algebraic algebraic algebraic algebraic BV formalism and we don't have to worry somehow I was not really happy when I was reading papers from Balachandran and the others when you do this braided that you twist the the algebra of creation and acknowledge operators when you write your field in the Fourier expansion with creation and akhelation operators then you don't know really where to put stars either you start multiply the plane waves or you start multiply the creation and akhelation operators Multiply the creation and the healation operators, or both, and then that leads to different results. And we tried all this here, and then we somehow thought quite a lot about these things. And then this algebraic approach was really completely clear because you don't have to worry about where you put star products. This BV algebraic BV setting tells you somehow immediately what is a correlation function, and you don't have to worry whether it's. And you don't have to worry whether it's the braided algebra creation annihilation operators, or it's a braided multiplication of plane waste, or whatever, something in between. So it's somehow it's cleaner, I would say. Yeah, our paper, I mean, my paper with Julius also essentially differs from Bharashandran's papers in this respect, if you remember. Anyway, I will. Member. Anyway, I would, yeah. Yeah, that I remember, but like I said, there are this some ambiguities, let's say, and then we were trying to avoid them in this setting. I will have a look at papers. Okay, let us thank Maria again and move to the last talk of the meeting. So, the last talk is. So the last talk is
