Thank you, Maria. Thank you very much for the introduction and give me a chance to talk. And I'd like to thank the organizers for organizing this nice conference. So today I'd like to discuss the application of the three-dimensional topology to material science. So today we will consider a block polymer melt. Block polymer melt, and we will analyze a microphase separation of block polymer melt. So, and we will consider a mathematical model of that as in this picture. And we will analyze this structure using 3D nets and handle decomposition of the 3D mature torus. So, this is the 3D matrix torus and that. So, this is the self-measure torus, and that is decomposed into several numbers of the handle body. So, first, we deal with the relation of the microphase separation of locopolymer and the 3D nets. And the latter part, we would analyze this structure using hand-over data composition. And this is ongoing work. Ongoing work, and I think we will finish writing the preprint soon. And the other work has been published in the Arthur Bojia application in 2019. Okay, I will start introducing the block polymer. So it's a polymer made of several blocks. So in this picture, small dots indicates some monomer. some monomer and there are several number of several kinds of monomer in one polymer so in this picture this part corresponds a monomer of type a and this part corresponds to the monomers of type b and here you can also see a type a monomer we are often prepared monomers with a distinct chemical properties Chemical properties. And if you, if polymer have this structure, these are three blocks and it is called turblock copolymer. And we also say that this is type type A, B, A, 3 block coporma. So this is an example of the die block coporima. So here you have A part and here you see B part. B part. Sometimes you have a star-like polymer as in this picture. So here you have three blocks: A and B and C, and this is called ABC style block copolymer. And you can also prepare four chemical distinct monomers, and you might have ABC and D type for block. Type 4 block copolymer. Okay, so these are block copolymers, and we like to consider a block polymer melt. So you have many block polymers. So this is one polymer. And if you prepare monomers with a distinct chemical property, then you have this type of microphase separation. Type of microphase separation of the melt. So this part corresponds to monomer A domain, and this part corresponds to B domain, and this part is A domain. And it is known that if you have a microphase separation, there are several kinds of structure, and this type is called a sphere type. Is called sphere type, and this one is called cylinder type, and this one is called bicontinuous, and this one is called laminar. If you change the volume fraction of the monomers, you will see different pictures. And if you also change the chi parameter or temperature, you might have many structure. So in this talk, we are interested in this structure, and we like to analyze it using a Uh, analyze it using mathematics and uh uh yes, especially CTM topology. So, goal of this kind of study is to characterize such a structure using topology, and we like to characterize a topological structure and we like to describe the property of the material using topological terminology and using. And using that, we like to design a material with desired property. So that is a big goal. And we will first give a mathematical model of the bicontinuous pattern. So here we say biocontinuous pattern is a trip periodic surface in a three-dimensional In a three-dimensional space, R3, which divides the whole space into two periodic domains. And we assume that the domain is a neighborhood of the network. So this is an example. So, and these are called 3D nets. 3D net is an entanglement of several networks. And in this case, you have two components of network. You have two components of the network, and we assume that each region is a neighborhood of this network. So, these are examples of the bicontinuous pattern. So, the bicontinuous pattern is an infinite surface in a three-dimensional space, and that has a triple-paired structure. So, that is the surface is invariant after the After the transformation in the x-direction or y-direction and the z-direction. So you can take cube, for example, for a fundamental domain of the structure. So in a sense, you can consider such a structure, this kind of structure with a periodic boundary condition. And if you have ABA type, triple copolymer or AB type. To your copolyma or A-B-type diabolo copolyma in the melt, you might see this kind of biocontinuous pattern. And if you consider a block copolymer with three blocks, you might have a trillion continuous pattern. So here you consider a blanched surface in a three-dimensional space, which is also tribulally periodic. Periodic and that divides the whole space into three domains. And we here we assume that the domain is a neighborhood of the networks as in this picture. And this structure also appears as a microphase separate structure in turbulent copolymer melt. So this So, this suppose you have an ABC type turbo coponema, then you have some connection of three parts. So, here you have a correct connection of three parts. And if you consider a melt, then so here you have one. So here you have one block polymer. The A will fill this domain and the B part will fill this domain and C part will fill this domain. And the blanched surface appears as an interface of two domains. For example, so this part of the blanched surface is an interface of interface of A domain and B domain. So here you have C domain. So this part is an interface of B and C and this part is an interface of A and C and this polymer is piled up in this direction and the connection part will give you a blanched line of the blanched surface. So a blanched line is a A blanched line is a line where three surfaces meet. So, this is a blanche surface and this is the example of the troch continuous pattern. So, it is not easy to see the blanche line. So, I will show you another picture. So, this is the same picture of the total continuous section. The total continuous structure. And if you take a look at the interface of the A and B, A is red and B is green. And so here you will see the interface of A and B. And the interface of A and C is as in this picture. And the interface of the B and C is as in this picture. And you can see a blanch line here. A blanch line here, here, and here, and here. Now, around the blanch line, you see a part of the blanche surface, this one, and this one, and this one. Okay, and this is totally content structure. And so we are seeing. So, we assume that each domain is a neighborhood of the 3D net. So, first, we like to give a relation between total control structure or bicontier structure and the 3D net. And the 3DNet is for the 3DNet. There are many research on 3DNet. And the next speaker, Professor Evas, has many beautiful results on this subject. Subject. And for the bicontained spatum, we have the following observation. If you consider a 3D net with two components, then that will give you by continuous pattern a unique optical ISOP. Once you fix the 3D net with two components as in this picture, then by containers pattern, which gives the neighborhood of these two networks, is determined after I step. So, for example, if you have these networks, 3D nets, then this is the bicondes button. The bicontinence button corresponding to the network. And if you prepare a bicontinence button first, then that will give you a 3D net up to some moves. The move is called XI and IX move, as in this picture. So up to these moves, there is a one-to-one correspondence of the 3D nets and the biocontinence pattern. Swedinets and the biocontinence pattern. So if you like to classify biocontinence pattern, maybe you can use 3DNets to classify by continuous pattern. And in case of the total continuous pattern, things get a little complicated. You need some move. If you fix a 3D net with a three component, that is. The three components that will give you a three-continence button you need up to some move, and the sum move is called IHHI move. So you need to change the total continuous pattern as in this picture. So this move is called IEH and HI move of the total continuous pattern of large surface. And if you prepare a toy continuous pattern, then To equate this pattern, then the network is determined up to the same one, Ix and XI move. So, this is a correspondence of the two conditions pattern and the network. So, the classification of the two connected buttons can be done by using a classification of the switching net. Of the switching that. So, using this result, we have the following problem. The first one is that you have to characterize what kind of 3D nets, which 3D nets corresponds to a three-continuous pattern. You have to prepare some good 3D networks. Some good 3D net with good property to have this kind of structure. And next problem is a classification of the 3D nets. And if you consider a fundamental domain, that corresponds to a classification of the spatial graph in a three-dimensional torus. And we will discuss this in the following half of my talk. Of my talk, and also we are interested in ID conformation of the 3D nets. So, you have entanglement of the several networks, and we don't know what is the ID conformation of the switching nets. So, giving definition of the ID conformation and giving a characterization is a good problem for this subject. For this subject. Okay, so even if you prepare the same network, you might have a different entanglement for the 3D nets. Okay, next we will use the 3D measure topology for a study of the biocontinence pattern and the totally continuous pattern. So first we define the three-dimensional torus, which is given by the By the this one, the S1 times S1 times S1, and that is obtained by identifying the phases of the curve as in this picture. And you will have a CD mesh torus. And if you have a biocontinuous pattern that has a tripodic structure, then you have a decomposition of the 3D meshotora. Uh, decomposition of the three-dimensional torus into several two parts. Now, actually, the part will be a handle body. Handle body is a three-dimensional manifold, as in this picture. So, the boundary is a global surface, and inside is field that is called hundred body. If you have a bi-continuous pattern, you will have a decomposition of the three-dimensional torus into two hundred body. And the decomposition of the three-dimensional space. Of the three-dimensional space into 200 body is called Higger splitting. So if you have a biocontinence pattern, you will have a Higger splitting of the three-dimensional torus. And the component splitting of the three-dimensional torus is characterized as follows. The genus C Hega splitting is unique up to homeomorphism, and also genus N hela splitting is unique up to homeomorphism. And applying this result, And applying this result, we will have a topological characterization of the bicontinuous pattern. And we can say that the two bicontinuous patterns are isotopic in a three-dimensional space. It's a topological characterization. But I think the geometrical characterization is very important. So it's a very rough characterization. So it is good to consider this structure using This structure using a minimal surface and characterizing it using geometry is very important. And if you consider a totally quantitative pattern, you will also have a decomposition of the three-dimensional torus into several hundred bodies. And we need to define some new concept that is called hundred-body decomposition. A handle-body decomposition is a decomposition of the three-dimensional manifold into several hundred-body. Dimensional manifold into several hundred bodies. And we assume that the intersection is a compact surface. And if you decompose the three-dimensional manifold into 300 bodies, you will have a value surface as a decomposition. And this concept is also defined by Kenny, and that is called a trisection. Trisection. And the trisection of decomposition, but you need to assume that the intersection of the two-handed body is a connected surface. So if you decompose the three-dimensional torus into three handled bodies, and that is called a handle body decomposition, and we also define the type using a genus of the handled body. Genus is a number of the whole of the handled body. So in this case, you will have a 222. You will have a 2 to 2 and overdeecomposition. So, this is a 3 continuous structure, and as we assume that each domain is a neighborhood of the network, you will have a handle of the decomposition of the 3D measure torus. And for this example, you will have a little complicated decomposition, and that is a 555 hundred-body decomposition of the three-dimensional torus. And to characterize 2D container structure, you have to characterize a handover decomposition of the 3D mission to us. And this is an example of some characterization. So if you consider very simple decomposition, for example, type 111 decomposition. Type 111 decomposition, that is the decomposition of the soi dimension torus into three soy torus, then we can show that the decomposition is unique up to homeomorphism. And if you consider a corresponding total continuous structure, then we can say that the 111 totally continuous pattern is unique up to S2P. This type is also defined by a type of the underbody decomposition of the three. underbody decomposition of the 3D mature torus. So if you consider such a decomposition, we can say that it's unique. But if you consider a little complicated one, so increase the genus by one, you have two to two totally continuous structure and or two to two handle vertical composition. And actually, in this case, the composition is not unique. And you have And you have several decompositions. And so these are examples of the 2 to 2 to decontinence pattern. So if you prepare a 2 SQL network and you put it in a good way, you find two different frequencies buttons. Okay, so and we like to characterize those and we will use And we will use some kind of operation for characterization. The operation is called stabilization or destabilization. And for the handle decomposition, for the handle-body decomposition of the SOI manifold, we show that if you prepare two handle-body decomposition of the same manifold, and in this case, we assume that the number of the handle-bodied three. Number of the handle is three, then we can show that those are stable equivalent. That is, uh, that means that those two decompositions will be isotopic after applying a several number of the stabilization, which I which we defined now. So, here we will consider two stabilization. That is, first one is a type one, type zero stabilization and And that will give you this one, is a type 1 stabilization. So here you have the two parts of the same handle body H chain, and you prepare some arc connecting the two parts. And you make a tunnel, and that will increase the genius of HJ by one, and also that will increase the genus of this part by one. Genus of this part by one, and that is called stabilization. And you have another hand of the decomposition of the same manifold. And also type 1 stabilization is as in this picture. Here you see two parts of the H, the same hundred body, and here is an arc connecting those two parts. And you make a tunnel. And you have another handle body decomposition. And now the G. And the genius of this part is increased by one. And we show that by applying these moves, two hundred body decommission will be safely equivalent. And as a coloury, we can show that if you prepare two totally continuous patterns, then if you do the similar moves as this, and after a finite number of sequence of this. After a finite number of sequence of this civilization, we can show that those two totally quantity buttons will be isoto weak. So we can use these to characterize to make example of the total continuous pattern or do the characterization. For example, this 555 total continuous pattern can be also can be obtained from a very simple From a very simple ancom structure by a finite number of sequence, finite number of sequence of the stabilization. So this is a stabilization pathway. So from a honeycomb 111 to the contest structure, by finite sequence of stabilization, you will have this structure. If you consider polycontinental structure with finite maybe n domains, then you also have to consider decomposition of the three manifold with n hundred bodies. And in this case, you use polyhedron, as in this picture, to decompose the three manifold. So, this is an example. So, this is an example of the four continuous patterns. And each domain is a neighborhood of the SRS network, and you prepare four of those. And interface of the domains will so in this case you have a branch or branch will also become a network, and the branch is a two-diamond network. Diamond network. And to consider this structure, you consider handle body decomposition of the solid motion manifold with n handle bodies, as in this picture. And we also have and if you consider a four-continuous pattern, we also have an example of the two distinct Polycontinence pattern with the same type. So here is a full continuous pattern and which both have the type 111. And we also have a stabilization theorem for the decomposition of the switch emission manifold with n handle bodies. So for those cases, you need several moves. Several moves and this the supervision I showed late I showed these two and you need 02 move and two zero move and also two three move and three two move so it's a little complicated but we have a stabilization theorem for the polycontinental structure And so this is stabilization, and actually we can discuss the polymeric meaning of the stabilization as follows. If you have this structure, here you have three domains, this domain one and two and three. One and two and three, and suppose you have a tunnel of the as in this picture, and if you elongate the material as in this uh as in this way, then uh this part will be uh separated and the separation of the domain happens. Then you have this picture, so and this is uh corresponds to the destabilization of the to equal disputes, and that can be considered. And that can be considered as a deformation of the domain in the elongation of the material. Okay, so the summary of the talk. So we consider the microphase separation of the block copolymer using three-dimensional topology. Especially we use the handle-body decomposition of the three-dimensional torus to analyze such a structure. And we show that the two we show that the two polycontinence pattern can be transformed we can transform one to the other using a stabilization operation so that's the end of my talk thank you very much for your attention thank you koya that was very beautiful are there any questions that you can raise your hand or just unmute and have a question So, for the Hagar genus of the three Taurus, the three number three is the lowest. If you do two handlebodies, but when you did three handlebodies, you could get lower than three. You get one, right? So, what's the lower bound for the lowest number you can get for the handle body decomposition? So, C2S has 111. So, in this case, you can decomposition. You can decompose the switch mentioned Torah with three sweet toras. So I think this is the simplest.
