So today I'd like to explain some recent progress on the spectrum of the CI Anit operator. And this is outline of this talk. First, I will give my basic definition and motivation of the machine. Motivation of my work. And next, I will explain the height milk controls. This is a very important and useful tool for studying analysis the properties of differential operators on GR mindful. And using this, we are I explain the properties of the spectrum of the CR point operator. And the property is very different whether the CMIFO is envelopable or not. So with an envelope case, and the next part I put a non-envelope case, I will give some true. I will give some future open process. So we give a quick introduction. I think that this is the first time to give the definition of a CR mindful. So CR mindful is roughly speaking the one real dimensional armor of a complex mindful. And the BREC M is a two transport dimensional mindful. Most one dimensional smooth manifold and CR structure or N is a rank, complex rank and sub-bundle of the complex by tangent bundle. Satisfy these two conditions. So the Q10N, the intersection of Q10N and its complex conjugate is consists only of a zero vector. And the rebracket of two sections of T1, zero n is also a section of Q1. Is also section of G1 known as an integravitive condition. If the manifold is dimension to n, then the this boundary defines the structure of a complex manifold on n by the well-known neural mouse. So, this is a natural generalization to real automation. Dimensional case. And we call the pair M1 T10M is called a CR micro. A typical example of a CR micro is a real hypersurface in a compact microphone. It has a canonical CR structure defined by the holomorphic tangent model for the complex microphone. And in this talk, I assume the convexity strictly should convex key. So we assume that there is a nowhere but There is a nowhere vanishing real pump form feeder such that feed annihilates the CR structure Q10F. Then the random form feeder is the Harmitian form on the CR structure defined by this homilo. And a CR manifold MT10F is said to be strictly sudden contact. Is said to be strictly pseudo-complex if there is CT, hatred is function, such that the red form with respect to CT is positive definite. And we call the triple M T1 to M C the a pseudo-Hamitian mindful. And I remember the condition error stator is positive definite in Filter is the definition implies that this feature defines a contact form on M. So a strict convex C and manifold has the underlying contact structure. And also, the raviform is positive definite Harmitian form, so we can define a Harmitian metric on the CR structure or in topics concrete and Explain the invisibility. So red M is a 10 plus 1 dimensional. Now here we assume a closed strictial convex C and micro. And M is said to be embeddable if there is an embedding project for some complex embedding from M to some complex Euclidean space such that the Such that the image of the CR structure is contained in the holomorphic tangent bundle of the complexly reaction space. So it is asked whether where M is enveloped. So it is a remarkable result by Jamon Bell. So if n is greater than or equal to 2, what Is greater than or equal to 2, or equivalently, the dimension of manifold is greater than or equal to 5 and must be envelopable. On the other hand, Lucy found non-environable 3CGL3 manifold by perturbation of the standard 3-sphere. And I will It's fine. And I will I will uh explain this example later. And more after that, this is the rule of statement, but a generic 3R3 minus no available. For example, the band and exchange shows that the uh generic deformation of the standard CR sphere, C standard C3 sphere, is more embeddable. We still is not embeddable and there. And also result from contact to GM3. So, for example, on the 3 sphere, there are infinitely many contact structures. But the only standard one are the means and the double CL structure. So basically the so the dimension is greater than or equal to five and three is very different and visibility. So then we next uh consider when the three manifold three CR manifold is available. So to do this with uh contact points on a three mesh are called CR six sudo convex. CL specific CNIPO. Then we can define the d bar b. This is the CL underline of d bar in complex geometry. So take a smooth function u, then take a external derivative and restrict to t01m. This is the section of the dual of t01n. And the bundle T01 is the. Uh the bundle T01M, the divarable T01M has a Hermitian metric by rare before. So we can take the a formal adjoint of D by B. Then we can define the common Laplacian D by B, D by B is the so this is the CM1 log of the D by Laplace and compression geometry. But this conflation is not This convaplation is not a rhetoric. In fact, this operator is not even hyperlinked. So it is this analytical cornerplace and it is very difficult to study. But this corner of Russian is related to embeddability. To embed ability, this is proved by Buddha Monber and Kong. The three manifold, the three CR manifold is environable if and only if the Commonplacian has the unique self-adjoint intertension, so we use the same symbol, then the Con Laplacian has a close, M is and w if once only. M is embeddable if and only if the correlation has closed range. So the range of the correlation is a closed subspace of the L2 space. So we define two operators. The S is the orthogonal projection to the panel of the corner plasma. This is known as TF projection. And if envelopable, the length of the corner plastic is closed, so we can define the green operator. We use n for this operator. So the emailability the emailability of the CR3 minefoil is closely related to the To the spectrum of the corner processing. So we next explain the CL PAN interpretation. The PAN interpretation conformal geometry has been has appeared many talks. But a CL point operator is defined, not defined, but Not defined, but uh so red M is a three-meter closed chief Hampton manifold, then the CR type of data is observed from this. So this is con Laplacian and this is the complex conjugate plus rural data written in terms of the Tanaka web star correction and torsion. So this operator acts on the space of smooth functions. So this operator has the following properties. So P is a first-order and real and formally self-adjoint linear partial differential available. And under the conformal change of the contact point, it is a very good transformation role. A P-hat is a fearpunch of very capability to see. So, in particular, this transformation rule implies this integer, this integral, u is a smooth function, and u times pu integrate of m is independent of the choice of the similar to anitopta in conformal geometry, but for the next two properties defined. So, P is not. So P is not hypothetical. So this means PU smooth does not imply U is smooth. And also the kernel of the shear point operator may be infinite dimensional. So if our operator is elliptic and the manifold is closed, the current any elliptical vector is of course hyper elliptic and course hyper elliptic and on any closed manifold elliptic the current of elliptic of theta is a finite dimensional so this is a social different spectrum in Laplacian over points of delta is conformal geometry and this operator is related to some important problems in CR geometry first uh Sabun Chaniro and the Komrinqi are From Rinchi 202012 proved that this score is not Riemannian score coverage. This is a score curvature with respect to tan-co-webstack connection. And the score curvature is positive and the CL planet operator is non-negative, then N is embeddable. So embeddability is related to the CL Parnit operator. Directed to the CR panic operator. And also, this operator is related to CR Yamabi problem. So, CR Yamabi problem is find the minimizer of the CR Yamabi functional in a given app under the conformal change of the concept form. And Jinchen and Andrea Malativity and Polyang 2017 proved that the score power is possible. Prove that the score power is positive and the CL point of beta is non-negative, then there exists a minimizer of the CL Yammabi function. So they prove that under V2 conditions, the CR positive mass several holds. And using this, they found they proved the existence of the V minus. And so uh uh I other remark. I have a remark. So it is a crucial difference between conformal and C one of the crucial difference between conformal and CRG and three. The same also found three dimensional CR modes that does not admit the minimizer of CRM RV functional. So in conformal geometry, So in conformal geometry, so any dimension like P are the macro and solved affirmatively. But in dimension in dimension uh three in three geometry the the CR Yamabi program has not has a counter example. Which condition was not sexual? Not satisfied. Yes, so in this example, uh fear point operator has negative eigenquery. But I would say positive, but uh fear point operator has a negative eigenquery. That's about your result. That's something explained afterwards by you, right? Yeah, yeah. So this is also the example. This CRMIFO is a CRIFO contract. A fear might lossy, and I will explain a little bit. So the definition and properties. And so moreover, the kernel of P is linked to the CRQ curvature and the relating similarity of the C kernel is appearing in the Kengo's talk. So uh this operator is related to This operator is related to many important CRP CR geometry. However, P is not hypertric, so we cannot apply matrix theory or alphabetically like CL Yammer V operators. And so it is difficult to study from the CL Panic operator. So this is, we would like to know, so B is not high. So B is not hypertic, it is even non-trivial whether it has a 3-fajoint extension or it's unique or not. So P is a formal surfad joint equivalent as a symmetric operator, but the self-adjoint extension existent is non-trivial. And if so, I can show that we can show the self-adjoint. We can show the self-adjoint extension. Then, what about the spectrum? So, this is also the bigger problem. So, if M is close, the spectrum may have a continuous spectrum or relief spectrum. And I also study the planetary of eigenfunctions of the CL pine subject. This is So we want to know topics of we are to know. Question. We next explain the high-level properties, but this uh definition is very complicated and we explain only its property. So let's say here M is a for general Here M is a for a general to enforce one measure approach or pseudo-Hungary microphone. And the heightened value paragraph is the theory of pseudo-differential operators that reflect the CR structure. So the usual pseudo-differential operator sees all directions the same. But in the CR structure, there is a direction to horizontal direction and Horizontal direction and transverse to the con uh contact structure direction. So it's if diff defined. So we need to consider we need to use the theory of shoot differential this property. Let's rewrite this symbol by the space of heigen. We have to differential operators for all the n. Example, so uh vector phi uh so this is a this is a space of uh complicated contact structure. So horizontal direction is we count faster, but uh rare vector field is transverse the contact structure, so we can we consider this red vector field second order. Of the second-order operator. But equivalently, so that phase of pseudo-differential differential operator is at the most M's derivative direction to horizontal derivative to horizontal direction. And we explain some properties of the height and well curve. So any So any operator A is a map since Smooth function to Smooth function continuously and the space of this isometric differential operator is closed and complex conjugate and adjoint and transpose. And the union of the and if n is And if n is become larger, the disk space is also larger. And order m1, a composition of order m1 and order m2 is order m1 plus m2. I think this statement. And the intersection of all space, all the high-den vector space. Embarrass the space is equal to the space of smoothing operator. And so if M is non-positive, A can be extended to a subref space, Hs, to Hs minus half of M. So if the usual For the usual functional vector, this is minus m, but we change the counting of the order. So, let vector field we consider two second order. So, this affects the loss of regularity. But in particular, so if If M is negative, A is Map L2, A defines the continuous operator L2 space and this is compact by a remote. I will use these properties later. So, by using this, we explain the spectral angle of panic operator. So, we first consider the whole embeddable case. So, red m t1 below m is an embeddable to the convex CR manifold and C ta is a contact form. So I said in the introduction, I said in the introduction, if available, then the cornlaplacium has growth range. So we can define the segue projection and the green operator of the cornerplacian. And this operator defined by using the theory of functional analysis. But we can show that this second projection is a first order and zero order and win operator is minus two order either we should differential operator if proved by a Belgian granular and by using these two operators we obtain uh g0 on the order minus four such that satisfying this Satisfying this equation and here 2 dot A to A to the B means that A minus B is a smoothing operator. So since P is not elliptic, P has no parametrics, but here Here, this S class S verb is contained, the range of S class S verb is contained in kernel P. So this means that the module colour P has a parameter X. And so this implies that this essentially self-party. This means that a closure in A closure in the sense of functional analysis is the self-adjoint. Or equivalently, T has a a unique self-adjoint extension. And each extension has a close range. The close range means zero is the isolated point in the spectra. Well we can define the projection to the corner of the CL point operator, pi, and the green operator of P. Since P is very close, we can define the green operator as a continuous linear operator. And then we can show that pi is equal to s plus s bar. equal to S plus S bar module smoothing operator and G is equal to G0 module smoothing operator. So in particular, a pi is a so S dash S bar is a zero so high dimensional differential product of all the zero. So so is pi. Similarly, G is And similarly, G0 is high-demand value should operate that with order minus 4. So this implies g is a order minus 4. Well, it is not really a whether pi or g marks smooth function to smooth functions in we use a function cut analysis, but this implies. But this implies, for example, pi or g maps, pi or g maps, smooth functions to smooth functions. And by using this, we accommodate this real. So first, the spectrum of the CL prime operator is discrete in CRI. And for any non-zero eigenvalue lambda, the corresponding eigen space is a finite dimensional space. Space is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of finite dimensional and subspace and consists of smooth functions. And I also we can also see that the kernel of the CL partic operator that is smooth is dense in the Dense in the old corner. This was first short proved by Jing Yu Xiao in 2015 by Yip. He uses a printable operator with complex phase. And I proved this result and I generalized to higher dimension. So I also generalize to higher dimension. So critical DGMS operator in CR case. That in CR case. This is an important result. And as I said in the introduction, non-negativity is important in several programs in CR geometry. So in explains a non-negativity. Inexpress non-negativity on embeddable case. So red M is a embeddable pseudo-convex CR, actually pseudo-convex CR micro. And that this is very non-trivial result, that if M is invertible, there will be complex two-dimensional projective manifold X and the domain X, such that M is M is isomorphic to the boundary of this domain as CL rivals. This is this has been proved by Rambett in 1995. So in fact for we identify M as the boundary of the domain of omega. Then in X take a asymptotically complex hyperbolic care form, career metric on the interior of omega. So I so we use the information of the interior to show the negativity of the CR point separator. And since P are CR point of it are the real real and self-adjoint, it suffices to show the non-negativity for the real value function and take the, so we take the real value smooth function on the boundary and take a harmonic extension with respect to this Kerala metric. And this Kerala metric is diverges at the boundary. Diverges at the boundary, so the Laplacian between this matrix is degenerate. So the existence of the harmonic extension is non-trivial, but this has been proved by Keppstein, Merrow, and Mendoza in 1991. Then uh then oh we can see. So you can see the DDCU, the square of DDCU children is non-positive on point-wise on omega. So we can see that consider a complex Hessian of the utilitarian. And if we take a normal coordinate, harmonic condition is in the trace. In the trace of A is zero, then a Hamisha matrix, two times two Hamisha matrix with trace three, must have the determinant of such a matrix must be non-positive. This is an elementary in algebra. So this four-four is not positive. 4, 4 is non-positive pointwise, so the integral is also non-positive. And by using stock service, we can the integral of some three form on the boundary is not positive, and this is not really term tensor curve implies that. calculus imply that this in the integral of this free form is equal to minus u times p u the integral u times p u so the integral of u times p u is non-negative so that this implies the spectrum of the CL point operator on in no envelope is is so the CRP of beta on n beta CRI hold is non-negative, always non-negative. And also if the equality holds, then EDC U tilde is identically zero. So the colour we can determine the colour of the participation. Here plus a beta explicitly. So the CL3 harmonic function is reflected in the boundary value of the free harmonic function. So this is to result for embeddable case. So the spectrum is a discrete subset here in this interval. And and except zero, each eigen space is finite dimensional and every eigen function is smooth. This is envelopable case. So next is so I would like to explain what happens when the no embed double case. Yeah, so we assume that non-MBW MBWT is equivalent to the range closedness of the convertion. So if we consider non-MBWCR14, the corner placian is not range closed. And so the green operator does not exist. However, there exists There are this uh formal Sega projection S zero and uh formal green predator N zero such that satisfying these equations. And so if S0 is the actual SA projection and N0 is the actual mean of data, these equations call for equality. But But here, this is module all-property module smoothing operator. This operator has been constructed by Biz and Greener about the bulk of Heisenberg purpose. Then, for each non-zero complex number rounder, Roundup, let's define the R rambler by this formula. And this is this rambler, this R rambler is 0 of all that 0. So this operator defines that continuous operator is continuous on L2. And definition and the term computation show that P shows that P minus lambda i times a computation of P minus lambda I lambda is equal to identity plus K lambda. And K lambda is a homomorphic family of identity to the differential operators of order minus one. I'm using this Using this equality, we can show that so if there is a adjoint in the sense of function analysis, so the domain of the P star is L2 function at that Pu in the distribution sense is in L2. But by using this But by using this by using this equality, we just showed that uh the any function in this space must be smooth. And so the domain of p is uh contains function. So this is if this equal. If this equals V over 10, this equals E. And these are symmetric or formally self-adjoint. This basically equal to 0. So the kernel of p star plus minus square root of minus 1 is equal to 0. And this is, and this means that p is essentially 35. P is extensively surprised by it. This is purely a result from functional analysis. So, P, the closure of the P is self-adjoint. So, and it is a unique self-adjoint extension. So, we use the same symbol P for the self-adjoint extension. And since P is a self-adjoint, we use Technology, we may assume that the i plus k square root of minus 1 gifting particle by adding a smoothing operator to this Ranger artificial technique is uh discrete subset sigma in Great subset sigma in C set minus 0 such that I trust K lambda is invertible for any lambda that not doing sigma and for any lambda in sigma the this true space is finite dimensional and Finite dimensional and other space of the space of smooth functions. This flows from the analytic frame function. Analytic frame function that consider holomorphic primary of the compact operators on some domain. And assume that for some point I plus k parameter is inversible, then there is a discrete subset such that discrete subset such that outside the discrete subset, I plus k lambda is always invertible. And I plus k lambda is a thread home operator. So if it is not invertible, then the kernel and kernel is finite dimensional. And the smoothness is followed from the k random is a finite is minus or the minus one. So by a by a bootstrapping argument, any eigen function any function in this here is smooth. And in particular, if lambda is not doing sigma, this operator is continuous and defined give the inverse of p minus lambda i. So we can show this result. So the spectrum set minus zero is contained in this figure since we can explicitly construct the inverse of p minus lambda i. So the spectrum of p minus p set minus zero is discrete in r set minus zero. And also So any point in the spectrum is an eigenvalue. And also for each eigenvalue, the eigen space is finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. So this is because Use uh this use this take the con take your con com take the conjugate uh take in our joint uh lambda minus lambda i is equal to i plus k rambled star so the kind of p minus lambda i is contained in i plus k lambda star and and this the kind of And this the current of this space is finitely dimensional and smooth. So we obtain this result. This proof is not my original one. This proof is inspired by results of the Barzan at the stein. They prove that the Pongra Brushian has only eigenvalues by a similar eigenfundable case we also see that some non-embedible examples process P we consider unit sphere Unit CI C2, then it has a canonical distribution convexity structure T1, 0, S3, and this is spanned by vector field globally, this vector field 0. And of course, this S3 is embeddable. This is because this is a real pipeline service in C2. And for NOM0, uh, for HD, Uh for H D we define the loss sphere by at the manifold it is S three and the C L structure is part of T L bar. So this T is equal to zero this is standard C L structure on sc three. And it is known that that this loss C R is not available. This is because uh If is with t one cell CN then f x equals f minus x so any component of the m map uh preserving Map uh preserving the CR structure is uh even function. So we can construct an embedding by using by uh embedding satisfying this condition. So I consider a spectra of the C alkanitop data on this. kinds of data on this non-MBW example. To do this, also take the SHK is a space of superficial harmonics of degree K. Then it is known that the L2 space of S3 has this organ decomposition. And the three advantage operator on each Pan is operated on each lossphere marks this SHK to this cell. So we obtain a family of linear operators on finite dimensional linear space. And more sim to simplify the argument, we take a more small subspace. For each possible integer error, Positive integer L and V J L is defined by this formula and this is a spherical harmony of degree to L minus 1. Then this V one to V L is uh linear linearly independent and spotlight. Define the linear subspace of SH2L minus 1 of dimensional L. And the sphere panel operator is closed in this space. So the sphere panel operator maps Doul to Bouille. And the D space has a good basis, Bouillon to Bouille. So we can write down the matrix of the Down the matrix of this operator, it is become a pentadium matrix. So by using induction, we can compute the determinant of this matrix. So Cl is positive number, and minus Cl times Cl times T 12 over 1 minus T over T over 12. And so if T is non-zero and if is positive, so this means that if T is non-zero, the determinant is negative. And so this implies that the this matrix That this matrix has at least one negative eigenvalue for each L. And L is an arbitrary positive integer, so we can see that the CL points of beta on the Ross sphere have infinitely many negative eigenvalues. And as I said, the Like the previous slide, the for each eigen space, non-zero eigen space is high-end. So we can check that the negative eigenvalue with infinitely have the field points of it has infinitely many negative eigenvalues without much pristine. It's an exam uh very most simple example of the non-embedden CMOP. And the last I will talk about the future works. So previous sections how we check the Section: We check the fear point operator on the Rossi sphere has infinitely negative eigenvalue, but I don't know how the distribution of the negative eigenvalue. There are three possibilities. One so the spectrum is bounded from below. Then there Then, there P know that there are infinitely many negative eigenvalues, so it must be accumulated to zero. So, in particular, P the range of P is not crossed by P. So go to there is an accumulation, there is an isolated but spectrum is not bounded from there. And the third one is both hard. So pectram is not bounded from also accumulation point. There are three possibilities. There are three possibilities. And I calculation by using some mathematical using show that the spectrum of the bound of this value. And the important point is this part. And the point is this bound this boundary is independent of L. So I ho so I speculate that this is we also have the actual spectrum of the CR point of vector is bounded from below by this constant. But for I think this This is I expected this this one happens, but I have no idea to prove. And so I only see the one example, so Rossi Spia. So what happens when the other non-valuable C are mine for us? So the China So the Chino-Chiyang result, I explained in the introduction, imply that M is techno-embeddable and sparrow tapja is positive, then the CL operator has at least one negative eigenvalue. But this does not imply infinite remaining initiative eigenvalue, existence of infinite remaining negative eigenvalue. And apart from this, almost nothing is known. And recently, Park Ten Ho in Tangan University and I have found some examples of non-environable traditional convex CR structures on three to graph, such that the scroll curvature is positive and the CR point operator has infinitely many negative eye-incurses. So I speculate that at least the score cover positive case, P ma non-evidability implies the existence of infinitely many negative eigenvalues. But uh I have another uh idea to idea to improve this for general settings. Um this is the summary of this talk. So P is so my P is the point so beta is must be essentially self-adjoint if for embeddable if embeddable case both embeddable and non-embeddable case. Um if embeddable the spectrum is con is contained in this interval Is contained in this interval and discrete. And if no n valuable, that if v equals zero, that it is a discrete. And so if non-mb double zero, zero may be an accumulation point. And both mb double and non-m double case, for each non-zero eigenvalue, the kernel are the eigenvalues. The connect or the eigenspace, corresponding eigen space, is a finite-dimensional subspace of the base of semester functions. And future work, so P for a non-M V case, so P range growth. So if M below uh P is non-negative, so it is bounded from zero by zero. So far, how about the non-M-bedged case? So bound P is bounded from zero or not. From Berl or not. And also this example of the WCR manifolds such that P has infinitely finite negative ideas. So particularly, so I don't know I have no example of a non-embedible CL manifold with non-negative CL panic operator. No negative CR panic operator. So finite contains uh the cave here. That's why I stop here.
