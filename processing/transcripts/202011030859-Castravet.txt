Okay, that's probably long enough. Well, welcome back. Hopefully, you can distract yourself from all the goings on in the world today with some nice mathematics. Mathematics. It's our pleasure to have Anna Maria Castrovet from Versailles, who's going to tell us about exceptional collections on modulized basis of stable rational curves. Okay, thank you very much for this invitation. It's an honor to speak in this workshop. So I want to tell you about this work on exceptional collections, invariant exceptional collections on M0 and Bar. So everything I'll mention is a joint work with Zenya Tevalov. With Jenna Tevelov. Yeah, so just to recall, we're going to look at the model space M0N bar. So this is a compactification of M0N without the bar. So this is a configuration space of n distinct points ordered on P1 taken up to the action of PGL2. And we're taking the Delhi Bamford Knudsen compactification. The Libaum for Knutsen compactification, which is a Fantorial compactification. We are adding, we are compactifying this quasi-projective variety by adding some strata corresponding to reducible curves, stable curves. And so we're looking at really just the trees of P1s with n distinct smooth points on them, and such that the log canonical line bundle is ample. So every So, every P1 has to be marked by at least three points, which can be also nodes. So, this is the genus zero case of the Lee-Manford model spaces. And so we have an action of the symmetric group which permutes the markings. And okay, and so now you can actually describe the space more concretely. The space more concretely, but you will then lose the symmetry. So, for example, if you fix three of the points to be zero, one, and infinity, then the configuration space is just the choice of another point on P1. And then the natural compactification is M0 is P1. And you can actually generalize this in a slightly different way, still in an asymmetric. Uh, okay, still in an asymmetric way. So, this is a theorem of Kapranov: that uh, M0M bar is an iterated blow-up of a projective space in dimension n minus 3. You blow up n minus one general points, which you can fix up to automorphism of p n minus three. And then you take all the all the lines spanned by them, the proper transforms, and you blow them up, and you continue in this way with the planes and all the linear subspaces spanned by the points. So, Picard number is becoming a Is becoming exponential in n. So that's, I guess, one reason why this is a hard space to work with. And then I should say here, yeah, that here there were only n minus one points appearing. And so this is due to the fact that the blow-up map, the map from n to the to p n minus three, the one that blows up all these points on linear subspaces, is coming from a choice of a marking. And so it's A marking, and so it's if you make a different choice, then you have two different descriptions as a blow-up, and then the two are related by a cremona transformation, a standard cremona transformation. And so this is not an SN invariant description, it's actually Sn minus one invariant. Yes, okay, and so to be more precise, this map here is given by a big and map here is given by a big and net line bundle, a tautological line bundle on M0N bar, coming from taking the line bundle whose fiber at the pointed curve is given by the cotangent bundle at the corresponding marking to the curve. The points are all smooth points on this curve. So it's a very natural lineball. And okay, and so a question of So, a question of Orlov and Manin was if you can actually find a full exceptional collection on M0N bar, which is also SN invariant. So, I will explain what this means. But so the answer is yes. This works for all n. Okay, and so okay, yeah, so I should first let me say some comments. me say uh um some consequences yeah so in particular this also um yeah so this is a this is about derived categories and um this yes a shadow of this is is the Grotendy group and as well the cohomology yeah so in particular you will get that you have a Grotendi group has a has a basis is a free abelian group which has a basis which is permuted by Sn and similarly And similarly, the same statement holds for the cohomology, let's say, with Russian coefficients. And okay, and so there is work, previous work that went into this direction of understanding the SN representation given by the cohomology of M0MR. So for example, Getzler studied the character of this representation and he gave some recursive formulas. He gave some recursive formulas. And then later on, Bergstrom and Minabe studied the length of this representation, again, in terms of he gave the recursive formulas. And so we're actually going to get inspired by this work of Bergstrom and Minabe and use a similar approach, which has to do with simplifications of M0M bar that come from Haset spaces of weighted stable rational curves. And so I think a natural question here that I didn't get. Question here that I didn't get asked is: Isn't it true that any representation of Sn is a permutation representation? So there are trivial examples like S2 acting on a vector space by sending a vector to minus the vector. But there are also more interesting examples. So for example, on the del Teto of degree two, if you consider the this is the degree two cover of P two given by the anti-canonical line bundle. Anti-canonical line bundle, and so this gives you an evolution. Uh, so an element of order two of the automorphism group. So you have an action of S2 on the cohomology of the Del Petro surface. And then it's not too hard, it's not maybe immediate, but it's not too hard to show that the reducible fibers of this map are coming from pairs of minus one curves that add up to minus k, and this evolution will exchange those and. Change those. And so it's not too hard to see that, for example, in the P car group, the signature of this action is 1, 7. So minus k is preserved. Then there are the minus 1 classes which are sent to minus themselves. And then there are the other degree 0, degree 2 parts of the cohomology. So the signature is 3, 7. And now this is not possible if you have a basis permuted by the action of S2. And so the basis will either send a vector to minus. The basis will either send the vector to minus itself or it will be fixed. So that means the signature has to be a b with a greater equal than b. Okay, so we got that out of the way. And then, so let me now recall what the full exceptional collection is. So, as I said, this is about the derived category of M0MBAR. Now, there are many people who studied the derived category of M0MBAR, starting with body and space. M0 MBA starting with Barines Mirnov and then Balat Faverukatsarkov. And so, okay, so I'll recall the basics. So everything will be oversea. Everything is oversea for us. You have a smooth projective variety, any smooth projective variety. And then you're looking for some kind of basis for the Groton D group, or let's say for the Groton group. So an object. An object in the direct category is exceptional, is there are no x except in degree zero from this object to itself. And then if you take an ordered collection of objects in the derived category, you call this an exceptional collection if there are no x at all from right to left. And then, yeah, so in particular, this implies that you have an independent sequence in the Sequence in the Grotony group. And then fullness just means that these objects also generate. So the smallest triangulated subcategory that contains these objects is the direct category. And so this also will give you then a basis of the Grotendi group when you take classes of such objects, modulo relations that come from distinguished triangles. So the three abelian group genetic by. So, the pre-abelian group generated by classes, by objects, and modeled by these relations come from distinct strongers. Okay. And so, in particular, if such a collection exists, a full exceptional collection, then you must have a Grodnik group that is a free abelian group. And the length of the collection is the rank of this group. So, the classical example is on PN. If you take the On Pn, if you take the line bundles O of N, so this is a full exceptional collection. And now exceptional collections on blow-ups exist due to a result of Orlov. So if you take again any smooth sub-variety, let's say fix the co-dimension to be n plus one, blow up x along y. Blow up X along Y, because here the exceptional divisor. So this is now a P unbundle over Y. Then the theorem is that from full exceptional collections on the center and the base of the blow-up, you get the same on the blow-up. So, and this is very explicit. You essentially take the twist, the dual of the collection I just wrote down for PN minus the minus the relative degree zero part and then add the all the pullback of the collection from x so this is enhances the formula that that we know from for the cohomology of a blow-up okay and so uh now putting these two together the this description of exceptional collections on blow-ups and capranov's description of m0 and bar uh you get immediately uh You get immediately that you will have a full exceptional collection on M0n bar. It's just not going to be Sn invariant, but rather Sn minus 1 invariant, just because the Kapranov description is Sn minus 1 invariant. So you start with Pn minus 3, you have a collection there, you blow up some points, then you blow up some lines. And at each step, you will be blowing up the proper transform of a linear subspace. So that means again, it's a blow-up. So that means again it's a blow-up of a projective space along points and lines. And so, inductively, by inductional dimension, you get a full exceptional collection on this iterated law. Okay. And so an example of how does this work for M05. So the order of collection, if you think of M05 as a blob of P2 along four points. But recall that the exceptional divisors in one of these Kapranov model maps come from boundary divisors. So, the boundary divisors delta I5. So, here delta I5 corresponds to the locus of reducible curves. So, with two components, two or three components, such that I and 5 are always on one component. They don't break apart. And so this. And so this is now this. I claim this is a P locus, this is a rational curve in M05, it's a minus one curve. And now the Kapranov map given by the fifth marking, the tautological line of psi five, will blow down exactly these four minus one curves. And so just by writing down the Writing down the collection in Orlov's theorem, you get four torsion sheaves. Yes, I forgot to say in Orlov's theorem, the first part is a torsion collection. Yes, those are things that are supported on the exception device that we push them forward to the blow-up. I write them just in this way as a torsion sheaf on the variety. So you have this O minus ones on the exception, on these four exceptions. The exception on these four exceptional, on these four minus one curves. And then you have, you can choose, for example, as your full exceptional collection on P2, just the collection given by O of one of two. This map is given by the tautological line moment psi five, so it's the pullback of O of one is psi five. And so this is exactly the pullback of the standard collection, say on P2. So we have three line bundles and four. Have three line bundles and four torsion sheaves. And now it's clear: this is S4 invariant. These objects here, S4 invariant means the collection. What happens with the collection? Does the collection stay the same once I apply this action? So these objects here will be permuted by S4. These stay the same. Instead, what we want is a collection which is S5 invariant. Collection which is S5 invariant. So I claim now that, for example, when you try to solve this problem, this is one example you can eventually come up with. So you have, there are three blocks in this. So there are seven objects. There is two vector bundles, the trivial line bundle. And so here, this third object is the sheaf of log differentials with poles along the boundary. Whenever you have a variety. Whenever you have a variety with a simple normal crossing divisor, you can look at the sheaf of log differentials with poles along this divisor. And so this is totally symmetric. I'm taking all the boundary here. So this is a symmetric rank two vector bundle. And then there are also this block of five line bundles, which are permuted. Of five line bundles which are permuted by the action of S5, and now these line bundles are just pullbacks of O of one by a forgetful map. So dec M05, you forget one of the markings, marking, the ith marking, and you contract if a component has fewer than the required number of points. And so these maps exist for all n yeah so now you So now you got the collection, one which is S5 invariant. Okay, and so the idea to, as I said, this is going to be based on, it will be inspired by some work of Bergstrom and Minabe. So that is to use Hazard spaces, namely, you can define some more general stability condition. Stability condition that in particular will also have M0M bar as an example, and this will allow us to get symmetric descriptions of M0M bar as a blow-up. Except we will have to pay the price that for symmetry, you will have to give up the fact that the locus you blow up is smooth. So you will actually break the symmetry by blowing up successively loci that intersect transversely. side that intersect transversely. So that's the idea. So we are now looking at, we're going to throw in some weights for each point, one rational number, and we're imposing that the sum of these weights is at least two. So then an a stable rational curve is again just like before you take a tree of P1s with some smooth points which don't need to be distinct a priori. This will depend on the choice of weights if they are distinct or not. And then we replace And then we replace the canonical line bundle with the low canonical line bundle. This is a Q line bundle, these are rational numbers. And then we require that this is ample. So again, just like before, this will come down to counting the points on each component. So I recall you that when you restrict the dualizing sheaf to a component of three of P1s, what happens is you take, you get happens is you take uh you get the the canonical of that p1 so of minus two and you twist by the number of nodes so if you have at least three nodes this will doesn't matter what you twist with after what are the weights um i should have said that weights are always positive yes i missed this here uh positive and less or equal than one um okay so yeah so this will be uh yeah so this is a real condition only when you have uh when you restrict to a component When you restrict to a component, like an M component where there is only one node, or some middle one where there are only two nodes. And then the other condition which is imposed just so that you have a nice inductive description of the strata of this model like space is that if some points coincide, we want to be able to replace that fat point with one single point, with the weight corresponding to the sum of the weights. So we will impose that. And so we will impose that if some points coincide, then you must have that the sum of the weights is at most one. And so then Hasset proved that there is a fine moduli space for a stable rational curves. There is a universal family. Okay, and then this any P1 with n distinct points on it will be a stable. So this will contain always, we're not changing anything on the Always, we're not changing anything on the configuration space. This will always be contained as a dense set, open set, and so we're only changing what the boundary is. And you can see this more clearly once you consider the so-called reduction maps, which would be crucial for us, is when you, the set of weights is so that each AI is weight AI is bigger than BI for each marking I. Then Then, what to get this map here, you just look at the universal family and you do semi-stable reduction. And so the only thing that will happen there is that you could have a curve with two or more components, such that on one side, the sum of the weights in the beginning was bigger than one, but then after you pass to B, the sum of the weights is less or equal than one. Of the weights is less or equal than one. So then this will become unstable in the target, and so it has to be killed. You have to contract all these points to this component, you have to contract it. And so that's the only thing that's going on. So you're contracting some boundary divisors, and these are prescribed by how A and B relate. So in particular, you will get M0M bar is like is the master space. Bar is like is the master space of all these spaces. It sits above all of them and it's an iterated blow-up of any such space. You can even break this down into smooth blow-ups at each step. You understand exactly what you blow up. And so you can also see here that there is a chamber decomposition given by the weights and these subsets and sums. And sums that sum up to one, those are the walls that you have to cross to change to have a change in the stability condition. So, in the interior of every chamber, your space is the same. So, you play with that a lot here. You can choose different weights and still have the same overlike space. Okay, so now there will be some key examples for us. And so, I'm glad I'll go through them slowly, but to To keep us motivated, let me say that these are the, that we are going to prove that this is enough. To consider just these examples will be enough for our problem. So we will want to construct invariant, full exceptional collections on these examples. And so one example is just one weight of one and then some something what I call very light points. Yes, some light points, meaning that. Meaning that I, well, their sum has to be bigger than two. So I cannot have that all these coincides here because then their sum would be at most one. But any other combination of these light points, I want that to be possible to collapse. And so it comes down to this inequality. And then, so yeah, so all but one of the light points may coincide, but not all. And of course, you have this one here, so you cannot. This one here, so you cannot make this point, which is the first marking here coincident to the point P1. This cannot coincide with any of the other points. And then again, it's not too hard to see that you cannot have two or more components, because then you will have a component with all the light, only light points on it. So that would be unstable. So these are we are just looking at P ones with n points. With endpoints, and now you can fix, for example, this first one that none of the other ones is allowed to coincide with. That's if that's infinity, then you're looking at n minus one complex numbers, not all of them equal. So if you fix one of them, say p2 to be zero, then you're looking at c n minus two more complex numbers, not all zero. Not all zero up to the action of up to automorphisms. So, this is actually you can see now this set theoretically. This is a projective space. It's not too hard to actually prove this is to construct a universal family over this that exactly describe this problem. And so, yeah, so in this case, the Baylin's own collection is gonna be an invariant full exceptional collection. Variant full exceptional collection with respect to any group. Okay. Should I are there any questions? Okay, so then the next key example is loss of money in spaces. So these were studies. Manin spaces. So these were studied by Losev and Manin. And they look at again a choice of two points with weight one. We'll call this the heavy points. And then there are L minus two light points. So arbitrarily light, so that any number of them can coincide. And they cannot coincide with the heavy points. And then we can prove that an A state. We can prove that an a-stable curve must be a chain of p1s in which the heavy points are at the end. So you cannot have a tree which is not a chain, because again, that means that you will have a component with only light points. And there is a Kapranov-type description that the Lossemani space is a blow-up. That the Loss-Manning space is a blow-up of a projective space along n minus two points, and then all the proper tensions of lines spanned by them, all the planes, and so on. So, but it's the same description as before, just with one point less. And so it's, in fact, we have two reduction maps here, given by reducing, for example, here you reduce, you keep the first. Reduce, you keep the first marking one, and then you keep reducing this weight until it becomes arbitrarily small. So you end up with the Caprano model we discussed before. And so this blow-up, this description given here, you can prove it using all that I said so far about the reduction maps and the stability, what A-stable means. Stable means and so that again, this is an asymmetric, it's a choice of one of these two points that gives you this bloody description, okay. So, okay, so an example here of an S2 by so here the action of S2 interchanges the heavy points, and then the action of S3, if N is five, interchanges. If n is 5, interchanges the light points. And so I claim now that this collection of line bundles is a full exceptional collection. It's clearly invariant under this action. Okay. And so there is then the last type of space is what I call the MPQ spaces. So this will be really. So, this will be related to GAT quotients. So, the key thing here is that P will stand for the number of heavy points. But, okay, number of heavy points, and then Q is the number of light points. But nevertheless, we want these heavy points to be as minimal as possible. So, the condition is that we want, so I'm writing the heavy points as a plus eta, where eta is arbitrarily small. Where eta is arbitrarily small, positive. And so as minimal as possible means that I want that, if I don't have this eta here, that means the sum of the weights is actually two. And so that is actually not allowed for the Hassel spaces. But yeah, so we want just a little bit more than that. And here we are allowing this P to be anything greater or equal than 2, and then Q can be. Than two, and then q can be anything starting with zero. So zero is actually an important case. And so then these relate to the GAT quotients of a product of p1s, so p plus q copies of them by the diagonal action of pgl2, where we choose this q line bundle on this product of p1s. So this is exactly what I would have here in the weights if I don't add this eta. weights if I don't add this eta. So it's the sum here adds up to two. So I take the GAT quotient. So I take a multiple, sufficiently large enough multiple of this, and then I take a unique PGL2 linearization. And so this is this GAT quotient. And there is always a birational morphism. And now this is actually an isomorphism if P or Q is. If P or Q is odd. So in this case, A stable will mean again that you have just a P1 marked by some points which may coincide. And then, yeah, so this is okay. This is the stability here in this case coincides with the stability in the GAT sense. And then if And then, if both P and Q are even, then the GAT quotient is singular. And this is the Kirwan designularization. So, we are blowing up the singular points of the GAT quotients. Okay, so this corresponds to a so you're going to have for every partition of the set of markings. Set of markings into sets with equal cardinality. So you will have a singular point in the GAT quotient. And so we're blowing these points. This map blows these points up. And the exceptional divisors of this are boundary divisors in this HACT space. So it's the boundary component where you have an A-stable curve. Have an A-stable curve which has two components, and each component is marked by this partition. And that will also automatically imply that you need the same number of heavy points on each side and the same number of light points. Okay, and so the case when Q is equal to zero, I'm going to redenote this. I'm going to just call it MP. Call it MP. So, this is the case when all the weights are heavy, but still as small as possible. And that comes down to exactly this condition here. A is 1 over r if p is 2r plus 1, and 1 over r plus epsilon if p is 2r, which is the same as 1 over r minus 1. So then I'll just repeat here that if p is odd, then this is the symmetric GAT quotient. And this is the symmetric GAT quotient with respect to a symmetric linearization. And then, if p is even, you're blowing up p choose two divided by two singular points. So, an example of this is M06 bar. So, this is actually the what I call here for p equals 6. So, we are in the even case. This is the single blow-up of the segregation. The symmetric JT quotient is the segregatubic in P4, which has 10 nodes and we are blowing up these nodes. And the boundary divisors of M06, there's 10 boundary divisors corresponding to the partitions of 6 in sets of 3, two sets of 3, and these are P1 times Q1. These are the exceptional divisors about the nodes. The nodes. And so then a full exceptional collection is the following. Again, this takes a bit of work, but it's not too hard. That you can try to reiterate what you did for M05 use these sheaves of log differentials. So there is one here. This is again the sheaf of log differentials of M06 bar. It's a rank 3 symmetric vector bundle. And then pull back the sheaf of log differentials. The sheaf of the log differentials from M05. So this is now six choices here: six ranked two vector bundles. And then the others are, so we're pulling back all of one by a forgetful map that forgets i and j markings. So there is six choose two of these. And then there is a symmetric line bundle, which is the you pull back all of one from p4 via this map phi. And then there is a new type of And then there is a new type of object which comes from these boundary devices that are contracted. And so here we're taking O minus 1 minus 1. Okay. So then the reduction theorem is that it suffices to find fully invariant exceptional collections on these examples. So this means that for M0N for all n. For m 0 n for all n, if you want a full exceptional collection, you'll have to find for all dimensions these you'll need invariant collections on all these spaces in all dimensions. But for a fixed n, the dimensions you need here are significantly smaller. Okay, so the idea here is that you can blow up M0N in a symmetric way, but without But without blowing up a symmetric smooth loci. So you just start with M0N, which is all the weights are equal to one, and then you reduce the weights in a symmetric way until you arrive at the symmetric JT quotient. And then along the way, each of these maps blows up some loci where some points coincide. And then this inductive structure on the facet spaces that they all can be. The facet spaces that they all can be identified. You replace the points that get identified with the sum of their weights. And so that happens when you hit the wall where the sum of the weights is one. And so the low side that you blow up have exactly this form. There is a bunch of ones, and then there are some other weights smaller than one. They don't need to be arbitrarily small. But at every step, you blow up all such. So these also intersect transversely, but you blow them up, all of them. But you blow them up, all of them, at this step, at one of these intermediate steps. And they, yeah, these laws intersect also transversely along loci with similar type. And then, so there will be a generalized or log theorem that works in this case as well, except now you need to understand full exceptional collections on these spaces. And so, again, you continue with them in the same way. So, let's say. With them in the same way. So let's say you have just one weight of one or two that will correspond to one of these cases, either the Caprano model, or if there are two, then it's a loss of money space. And then you reduce, again, you try to make the other weights as small as possible. So that's up to here. And then eventually you also want to reduce the heavy points, the ones, you want to reduce them as much as possible. So in that sense, the spaces that you have here are the minimal ones. Yeah, so then. Uh yeah, so then and then um so then now we we are done if we have a an invariant version of a law theorem uh and so I'm just gonna give an example of how this works let's say if you take uh two sub varieties of the same co-dimension intersecting transversely uh you blow them up in any order you obtain the same space and then these are the These are the exceptional divisors above the two sub-varieties. So these are themselves blow-ups. And then we will need, in the end, I guess consider E12 is the pre-image of the intersection of Y1 and Y2. And I'm also denoting Y empty set X. And so let's say if you have a finite group which permutes this. A finite group which permutes these sub-varieties, then you can look at the stabilizer of Yi's or their intersection. Yeah, so all the empty side that it was G. And then you take invariant collections, Gi invariant collections on each of the y1, y2, their intersection, and x. And then the claim is that this will work to it's very explicit. It's very explicit again, just like in Orlov's theorem, and this is an application of Orlov's theorem, in fact. Okay, so then we need to find collections on these spaces. So this took us a couple of years. This took us a couple of years. So, the first was the loss and money space. It does have an invariant full exceptional collection. And similarly, if you reduce the two ones, you obtain what I call the MPQ at P equal to. And this is, you can deduce the same result for this space using what you know about the loss of money in space. So, this is a very So this is a very explicit collection that generalizes the example for the dimension two that I gave before. So you have to generalize the psi classes and then consider pullbacks. So the approach there was essentially to just identify objects which we call caspido. So their push forward with respect to any forgetful map is zero. Forgetful map is zero. And so those are the ones that are new. All the other ones are pulled back by forgetful maps. So we tried this approach for M0M bar to find these cascadal objects, but so we didn't succeed with that. And so this is a different approach then for so for in the end you do have the spaces MPQ also have sp times sq invariant full exceptional collections for all p and q. For all P and Q. Okay. And so there are different types of objects that you will obtain here. So just like in the examples you had before, there will be some vector bundles. Yes, and then there will be some torsion sheaves. And then also some complexes. So the nicest case is when P is odd, you only get what I call the vector bundles. Get what I call the vector bundles FLE. So here L is an integer and V is a set of markings. And the range, there will be some appropriate range in each case. And so for when P is even and Q is odd, then already we were unable to find the collection just with the vector bundles. So we had to replace these torsion sheets here are very close to the vector bundles. Are very close to the vector bundles, but they are not vector ones. And then in the even case, there is one more block. So, okay, here the complexes are modification of the torsion sheaves that appear also in this case. But then there is also this torsion block of objects supported on the exceptional devices of our Kira on the singularization. Ana Maria, sorry to interrupt. I think Janos has a question in the chat. Yes. The chat, yes. Do you want me to read it? Or yes, please. Yes, so um, he says, Y1, y2 subsets of x, blow them up in any order. The spaces you get are not isomorphic for curves and threefolds, they differ by flops. Okay, so I'm saying that uh we're blowing up some things that intersect transversely, and I'm claiming that I get the same. Oh, it's not true. It's not true. Okay. But I mean, they differ by flops. So, as far as derived categories, they may be the same. Okay. But curves in threefolds can never be transverse. Yeah, I won't be able to say, but I will answer you later. I'm sorry. I mean, in our case, this is kind of immediate that it's the same because, I mean, as I said, you can, you're you can break down this, I mean, you're talking about the reduction map. And in our case, the reduction map, you can break it, you can break the symmetry a little bit so that you blow up one local. Little bit so that you blow up one locus first and then the other one after, and then you can reverse. But the map is the composition of the two is the same. So, okay, so okay. Okay, so I want to now explain what these objects are, and I want to also, since this is the only chance I can actually write down a Chance I can actually write down a precise statement, I'll also write down the statement about these collections. So the vector bundles appear in some natural way if you consider the universal family over each of these spaces. So there are some sections. So here we're again looking at, I'll call sigma the markings. So there is light and heavy, there is P heavy and Q light markings. And then just to recall that if P or Q To recall that if P or Q is odd, we are really just looking at P1s. And so we have a P1, the nicest possible family, a P1 bundle. And then here is the vector bundles that we're considering. They're really vector bundles. I'm going to make a... So L is some integer, E is a set of markings such that L plus E is even, or E minus L is even. And then I'm looking at this line bundle, relative. A relative dualizing sheaf tensor E minus L over two copies of it, and you twist by the sections corresponding to the markings in the subset E. So I claim this now has a relative degree L and then this is then a vector bundle of rank L plus one on MPQ if P or Q is odd. And then in general, so this is a So, this is one thing that helped us along the way: is that even when P and Q is even, you can still interpret the so in this case, this is not the P1 bundle, but nevertheless, this universal family is a Hassett space. It has some boundary components, and so you can define, nevertheless, in the same way, adjusting here with some boundaries. This time is now we're talking about, yeah, so either. Uh, yeah, so either mpq or u you could on both of them. This works. You twist here by some boundary, and uh, in such a way that at the end you get the vector bundle. So, here it's a very precise coefficient for each boundary. Okay, so we will have to move to uh we will so we define vector bundles also on the spaces MPQ and P and Q are even and their universal families. Okay, so then the first theorem, so there will be three types. So when P is odd and any Q. So this is the simplest case. So we have again some heavy, you have a subset E of the set of markings. We divide this into heavy and light. You look at the cardinality of each marking, each subset of heavy and light. We call this EPEQ. We call this EPEQ. E is the sum of all the number of elements in E. And then here is the range that works. So the range that works is given by this inequality. R here is 2R plus 1 is P. And then, okay, you have to also specify an order. That's also a bit delicate. So an example. So, an example is when p is 5 and q is 0. So, this is we are in the odd case of a GAT quotient. So, this is m05, so even dimension, but you're taking an odd number of copies of p1. And so, I claim that if you just explicitly write down what this inequality means, you get exactly these cases. And so, you get one line bundle. This is easy to see. One line bundle, this is easy to see is that it's the trivial line bundle. The other are, you get then five line bundles and one rank two vector bundle. It takes some work to show that these are exactly what I showed you in the example before, coming from the sheaves of log differentials. But as you can see, the symmetry is the same. Here we choose one marking to drop, here we choose four markings to keep, and here we take all of them. And here we take all of them. Okay, then the next type of object is the torsion sheaves. So these appear only when P is even for all Q. And then again, we divide into heavy and light. We say P set P to be 2R. Q can be anything. And then the new type of object you need is coming from a choice of. Coming from a choice of half of the indices in P. We look at the sub-variety in MPQ where the points in this corresponding to this, the markings corresponding to this subset coincide. So this is again some close sub-variety there of codimension r minus one that is also identifiable with the Hassett space. And then in this case, what happened is that you have like this heavy point coming from the points in R. Coming from the points in R gives you a new section. And then, so for subs, for L and E's such that, again, same condition as before, there is nothing new here, but the new thing is that we want the number of heavy indices in E to be exactly the set R. And then we take exactly the same line model like we did before. Before we were pushing it forward, now we're restricting it, we pull it back by this new section. It back by this new section. So, this is now, this is now supported on this ZR, and I push it forward to MPQ. So, all my torsion sheets will be pushed forward. And then there is a COSUR resolution that when you take the ZR, this locus is an intersection of boundary divisors where just two points coincide. You take the resolution of that, and then you twist by this line bundle. You twist by this line bundle and pull back. And so the tau LEs are intrinsically related to the F L E's and they have a resolution by these vector bundles. And so then the theorem in this case, so now we're in the case when P is even and I'm going to take Q to be odd, then there will be two types of objects, so vector bundles in two possible groups. And then some torsion sheaves. This is exactly what we had before in the P-Odd case, except now we are looking at the inequality for the number of light markings. And now this is a modified version of this. And it's the one that, after a lot of trial and error, worked. Okay, and yeah. Uh okay, and yeah, and so now one of these groups, uh, one A or one B, together with the group two, will work to give a full exceptional collection. And so it and it does not work if you're trying to take the exact same group two, but with a vector bomb instead of torsion objects. It's just not exceptional. Okay, so I'll try to finish. So, then, as I said, there are some complexes that appear only when P and Q are both even. So, this is now you fix an even number of indices, P equal to 2R, and then an even number of light indices, which now I'll index by Q plus 1. So, Q will be always odd here. It's just Q plus 1 is the One is the number of light indices that I will be interested in now. So, this is now the case of this singular GIT quotient. Our MPQ plus one space is a resolution of that. And now we are looking at these boundary divisors that are the exceptional divisors. And we're looking at, we take a symmetric choice of objects supported on these boundary divisors. For each boundary divisor, Divisors. For each boundary divisor, we take a symmetric choice of A and B's, take all minus A and minus B, and take the triangulated subcategory generated by these. And so these you can prove just this these objects that I wrote here form an exceptional collection. And so we're taking the orthogonal complement of that. And we then we consider the same torsion sheaf. Then we consider the same torsion sheaf as before with the same restrictions on L and E, and this object is not automatically perpendicular to this, but you have to project it. So just take the decompose it and take the projection into the orthogonal complement. And so this is essentially when you consider these torsion shifts tau L E with their Cozur resolutions, you adjust the terms in the resolution by using this boundary. By using these boundaries. Okay. And so then the final theorem is for the case, the even-even case. So there are three types of objects. And then the groups are now, so for the vector bundles are there is a group 1A and the group 1B, again, sort of symmetric, like we had before. But now But now, so for the complexes, so here we there is a natural group 2A to consider, but we could not make that one work. But the group 2B did work, either with 1A or 1B. And then together with the torsion sheaves in the subcategory A that I described before. And it's important also this works for including S equal to minus. s equal to minus one. So this will be corresponding to q plus one equal to zero. Okay and so I claim now I'll just finish. So you recover in this way the collection I wrote down for M06. It's exactly it's it is group one of the groups from before this is group 1B and this And in this case, okay, so when q is zero, then this complexes do not appear. Yes, in the in that the inequality involved some positive number being less or equal than s minus one. So if s is or s, sorry. Okay, so then yeah, the the the way that this argument goes is uh um Goals is essentially an induction in which you use different. Okay, so there are different kinds of arguments. So this is like the map of the proof. So for the p odd q equals zero case, this is the simplest case in the sense that you use the fact that you have a GAD quotient and you use results of Telemann and Halper Leissner to move to the product of P1s and compute X there. And compute X there. So this involves like checking the understanding the unstable locus, stratification of it, and compute some weights, making sure the conditions are satisfied so we can compute things on this product of P1s. So this, for example, does not work for the other GAT quotients that we have when P is odd and Q is bigger than zero, or even when P is even and Q is odd. P is even and Q is odd, this window calculation does not work, meaning the condition is not satisfied. And then, so in this case, you can try to use, for example, when P is odd and Q is positive, you can drop a light index, and then this is actually the universal family over the target. So it's a P1 bundle, so you can use. One bundle. So you can use this together with our Love's theorem and the induction on dimension. Then the proof theorems B and C. So these are when P is even, Q is odd. So MPQ, P is even and Q is odd always here. And so we pass from MPQ to MPQ plus one by using, we compare our homes between the two spaces. So here the dimension. The two spaces. So, here the dimension drops by one. This is not the universal family, but it's a blow-up of the universal family. And then you go also from the case of MPQ minus one to MPQ, except in this case, there is no forgetful map this way. So we can reduce the weights so much that we cannot drop anymore a light point and we can never drop a heavy point. And so, in this case, you have to use a So, in this case, you have to use a, you compare these R-homes by moving to the universal family of MPQ minus one. And then there is a new reduction map here to MPQ. This is by rational morphism. So, this is why you need these vector bundles to exist on U and you want to compare them. And then, exceptionality is the fact that was for the exceptionality of the vector bundles. If you now take the torture. The vector bundles. If you now take the torsion sheaves, exceptionality here, you can check it in the queue, but you move to this sub-variety where the R points coincide, and the window calculation works there. The weight condition is satisfied. And nevertheless, so the vector bundles, these FLEs that appear here are generally. Here are generating the derived category. And so, even though they do not form an full exceptional collection, they do not form an exceptional collection, they do form, they generate the collection. And so the approach is to generate these vector bundles by again moving between all the different spaces we have and using the CASO resolutions. I think I'm over my time. Sorry. Well, thank you very much. Let's thank Anna Maria. much. Let's thank Anna Maria. And we'll open up for questions. So I think Janos has another question in the chat asking what permutation representations do you get? I assume he means on the cohomology of moduli space, but you could say more, I would guess. So So, I think what we do is can, I guess, it will take some work to actually write down some recursive formulas for like decomposing this representation into reduced representations. But so it will be as involved as this proof, as all the reduction maps that we consider. And this so there is no so. So, I don't have a formula, but it's possible. So, it's all very explicit. And so, yeah, so I think it's possible eventually to to get some re recursion out of out of this this theorem. So John Christian asks if the HACIT spaces are more dream spaces. Can you see the chat? Yes, now I see it. Yes. So, okay, so the GAT quotients, so when one of them, P and Q, are odd, then these are GAT quotients. And so those Quotients. And so those are like the they are small modifications of the symmetric one, which is a funnel, but also small modifications of a blow-up of projective space Pn, say, in N plus two points. Okay, and then the other ones, sorry. Okay, so the other ones will be well, so okay. Okay, so well, so for n equals six, they are, yes. Yeah, so M06 is a morning space, and it is this resolution. Yeah, so it's possible it is. Yeah, so it's possible it is Loffano, but I do not see that right now. Well, perhaps we can continue the discussion either in the Zulu chat or in one of the breakout rooms. So let's take just a short five-minute break before we come back and we'll have a talk by Michael Weems. But let's again thank Anna Maria. That was a great, great talk. Thank you.
