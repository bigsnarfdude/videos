Right, hopefully you can see that. Yes, uh I can't see it though. Okay, you want me to start? Yes, please. Okay, right. My computer says it's one minute to three, so you know, or one minute to the hour, so I wondered whether we were quite ready. All right, well good afternoon or good, whatever time of the day it is, everybody. Of the day it is, everybody. I'm happy to be interacting with you, although I'm afraid I've not been able to, I feel like one of those bad workshop participants who comes to the lectures and then goes back to sleep in their bedroom rather than interacting with people. I haven't really had any informal discussions yet. The thing is, I failed to clear this week as I would have done, of course, if I'd traveled to Banana. Would have done, of course, if I'd traveled to Banff. In any case, we're here and I have a survey to give. So, pretty much, Sergei told me what to say. So, I don't know whether, nonetheless, I'm doing what he wants me to do. So, I'm supposed to review the asymptotic behavior of monopole moduli spaces, which I, from different perspectives, that was the instruction. That was the instruction. And I guess part of that is the geometry of asymptotic regions. What, I mean, so the moduli spaces are non-compact, that's known. The question is, what do divergent sequences of monopoles look like? What, if you have a sequence of monopoles in the moduli space that escapes every compact set, what can you say about it? So that's pretty well understood, at least if. That's pretty well understood, at least if the group is SU2. But as we've been hearing yesterday and the day before, there are different ways of thinking about the monopole marshlight space. So first of all, I mean, the most the basic, if you're a physicist, then we have this definition here. I won't write the Bogomolny equations. I assume that you were in Derek's talk. Derek's talk. The point is, though, so I'm changing notation from Derek. So the charge is K, the monopole number or charge is K rather than run capital N. I won't have any elliptic moduli to model K up with, so I think that's safe enough. So for large mod X, as you go out in R3, the Higgs field is supposed to have this particular behavior. This one. Behavior, this one could be any number as long as it's non-zero. But you can in Euclidean space you can rescale it to be one. Of course, that's also different if you have a higher gauge group. Well, no, I suppose it's not. Sorry, okay. Right, so that's the Bogomoli equations. That's the first definition, and we heard a lot about solutions and trying to find explicit solutions in previous lectures. Over here, we Over here we have rational maps, which we heard about yesterday, the first talk yesterday, although the convention used by Sasha is different from the one that most of us are used to in monopoles. So we have rational maps from the sphere to the sphere, P of Z over Q of Z, of degree K. So the denominator for me has degree K. Degree k, and you can take it to be monic because it's a ratio. So q is of the form z to the k plus lower order terms, and the numerator p is of degree less than k. Okay, and so then there's this condition that the resultant of f is non-zero, which says that the p and q have no common factor. So it really is a rational map of degree k. There's no cancellation, which means it might be a rational. Which means it might be a rational map of lower degree. Okay, so that's known by the results of Donaldson proved this using NAM data, and then it was interpreted rather more sort of in more physicsy terms, I guess, by Jacques first, about sort of scattering along straight lines. So the Z there, the complex variable Z, you should think of that as two. Think of that as two of the three variables in R3. So, this rational, as we were discussing yesterday evening, this rational map description singles out a direction in R3. And so, Z is a complex coordinate in the plane orthogonal to that direction. And you're doing scattering along lines perpendicular to that Z plane. So, Z is X plus I, or something. Okay, so that's one corner of the picture. Of the picture. And then if we go in here, I've written down NAMS equations. Well, I've written down NARM data. So T0, T1, T2, T3 are functions of a variable s in the interval minus 1, 1. That's related to mod phi being 1, that these matrices are defined on that interval. On that interval. T0, I mean, it's better to think of, it's better, although a bit extravagant, to think of having a connection on this interval. So d by ds plus t0 is the connection, really. And t1, t2, t3 are three Higgs fields, but they're just functions in unitary in the Lie algebra of u of k. algebra of u of k if we're talking about monopoles of charge k so um so these these things are um so t a is in that's meant to be a gothic k right so they're in the lie algebra of u of k i didn't say that and as as derek said um on um monday uh these uh these matrices uh t1 t2 t3 T1, T2, T3 have prescribed singularities at the endpoints of the interval. So they have simple poles with residues giving you the irreducible representation of SU2 of dimension k. Okay, so that's very important. Okay, so we have these three descriptions, and of course, I remember I mean, so actually, it looks from this as if the study of monopoles are the study of a non-trivial triangle, but actually, as Michael Murray pointed out in a seminar a very long time ago in Oxford, it's actually the study of a certain non-trivial tetrahedron. And the fourth vertex, which I haven't written, would be the spectral curve. So I'm afraid I'm not going to say anything about spectral curves in this talk. Spectral curves in this talk. Okay, but they are, of course, another aspect of another very beautiful aspect of the story. Okay, so from either, so what I aim to do initially is try to say using in each of these pictures what the asymptotic region or what some of the asymptotic regions of the moduli space look like. And then we'll go on and discuss the metrics. Okay, so I mean, I just, so whichever way you So, I mean, I just, so, whichever way you think about it, this is my notation for the moduli spaces. So, if you take the space of A phi's modulo, modulo gauge, I mean, which satisfy that suitable boundary conditions, and you factor out by gauge transformations that approach the identity of infinity, then you get this modulized space, which you can prove is. Space which you can prove is smooth of dimension 4k, non-compact. And the natural L2 metric, which Derek wrote down, you just take variations of A and phi, so those give, those are fields on R3, you make them orthogonal to the gauge orbits, and then you integrate them over R3. Okay, so that's the L2 metric I'm calling GK, I mean to recall the To recall the notational dependence on the moduli space it's living on. And the beautiful property of these is that they're hypercalar. And formally, of course, this is because you can think of the Bobomani equations as the three components of a hypercalar moment map for the action of the unitary gauge group on the space of data A phi, where you have to do this framing. You have to fix the values of phi. fix the values of phi up to order one over r to make everything uh square integral okay so to have to have a to have a configuration space of um a phi's which um on which there's a Riemannian metric an infinite dimensional Riemannian metric you need to fix the leading terms in phi and also in A actually but I'm not saying that okay so this is this is the this is the basic moduli space it has dimension four Basic moduli space it has dimension 4k, where k is the charge. And one thing I want to emphasize, because it is definitely an issue when you think in terms of the rational maps, is that this inherits Euclidean symmetries from R3. So the equations, the bottom-up equations, are invariant under Euclidean transformations, so translations and rotations, and so are the boundary conditions. And so And so there's an action of the Euclidean, the group of Euclidean isometries on this multimile space. So, in particular, you can do things, and they act isometrically on the metric as well. So, you can do things like factor out by the translations, or more or less equivalently, you can center the monopole at a point. So, there's a well-defined notion of center of mass of monopole, and you can put it at the origin of R3. If R3 has an origin, which I suppose is. Which I suppose is a, you know, it's a question whether we're really working in R3 or an affine three-dimensional Euclidean space. But in any case, you can certainly factor out by the translations. And that gives you out, gives you this slightly smaller space, which I'm denoting with the superscript zero. So this is not hypercala because it has the wrong dimension. It has, you've lost three degrees of freedom because you factored out by the translations, or you've centered. You've centered, and um, so that's not hypercala, but then you can, in fact, there's it turns out this is still acted on by a circle. Um, so this enjoys a circle action, and uh, you can factor out by that, and then you have a 4k minus four-dimensional moduli space of centered monopoles. Um, there's a okay, maybe it's Okay, maybe it's misguided to go into this, but there is another moduli space called the strongly centered moduli space, which is the simply connected version of the quotient of M0K. So let me write M0K mod S1. That's some, we factored out by all the rigid motions and also by rotations of the frames at infinity. So that's hypercala. And then That's hypercolor. And then this turns out not to be simply connected. It has a fundamental group Z mod K and its universal cover is denoted by X K and is often referred to as the space of strongly centered monopoles. So this is the This isn't the universal, um, but it's also okay for cover of M0K1S1. And so, I mean, not only can you factor out by these obvious symmetries, R3 and this global large gauge transformation. Large gauge transformation. I mean, that's actually also respects the metric. So I've written this in slightly inexact form. So up to covers Mk, I mean the basic big moduli space is locally a Riemannian product of R3 cross S1, which is the motions and the circle action, with the strongly centered guy. Strongly centered guy. So that's all good to know. Okay, are there any questions so far? Okay, right. I hope the zooming in and zooming out won't make people feel queasy so soon after their breakfasts or whatever meal they've just had. So, right, so I was supposed to talk about asymptotic. So, I've introduced the main characters. And I mean, the headline really, I mean, the basic summary is that unlike in other, so in monopoles, there's a scale which is given by the basically it's given by the length of the Higgs at infinity. So, there is a length scale of some kind. And that's at least consistent with there being no bubbling in a sequence of monopoles at finite points in R3. This is not true if you have monopoles with singularities, which is a sort of unexplored or relatively unexplored area, I would say. But in the context of these Bogomoli equations, which have finite total energy, the only bubble, I mean, if you have a diverse. The only bubble, I mean, if you have a divergent sequence of monopoles, this corresponds, I mean, you can really see lumps of magnetic charge separating by distances in R3. And that's the sole cause of non-compactness, at least if the gauge group is SU2. Okay, so that's the heuristic I've written here. So the non-compactness in a given moduli space Mk corresponds to Corresponds to, well, at least if we're in M0K, if we factor out by the translations, it really corresponds to lower charge monopoles. I mean, so your monopole configuration breaks up into lumps of smaller charge and those disappear off to infinity. So, I mean, if you don't factor out by the translations, of course, you can take a monopole and just get a divergent sequence by just shifting. Just shifting it sideways out to infinity, or well, sideways in any direction you please out to infinity, okay. And that will be a divergent sequence of monopoles, right? Okay, so you can see an account of this in the previously referred to best-selling blue book. In chapter three, this description of divergence of sequence of monopoles is explored and explained. Is explored and explained. But the analysis there definitely rests on some serious work by Ullenbeck, of course, gauge fixing and Taus. So this is, you know, there is, it's not obvious that this is the picture, but it is the picture. All right, so I will try to explain. Explain how this is supposed to work in these different pictures, what you see. Well, I guess I've kind of already done it in the original Bogomolni picture. So, I mean, let's just, for simplicity, look at the case where you have two lumps separating. Okay, so I mean, in Okay, so I mean, what we mean by that, if you think in terms of the fields, is that you start with maybe an A1 phi1 in one centered moduli space and an A2 phi2 in another centered moduli space. And it's an important fact that the fact that the uh so not only do you I mean you have these boundary conditions on the Higgs fields and the and the the I mean the connection the Higgs field but they look I mean even sort of quite a way into R3 they look they look abelian so the the fields far out look like U1 monopoles embedded in SU2 so they look like the rack monopoles Two. So they look like the rat monopoles far out. And so you really have a picture that I mean, you can choose two points in R3. I don't know, P and Q. Those are not points, those are lumps, but the points are the centers of these balls. So you choose two points widely separated in R3. So, this is supposed to be a big distance between these two things. And you can, these yellow regions I've drawn are supposed to be large balls, but they're nothing like, I mean, they're very large, but they're nothing like the distance. They're nothing like the distance between the two lumps themselves. So there are two different scales here. So these balls are large enough. So this is supposed to be a picture inside R3. These balls are large enough that if we go slightly outside of R3, I mean, if you look at the, if you cut, so you're putting A1, phi1. Phi one inside at the center of this ball, and you're putting you apply your translation and put A2 Phi2 in the center in the middle of the other ball. And so the point is that outside either of these balls, the fields look approximately abelian. So, in either of those regions. And then what you can do is find, so I mean, this is going to be a gluing construction. You're going to construct an approximate solution. So, topologically, I mean, a topologically correct solution would be to glue a Dirac monopole. Um into a complement of balls. And this, I mean, let me just write the Higgs field of this. So this will live on some direct sum of line bundles, and the harmonic function you would take sees the two charges. C is the two charges of the monopoles. So with my conventions, the scalar field for the Dirac monopole would be this harmonic function, okay, which is singular at the centers of the two balls. And this would be, yeah, so you write that down, it has the Yeah, so you write that down, it has these singularities, but then they're smoothed out by gluing in the monopoles themselves inside these large balls. And the point is that this will be topologically correct. So when I say the fields are abelian out here, what I mean is that near this region, we're in the asymptotic region of A1 phi1, and it will look very much like just this. Very much like just the this term plus some correction terms, and similarly, near this ball but far from this one, um, the field will look like uh I mean the Higgs field will look like will look like the sum of those terms, okay. So, and by putting them together, I mean again if n is very large, the contribution from this term here will be negligible or small anyway, and similarly the other way around, whereas at infinity you see k1 plus k2. K1 plus K2 over mod X, which is the correct decay for a Higgs field corresponding to modopole of charge K, where K is K1 plus K2. Okay, so that's roughly, I mean, and so the claim is that, well, I've just drawn the picture for two lumps, but so the claim is there's an asymptotic. So, the claim is there's an asymptotic region, the moduli space, which looks like this for any way of writing k as a sum of two integers. And indeed, for any of the. Let me ask a question. Yes, Josh. Are k1 and k2 necessarily positive? Yes. Okay, I was thinking because otherwise you could have k1 equal to minus k2 and somehow describe zero monopoles by. Yes, well, Well, well, I mean, of course, k has to be non-negative. I mean, to have something, to have an A2, phi2, I mean, I don't know what any A2 phi2s with K2 negative would be. Right? I mean, we need, I mean, we do, I mean, if you had monopoles of negative charge, then you could imagine trying this construction on them and decreasing the monopole number. But as far as I know, we don't. That yeah, I think like monopoles, anti-monopoles together are not static, so they would like amiculate, so there would be no they don't live in the modular space. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. No, I mean, there, yeah, I mean, I think there's some some related question about calorons, which Lorenzo and I were discussing trying to understand over the summer, but uh, at least on my part, not terribly seriously, um, or at least not very successfully. Okay, so that's the picture in terms of fields. That's what an asymptotic region looks like. And I'll write this later, but more generally, you could imagine a configuration of, say, you could imagine a partition, k as a sum of a non-trivial partition of k as a sum of positive integers, k1 up to kq, and then you have a To KQ, and then you have a widely separated configuration of Q points, and you're trying to find a monopole of charge K by taking your favorite monopoles from each of the moduli spaces for charges K1 up to KQ and filling them in with a direct monopole between in the spaces. So that's how this goes. And of course, this was done first when the particular. When the partition was the trivial one, actually, well, not the trivial, I mean, the smallest or largest, depending on your ordering of partitions. So, where all the, I mean, where you write k is one plus one plus one plus one, right? Okay, so Taubes glued k monopoles of charge one together to get a monopole of charge k in the best-selling green book, which appeared in the early 80s. Okay. So, are there any other questions? Horri, good. Okay, right. Where's my how much page have I got left? Okay. All right, okay. Um So maybe I'll talk about how the sort of asymptotic regions, the corresponding thing looks in terms of NAM data. I mean, yes, on this view, I can't see where the edge on my screen is. Okay. Okay, right, so norm data. So the norm equations are, if t0 is zero anyway, it's dt1 by ds is the commutator of t2 and t3. So if the t's are constant and commuting, then that does give you a solution, but it doesn't satisfy the boundary conditions that you need at the end points where you're supposed to. At the end points where you're supposed to have these non-trivial residues. But that nonetheless is sort of the idea behind finding the corresponding solutions, which are localized in two clumps. So I mean, so my interval was from minus one to one. That was my normalization. So that's the norm interval. S lives in there. And so you can certainly write down. So, you can certainly write down a solution which has this kind of shape. I'm sorry, I'm going to probably. So the P and the Q are, well, okay, so let me not do that. So let me also not do that. So let me, let me, hopefully this. Let me hopefully this will be comprehensible. So, this is a triple of k by k matrices, and I can define it to be have the following shape. So, it's the K1 by K1 identity matrix times P of. P over K1, and it's then you have the identity, the K2 by K2 identity matrix times Q over K2, something like that. So what I mean is that diagonal entries of T1 are the X components of P and P1. Um, x components of p and q, and similarly for the other ones. So, I have it. I mean, this is in p, I mean, p is the coordinates of a point in R3, and similarly, q. So, what I have here is a triple of matrices, in fact. Okay, so and they're constants. So, that is a solution of Names equations, okay, just as it is, but it does not satisfy the boundary conditions. Michael? Yeah. Does this correspond to the Dirac monopole? No. No, does it? No, no, no, no. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, the Dirac monopole as so this corresponds to the So, this corresponds to the this is so the direct monopole. I still don't know whether anybody's really maybe, I mean, Roger, has this really been proved? So, the direct monopole for these two points with these two multiplicities would be a solution on the half line, which has the residue, the correct residues at s equals zero and approaches this matrix at s equals infinity. Have you asked me that? Have you asked me that? Am I asking you? Well, I mean, I just put it out there. It's true, right? But I mean, is it really true? Sure. If you ask me what reference, I would be heart pressed. Okay, okay. I like it. When I think of this, I like to go in my notes of communication with Michael Singer, and I find good references there. It's one of those things that everybody knows is true. And if you are asked for reference, it's hard to find. Anyway, okay, so this is, so that's, that's the, that's, I mean, I don't think, I mean, this constant solution on its own doesn't tell you very much about monopoles. But so, I mean, the analog of, so precisely what you would like to do. What you would like to do, I mean, this somehow corresponds to just translating things apart. And so what you, what you, I mean, a NARM solution that corresponds to, so I mean, now the idea is that you take mod p minus q to be l, which is very, very large again. Okay, that's what we did before. So the diagonal entries of these matrices correspond to the positions. The matrices correspond to the positions of these particles. And then you would try to perturb this solution. The gluing theorem is to perturb that constant solution so that it acquires the right residues at infinity. Okay, so somehow, I mean, the picture, I mean, Roger knows more about this than I do, but somehow the picture is that you have a solution which is approximately constant. Constant along some big chunk of the interval, and then it you glue it on, so well I don't know how to write this, and then you glue it onto the things with the correct glass is so slippery, this is a problem, right? So let me try. So that always happens at least. I'm not always happy with the next one. So somehow um so this is uh this is s equals one and uh you have some kind of um divergent bit of the well some bit of the solution that glues on um or it interpolates between the constant solution over a big chunk of the interval and the thing with the poles and in fact with the the point i mean the point about With the point, I mean, the point about the rack monopoles is that after rescaling of the S variable, this thing, I mean, in some limit as L goes to infinity, and after rescaling, this solution, which is sort of very compressed into the corner of the NARM interval, that will rescale to an interval on the half-line, which gives you this Dirac monopole. Okay, so the Dirac monopole, or the NAM transform of the Dirac monopole. Or the NAM transform of the direct monopole appears in the picture in that way. Okay, so that's how it looks with NAM. Well, it's already half three, so I think I won't, I was going to talk about how you glue rational maps as well, but I will not go into that today. I will not go into that now. Because I think I should say something about. Because I think I should say something about metrics. Okay, so you have this L2 metric, which is famously difficult to compute. I mean, because you don't know how to integrate and you don't know enough about the fields. Though I guess there are people working very diligently on finding solutions explicitly. Finding solutions explicitly, whether they'll ever be explicit enough to compute the metric in a in, you know, in over large parts of the moduli space is another question. As, yeah, I mean, what coordinates will you use is a reasonable question. But remember this property that if you have a monopole, this claimed property that there's a sort of lump That there's a sort of lump of, there's a sort of relatively concentrated region where the fields are non-abelian. And outside of this region, you just see a Dirac monopole modulus and exponentially small corrections. Okay, so that's the picture. And using that picture, Gibbons-Mountain, I mean, it's a physics argument, but they They derived a formula for the metric by considering, by sort of replacing monopoles by sort of, I mean, by against, essentially by their Dirac versions. Okay, so you consider variations, you just sort of think about the behavior over the, I mean, you just treat them as if they were abelian, basically. And this leads to a very basically. And this leads to a very beautiful, I mean, so you actually get an asymptotic metric, which is hypercala, which I shall write down in a minute. And then Roger proved that this is, in fact, you know, this is rigorously true, that the Gibbons mountain is an exact, well, is an exponentially close approximation to the true metric in this asymptotic region corresponding to k-monopoles of charge one all separating off to. Of charge one all separating off to infinity. Okay, so let me try to say something about. Okay, so maybe I'll just sort of introduce some local notation. So So lambda is going to be a typical partition of our integer k and sometimes it will be well okay it's a it's a partition of k with all the components at least one so you're not I'm not allowing any zeros that's that's that's that's not allowed. That's not allowed. And so the heuristic is that for each lambda, there'll be an asymptotic region, A lambda. For degenerations of type lambda. By which I just mean you are able to localize widely separated lumps of charge K1, K2 up to KQ, where K1 up to KQ are the path of the components of the partition. Okay, so this is what you expect. And I mean, roughly speaking, Roughly speaking, I mean, let me just say a bit more about this before I get into the precise result for Lambda, this special partition. So, what you might expect is that A Lambda is, well, I'll use a twiddle again to mean that I'm not being very precise. So, this should consist of configuration data, which is where the centers of the points are. Of the points are so mod lambda is the number of components of the partition lambda. Okay, so it was the number I was calling q before. So it should be something like this. Well, except, well, okay, except you don't want the points to be too close together. So I'm just going to write minus diagonals. And then I'm going to put an infinity there to indicate that I want everything to be widely separated. Okay, so I have a configuration. Okay, so I have a configuration of points in R, I have a configuration of Q points in R3, and they're all widely separated from each other, and from and yeah, they're all widely separated from each other, and all near infinity in some sense. Okay, and so that's the configuration, that's where you're putting the monopoles, and then, of course, you have. Putting the monopoles, and then, of course, you have actually to choose the monopoles. So that will be from in order not to overcount, you may as well center them. And so you'll choose monopoles, and I'm just writing m0 lambda for the product of monopoles corresponding to the partition. The product of moduli spaces corresponding to our partition. Okay, so that's the kind of thing you'd expect. You have configuration. Expect, you have configuration data, and once you've chosen the configuration, you can choose a monopole from each of these moduli spaces. Okay, so this is essentially right, except it's wrong for an interesting reason, which is that this is not in fact a product. So there's some interesting topology in these asymptotic regions. So let me say what that is for the simplest one. The simplest one, so the Gibbons Mountain one. So, so this is essentially correct, but not exactly. So, if you look at if you look at a well, let's say, if you look at lambda is just all the ones. So, in fact, so then in fact, a lambda. So then, in fact, A lambda is the total space. Right, so in this case, Q is K. There are K parts, this partition. The configurations need to stay away from each other. Everything is meant to be a long way from everything else. And this is, in fact, a Taurus bundle of. Over this space r to the 3k model of the diagonals. So, I mean, that's kind of reasonable because for charge one, I mean, I should be having, I mean, all these k's are one, so I should have the product of the centered moduli spaces, but without the S1 factored up. So, in this case, all these factors are just circles. So, it's, I mean, so this is, this, this picture is just a twisted version of this picture when lambda is all the one. When lambda is all the ones. Okay, and the so this Taurus bundle is very interesting. So I mean, it's generally called the Gibbons-Mountain bundle. And so it has factors. And if we call the jth factor, I don't know, Sj or something, so this is a circle bundle, and it's supposed to have a first change. It's supposed to have a first churn class that is as a mysterious factor of two. And then, so I'll explain the notation in words. So, omega is the generator of H2 of R3 minus the origin. H2 of R3 minus the origin. So that's a two class. And pi ij is just the difference map that takes vector xi minus, it takes takes it projects by taking xi minus xj, and that gives you a point in R3 minus the origin if you're away from the diagonals. Okay, so you have this class in H2 of the R3 with the origin removed, and you just put it back to this space for all the diagonals. To this space where all the diagonals are removed. And that gives you, I mean, letting i and j vary, you get a bunch of different two classes that way. And you can then ask for a circle bundle over this, ask for a circle bundle over this space whose first churn class is given by that. Okay, and that will be the jth, um, uh, the jth term in this product of k of the torus bundle. Okay, so t there's bundle okay so t this t k bundle is um yeah so a lambda is if you like the product of these these different circles okay so that's that's the description you have this given mountain bundle and um it lives it's away from the diagonals i mean it doesn't extend through the diagonals because um you have non-trivial topology there um and um the the metric is very naturally adapted to this geometry Actually, adapted to this geometry. Let me try to write it down up to the usual factors of two and everything. So the metric is something so that you form, so I can write it this way. So you form something like gij dxi dot dxj. x i dot dx j plus g i j alpha i alpha j. So the g with the upper indices is equal to g inverse, usual notation. And so we have the what we see here is dot products of the vectors in the different factors of Vectors in the different factors of R3K appearing. The Gij is some K by K symmetric matrix, and so the diagonal entries are this, I believe. Okay, so um that if if you only had one term, that would be a tab nut-like thing. Um nut-like thing and gij is one over mod xi minus xj and the alpha i's are certain one forms on so alpha i is is a connection one form on the um ith term in the product of the this torus bundle okay so that's the gibbons mountain metric um And as I said, it was proved by Roger to be an exponentially good approximation to the true L2 metric in a paper in the late 90s. So you can see that this cannot be extended, I mean, this can't be a good approximation. I mean, this can't be a good approximation everywhere because of the minus sign here, right? So, I mean, as the two points come together and you start leaving the region of widely separated monopoles of charge one, this term will blow up. The metric will go indefinite, and so clearly something's going wrong. Okay, so that's the picture of when the That's the picture when all the charges are one, but we have lots of other asymptotic regions as well to talk about. But in fact, the claim is that something rather analogous happens in all of them. Okay, so I hope that's more or less readable. So let's turn to the case of a general partition lambda now. Lambda now. And so I think it consists of positive integers k1 up to kq again. And the analog, well, so I'm just writing down things which are, so there, all I'm saying here is that there's an analog. So there is a, so for each partition, so this was, so I mean, this was known. So, I mean, this was known by Roger and was, I mean, it appeared in my work with Chris on monopoles, which will probably be published in about 2040, I think, by the memoirs of the AMS. They're very, very slow. And anyway, so you take this, so the analogous thing is you have now a configuration of Q points or mod lambda points in R3. Points in R3. You remove all the diagonals because that would correspond to passing to a different asymptotic region. There is a Gibbons-Manton or generalized Gibbons-Manton bundle, which I'm calling G sub lambda. And it's defined in a very analogous way, but there are some random factors of not, well, they're not at all random. There are some additional factors corresponding to the charges of the. Of the weights that you have in the partition. So rather than just being the straight sum of all these pullbacks, it's weighted by these integers corresponding to the partition. So you define Q line bundles this way in terms of their first Sherman class. And then using the fact that Using the fact that M0 lambda, which is the product of these center moduli spaces, has an S1 action. So the product has a T mod lambda action, and you just form the bundle, you associate a moduli bundle, if you like, to the Gibbons-Manton bundle by using the usual construction. So you think of this as a T mod lambda principle bundle and use the action of this on both factors to define a twisted product. Factors to define the twisted product. Okay, and in very small letters here, because I don't really know what finite groups are, I mean, and I lied also in my previous description. So there are annoying but important finite group actions throughout this entire story. So I should have said this at the time, but monopoles are supposed to be indistinguishable. So in the previous picture where we have In the previous picture, where we have k widely separated monopoles, you can't tell them apart. So, the symmetric group of order k is acting on this whole picture that I just described. So, the true asymptotic region here, this asymptotic region with lambda being that simplest partition, really the whole thing should be factored out by the symmetric group. By the symmetric group. Yeah. Well, okay. I mean, we have a we define this region with a hat on it, and then the true, the true asymptotic region would be this divided by the symmetric group. Okay. Okay, and there's a similar picture, there's a similar annoyance for any partition. If ever you have two of the elements of the partition the same, like if K1 and K2 were equal, then you'd be able to switch those and you'd have to factor out by that group. I mean, that group, I mean, the group of symmetries that preserve the partition in the obvious sense will act on this picture, and really you should factor. On this picture, and really, you should factor out by that to get the asymptotic region. So, let me put a hat on that as well with the understanding you have to divide out by a finite group in order to get the true picture of the asymptotic region. Okay, so let's see now. There is a theorem here which Chris and I proved, which is Proved, which is that, yeah, so I mean, having made all these definitions, in fact, it is true that to leading order, the true metric, the L2 metric on the moduli space is, as you'd expect, it's a product. You have the Euclidean metric on the base, or the part of the base that you have, because you've removed the diagonals and everything. Diagonals and everything. So you can see the metric on the base, and then in the fibers, you just have the Riemannian metrics on the moduli spaces. Okay, so this is a, I mean, so this is not as precise as Roger's result, of course, because I'm not talking about the next order term down. And the other catch is that I'm assuming large uniform separation in my points. And also that I'm in a, I mean, this is really. that I'm in a, I mean, this is really happening in compact subsets of my product and also for large uniform separation. So let me, maybe I just write down what I mean by that. So by this I mean that my points, well I'm going to write it this way. So I'm writing xj xj as yj over epsilon. So epsilon is going to be small. And the thing is that the all these y's, I could take them to, no, I can't take them to have unit length, but the lengths of the y's are all bounded between two numbers, okay? So we're thinking of the y's as sort of fixed in some on some on some shell of a definite size, and then we're size and then we're shunting all these points we're scaling all these points out to infinity by dividing by epsilon okay that's what i mean by large uniform separation they're sort of receding uniformly um uh relative to each other the the ratios of the lengths between them remains bounded as they go out to infinity in other words and the other thing i should have said is that um the um we also need um you should also stay in You should also stay in compact subsets of M0 lambda because after all, this is actually I suppose that's more that's not that brace so much as so much as this twiddle. So that twiddle holds So that twiddle holds for large uniform separation of the configuration data and provided the monopoles that you're gluing remain in compact subset of this product moduli space. Okay, well time's nearly up, which is good. So, I mean, this talk is supposed to be, I mean, this talk is, I hope, going to provide a reasonable lead-in. Provide a reasonable lead-in to the next talk. But maybe I can just say a few words about that motivate what Chris is going to say. So, I mean, the sort of critical point, I mean, so in particular, the result that Chris and I have, this is not good enough to say what the monopole, the metric is sort of uniformly on any sequence. Uniformly on any sequence diverging to infinity because I mean, we know it sort of partition by partition, but in each of those regions, we have to impose this uniform separation assumption in order to be able to do our gluing. And so, an important issue is what happens at these transitions. So, I mean, to draw the obvious picture, I mean, if you The obvious picture. I mean, if you have a sequence of, I mean, the transitions just for k equals three, I mean, that's a widely separated configuration. And this is not. Okay, so I mean, so the length scale between these two points supposed to be much, much smaller than the distance between. Than the distance between the two lumps. And so, when that happens, you know, at a certain point, you say, okay, fine, well, I'll just put those together and regard that as a monopole of charge two, widely separated from monopole of charge one. But there is a transition region where the points are going out to infinity, but you don't quite know. Quite know it's sort of marginal whether you can treat. I mean, the distance between two of them is much smaller than the distance between the other, but it's marginal to know whether you can treat them as something in the two monopoly. You're still near the boundary of the two monopoly homogenized space. Okay, so the picture that I will stop very soon, but the picture that the way this the way this can be organized Organized is by, I mean, our preferred way of organizing this is to use manifolds with corners. So the idea is that the so if you're looking at the compactification of the centered or the moduli space of three monopoles up to translation, then Then you, it it doesn't, it's not a very good idea, I think, to think of adding just a boundary. One should add two boundary hypersurfaces. So one corresponding to one plus one plus one, and the other corresponding to two plus one. Okay, so that's the idea, and maybe I can just without can just without sort of putting in the monopole factors maybe i can just explain at the level of configurations in very concrete terms um what you know how this looks so i mean we factored out by translations so the um the basic configuration space is um we're having we have three points up to translation um so i'm just going to set one of those to be zero but using the Of those to be zero, but using the translation freedom. So, I mean, the base, so for the one plus one plus one thing, once you've centered, the Euclidean base space is a configuration of, I mean, it's R6 really with two points, right? I mean, there's a third point, but that's fixed at the origin or something. So we have x1, x2 in, I'll write it as R3 cross R3. I'll write it as R3 cross R3. And what this corner represents is, so in a manifold of corners, you have boundary defining functions. Let me make sure I get this the right, the way I usually get it around. So let's say that that's a boundary defining function, and this is a boundary defining function. And this is a boundary defining function. So, rho and sigma are supposed to be smooth functions which are positive in the interior and vanish precisely at their boundary hype surfaces. So, these are part of the data that you have these things. And we're going to consider particular pairs x1, x2, where x1 is y1 over rho. y1 over rho and x2 is y2 over rho sigma where you think just think of y1 and y2 as coordinates on the sphere so these are just points of unit length so I have the right number of parameters there okay I have two angular variables y1 and y2 and I have two length scales rho and sigma but I'm just putting them in in a funny way and so the thing is that you know if you if you think is that you know if you if you think about this if sigma is um i mean if sigma is small but positive but sort of unvarying and rho tends to zero then this this pair of points um the mutual distance between them will go to infinity as will the distance to the origin right okay so in this um i mean in this regime so I mean, in this regime, so approaching this boundary hypersurface is sending rho to zero, we have mod x1, mod x2, and mod x1 minus x2 all tending to infinity. Okay, that's if you do this. And conversely, if you fix rho to be positive, To be positive, and you let sigma go to zero, then you see it's no longer the case, right? Because, I mean, I'm just writing very trivial things here, but it's maybe worth it. So this coordinate, this variable, of course, remains bounded if rho is fixed, because the length of y1 is fixed to be one. Whereas this one is going to infinity as Is going to infinity as sigma goes to zero. Okay, so this cat, so in this regime, mod x1 remains bounded, mod x2 goes to infinity, and of course mod x1 minus x2 must also go to infinity. mod x1 minus x2 must also go to infinity so this so if you think if you think back so this is capturing this corner is capturing precisely this transition of triangles if you think of x1 as being the side if you think of x1 as being um well I suppose I've put this at zero so this is x1 the way I've done it um so that's the so that's the picture where um So that's the picture where you're close to this boundary, yeah, where you're going to an interior point of this boundary hypersurface. That corresponds to these long thin triangles. Anyway, I seem to have run out of time, but that's probably just as well. So that's kind of by way of motivation for how manifold corners are used in the description of these compactifications. So I don't know whether I said So, I don't know whether I said what Sergei wanted me to say, but thank you anyway for turning up. Thank you, Michael, Michael. Are there any questions? I have a very naive question, if I may. Yep. The description you gave early on of your gluing construction, I didn't quite understand. I didn't quite understand how you were gluing this thing. Yes, exactly. With the Higgs fields, the way you talked about gluing them made it sound as though they were constant or something. So how do you actually glue them? Okay, so yeah, thank you for the question. Right. So do I have some where can I where can I some where can I where can I okay so so if you have a collection of points P1 up to PQ in R3 all pairwise distinct then you can write down this harmonic function that I wrote down before Right, so that's a harmonic function, and then you try to solve dA is star d phi for a one form, and which you can't do, but you can solve this for a connection one form on some bundle script LP. Script LP. Okay, so this is a bundle of R3 with the points removed. And it has first shown class Kj when evaluated on a small sphere centered on Pj. Okay, so that's a line bundle. And so I can find a connection unique up to gauge which solves that equation on that line bundle. Okay, and that's exactly what I need. Okay, and that's exactly what I need. So, I mean, okay, so then I can I can write. So when I said Dirac, I mean, I was rather brief about this. So when I said Dirac monopole before, what I really meant was I take, well, I take the bundle E, which is LP plus its dual, and I equip it with it with A and minus A, so to speak, so the induced connection on the other bundle. And then, so I mean, if I do that, then I have, so this gives me a Dirac monopole. Well, if you like, it's a reduced SU2 monopole embedded in. In SU2 monopole, it's a singular SU2 monopole which is reduced, I mean reduced everywhere. I mean, it's the sum of it's a sum of U1 monopoles. I mean, it's U1 monopole and its opposite. Okay, so that's a singular guy, but then, but this has exactly the right topology to fill this region between. Fill this region between where all the monopoles are. So if those are my monopole regions, the point is that if I look at my Aj phij, then on a large sphere, I can also, what I see is, I mean, the asymptotics tell me that. Me that on this large sphere, the Higgs field, the jth Higgs field, is approaching this diagonal thing with entries one and kj over mod x minus pj. Of course, when you say diagonal, I mean there are lots of different ways of putting a maximal torus in SU2. So is there somehow, is there something that's fixing them all? But there aren't so many. No, because there aren't so many because the Higgs is non-zero here. So it's fixing. I mean, you're looking at the eigenbundles of phi, really. That gives you, I mean, it's diagonal with respect to, yeah, I mean, there is a gauge which is unique up to S1 or something in which the Higgs field is diagonal. So that gives you, I mean, so there is a canonical, once you're away from the zeros of phi, you have a decomposition of the rank two bundle that's going to. Decomposition of the rank two bundle that's carrying this monopole into a sum of line bundles.
