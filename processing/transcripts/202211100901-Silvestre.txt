Of this nice conference, very nice conference. Our first speaker is my pleasure to introduce Liz Silvestre from Chicago. And he will talk about other continuities up to the boundary of kinetic equations. All right, thank you very much for the invitation and introduction. Yeah, so yeah, I'm going to talk about taking a kinetic equation like a simple kinetic attitude and doing some sort of Georgian what happens when Most like what happens when there is a spatial boundary. Okay? So let's start slowly. So you probably have seen this equation before, this equation by Colmoboro, written several years ago, which is, you know, you have a function of time, space, and velocity, so it's like a kinetic equation that has just the simplest possible diffusion, that is the Laplacian in velocity. And Kolomograph wrote a fundamental solution, just computation by hand, that this one is the My hand, that this one is the fundamental solution for the Kolmogorov equation. And the fundamental solution looks very similar to the fundamental solution of the heat equation. So it's similar to the solution of the heat equation. We have that for any initial data, the solution of the Kolmogorov equation will be some sort of convolution of the initial data with this particular kernel. And by looking at the solution, you observe that the solutions are smooth. Because for any initial data, you're convolving with a smooth function, and then the solutions. Function and then the solution becomes smooth immediately. And that's sort of unexpected, perhaps, because the regularity here of the Laplacian is only in the velocity variable, but not in the space variable. So the interaction between the drift and diffusion makes the smoothing effect take place in all variables at the same time, which is some sort of magic effect. I mean, there's no, I mean, we can find all sorts of explanations, but to me, it's still magic, regardless of what way. Magic, regardless of what way we can explain it. What? Like Santa Claus. Yeah. And okay, so this is the equation that sort of opened up the field of hypoelliptic equations, right? So these are equations in which the diffusion is only taking place in certain directions, but then there is a drift with variable coefficients that sort of rotate and interact with the diffusion, giving regularization in all variables. So, the kinetic equations like the Landor or the Boltzmann equation are a non-linear version of Kolmogorov equation, where instead of having the Laplacian with respect to velocity, we have a non-linear diffusion operator. For the Boltzmann equation, it's going to be an integral diffusion, and for the Landau operator, it's a second-order diffusion. So, if we want to understand the regularity properties of an equation like this, a kinetic equation like Poles, Panel, Lambda, One thing that we have to do at some point is to study linear equations with rough coefficients. It's like the Georgianas-Muslim type of theory. So for kinetic equations that are just like the Kolmodor equation but with uniformly elliptic coefficients, there is a result that parallels that result of Kichochi National Muscle that says that the solution will be held continuous. And there is a recent history of several papers in History of several papers with respect to this problem. So for kinetic equations, there is a version of the Chochinasch muscle. That gives you Helder continuity in all variables, in time, space, and velocity. And this is a result that is useful when you want to study the Lando equation. Because a result like Dichochi Nashmonster, for an equation that looks seemingly linear but with rough coefficients is something that you can apply to a solution. Can apply to solutions to a non-linear equation because a non-linear equation is basically like a linear equation, but the coefficients depend on the solution somehow. If you don't know what the solution is, as if you didn't know what the coefficients in a linear equation is, if you have an estimate that doesn't depend on the coefficients, then it can be applied to solutions to a non-linear equation. So it only depends on the uniform volatility of the coefficients, but not on their smoothness. It's interesting to always point out that the puddle-saconal version, so the problem in non-divergent form is still open. So if you take the kinetic transport and you add diffusion in non-divergent form with the coefficients outside of the derivative instead of inside of the derivative, then presumably the solution to this should have some sort of a priori Helder continuity estimate, but it's still an open problem. And it's a problem. Open problem. It's a problem that has been open for many years. In the context of hypolytic equations, this is not the way people have looked at it so much. But people have looked at versions of Philosophon theorem for all sorts of hypoeptic settings and it's never worked because there isn't really any reasonable hypolliptic version of the Alexander Maherman Fuchsietz. So this is an interesting open problem. So there's also an intra-differential version, which is in a paper that we did with 3, like point that we did. So this is an inter-differential version of the problem before, in which instead of having a classical second-order diffusion, we have an inter-differential diffusion. And the kernel satisfies certain ellipticity conditions. Lucity conditions and certain symmetry assumptions that resemble divergence form operators. And this is a result that, in the same way that the previous one was useful to analyze the regularities, properties of solutions to the Lando equations, this one would be useful to analyze the regularity of solutions to the Boltzmann equation in the inhomogeneous setting. Okay? So, what I want to talk about So, what I want to talk about today is what happens if you add a boundary to this result. So, a boundary is going to be a boundary in space. So, let's say that we have an equation where x lives in certain domain omega. We have this equation, v is globally defined. Well, it doesn't matter for what I'm going to talk about, it could be v also defined in some neighborhood. But x is in some bounded domain, and there is some boundary. Some boundary domain, and there is some boundary for the x variable. So there has to be some boundary condition that is imposed. And there are different boundary conditions that have been considered in the literature. One of the most natural ones is specular reflection. That is, whatever comes and hits the boundary bounces back. I would say in the kinetic setting is some sort of similar to the Neumann. Similar to the Neumann condition. Because it's similar to the Neumann condition in the sense that if the boundary was flat, you make an even reflection and you have a solution across the boundary. So this R of X is the reflected version of velocity. So if it's something that comes with certain velocity to the boundary, it has to bounce back to the with the reflected velocity. So it gives you this equality on the boundary, right? And that's the specular reflection boundary condition. The specular reflection boundary condition. Another relatively natural boundary condition, which is something like the version of what Dilge boundary condition would be, is to prescribe the value of the function wherever the function is entering the domain. So here, we say that the incoming part of the boundary is those points on the boundary for which the velocity is pointing inwards. And then we would want to prescribe the value of f wherever we are in the. Of F, wherever we are in the incoming part of the boundary. In the outgoing part of the boundary, that is where the velocity is pointing outwards, the equation should determine the values of the function. So we cannot really prescribe the values where it's going out. This is the same as it happens in any first-order equation, where the flow is coming from the boundary, you prescribe what comes into the domain of the equation. But when the flow is going outwards, then whatever happens inside, Whatever happens inside, it's going to let the equation determine the values of the function on the outgoing path. So, this would be the influx boundary condition. And then there are many other boundary conditions for kinetic equations that are considered in the literature, right? But I'm not going to talk about any other, right? I'm going to talk about this, these two only. So, this could be, this is the way, this is what one could do for a spectral reflection. For a spectral reflection. If we take the spectral reflection, I have to remind myself not to ever touch the bottom. So if we take a kinetic inter-differential equation, we put the specular reflection, then one can prove that the solution will be held continuous up to the boundary with some estimates. The estimate is going to be a little bit weird. So, how can this be done? So, there is a way to flatten the boundary by making a change of variables. You have to make a change of variables both. Of variables. You have to make a change of variables both in space and in velocity at the same time, right? Because you want the transport operator to stay the same. And after you do that change of variables, you get to a problem in which the specular reflection can be analyzed just by making an even reflection and extending the solution across the boundary. So, specular reflection is like the normal boundary condition. So, it's just that when the boundary, once you flatten the boundary, The boundary. Once you flatten the boundary with the change of variables, you do an even reflection, you have a solution across. So you use the interior regularity to study the heliconity up to the boundary. When I say with an estimate, it's a little bit tricky because what does the estimate depend on? When you flatten the boundary, you get some extra terms that depend on the velocity that you center your estimate, depends on the curvature of the boundary, depends on various things. On various things. So there is an estimate, but it's not a very clean estimate. And something frustrating about this estimate is that it's a, you know, these are local regularity estimates. If you have a domain that is localized in velocity, you get regularity in any smaller domain, right? Even for a range of velocities. But when the velocity goes to infinity, the estimate deteriorates here, because the change of variables has some extra terms depending on velocity. Anyway, it is what it is. So, is C2 good enough for the boundary? C2 is good enough, yes. I would believe that maybe even less than C2. Okay, because you said you need the curvature, so. Yeah, yeah. C2 is definitely good enough. I don't want to say anything for certain because I'm being recorded, but C2 is certainly good enough. Uh C two is certainly good enough, but I'm not sure if if C one was good enough. But uh that I will have to check because it depends on the change of no, I think the second derivative, there is a term that that involves the second derivative on the boundary that appears when you do the flattening. Because when you do the flattening, you have to make a change of variables in X and in V, not only a change of variables in V. Because if you make a change of variables in in X only If you make a change of variables in x only, then the transport operator changes. So you want to change the velocity sort of to go along your change of variables so that the transport term is still the same. But then you get an extra term that is an acceleration term. And I think that acceleration term involves the second derivative of the boundary, but I might be confused. Right? And that's the term that is sort of putting an extra, you know. You know, garbage airflow terms in your estimates. Okay? Okay, so let's, but let's talk about the influx boundary condition. With the influx boundary condition, there is something that happens. That is that the boundary condition may not be too happy with continuity estimates. So let's think about the problem in which there is only transport. Let's suppose that we had only transport and no diffusion. Then, if the Then, if the domain is not convex, the boundary condition will create discontinuities. Because imagine that your initial data is some blob here that is traveling in that direction. After a while, this is traveling, it's going to hit the boundary, it's absorbed by the boundary because we have the influx boundary condition. If we put zero boundary condition, then on the other side, we're just going to get zero that comes in. Right? But then here, we're going to have whatever the value. We're going to have whatever the value was initially that is going to go to the other side. So, along this line, there is going to be discontinuity created by the flow of the pure transport equation. So, the pure transport equation flows into discontinuity if the domain is not, at least if the domain looks like this, if it's not convex. Right? So, if we study now the regularity up to the boundary for a kinetic equation with the influx boundary, Kinetic equation with the influx boundary condition, then the transport term sort of helps with the regularization inside, but doesn't really like the regularization on the boundary. Okay? At least in the non-converse case. But nonetheless, the regularization effect wins. So this would be sort of the result. If we have the kinetic equation with rough coefficients and we have a uniformly elliptic. And we have a uniformly elliptic coefficients with the influx condition, then you have held the continuity up to the boundary, right? This C naught could be anywhere up to the boundary even on the boundary of the domain, right? So this is intersection, I'm intersecting my cylinder, my kinetic cylinder, with the points that are inside of the boundary, right? So the Helecontinuity works all the way up to the boundary. The way up to the boundary. But there are some things that have to be understood. If the domain is convex, the constant here does not depend on the point where I'm centering the estimate. In particular, it doesn't depend on the velocity. And it doesn't depend on the shape of the domain either. Provider is convex. So the curvatures are not going to play any role. If the domain is not convex, then If the domain is not convex, then this constancy will depend on many other things because I'm gonna have to do that flattening the domain change of variables. Right? And in particular, as the velocity of my center goes to infinity, the constant deteriorates. So if you want to apply the estimate to the Lando equation and try to do some sort of, you know, do it as a first step for a conditional regularity result, you have to take care of the deterioration for large velocities. Deterioration for large velocities if the domain is not convex. But for convex domain, the system is very clean. Presence, good? No? Okay. So this is the result that I want to explain more or less. Alright? So let me start with some I know no no the I have actually what? Two more variations of the result. Variations of the result. First, this one is silly. I mean, it's going to be silly once we understand what's going on, but I want to state it. If we have a sub-solution of the equation with zero influx boundary condition, then you can pound the L infinity norm with respect to the L2 norm. This is the first step of the Geochi. The Geochey, you have L two to L infinity and then L infinity to C alpha. I'm saying you can also do the L two to L infinity for uh sub solutions with zero boundary conditions, right? Boundary conditions, right? And this should be for a non-negative subsolution. So this should be the supremum of f. I don't think I wrote non-negative anywhere, but anyway. And this one is sort of funny. Let's suppose that you look, you have the C, we put zero boundary condition for the influx boundary condition. Now, if I take any point that is in the incoming part of the boundary, you see that I have a strict inequality here. So this means Have a strict inequality here. So, this means that I'm taking one point where the velocity is pointing inwards, somehow is going into the domain. It doesn't have to be perpendicular to the boundary, but it's somehow going towards the inside. Then, I have zero boundary conditions, so the function is equal to zero at this point on the boundary, but the decay of the function when z approaches the boundary point is faster than any. Boundary point is faster than any algebraic rate. So there is an infinite order of vanishing, right? Which is funny, right? You don't see infinite order of vanishing so much for boundary conditions of PTs. So there is one equation that has infinite order of vanishing on the boundary condition, we have zero boundary condition, which is the heat equation. If you take the heat equation and your initial data vanishes in a ball, right, then the function is gonna Then the function is gonna lift off from zero with an infinite order vanishing. The heat equation with constant coefficients. If you put a parabolic equation with rough coefficients, I wouldn't know if that's true or not. I don't know. I haven't put too much thought into that problem, but it's sort of a fun problem. Imagine parabolic equation with rough coefficients, initial data zero in some ball. Is it going to vanish? At what order is it going to vanish? Boundary condition zero? Initial van. Zero? Initial value. So what you're saying in time? What about like on a spatial domain? No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about a local estimate, right? If you have a solution of the heat equation, what happens far away, I don't care, right? So the boundary condition is irrelevant. If at time zero, the solution of the heat equation vanishes in some open set, then regardless of the boundary condition far away, it's going to separate from zero with. It's going to separate from zero with infinite order vanishing. Yeah, yeah, m derivative. M-derivative. Fine-derivative. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, it's identically zero in X, right? Because it's given. Okay, but I guess the analogy, I don't know how close it is. No, it's actually a very fairly close analogy because here you have the boundary in X, right? But X in the equation is first order in X. And the heat equation is first order in time. Right? So here you have. So here you have a velocity that is sort of going inwards, right? So you can think about what's going on here as some sort of initial value for the heat equation, right? Except that if you give me the heat equation and you put rough coefficients, I don't know how to prove infinite order of vanishing at the initial time. I'm not even sure if it's true for parabolic equations. What do you mean by rough? Like just L infinity bounds? Let's take a parabolic equation and put uniformly. Equations and put uniformly elliptic coefficients. But they are not smooth, right? And then if the initial data has a piece that is zero, I don't know if the solution is going to, at what order the solution is going to vanish. You can just do this with like heat kernel balance. Well, for the heat equation. No, no, no, no, no, but for the heat equation, let's suppose how would I do it for the heat equation, right? If the initial data is zero, the Laplacian is zero, then the time the derivative is zero. Derivative is zero. Then the second derivative is the pi Laplacian, which is also zero. Third derivative is the Laplacian to Q, which is also zero, and then you keep going. Right? So for the heat equation, I differentiate the equation to get the infinite order vanishing. I think you just do it from the heat kernel, though. I don't think so. The moment that the coefficients are dependent on time and are graph, they have graph dependence on time, you don't have You mean from the decay of the T, that it decays? Because when you're in a small time, it's like you learned. Maybe, yeah, maybe, maybe. And then there, there's very nice. Yeah, yeah, actually, yeah, that might work, actually. Yeah, that might work. Yeah. But it's not very helpful for your problem. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. But it could be a solution for the question I was raising right now. Yeah. That's actually another question. Yeah. That's actually another bad approach. Yeah, because you cannot decays like a loss. Right? Alright, that's that's pretty good. Okay. So all right, so we're gonna get this vanishing of infinite order in the incoming part of the boundary. Alright, so now let me start with the tools that you have to use to deal with this kind of thing. So when we study kinetic equations, we have Study kinetic equations, we have to use this Lie group structure that is the one that really keeps the transport part of the equation invariant, right? So, this is the group structure that corresponds to inertial changes of variables. So, if I compose these two vectors in R to the 2d plus 1, it's the same as adding them, except that it has this extra time. So, it's like when you have a solution, When you have a solution, you compose to the right, on the left, with this Galilean Lie group structure, and you have another solution. This corresponds to taking a solution and looking at the same solution from a different inertial frame. There is a scaling that also agrees with the class of solutions, which is like the parabolic scaling in R and T, but it has another power with respect to X, and it's R X cubed, with R, that is R cubed. With R and R2. Okay? So you have to be careful when you work with genetic equations not to ever add points. I mean, it sounds silly, right? But this is the type of, this is the group structure you have to use between different points that involve time, space, and velocity. And sometimes you would add points in places implicitly without realizing. For example, if you take a modification of a function, you say, If you take a modification of a function, you say, I have a solution, so I can prove something from the solution smooth. I want to modify it and pass the limit. When you modify, you're taking translations of your solution. So, translation is like adding something to the variable txv. So, you have to be careful to modify with respect to this group structure. So, everything you do ever with kinetic equations has to be with respect to this group structure. You should never add points in space. Okay? I need something to be a little. Okay? And it's something to be a little bit careful. So, when we define a kinetic cylinder, we have to do it with respect to this loop structure. What's a kinetic cylinder? Well, we know in elliptic equations we have balls, in parabolic equations we have cylinders, which is a ball in space times an interval in time. In kinetic equations, we have this kinetic cylinder, is an interval in time, a ball in space, a ball in velocity. But this is the unit cylinder. If I want to center it at some other point, To center it at some other point and I want to change the radius, I'm going to apply the scaling and the degroup structure to the initial unit cylinder. So if the velocity where I center my cylinder is not zero, this is going to be a slanted cylinder because the Lie group structure introduces this extra term that sort of makes the ball in space be translated through time, right? Because it's in an emotional frame, so things Because it's noisy and irrational frame, so things are moving. All right? So, our kinetic cylinders that are the places in which you sort of improve the oscillation, iterate to get the continuity, have to be this sort of oblique cylinder. All right, and this is, you know, it looks sort of silly, but I have to say it, which is the definition of weak solutions. If I have the equation and I have the incoming boundary condition. I have the incoming boundary condition on the incoming third of the boundary, so it's the influx condition. I would define the solution just with the usual iteration by parts argument, but my test function has to be vanishing in the outgoing part of the boundary. Because in the outgoing part of the boundary, I don't know what the value of my function is. I'm only determined the boundary condition is only determined the incoming part of the boundary. So when you do the integration by parts, you have to do it only for functions feed. Paths you have to do it only for functions feed that vanish on the outgoing path. Right? And let me make some observations about the type of what the weak solutions are going to satisfy. First, by definition they are in L2 of H1, right? This is also something you can prove by diffusion of energy. But even from the definition, they were functions where the gradient was in L2. So they are In L2. So they are L2 in time and space, H1 in velocity. So they have one derivative in velocity. If you plug this into the equation, you see that this term over here is going to be L2 Tx in H minus 1 in velocity, right? So this term, just by virtue of F being here, is there. And because of the equation, you see that the transport term has to belong to this space. Okay? Okay? That's negative one derivative in velocity. And this is a space, you may have seen this paper by these four guys. They call it the kinetic subbless space. And in their paper, they also put some weight in velocity. So it's sort of, I mean, you need to use this estimate to get some of the usual things that you would expect. For example, For example, I'm talking about boundary conditions. So it would be convenient to work in a space where the boundary condition is well defined, where there is a notion of trace, right? So there is a notion of trace if the function is here and the transport operator is there. If the function is here and you don't have anything else, there is no trace in space. L2 in Tx doesn't give me a trace in space. But if you add that the transport operator is here, then there is a well-defined trace in some way. There is a well-defined trace in some weighted L2 space. So that allows you to make sense of the boundary condition in some way, not only by all the integration but parse type of way. Some other observation, if the boundary condition is zero, then one can extend zero across the incoming part of the boundary and you have a solution across. Right? In the same way that for linear equations, if it's zero on the boundary, you can extend it as zero. And things go well. And things go well. But there is no, that's not eventual. But there is no obvious way to extend f across the outgoing part, because in the outgoing part, you don't know the value, you don't know what it would be on the other side. At least it's not obvious what it should be beyond the outgoing part of the boundary if you wanted to extend it. Right? And well, if you, with the definition I gave, you can, the usual formula for the chain rule applies when size is small from. Applies when the size is a small function. And that's fine. So now I want to look at a non-negative sub-solution. So non-negative sub-solution would be something that, let's see what this should happen. Imagine that you have a sub-solution of the equation, and it's zero on the incoming part of the boundary. Then one way to extend it would be if we extend it as zero everywhere outside of the boundary, then it's going to be a sub-solution across. Because there are two parts of the boundary. Because there are two parts of the boundary. Where we have the incoming part of the boundary, then the zero extension coincides with the boundary condition that we are given. And when we are in the outgoing part of the boundary, because my function is non-negative, if I extend it by zero, then there is a jump that's going down. Then it makes it more of a sub-solution. So a sub-solution, a non-negative sub-solution, is a function that when we extend it as zero, When we extend it as zero, it's a subsolution across the data. Okay? Notice that if I wanted to define subsolution just with integration of parts in the usual distributional formulation, we would run into some trouble. Because when we have this inequality, if the solution is in L2 of H1, then this term is in L2 of H1. This term is in L2 of H1, but because there is inequality, you cannot conclude that the transport term is in L2 of H1. So, for sub-solutions, we do not have a good notion of trace. And if we do not have a good notion of trace, there could be a lot of technical difficulties. So, the best way to think of sub-solutions that actually only applies to non-negative sub-solutions is that these are the functions that when you extend them at zero, it's a sub-solution. Extend them at zero, it's a subsolution across. Right? And this is something that you can prove is true for the positive part of a solution. So if you take a solution in the usual distributional sense, you take the positive part and it's going to be a non-negative subsolution in this way, that if extension is a subsolution across. And then the L2 to L infinity result is just, you know, nothing. You just say I extend it as zero. You use Extend it as zero, you use the interior estimate. So the L2 to L infinity estimate just applies. Notice that when you do the L infinity norm in the half cylinder with respect to the L2 norm in the full cylinder, this constant is not going to depend on anything, it's not going to depend on the shape of the domain, it's not going to depend on where you center it, because once you extend it as zero, you forgot about the shape of mobile. Okay? Um all right um so what about the Hedley continuity? When you prove the Heder continuity, resulting, let's say you want to prove the George Nashmoss theorem, you always end up with a lemma in a le with a lemma like this, which is sort of the bottleneck. You have a subsolution in some cylinder. Here I'm talking about the interior regulated result, okay? I didn't put any boundary on this slide. Okay, I didn't put any boundary on this, right? If you put the if you have a subsolution in a cylinder and you know that the function is zero or less or equal than zero in some portion of the cylinder, then it's going to be less than one minus theta in the half cylinder. Here I didn't write what q minus is. So I want to make a picture. So if time goes this way, and here I'm putting both x and velocity. Here I'm putting both x and velocity. This whole thing is q1. This one over here is going to be q1 half. And q minus is something over here. Right? I don't know if I die. I don't know. I don't know. Okay? So if the function is zero or less frequent than zero in a fraction of q minus, then the maximum has to go down when we go to q one half. This is sort of like the heart of the layer. This is sort of like the heart of the lemma, the lemma that is the heart of the proof of Heldecontinuity, in the proof of the Georgi or even the proof of Tito-Safan. So that is it. If I want to look at the, if I want to write this lemma up to the boundary for a non-negative subsolution, you can do it sort of literally writing the same thing. Because if you have a non-negative subsolution, that is a zero on a portion of q minus, but now we have But now now we have some some domain omega and maybe and then we look at the stuff that is inside and stuff that is outside when we extend it as zero we can still apply the interior regularity result and it applies sort of literally right the problem is that if when we prove the Helder continuity of a solution we will be applying this lemma to try Will be applying this lemma to truncations of f at different levels. And sometimes you look at the level and you get what's below that level, right? That's m minus f plus or f minus m plus. And m would be some level that is usually taken to be the middle value between the maximum and the minimum of the function in the cylinder or stuff like that. So when you start ranking at different levels, if you have, let's say, if we start with a function f that vanishes in the incoming part of the boundary, In the incoming part of the boundary, choosing those levels will ruin your boundary condition. If you start with the boundary condition that is zero or you truncate at a different level, your boundary condition may become non-zero. So if the boundary condition was exactly zero, then this lemma applies without any problem. But maybe you cannot ensure the boundary condition will be zero across the iteration of the Chorci, because you're going to be truncating at different levels. Okay? At different levels. Okay. Luis, can you. So, in the last slide, you did this procedure of extending away zero and saying that it's removing the boundary conditions. And this is on any part of the boundary, not just the incoming part? Well, the point about the, this is what I was saying in the previous slide. If you have a sub-solution, right? And it's zero on the incoming part of the boundary, then if I extend a zero everywhere outside, on the incoming part of the boundary, Outside, on the incoming part of the boundary, my boundary condition matches what I have on the outside. And in the outgoing part of the boundary, because the function is non-negative, my jumps go downwards. So it's more of a sub-solution. So when I extend a zero a sub-solution, it stays a sub-solution. Right? It wouldn't be the same for solutions or for super solutions, but it works for sub-solutions. Okay? And I have another comment. Yeah. When f is zero on gamma minus. Yeah, when f is zero on gamma minus, f minus m plus is also zero and gamma minus. If m is positive. Yeah. You will have to go post. Yeah, you don't know what you're cutting. Yeah, you're right, right. So, you know, if you imagine that you want to prove Kerala continuity, right? And let's say that you have the incoming part of the boundary that is you're not centering at the incoming part of the boundary, you're centering somewhere else. Part of the boundary, your center is somewhere else. But there is some incoming part of the boundary somewhere in your cylinder. Right? When you do the iteration to get helder continuity, you're going to be cutting at different levels. And they're going to converge to the value of the function of the point when you iterate. They're going to get closer. So eventually you're going to be cutting at some level that is non-zero, unless your function is zero exactly at the point where you're centering the iteration. And it could happen that there is some incoming part of the. Happen that there is some incoming part of the boundary somewhere in your cylinder. So that could be a difficulty in the proof. But it could also happen that there is no incoming part of the boundary, and in your ceiling, there is only outgoing part of the boundary. And if there is only outgoing part of the boundary, then you have no difficulty. Because on the outgoing part of the boundary, there is no boundary condition. So there is really no boundary condition that you have to match. Boundary conditions you have to match. You can translate the function up and down, you can do whatever you want, and the fact that the function is zero in the incoming part of the boundary is irrelevant because there is no incoming part of the boundary in your domain. So if there is no incoming part of the boundary in your cylinder, then you just do the same procedure as the indeed regularity results and it's gonna work, right? Because at every level you extend with the values that you are targeting, right? Tuncate, right? And it doesn't matter because you have no boundary condition. So I'm going to focus on the convex case because for the non-convex case, I will do the change of variables that flattens the boundary to make it convex. Okay? So what happens with the convex domains? You know, if let's suppose if the domain is called the domain, the domain is If the domain is convex and we are centering at the point that is close to the incoming part of the boundary, then what's happening is that there is going to be a portion of this single Q minus that is going to be outside of the domain. Now this picture is not really the interesting picture because you see that here I'm making the the domain in space and my cylinder to be uh vertical. Vertical, which is only the case if V0 is equal to zero. So if the velocity was non-zero, the picture would not be like this, because my cylinder will be tilted, will be oblique, right? The point about the incoming part of the boundary is that in the incoming part of the boundary, the cylinders are coming from the outside and not from the inside. So if you have a convex domain and you have an x-0 here, maybe you're centering anywhere close. The cylinder is coming from the outside. If the point is near some point with the incoming part of the boundary. And if it's coming from the inside, now my Q minus is somewhere over here. And from the convexity, well, in this picture, it's all the way outside, right? It's an exaggerated picture. But what I'm saying is that being the incoming part of the boundary helps you find. Part of the boundary helps you find points in Q minus that are all the way outside. And convexity is also helping you find points that are all the way outside. You need both assumptions to guarantee that there's going to be a fraction of Q minus that is outside of the domain. And this fraction only depends on convexity. So it doesn't depend on the shape of omega, on any curvature, on any other feature of the shape of omega. And it doesn't depend on the velocity of T0. Velocity or V0 in this point, other than the fact that it has to be a velocity that is an incoming part of the boundary. So this sometimes the mouse point disappears when it gets over the little window, so you might have to exit. Yeah, then you can kill it. Now what's the key? Now what's the the key to put the domain full screen? Okay. So this is a lemma that will uh allow us to prove that let's say if the incoming uh boundary condition is zero, then the function will converge to zero on the boundary with certain header continuity. With certain Helder continuous models of continuity. So it's interesting to understand the difference between the incoming part of the boundary and the outgoing part of the boundary. So let's say that here the light yellow portion is what is inside the domain omega and the darker part is what is outside of omega. So here this horizontal variable is x, the vertical variable is time, and g is not drone. Not drawn. So if we are in the incoming part of the boundary, the cylinders come from the outside, and you have that most of the cylinder is going to be coming from outside of the domain. If you are in the tangential part of the boundary, then the cylinders are going to be split in half, roughly. And if you are in the outgoing part of the boundary, then the earlier parts of the cylinder are going to be coming from the inside of the remote. Okay? So if we want to prove the Kelsey continuity at any point, At any point, we will have some sort of improvement of oscillation iteration that has a dichotomy. The dichotomy is: if there is no point in the incoming boundary anywhere near anywhere inside my cylinder, I will use the same as the interior regularity iteration. If there is some point of the incoming boundary sufficiently near the center, then you have an improvement in the LE fitting. Then you have an improvement in the L infinity norm because my boundary condition is zero. So naturally, I want to prove that the function conversion to zero on the incoming part of the boundary. So eventually it's going to happen that if you have a point that is not on the incoming part of the boundary, eventually you're going to move out from case one into case two. But all together you can join the iteration and have a a nice improvement of oscillation that goes all the way into a header continuous models and continuity that will be independent of everything. That will be independent of everything at the end. Okay? So, this is how the iteration goes to prove the Helder continuity up to the boundary. And in the convex domain with constants that do not depend on anything. So, let's see what happens. How do we get the infinite order vanishing? So, what happens is that when you you know the the cylinders You know, the cylinders have a scaling that is different in space, time, and velocity. So recall that my cylinder QRC0 was C0 applied to the scaling of Q1, right? And the scaling Pxv, we have to multiply T times R squared, X times R Q. x times R cubed and V times R. So there is a different scaling with respect to X, V and T. So when you make it oblique, the scaling is going to affect one variable more than the other. In a way that is going to make that on small scales, most of the cylinder is going to be outside of the domain. Now the picture is admittedly wrong and also the statement here. Wrong and also the statement here, right? They're not really becoming more oblique. The angle is always the same because the angle is always V0. But the scaling in space and time makes it much thinner in space than in velocity and in time. The problem is that that's harder to draw and I I I find it more educational to first give you the wrong statement and then the correction and to give you the right statement because it then is harder to process the other one. Process the other one, I think. So I sort of confused you on purpose. Sometimes it's good to get people confused, right? So the point is most of the cylinder will be outside of the domain if we start at any point in the incoming part of the boundary. And as r goes to zero, we can get a proportion arbitrarily close to one of the cylinder that is completely outside. Cylinder that is completely outside. And if the proportion arbitrarily close to one is completely outside, then when we apply the L2 to L infinity estimate, right, it says that the L infinity norm in half the cylinder has to be less or equal than the constant times the L2 norm of F in the cylinder, but the L2 norm of F is going to involve, it's going to be, you know, you're integrating 0 in most of the cylinder, right? So you're integrating the function f at most. The function f at moments in a teeny tiny part here. So you get that the L infinity norm I just ignore that. Yeah. Okay. The L infinity norm in the half cylinder is going to be less or equal than a constant that goes to zero as R goes to zero times the L infinity norm in the larger cylinder. So you know, if you have improvement of oscillation at this cylinder less or equal than a constant less than one times the oscillation Less than one times the oscillation in the double cylinder, then the exponent in the coder continuity estimate will depend on that constant less than one. If the constant is arbitrarily small, then you can get the exponent arbitrarily large. So having this constant go to zero as r goes to zero tells you that the function will vanish at infinite order in the incoming part of the value. So that's the funny part of the result, that we get infinite order of vanishing Infinite order of vanishing in the incoming part of the boundary. Of course, the moment that you add a non-zero boundary condition or a non-zero right-hand side, then you don't have infinite order of vanishing anymore. The order of vanishing will have to match the scaling of whatever other terms you introduced. But at least in the zero-boundary case, it gives you a very clean thing because you don't see very often. You don't see very often infinitoidal functions. Alright? Okay, so I'm going to stop here. Do we have questions? Go with others before me. I suspect. So I have an annoying question about the boundaries. Annoying. Why annoying? If your domain is convex, but it has a corner, is there some weak way? Is there some weak way? You don't have a normal anymore, so is there a weak way to define your boundary condition? So you're questioning my definition of solution because I said my test function has to vanish in the outgoing path, and you don't know exactly what the outgoing path is, right? Yeah. So presumably, if you have a leach's boundary, then Then, almost everywhere on the boundary, you can describe whether it's incoming or outgoing. And then sets of measure C on the boundary shouldn't really count. So the corner is one point. So then your estimate should probably still apply. Yeah, I don't see anything that I would. You know, the estimate doesn't depend on anything on the boundary. So there is no reason to expect this to fail. To expect this to fail. But convex domains are Lipschitz, for sure. So at least in the realm of Lipschitz domains, it's going to be more or less determined the normal derivative almost every way. Yeah, so you have the you have the coefficients or holder continuous. Yeah. What's the best to remember, right? So if the coefficients are holder continuous, you will want to m do some sort of shauder estimate. To do some sort of shader essence. The problem is that even if you take the Kolmoborov equation, that is constant coefficient, on the tangential part of the boundary, the solution is not going to be very regular. There is only a certain amount of Helder continuity that you get. So you cannot expect more than that. So yeah, eventually we would like to do some sort of shadow, but I'm not sure. Sort of shadow that, but I'm not sure exactly what the statement would be. Because you cannot get C1 regularity on the tangential part of the boundary, even for the first Kolmodov equation that I wrote with the Laplace. You only get held continuity in the tangential part. Tangential part, I mean, those points on the boundary where the velocity is perpendicular to the normal, to the boundary. At those points, there is some singularity. Something like that, but we cannot do better than that. Questions? Russell, yes. Oh, and then Robert. So you know I'm not very well informed on kinetic equations, so I apologize if this is. No, no, no, no. This last result that you're talking about actually is, I would say, fascinating, and I'm curious for simpler versions of the equation, was there already evidence? Of the equation, was there already evidence to suggest the infinite order of vanishing, or did it really pop out from how the special geometry of your B group affects the? I didn't know it. So you never. This literally came after you wrote the proof and you said, oh, look, this is. Yeah, exactly. I was writing the proof and I was like, wait, wait a minute. This is vanishing very much. So it seems to be an effect that if I would say that the geometry of the equation in the sense that of the transformation is And a posteriori, I thought of the fabric equation. And now Chris knows how to do it for parabolic equations. But it seems like a statement that an equation that if the geometry is such that so if the equation is such that it's a certain scales, you get this reduction of oscillation, and then the geometry is such that when you rescale, you get a certain phenomenon that interacts with your constants. It's like, that's. Constants. Yeah, on the other hand, if you think about the heat equation example, I was thinking about whether I could reproduce the same argument, and it doesn't quite work. So even though you have different scaling in time and space, because the parabolic cylinders are not oblique, you do not have this effect. So it's a different. For the heat equation, you cannot do it with this same argument. Project. Oh, yeah, I have two questions if you don't mind. The first one is about the boundary condition. So for the inflow condition in the wor context, I'm getting the sense from Martinique that that it's uh easier than the specular condition, or is it the same? Another easier is the term. The result that you get is cleaner. It's cleaner. It's cleaner. Cleaner. Cleaner. Because for the specular reflection, I don't know any way to remove the dependence of the constant on the shape of the domain, and more importantly, the shape of the domain, on the velocity of the point where you center your estimate. I don't know how to remove that dependence for spectrum of reflection. Whereas for influx, you do remove that dependence, at least for complex. That dependence, at least for conflict on it. I hope I'm not wrong, but my understanding is that for the small data perturbative context, a lot of the inflow of the condition is harder, so a lot of problems are still overcome. And so my second question is. The thing is that the strategy for specular reflection is very natural. Yeah, right? Because it's what I said. I mean, I just gave a slide. That's like you flatten the boundary and you reflect, and that's it. I mean, that's the idea. There is, you know, there is not much to think about. So, I wouldn't say that the influx is simpler. But it is true that the Heder estimate that we get at the end is cleaner than the one for spectral reflection. Specular reflection, what you have to do is clear. You're going to have to reflect. What is the second? Oh, yeah, so for specular reflection, Um compared to um small data case, then uh what is the uh so the so the concepts depend on the the small data case I mean I guess that the paper you're thinking about is probably the one I okay Okay. Yes. That's the paper that I cited. So in the paper, in the small, in that paper that they do small data case, they discover like some sort of some section in which they sort of analyze the problem, the linear problem. That's why I said that the proof of the result is essentially even in our paper. Essentially, even if paper, it's not explicitly stated like this. But they do the specular reflection. They do the flattening, the boundary, and the specular reflection. And they mention that they're going to apply these results to that extended proton, right? So it's a store visualizing that paper, okay? And you see that you can do it if for a specular reflection, you could even do it for shadow estimates, right? The moment that you extend it, you have uh you do have no boundary anymore. Uh you have no boundary anymore. But I think then if you extend, you get discontinuous I don't think you get this continuous coefficient. If your con if your coefficients are continuous Yeah, but after you extend do the extension you you get I will have to think about it but I I I well you have I'm not sure. I not I don't I'm not sure. I'm not I don't believe that. You certainly can do higher regularity because of the no no no I think you're fine actually. Well because at at best won't your coefficients have sorry at best you could hope for your coefficients will have some kind of corner right no they don't have corner right
