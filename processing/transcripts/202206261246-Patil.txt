Opportunity to talk about my work. I'm Arya Patel. I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. And today I'll be talking about work that's being done with Wen Erie, Josh Fiegel, who are at the University of Toronto, and David Thompson, who we all know very well at Queen's. And before I actually talk about my work, I want to give you a quick A quick look at the sort of the top panel of this slide. While this looks like abstract art, this is actually a time series measurement of a star. And credit goes to Connie Eds, who's an astroseismology expert at KU Leuven. And this is exactly what astroseismology is. We are looking at time series measurements of stars to look at the seismic waves inside them. And it's nice to be following Jeffrey's talk because. Following Jeffrey's talk, because some of the seismic wave concepts will be repeated here. And of course, we're applying multi-taper methods here because we are looking into the time domain and trying to improve the analysis. So, the overview of my talk is that I'm going to give a brief introduction of astro seismology, assuming that not everyone here has heard about it. Has heard about it. And then I'll talk a little bit about the time series data that we have, the current methods we use, their limitations, and how we are trying to improve that with multi-taper spectral analysis and the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. And the motivation of all this work is to better understand exoplanets, stars, as well as galaxies. And I'll talk about how we kind of try. Kind of try to touch all of these aspects. And I'm an astronomer, so I will be focusing on that a little bit. So any introduction for astroseismology starts with the sun, because that's the star we know the most. And the idea is that helioseismology looks at the sort of waves that occur inside these stars. We have two types: one is the pressure. Is the pressure mode or P mode, which are acoustic waves that happen in the envelope of the star? And here the restoring force is pressure. And then there are G modes or gravity modes, which occur in the core of the star. And these are due to the restoring force of buoyancy. And what happens is that if we study these waves, we can actually look into the deep interiors of stars, which we cannot do otherwise. Stars, which we cannot do otherwise. Now, the interesting thing is that after helioseismology, people tried to look at these waves in different types of stars. And what we found is that these low mass oscillations that we see in the sun and stars like the sun also appear in high mass stars. And here, the interesting thing is that the zones of the star are flipped. So instead of having a convective envelope and Having a convective envelope and a radiative core. We have a convective core and a radiative envelope. And what that means is now we see gravity modes at the surface. And so we can study all these types of waves with these stars. And just a quick look at how these waves look like and how they change the shape of the star or size of the star. And we measure these changes through measurements. Changes through measurements of the light of the star. And this goes back to spherical harmonics. I'm just showing examples of radial, dipole, quadrupole modes with different what we call azimuthal orders. And just to give you a quick overview of how the or just visualization of how this looks, this is what a dipole mode with m equals zero would look like. And these are the sorts of oscillations that we're looking at. So these are quite complex, and to me, they're very beautiful. And so we're trying to study these. And sort of combining all of this together, here I'm showing what is called the Hartspring-Russell diagram. I won't go into the details of this diagram, but the idea is that we can put all the stars into one diagram and show. Diagram and show the different types and their evolution. And the x-axis here is temperature, which actually goes high temperatures to the left. And then y-axis is the luminosity, which goes above. And what I'm showing here is that most of the high-mass stars, which are generally high-temperature stars, have gravity modes that are dominant. Whereas in the low-mass stars, we have pressure. Whereas in the low-mass stars, we have pressure modes, and I'll be talking about how that helps the understanding of galaxies. And I'll be focusing on the solar-like stars right here. And another thing I want to point out is that the red giants, which are sort of evolved low-mass stars, also behave like the sun. And this is one property we'll be using in the analysis. So now I'm actually going to dive into the time series analysis, which is interesting to all of us. And here I'm showing an example time series of a star that's like the sun. And this is measured with the Corot Space Telescope. And ideally, what we want to do is take this time series and convert it into a spectral estimate. And what we expect is that in the low And what we expect is that in the low frequency, there's some stellar activity. There's rotation peaks and harmonics, which come from the rotation of the star. We have some granulation, which is coming from sort of convection at the surface of the star, and some noise. But the most interesting part here is the acoustic modes or the pressure modes that I was talking about. And they show up in this sort of Gaussian envelope pattern. And if we were to zoom into this, we would see. We were to zoom into this, we would see several modes that the star shows. And these modes are basically with different sort of L, different M, and as well as the radial order. And there are two things that I want to point out. One is that these modes have a Lorentzian shape in frequency because these are quasi-periodic in nature. You can kind of understand them. You can kind of understand them using damped harmonic oscillators. And one interesting thing about how they are structured is that there's this delta nu parameter, which tells us how different modes with the same degree L are spaced. And we expect that this spacing happens all across these different modes. And this is described with this equation here. And this is described with this equation here, which is to first order. Of course, there are some variations here, but we see that they have some regularity. And there's another parameter, new max, which is the maximum, the frequency where you see the maximum amplitude, if you were to draw a Gaussian envelope here. And these two parameters are actually related to the internal sort of this properties of the star. Of the star, specifically the density, and here g stands for something related to the gravity. I won't go into the details of this, but the idea is that if you have these two parameters and the temperature of the star, you can get very precise estimates of the mass and the radius. And here we use scaling relations, which is that we compare these parameters to that of the sun. So this is delta nu of the sun, nu max of the sun. And this would allow us to. And this would allow us to actually get values from the proportionality. And this is where the prospects for galactic archaeology or the history of the galaxy come in, which is what I work on, which is that if you are to get really precise mass estimates of a long, large number of stars in the galaxy, you can estimate the ages of those stars. And from those ages, we can actually trace the star formation history of the galaxy. The star formation history of the galaxy. And I want to point out that through astroseismology, we get the most precise ages, up to about 10%. That doesn't sound very precise, but for astronomy, that's very precise. And then quickly, I'm going to go over the challenges we are currently facing and in terms of the methods we use at the moment. So the first challenge is irregular or uneven sampling. Or uneven sampling. And I'm showing here, again, a time series of a star, particularly a red giant star, which is an evolved low-mass star. And you can see that we have measurements for over seven years from the Kepler Space Telescope. The main caveat here is that there are these gaps, and the problem is that Kepler observes over quarters of a Over quarters of about three months, and then there's a downtime. So we have these big gaps. But other than those big gaps, the sampling is quite even because it's evenly sampled at the time, in the time of the telescope. There are some corrections from that time to sort of the time at the barycenter or the center of the solar system, which causes some irregularities, minor. Some irregularities, minor irregularities, but otherwise it's more or less even. Until now, what people have been doing is they've been using the Lombs-Cargel peregram because that handles irregular sampling. And this has been the standard for quite a long time in astroseismology. But what we wanted to do was: can we go beyond the long-sagger periodogram? Beyond the Lampskargill periodogram. And this is because when you look at the sort of the original, the Scargill paper for this Lambskargill periodogram, we see that the kinds of signals they were looking at are very specific. It's periodic signal hidden in noise. This analysis is equivalent to the square splitting of sine waves, and this applies really well to strictly periodic signals. Signals. And our case is for quasi-periodic P-modes. So, what we wanted to do was that instead of using the Lomskargel periodogram, we just used what we call the non-uniform fast-fourier transform periodogram. We're just using the NUFFT to compute the classical period for our time series. And the reason that we are generalized. And the reason that we are generalizing the classical periodogram using NUFFT is because while the corresponding distribution of the classical periodogram is not well defined for uneven sampling, that is, it's not distributed, let's say, as a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom for sample Gaussian white noise. We don't understand it that well, but we expect that for quasi-regular sample. Expect that for quasi-regular sampling, the way we have, where we can separately handle gaps, this might work really well. So that was the first part. Then the second part is handling statistical inconsistency and bias. And this is where we look at multi-taper spectral analysis. And just to give you a definition, I think most of you already know. I think most of you already know of this, but here the variance of the estimator does not tend to zero as n tends to infinity, which is the number of samples, and that's the inconsistency. And it was interesting to me to find out that this was known way back by Raylight. And I think David Thompson pointed this out to me. And also, the bias is due to the spectral leakage. Is due to the spectral leakage. And we tried to understand this for the time series that we have. Again, I go back to the red giant time series and do what we call pseudo-Windows, which is I look at the frequency response of a purely periodic signal. And I find that there's a lot of variance in the Lombs tiger periodogram, which goes back to the inconsistency. And we see there's a lot of spectral leakage when I zoom into the two periodic modes or sorry, signals that I've added into this pseudo-window. Into the pseudo-window. And this is very important for astro seismology because we are looking at frequencies that are very closely spaced and the noise is quite high. And so now I'll talk about how we include multi-taper spectral analysis in this to kind of handle both irregular sampling as well as the statistical inconsistency and bias. How am I doing for time here? Okay. So, yeah, for here, what we are doing is again, we are taking the Slepian sequences. I'm showing an example here of different orders of Slepian sequences. And then we could just directly apply this to evenly sampled data to compute the sort of eigen coefficients and the. sort of eigen coefficients and the the Thomson multi-taper estimate. But as I said, we are using, we are dealing with irregular samples or rather quasi-irregular samples. And again, we go back to how Scargill mentioned using tapering right in the abstract. And this is what has been done before. I see something in the chat. In the chat. And yeah, so we use basically the cubic spline interpolation of the tapers, which was done in Springford Edie and Thompson paper, where they looked at sort of combining multi-tapering with the Lomps-Cargill periogram. And this is exactly what I show here: combining the Lomscrogger. Show here combining the Lomskargel with the multi-taper periodogram. And we see here that both the variance and the spectral leakage is reduced. And I show sort of two different bandwidth parameters just to see how the frequency resolution is reducing. And then we do the same thing, but with the NUFFT periodram. Periogram. So here we are just combining the multi-taper with the sort of classical periodogram extension that we have. And we see that they more or less look very similar. And all our tests kind of suggest that they work very similarly for the kind of time series we are dealing with. I'm also showing the jackknife confidence interval, which we added to this computation. And yeah, this goes back to sort of how this should help us estimate the p-modes more accurately. But another thing I want to point out is that in the low frequency end, there's a lot going on, and we know that there's actually some exoplanet signatures that we can see in this particular star, which is a planet revolving around the star. And what this means is that we have mixed spectra. We have a continuum, we have some quasi-periodic. Continuum, we have some quasi-periodic modes, and at the same time, we have purely periodic exoplanet signals. And this is where we go to the F-test. Here I'm just showing the equation of the F-test, which is just the variance ratio test to find out if there's a purely periodic signal at a frequency F. And this is done with the help of the tapers, specifically the Tapers, specifically the discrete Fourier transform of the zeroth-order taper here, UK. And this estimate here is basically just the mean estimate of the amplitude of that periodic component. And we applied this to our estimate, the MTNUFFT estimate. Here, the NW is 4K sum. We applied this F statistic, we got the p-value. F-statistic, we got the p-values, then we did some multi-hypothesis testing to ensure that we are not overestimating the purely periodic signals. We do some BHQ and Bonferroni corrections and we find these sort of three, four different frequencies that are potentially purely periodic. And the interesting thing here is that these three actually. That these three actually correspond to exoplanet harmonics. And this is something we found would be very interesting for exoplanet detection, where people generally use something called the box periodogram in astronomy at the moment. So we were hoping that we could combine both the mode estimates with the exoplanet harmonics. And I quickly And I quickly want to mention that we also worked a little bit on the variance of the multi-taper F-test. This also comes back to sort of David's paper where he talked about if we have like a frequency estimate where the F test or the F statistic is the maximum, then we might be looking at a periodic component. And so, if we look at this periodic component and measure the variance, it comes out to be something like this: which is the Kramer-Rau bound with an additional factor of this variance efficiency raised to minus one. And this T here is basically just the total time duration of the time series. The Sn F naught is the spectrum. F naught is the spectrum, the noise spectrum, whereas SL is the line spectrum or the signal in the line component. And this is actually described by this equation here. And without going into the details of those equations, I just want to point out that combining those leads us to believe that or understand that the variance goes as 1 over t cubed. So if we were So, if we were to split the time series into smaller chunks because of this t-cubed factor, the variance won't increase that much. And actually, another reason we tried this is because sometimes the F-test can miss certain periodic signals if there are some variations across the time series. And this is what we are doing as well, and I'm sure. As well, and I'm showing a schematic here where I split the time series. This helps also let go of some of the gaps. And then I compute the periodograms for each of them, apply the F test. And what I find is that the frequency of this exoplanet signature at the very low frequency end is quite stable up to about the so this black one is the uncertainty we get. Is the uncertainty we get from the variance estimate, which we get through jackknifing? And this red is just the ray like resolution. And we find that this is actually good to check if a signal is purely periodic across the time series and there are no variations with stellar activity. And for the interest of time, I'm going to skip over this slide, but I want to mention that the previous one was. That the previous one was with sort of purely periodic high Q signals. But we also looked at sort of low Q signals, which is when we are looking at damped harmonic oscillators or the P modes. And in the pressure modes, we find that the frequency actually changes significantly beyond the sort of the uncertainties we expect. And here I'm just showing the frequency of a mode from the literature. Mode from the literature, and this is another frequency of a mode. And the width is just showing sort of the Lorentzian width. So, yeah, we are seeing that there is change in frequencies. Finally, we combined our multi-taper NUFFT periodogram with sort of estimation of modes. And here, what I'm showing is a simulated time series. Time series whose true PST is shown in orange. And then we calculate both the Lomskargel and the MTNU FFT and find that we get way better estimates with the multi-taper estimate. And this goes back to sort of describing the noise properties where the Lomskargel has a chi-square 2 distribution, whereas for the multi-caper, we are looking at a chi-square 2. Taper, we are looking at a chi-squared 2k distribution, and that means that our noise is actually becoming more and more Gaussian as the k is increasing. And then we finally estimated the sort of delta new and new max parameters that I talked about before by combining sort of modeling with the spectral estimates. And to the right, I'm just Estimates. And to the right, I'm just showing the likelihoods we use for Lombskargel, which goes back to the chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. And the one at the bottom, sorry, this should be not Lomskargel, this should be MTNU50. But the idea is that the likelihood for the chi-square 2k distribution stays basically the same, but there's an extra k factor added to it. And what that means is that we get similar estimates with both. That we get similar estimates with both these spectral estimators, but the errors are reduced by approximately one over whole root of k. And this is exactly what I'm showing here. If I compare Ramscargel versus MTNUF50, we get the delta new and new max parameters. The mean is very similar, but the standard deviation reduces by that factor. Factor. And this is why, sorry, it's important for precise mass and age estimation. And we can actually maybe go down below 10% age precision, which is the sort of benchmark right now. And we also compared the individual estimates of the modes. So the PB jam here is just the modeling we are using, which is combined with the Lomskargill. With the Lomskargel estimate, and here it's combined with MTNUFFT. And we find that the uncertainties from comparing to this literature, uncertainties, Lilo box, is smaller for NAMS Cargel and even smaller for MTNU50. And here it's the x-axis is the frequency and the y-axis is the difference between the literature value versus R value. And this goes back to more precise mass. To more precise mass and age estimates, because we can actually go beyond just using the scaling relations of delta nu nu max and actually model the whole star, which is more complex, but it can give better estimates. And this also goes back to galaxy formation and evolution. So, I think I'm almost out of time. I'm not sure, but here I'm But here I'm going to give you a few takeaways and the future work we're planning to do. So, I already talked about how we can do exoplanet detection. We can work with low-mass stars and understand their interiors. We can even look at galaxies. But we want to work on high-mass stars. So, the plot at the right, which I started at the very beginning of the talk, is of a slowly pulsating B star, which is a high mass star. And this shows G modes. Shows G modes, which are the gravity modes, which we expect to be purely periodic. And so we want to use the F test to see if we can do better with them. And we have some ongoing work on can we go beyond NUFFT? Is there something better? Which I'm sure there is. Can we go beyond spline interpolation of tapers? And I think there's a paper in the chat which we looked at, which is. At which is another interesting thing we want to try, which is dealing with the missing data. And then also optimizing NW and K. We looked at sort of Hailey's paper, but we are not sure how that would apply for our mixed spectra. And then finally, I have a Python package that I'm currently developing, which should ideally work for even and uneven sample with the methods that I've shown in this talk. Methods that I've shown in this talk. And yeah, thank you. Again, I want to mention that I'm an astronomer and I'm trying to do as good statistics as I can, but I welcome all comments and thoughts on this work. Thank you.
