The question then arises: how much of the apparatus of classical dynamical systems, and therefore this story that I'm showing you on this slide, how much of that will survive into the new world of hybrid dynamical systems arising because robots need to make and break contact with the world in order to get some work done in the world. Matt will be talking at the end about the extent to which Conley's ideas, the reconciliation. Ideas, the reconciliation of basins and topology, let's say, can be brought into the hybrid world. And then Paul in between will be talking about a route to formal programming. We want formal programming languages for robotics. And the question is, how do you get that? Well, if you're a mathematician, you understand that programming, if you want to think about programming in a formal way, you have to think about type theory. And type theory emerges from categories. And that's what Paul will talk about. From categories, and that's what Paul will talk about. All right, so I'm going to be using this sort of generic cartoon version of a basin to stand for the notion of an energy landscape, the symbol in these landscapes being exactly the basins. Here's an early work that Ilon Rimon, one of my early doctoral students, did with me, where we took advantage of Smail's demonstration that you could always get gradient fields. We pushed Smale's paper on gradient. Smel's paper on gradient fields to convince ourselves that you could always get a gradient field on a manifold with boundary that had one minimum and went high on the obstacles. And Ilon is showing you in this picture from his paper that not only do these things exist, but you can actually build in low enough dimensions, if you have perfect knowledge, you actually can construct changes of coordinates to deform the topological model, let's say, of a sphere world, a bouquet of spheres. sphere world, a bouquet of spheres or wedge sum of spheres if you're a topologist, into the geometric instance that you knew in advance. We also were very, very interested in taking these ideas and thinking about simultaneous motion, multiple motion planning over cross products of configuration space of many different robots at the same time. And we got proofs of correctness of the generalization of these gradient fields onto such cross-product configurations. Fields onto such cross-product configuration spaces. I would say another very, very significant advance got going through interactions with Yuli Baryshnikov, Dan Goralnik, who I think is on the line here, also played an important role. This is Amur Arslan's PhD work where he showed how to build non-gradient fields that took advantage of Geralnik's and Baryshnikov's insight into the homogeneous. Nikov's insight into the homotopy type of a single hierarchy, a cluster hierarchy. And so, what Amura was able to do was come up with a sequential composition of basins, wherein each limit set was a limit cycle in that homotopy class respecting that cluster. And what he did with insight from Geralnik was to move through the tree space of the induced hierarchy class. Hierarchy class and give a computationally effective, it's quadratic in time and space, way of going from any configuration to any other configuration in this cross-product space with none of the restrictions and parametric need that we had in the gradient fields, still assuming perfect knowledge about the location of all the other robots. These ideas got used by some of my other collaborators to begin to build individuated. Build individuated motion planning manipulation projects. I'm showing you work by Ishid Bozma and her collaborators in Turkey. And most recently, we've taken these ideas where there's only one actuated body and all the other bodies are trying to follow these either gradient fields or hierarchical planning fields. Here's work that Vasilis would talk about when he gives you the account of task planning, where we're actually instantiating these disks. Actually, instantiating these disks with real-legged robots. To do that properly, we need many more compositions than sequential. We need this notion of a hierarchical composition that I won't say too much about except to give you this cartoon picture of a wrinkled energy landscape where there's a ditch and then the ditch leads down to the attractor at the bottom. And that ditch is the template, and the higher degrees of freedom are the anchor. And so that's a hierarchy. Paul will have a little bit more to say about this in the context. We'll have a little bit more to say about this in the context of hybrid systems and the categories they're in. Most importantly, to get this to work, we're leveraging Haile Avik Day's work, a different doctoral student who won't be speaking today, who came up with parallel compositions of legged limit cycles. And so in this composition of two parallel vertical hoppers, what Avic is showing you is that you can take two of these vertical things, and if the mass distribution And if the mass distribution is right, they turn into a dynamical seesaw to which you can add something like the kick of a spoked wheel, if you want to think about it that way, and you get these bounding controls. So Avic pioneered these parallel compositions and their proofs of correctness. And here's a generalization into a more complicated mechanism that I won't tell you very much about today, except insofar as to say that we've moved here from gradient fields all the way up to pretty. Up to pretty complicated compositions of low-level things that have kinetic energy as well as potential energy, and they have to be composed in pretty precise ways. Many of these compositions have proofs of correctness, but the important hierarchical leap of going from these sagittal plane views of the machines down to the horizontal plane view of the point particle that you were seeing above, that's still a work in progress. Okay. Okay, to give you a sense of how important it is to do away with prior knowledge, you know, remember what we're saying. We want to run these robots out in the physical world where we have no prior knowledge, except we may have some kind of a generic model. So if we have an inertial motion unit on our robot, and maybe we have some kind of a LIDAR that can see front, we're going to have some kind of an obstacle rejection and reaction and rejection module. And we want to be able to prove. And we want to be able to prove things about what these fast, high kinetic energy machines will do in the context of those data. So, we're going to take these basin letters of view where we're going to fill form words of sequences of them. We're going to have a model, a cartoon model of what the environment is like. This forest model is modeled as a smooth terrain punctuated by these very, very, very high obstacles, trees, if you will. High obstacles, trees, if you will. And under these kinds of controls, empirically, we've gotten hundreds of body, thousands of body lengths, you know, kilometers of autonomous climbing in reasonably complicated, unknown environments with some degree of provability in consequence of these compositions. Now, what I will not have time to say very much to you about today, I've got about two minutes left in my talk. I want to set in particular I want to set, in particular, I'd like you to consider what would happen if the point particle of the mass center of the robot was commanded to cross the chasm. Okay. And what's being done in this is a sequential composition of parallel things whereby we've got a swing up and drop controller that prepares a single stance leap using a point particle that has underneath it one of these what we call floating torso. We call floating torso composition. Now, I've said a mouthful, and I don't expect anybody to have understood in any detail what I said. Paul, I hope, will come back and spend some time talking about how he is going to help us, or we hope he's going to be able to help us, develop a formal programming environment that makes these compositions formal enough that they can be used in hierarchy with these point mass. These point mass level, either gradient fields or more complicated hybrid, perceptually hybrid systems of a kind that Vasius will talk to you about. So the hope here is that we're going to have a complete vertical stack that goes all the way up, all the way down from the abstract goal of moving the chairs from one corner of the room to the other corner of the room, all the way down to what the joint levels of these legged machines should be doing with the potential. Machines should be doing with the potential and kinetic energy. Okay, with that, I think I'm going to stop. I have flashed up much too quickly, of course, in real time, but if those of you who are interested in the references can copy it off the movie, or if you send me a note, I'll happily send you the set of references if you're interested. I'm very excited that this group has convened again. I've had long Convened again. I've had long conversations with my wonderful friend Michael Farber about these ideas. He's been very generous with his time and insight. Those of you who know Yuli know that he's just an endless source of inspiration and help in getting some of the results that I've alluded to before. But what I want to say to you is that the real work here is being done by the younger people. Vasilis is going to tell you about. Skies is going to tell you about getting rid of prior information. Paul is going to tell you about the category theoretic view that could lead to formal functional programming type theories. And then Matt will talk to you about the extent to which we think there's an agenda to move Conley's ideas and some of Michael's ideas on top of Conley, Michael Farber's ideas, on top of Conley's ideas into the all-critical world of hybrid dynamics, which is real. Hybrid dynamics, which is real where the real tasks of robots live. I'm going to stop there and Visias, I'm going to stop sharing. And I hope that if I get out of the way, I hope now that you are able to take over.
