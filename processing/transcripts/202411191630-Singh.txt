And trying to study infill subformation. I'll talk about it more in detail. So, when we talk about binary black holes, there are so many parameters which we have to look at. There are some of these listed here. These are which you might know all of this about. On the right-hand side, I have this table which talks about some orbital parameters like orbital angular momentum, orbital frequency, the psi1 and psi2 angles, and then something, a variable which characterizes how the peristron is changing. Is changing after every operator. So we have so many of these parameters, and except for mass, mass ratio, dimension spin magnitudes, everything else is changing as these binary black holes evolve aside. So here, as I said, we're going to be paying special attention to these spring-tilt angles, which are basically angles between the spring vectors of the binary black holes with the orbital angle L. Orbital angle limit of L. And also, since we are also studying eccentric binary black holes, we have to see what eccentricity is in our case. Because in GR, there is not a unique natural definition of eccentricity. So you have a choice of what kind of eccentricity you want to use. In our case, we have used something called temporal eccentricity EP from the quasi-capital parameterization to define the eccentricity. And this works well for us because it determines how the angular motion of the binary changes with time. And this is valid as long as the post-Neconal regime is valid. And the binary dynamics can be explained by the PN theory. So these eccentricity and spin tilts together have a very important role to find out what kind of formation channels these binary black holes are formed in. You can see some schematic on the right. Some schematic on the right, which basically talks about two main formation channels, as talks before us hinted about: isolated formation and dynamical formation. So, isolated formation, the thing which you are expecting is kind of like favoring aligned spin systems more, plus negligible eccentricities, because in GR, we expect that in an isolated formation channel, most of the eccentricity or almost all of the eccentricity is going to be decayed away by the time the binary black hole gets into the The binary black hole gets into the frequency range of the current ground-based detectors. On the other hand, you have dynamical formation channels, which characterize isotropic distribution of spins, spin vectors all over the space if you do a population study of minor black holes, along with non-negligible eccentricities. So if you're hunting for eccentric minority black holes, dynamical formation channels are really very impactful in that sense. So eccentricity and precession, the spin precession of the binary black holes. And precession, the spin precession of the binary black holes, play a really important role in the evolution of the binary black hole because they can change their dynamics and also the waveforms which we obtain. So the question here is we're trying to do a long-term evolution of a binary black hole. How do we actually study these long-term changes in a binary's evolution? So in this case, what you can do as a zero-thought approach is just directly integrate all the V-n equations. Directly integrate all the V and equations of motion which you have, which can be computationally expensive. So, what this approach does, called as orbit-averaged approach, which basically kind of like smoothens out the short-term changes and only helps us focus on the long-term secular evolution of the binary cold wavefront. So, here basically we're trying to solve ODEs for different parameters like omegas, thin vectors, angular momentum, etc. Angular momentum, etc. And just to give you a point about the accuracy of this code which we have implemented, right now it's accurate up to 3pm in the non-spinning terms and 2pm in the spinning terms. So just to give you a brief overview, we have almost completed the draft and the LBK internal review is going on. And this is a fourth-order adaptive, uses a fourth-order adaptive solver. So basically, if you start from here, this is at some reference. If you start from here, this is at some reference, and then you can either be that green guy or the purple guy. So the green guy is traveling forward in time where orbital velocity v is increasing. So if you start from that reference, you can actually go forward as much as PN theory allows us to do, and then basically use numerical relativity fits to find the remnant properties of the merger. That's one application of our code. Also, you can go backward, and then as V is reducing and the orbital separation is increasing. And the orbital separation is increasing between the binary, then this is the approach which I'm going to talk about. You can find the spin tilts and infinity and infer the formation channels from those spin tilts. So when we are actually going back in time and evolving to larger and larger orbital separations, at a point you have to make a choice that if I want to make a more efficient evolution of the micro black hole, I am actually going to have a lot of the market. I am actually going to be using more competitionally expensive orbit average equations, or I can use something called precession averaging, where instead of averaging out over what is happening over an orbit, you average out over a precessional cycle. And these precession oscillations of the spins, these spins are precessing, these oscillations actually reduce as we go back in time and move to higher and higher orbital separations along, corresponding to larger and larger orbital angular momentum magnitudes. Momentum magnitudes. So, for eccentric binaries, when ordered angular momentum becomes really large but it's still finite, we get well-defined tilts at infinity, and that's where we want to reach. So, as I just mentioned, this approach is very useful to find the spin tilts at infinity. You can evolve the binary as far as you want, as far as back in time as possible. One of the caveats, of course, is that you cannot track the spin precessional phase. And just to give you a comic on accuracy, it's a topi and A comic on accuracy is utopian accurate. So now we have looked at these two approaches: precession average being faster but less accurate, audit average evolution being slower but more accurate. So the question we're trying to ask is, can we use the power of both to actually start from some reference frequency all the way back in time and find the sprinted side? So over here we have a workflow which actually does that for us. That for us, where you start at the rightmost point at some reference frequency, which is characterized by a relatively small separation between the binaries, evolve the binary backward in time using orbit average equations, and after a point where it's no longer computationally feasible or it's computationally more feasible to do a precession averaging, you kind of like switch from orbit averaging to precession averaging and then evolve the binary all the way back to find spent edge. Spintage. Now, the question again is: how do we find this transition frequency? What is the optimal transition frequency? So, the authors in this paper cited below actually did a convergence test based on different kinds of V-trans values and find the one which worked for them given a target accuracy in the sprint tilts and affinity, which they were targeting over here. And it turns out to be just an empirical function of the mass ratio of the binary as coded in the equation on the top. Binary as coded in the equation on the top. So now, once you have this code, how do you actually test the accuracy which you get in the sprintails at infinity? So, what you do here is that you are this orange guy traveling backward, and at retrans, you kind of like hop from orbit average evolution to precession average evolution, and then go all the way to find the pitch infinity in the blue. Now, one way to compare the accuracy would be: what if you go even Would be what if you go even lower in Vtrans, use more of the audit averaging, so that means you're getting more accurate results, but at the cost of speed, right? And then switching at a later point at 0.5 Vtrans, which is further along. And then what you can do is also use that value as V trans, switch the evolution, and then find this fringe to infinity. But as I said, the authors in the quasi-circular paper actually found out that this was. Actually, they found out that this was computationally expensive to do. So, orbit average evolution, of course, is computationally expensive over a large number of orbits. So, they found another frequency which is close to this, or very close to this, 0.6 Vtrans. So, if you evolve to this, you are actually able to find sprint to infinity at a much faster time, especially for equal mass binaries where the 0.5 Vtrons becomes completely fluctuated. So, what we do here is using these two approaches. Here is using these two approaches in blue and green, you find the spinach at infinity and find the difference in the cosines between those two approaches. And for quasi-secular binaries, the authors were getting this accuracy, which is less than 10 to the negative for all the binary black holes they tested. So for eccentric binary black holes, however, you might be thinking that if we have to evolve some kind of special scheme which basically takes care of eccentricity to find those materials. Of eccentricity to find this materials. But we started very simple. We started from the same V-trans which they had quoted, the function of mass ratio, which I pointed out before, and asking this question whether the V-trans obtained in the cost of circular evolution is actually good for eccentric cases as well. So this is some kind of population which we have modeled over and tested our hybrid evolution code and compared the sprinkles and infinity to find the accuracy. And these are the plots which we have obtained. And these are the plots which we have obtained. We have plotted the difference in the cosines of the spin tilts at infinity. Purple corresponds to the tilt 1, and then green corresponds to the differences in tilt 2. We have plotted this with mass ratio Q and 1 minus eccentricity at 20 hertz, where we start the evolution. So you see that all the points are actually below this 10 to the negative 2 line. That means that this is actually worse than what the circular results were pointing out, but we We're pointing out, but we are actually satisfied with this accuracy. The question is: why? And the answer is that for our current LVK ground-based detectors, or even in the O5 run or in the A-sharp sensitivity, the statistical differences in the sprinted sign affinity which we are going to obtain are actually higher than this value coded over here. That's why we are satisfied with these accuracy for now. So then the question is: after all, we are trying to find the formation channels of these minor black holes. And then the question is: the spin tips at infinity, are these actually a good approximation to those at formation? So to answer this question, we can do a simple test where we compare the evolution of two distinct eccentricities and then basically try to find out what is happening for those two final black holes. Final black holes. So here I have two plots. One at the top corresponds to a higher relative eccentricity, 0.01, and then on the bottom is at a lower, starting from the lower eccentricity. And one thing I want to highlight over here is that if you look at the green, if you look at the green curve and the purple curve in the top half of each of the plots, you will see. Of each of the plots, you will see that the green and purple are actually closer to the black dashed line, which is basically the spin tilts which we get at the empirical value of V trans, which are coded as a function of mass ratio, which are plotted in the vertical black dashed lines. So you switch the evolution there, find the spin tilt infinity, and then compare what we get from there with lower and lower rise of V trons. So if your code is good enough, and if your telescope and infinity are very accurate, you will expect that these two. Accurate, you will expect that these two colored plots, colored curves, which will actually asynchronate to these green, to these black dashed line over here. More so in the second binary as compared to the top binary. And we basically can have another way or another piece in the puzzle of this question which we're trying to ask about whether spinters at infinity are good approximations of low-level formation. Those are formation is the angular momentum values themselves. So we have coded the angular momentum values in some scale units as the temporal eccentricity Et tends to 1 backward in time. So you see that the bottom one is actually more than three times the value at the top. So the bottom one here is much better approximation to go that formation than the binary at the top. So using the same hyper evolution approach, different binaries can actually produce Binaries can actually produce different kinds of results, and you have to interpret them one by one whether it's a great approximation to the formation channel, or how much is it going to help you find the formation channels of the binary platforms. We have also done some comparisons with the previous circular hybrid division code, which is already public and as a part of LaSuite. So you have two different settings where you kind of fix the non-spinning terms contribution and spinning terms contribution in phase order and spin order, respectively. In phase order and spin order, respectively, and fix the approximant for cross-secular code. And then the second is using default settings for both the codes, where you actually use the respective spinning order contribution, not spinning order contributions for both of these codes, and then see the differences in the spin tilts which you're getting. So you start the same, you evolve the same system of binary black holes using eccentric code versus quasi-circular code. And try to find what is the spin tilt, what is the difference you're getting. The spin tail, what is the difference you're getting in the spin tails at infinity? You will see that more of the both and purple and green dots are above the 10 to the negative 2 line on the right-hand side. That means, of course, you are expecting more differences at default settings because you are comparing different spin order and phase orders, and also a different approximate. So, this is something which you expect. If you want to try it around, at least for now, you can play around with cos circular binaries using this. With cos circular binaries using this tilts at infinity package from the paper side of. So, just to summarize, I have a lot of other results, but just to give you a gist, what we're trying to do here is try to analyze a generic magnetic black hole, which has both eccentricity and spin precession built into it. So, we have to take care of both the effects. And when we're trying to find out the formation channels, again, spin tilts and eccentricity play a really important role in discerning what kind of formation channel it is. Discerning what kind of formation handler it is. So, what we have done is stitched together two codes to actually create a hybrid division code which actually accurately and quickly evolves the binary vacuums back in time to all the way to infinity. Then, we study these principles at infinity and also study the scenarios where these can approach those at formation. So, as I said, different binaries can actually have different results on whether they approach formation using our code or not. Code or not. And then the couple of applications of our code is that using the orbit average code, you can actually create an eccentric and recessing binary black hole waveform by twisting up an alliance thing eccentric IMR waveform model. And then on the other side, for hybrid evolution code, it really becomes important when you have both eccentric and recessing waveforms such that you are able to Such that you are able to actually evolve them back in time to find out what are the sprint tilts at infinity and those at formation, and then infer for a lot of these binaries, infer what is the formation channel which is being favored here. With that, I would like to conclude with my favorite animal. It's called Capybara, and it's the largest rodent on Earth. Thank you. So we have plenty of time for questions. It's a naive question. So even if you have excessive spinning binary, does the spin angle converge to some values at very early time or is it still binary oscillating? If you have measured some spin values now, if you extrapolate backwards, okay, does it actually converge to a spin-til value or does it oscillate? It again depends on binary to binary and also it depends on the value of acceptability. Eccentricity as we were showing here. So, as you see, that the binary at the top curve is converging to a different value than what we are obtaining from spin tits and infinity at the empirical V-trans. On the bottom, however, you have a closer convergence. The only reason we were not able to go beyond this lower end of the V-trans is because it's computationally very expensive. If it does not converge, then what is the Does not converge. And what is the meaning of computing something at negative infinity? I think what we're looking for is computing the spin tilts and infinity using the precision average approach where you can kind of like look at it as the limiting value of orbital angular momentum when the eccentricity Et tends to 1, basically. So if Et tends to 1, I think that is our infinity, quote unquote. Infinity quote unquote. That is what I understood. So for polycircular binary, it does asymptote to a single value of builds. For asymptotic binary, the angular momentum is not infinite, it is finite. So you still have oscillations in the parameters. So you don't, it doesn't asymptote, but the amplitude of the oscillation goes down as you go back in time. But you have, it's not well defined for asymptotic planning. It isn't it's not well defined for a centric variable. But the assumption here is that it is the oscillations are the amplitude of the oscillations are small enough so that you can approximate the tilts you are getting at infinity is good enough approximation for the tilt formation. Yeah, thanks Ananda. No questions? Okay, I'll use this time to show some web type parts. Okay. So here. So we also So we also did some runtime plots on how. Oh, okay. Sorry. Does it matter that the spindles at infinity that you get are... do they have to be like physical or is it just a mathematical representation? What I mean is in the sense that if you have a dynamical environment where sometimes Environment where sometimes like a black hole can be kicked out of a binary if a binary has a three-board interaction with a bigger black hole. In cases like that, notion of negative infinity probably loses because it's not isolated. So does it matter or is it just a methodical representation? So we are evolving back into a time where this particular binary was formed. This particular binary was formed. So spin tails can still change after or before this event had occurred, when the binary had formed. So we cannot evolve beyond that point. That's the limitation of this code, I think, especially for dynamical formation channels. So let's say you have a binary, a black hole being kicked out of a system and forms a binary with some other black hole. We can study that binary's evolution forward in time and then. Forward in time and then start from there and then go backward in time. But not after this point where it was, you know, kind of going out of the system backward in time. I think so you have to be careful of that. Yeah, it doesn't have any kind of three-word interactions or okay. Yes. Can you explain a bit on point number five on the summary? Are you suggesting? Are you suggesting that it's possible to produce an essential processing waveform without needing essential processing in our simulations? Yes. So you start from, as you were showing in one of your slides, where you had these, all the waveforms on the left were aligned spin systems, and all of the ones on the right were precessing spin systems. So we do have an eccentric IMR waveform model, which is non-processing, however. Waveform model, which is non-processing, however, right? So you kind of like do the same thing which you were mentioning about crystal-up, where you kind of like apply the rotations and go into a co-processing frame where you apply Euler angles at different times. And since this is the dynamics code, at every time step you can find the values of these parameters so that you can find the strain at every time step and then extrapolate it all the way. So you're using PN evolution still. We still don't know what happened in the NR regime, right? Oh no, no, we cannot go beyond the regime where PN breaks down. The regime where PN breaks down. We have to stitch. So, anyways, we have to we need a helping hand from the NR to stitch the if you want to go all the way to Ramnet, for example, for these kind of systems, yes. Yes, I do. Okay, let me show you the runtime for us now. Okay, so I think I should have made it bigger, but basically. I think I should have made it bigger. But basically, what you can see here is starting from 20 hertz, these are all different binaries sampled using the population I mentioned before, mostly uniformly in different parameters. And then you can see one thing is that the runtime for these lower eccentricity values in the bottom plot, or also in the top plot, the yellow points are actually more on the top on the y-axis, which corresponds to the runtime of extended. The runtime of eccentric binary versus runtime of quasi-circular binary. So it's a ratio, right? So that means if you're on this horizontal black dashed line, you basically have the same speed for both eccentric code and versus quasi circular code to evolve from the same frequency back to infinity. However, if you are above this line, you will see that the eccentric code takes longer time, of course, because it's a very low eccentricity, and then as compared to high eccentricity, And then, as compared to high eccentricity values on the right-hand side, which are below the dashed line, you will see that you will find the binary which is starting from a lower eccentricity will take more time to evolve to a particular frequency because the rate of decrease of orbit angular momentum and energy is lower for that binary as compared to the one which already has the high extensivity. So, just to show you a rough calculation, a rough estimate of minimum and maximum values, the maximum values of front. Maximum values, the maximum values of runtimes are somewhere around 30, 35 seconds. And then, minimum value, pick your choice. I think many of the values are less than 10 to the negative 2 seconds. So, just an added information. We also did a lot of other checks. So, if you have any questions, you can ask me in the chat. Thank you. Yeah, I I think you can share the screen. You have to go there and start the recording. I think yes, just
