So this is work with my colleagues, Mike Daniels, Golanan, Sam Batillo, and Bonnie Spring, and Don Venez. So, in 2008, the current physical activity guidelines are the same as they were in 2008. The only distinction is The only distinction is in 2008, so now and then it was 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous or some combination. But in 2008, they required that to meet the guidelines, the MVPA had to be accumulated in ballots or episodes of at least 10 minutes of duration. So at least 10 consecutive minutes of MVPA to count toward. Of MVPA to count towards that guideline of 150 minutes. Since then, they've dropped that requirement. But I still think that this idea of bouts is useful, especially for physical activity interventions that I'm going to talk about today. It also gives you a sense of how long it takes me to turn an idea into a Get an turn an idea into a paper in the time I was working on these papers. I changed my mind. And then fewer than 50% of American adults meet these guidelines and developing interventions to promote physical activities in active area. Okay, so little is known about the way that participants modify their activity and physical activity interventions. Typically, what is Typically, what has happened is they're given some goal, they're prescribed some goal like 30 minutes a day, and then it's up to them to meet that requirement. But it's not closely supervised in person. So in an intervention, participants can increase their daily bouted PA by either increasing the number of bouts per day and keep the duration of each bout constant. They can keep the number of bouts constant. They can keep the number of bouts constant and increase the duration, or they can do some combination of both. And evaluating the relationship between these two processes, the number of bouts and their duration, and whether they're substitutes or complements for one another and how they change in response to treatment, can provide insights into how an intervention works and how it can be resolved. So, just understanding if you tell someone to increase the duration of their bouts. Increase the duration of their bouts, is that negatively correlated with the number of bouts per day? So maybe they'll reduce the number of bouts per day to kind of compensate for the increased duration. So trying to understand how that works is useful. So the study that motivated this work was the MBC study. It was a randomized lifestyle intervention of 204 adults. There were two activity-related intervention arms: the IPA, which was an increase. Arms, IPA, which was an increased physical activity arm with a goal to increase MVPA. I'm just going to call that the treatment group. And then DSED, a decreased sedentary behavior arm, with a goal to decrease leisure time, sedentary screen time. I'm going to refer to that as the control. And then there was a two-week baseline assessment period where there was no intervention, and then a three-week intervention period, and that's Intervention period, and that three-week intervention period was split into two phases. The first week was called prescription one, and their goal was to attain half of their final target goal. In weeks two and three, they were supposed to reach the targeted goal of the meeting. And the physical activity in the MBC study was measured daily using an actographic cellarometer throughout the five weeks. So we have up to 35. So we have up to 35 days of accelerometer measured physical activity across these 200. And then we define about, as recommended in the guidelines, at least 10 consecutive minutes of MVP. Any questions in that thing, Stanley? So here's just some plots of the data from NDC. This first one is number of outs. This first one is number of bouts per day. So the top row is the treatment group at the three phases of the study, and the bottom is the control group. And the thing to notice is that the number of bouts per day is zero-inflated. At baseline, on 70% of their days, 70% of their days, they didn't exercise at all. There was zero balance. That tends to decrease a little bit to around 50% in the treatment group, but it stays at around 70% in the control group. And then durations, again, highly skewed. Most durations are last than the minimum. Minimum does seem to be some change in duration over time. So the goal was to develop a model that captures these unique features of bouted MVPA. So we have the frequent measurements, you know, at least one per day for 35 days, the zero-inflated bouts, and the skewed bout durations. And then we want to estimate. And then we want to estimate how bouts and their duration vary over the course of the MBC study and by treatment condition. So we want to see how the number of bouts per day and their duration changes over time in response to treatment. And we'll do this by jointly modeling the number of daily MBPA bouts and their duration. So just some brief notation. Nij is the number of exercise powers. Is the number of exercise ballots for participant I on day J. And then if they didn't exercise on day j, Nij equals zero. Nij is greater than zero, then Yijk is the duration in minutes of the Kth bow for participant I on dayj. K goes from one to and then our joint. And then our joint model is going to consist of two sub-models: a mixed effects Poisson hurdle model for the number of daily MVPA bouts, and then a mixed effects location scale gamma regression model for bout direction. Oops, run direction. Okay. So the Poisson hurdle is a common model for modeling zero. Model for modeling zero-inflated counts. And it's a mixture of a point mass at zero for non-exercise days and then a zero truncated Poisson distribution for physically active days. Here this model is governed by the pi ij, which is the probability of exercising on a given day, and then zero treatment k plus all is governed by this parameter length. By this parameter length. And note that both parameters are indexed by ij. So we'll model them using mixed effects models, mixed effects logistic regression for that pi, the probability of exercising on a given day, and lambda, which governs the number of bouts per day. So here the fixed effects X X, I mean the covariant fixed effects are just treatment and time and the interaction. Random effects are random intercept and random effects for those phases. Okay, and then for duration, if a participant engages on at least one bout on day j, we assume it follows a gamma distribution. Folllows a gamma distribution. Being parameterized here, some mean u and shape parameter alpha. Again, both parameters are indexed by ij. mu ij is a mean duration of about on day j for points to the i, and mu squared divided by the shape parameters and stuff. And again, we model these as a function of fixed mu s. Again, we model these as a function of fixed and random effects. The fixed effects are the treatment and time and treatment by time interactions. And the random effects are a random intercept in phase two. So typically a gamma regression, you assume this shape parameter is constant. And so here we allow it to vary by person and time. And time. And in that way, we can have a more flexible model for the variance of the duration. Okay, so together, by connecting the random effects, we have a joint model of number of bouts per day and their duration. And we can model, we have a model for the probability that a participant oxerised on a given day. Exercise on a given day, a model for the frequency of bouts on exercise days, a model for mean bout duration, and a model for mean bout duration, and a model for about variable. Can we start asking questions? Yeah, but this is super interesting. How do you check the magnetic assumptions? Assumptions? I used just diagnostics and QQ plants. So durational models, right there, I think that's what we... There's a lot of non-parametric symbolization, right? Average vowel duration or some characteristics of the vowels durational, which do not rely on a specific parametric assumption. So I think I know it's standard. Just understanding what institutions work well for durational data in this specific context. Something which I didn't see done too much because people just take off the shelf something which worked previously. So it's the diagnostic wasn't good. It was good. Yeah, yeah, it's I put the the paper in the uh Slack channel and Channel. Yeah, so you know, remember where we allow the mean duration and that shape parameter varies by person and day. So it's a relatively flexible model for doing these things. And we model time just using indicator variables for the treatment phases. Thank you. That's a good question. So applying this model to the MBC study. Study, our interest here is on these treatment-by-time interaction terms. That's whether the, at follow-up, whether the intervention, the treatment was significantly different from the control condition. And there was a significant effect in this spout model. Remember, this is the logistic regression for whether they exercise or not on a given day. So there was an increase in number of exercise days in the treatment condition. Days in the treatment condition versus the control condition. However, there wasn't an increase in the number of bouts per day on exercise days. So they increased their activity by exercising on more days, but not necessarily exercising more frequently on those days. And similarly, bout duration was also increased over time in the treatment condition compared to control, but no effect. But no effect on the shape group. So, just to summarize, those in the treatment group had more exercise days, and on those exercise days, their bouts were longer than the other people. How many bouts did they have in the exertion? I I it was just like one or two. Yeah. Not a lot. So another kind of neat thing that you can extract from these models, I call these behavioral phenotypes. So by looking at the random effects for each person, you can identify people with different bout and duration characteristics. So I just extracted four people, you know, the four most. People, you know, the four most interesting people, the four most distinct patterns. So, this first person, a participant 190, so this is during those two weeks of baseline. So, this first person, this is somebody who didn't exercise very frequently. They only exercised on five days during the two-week period. But when they did exercise, they tended to have multiple bouts. Multiple dots. This next person had neither, right? They only had one exercise day, and on that day, they only had one doubt. This person, someone who exercised relatively frequently, but only did one bout per day. And then the last person is somebody who exercises frequently. Somebody who exercises frequently, exercised almost every day during baseline, and on those exercise days, they had multiple bounce per day. So by looking at the random effects of each participant, you can kind of extract these different. And similarly for the duration phenotypes, you can look at different people based on their mean duration and their. On their mean duration and the variability of their duration. So, this first person is somebody who had a low mean, just 10 minutes, and a low variability as well. The next person had similar duration as the first participant, but a lot more variability in their bout durations. The third person had high mean, 21 minutes. 21 minutes and high variability as well. We had about as long as 50 minutes. This person had more of a moderate duration, but again, a high variability. And the last person had a moderate duration mean and moderate variability. Yeah, so is this the predicted mean or standard? Predicted mean or standard deviation, or is this collected from the data? This is raw data. So, I, these are, I can't remember, these are random effects. And just by looking at the random effects, you can kind of identify people who have these patterns. And then I plotted the rounding. Same with the previous plot as well. So, as far as kind of extensions to this model, This model, I should have done this originally, but because those parameters are indexed by person and day, you can incorporate day-level covariates into the model. So an obvious one would be weekend, weekday, because that tends to differ quite a bit. MVPA tends to differ quite a bit. And then for the duration model, you can include out-level information, for example. Out-level information, for example, a time of day or maybe some kind of real-time weather information. You can also incorporate weather into the bout sub-model as well. And this might just provide some additional information. Why do people exercise? What affects how long they exercise. And then another thing I would have liked to have done with the MBC study was to see whether these different Was to see whether these different patterns predict where people. So after the five-week treatment study ended, period ended, they did collect follow-up data to see how well people maintained any gains they made during the two-week period. And so one idea I had was I wanted to see if, you know, is somebody who has this type of pattern, are they more likely to maintain their gain? Their gains versus somebody who had this type of pattern. It's just the ideal pattern. Maybe this person is someone who's developing an exercise habit, and they're more likely to maintain any kind of gains they've made when treatment is taken away. Unfortunately, the maintenance data is that great in the NDC studies. I should have done it then. Great work. I had a question about the phenotypes. So you're getting those phenotypes during the baseline period? Well, I get them at all three periods. I just, there I just plotted the baseline data. You have a sense of. Do you have a sense of how they change the phenotypes change? Is there a way of defining these phenotypes through features, perhaps, and then looking at how they change from baseline to the frequent feed? Yeah, I mean, you know, you have a set of random effects, a baseline, and then the random effects of follow-up. So you could get the random effects measure that characteristic. Characteristic. That's sort of like a more detailed oriented question. These were healthy participants, right? Do you remember? Yeah, I mean, they had to be physically inactive at baseline. So less than, I think, 60 minutes per week self-reported MDP. Important MDP. How was the activity data? Was it where they was good? I think there's a table in the paper. Yeah, they tended to wear it around five or six days, hours or more. Surprisingly, surprisingly good. So if I want, I could potentially, I guess, Want, I could potentially, I guess, reproduce your results table if I just fit separate models for these different things. I could just say, like, if I'm just looking at the probability of exercising, I could just look at that as an outcome, fit a model for that, and I could just look at like about duration and fit a model for that. Is the argument here that there's no reason not to fit the joint model because we know it'll just be more efficient? Did you look at what we identified if we fit separate models? Yeah, I didn't want to talk about it. Yeah, I didn't want to talk about that here. The results were the same. So, you know, one I one sorry. It's in the appendix. One idea I had was that if you're just looking at duration, for example, for people who didn't exercise on a given day, you have zero data on that day. By fitting the joint model, By fitting the joint model, you at least incorporate information that they didn't exercise on the day. And so, by connecting the two models, I thought it would be more efficient. And then there were some people who had no bounce during the entire study, so they wouldn't even show up in the duration model. I don't know if a different data set may be different. Because you're still assuming the count and the duration are independent. Well, no, so I didn't I maybe I didn't highlight that. The random effects from all from all those four submodels are all correlated. So there's three random effects for each submodel, so a total of 12 random effects, so a 12 by 12 covariance. Bit of the you should be able to go the strength of the coordination between the two. Yeah, yeah. So, one thing related to Julian's comment is the correlations between the bout model and the duration submodel were very small. And so that would explain a lot, I think. Now, you know, number of bouts, whether the exercise or not, and the number of bouts, those correlations were high, but across the two submodels. Very interesting analysis. I actually have a question about how these bowels have, for example, A, if I have exercise now for 10 minutes, I probably will not do this in the next 30 minutes. So that basically connects to Lean's question, is some assumption accounting for those kind of repulsiveness, which is not a second question, really. My second question, really, I have a lot of vowels today. I probably will take them for tomorrow. So I wonder whether such kind of dynamics has been considered current model. And clearly, Google is trying to count durations, but maybe people redistribute the balance. So, no. I think maybe. I think maybe if we did a three-level model where you so where days are nested within phase, then maybe you could capture that day-to-day variability. Right now I'm assuming kind of independent given the random effects. A three-level model would be Has it been shown that bouts tend to have that repulsive property? I mean, I don't know a lot about that. Intuitively, I could see that you're important, but on the other hand, you could argue if you're engaged, if you go to the gym, you might have very closely linked balance, right? So I'm just trying to, like, is that a known phenomenon? It's a theory of guess based on my personal experience. personal experience.
