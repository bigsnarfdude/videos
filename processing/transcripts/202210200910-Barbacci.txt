Yes, is everything okay for you? Are you? Yes. Yes, okay. Thanks for the introduction. Hello, everyone. Yes, so today I'm going to talk about the multiscale modeling of the plant immunoresponse to make quota fit fungi. So in the future, I will be pretty interesting by the multiscale modeling of fungal growth, but today, in fact, I will focus on a project dealing with the pattern formation of immune. With a pattern formation of immune response to further understand how plants resist to the attack of a pathogen. So, this project is funded, but it hasn't started yet. So, every comment or suggestion would be welcome. So, as you know, plants are surrounded by a microbe and they can form different forms of interaction with this microbe. And so, by forming mutually beneficial symbiosis, Beneficial sound uses microbial plants to colonize land more than 450 million years ago. And in parallel, interaction with pathogen led to, in fact, the formation of a different system. And in fact, we want to understand further how the collective response to pathogen achieved at the cell of the cell allow the plant to resist the attack of pathogen. So, one feature of what we know for sure is that every cell in the plant. What we know for sure is that every cell in plant is immunocompetent. So there are several forms of plant resistance. So the first one is called the cadetative disease resistance. And in this case, the immune response is triggered by the specific association between a plant receptor with a molecule secreted by the pathogen. And the phenotype of the plant in this case is binary. So if the plant has a good receptor, the plant will be fully resistant. And if the plant has Fully resistant, and if the plant has not the receptors, the plant is fully susceptible to the pathogen. There is another form of plant immunity called the quantitative disease resistance. And this form of resistance, in fact, is triggered to face attack by fungi, but also bacteria such as exontomanas compestris. And in this case, plants are not fully resistant or fully susceptible to the pathogen. It's in fact in between. Fact, in between. And from a molecular point of view, this kind of resistance, the quantitative disease resistance is different because it's highly multigenic, it involves the modulation of thousands of genes and it can be activated by a myriad of different signaling pathways. So it means that this form of resistance, in fact, can be modulated by signals coming from the environment, such as variation of temperature or mechanical signal. And to study the constitutive disease resistance, in fact, we used most of the time the pathocystium composed by Arbidoptistagena, so the model plant of a crucifer, and sclerotinias sclerosorium. So that is a necotrophic fungus, meaning it actively kills its host to achieve its own growth. And sclerotinias sclerosorium is able to infect more than 400 decode species and it's widespread in all the temperate areas of the Earth. So, at the moment, the key we have to understand further the quantitative disease resistance is studying gene regulation. So, this is, as instance, what we found for the Pantapalloi clad. So, you see that whatever the species, 20% of the genome of this plant are modulated to participate to the plant defense toward sclerotinia. So, 20% of genome means thousands of genes, and 30% of this. Of genes and 30% of these genes are conserved over evolution. And it also means that, in fact, most of the time to study the quantity of disease resistance, the time scale used is the time scale of evolution. And in fact, we have the feeling, but maybe also good reason to think that the time scale of the infection would be also useful to understand further how the collective behavior of plants allow to resist the attack of the fungi. The fungi. So that's why we have the first reason. Sorry, first reason is because we proposed recently that around the necrosis formed by the fungus, there is mechanoperception and this mechanoperception trigger a first layer of defense through the cortical microtubule anisotropic patterning. And this so-called mechanical trigger immunity participates to 30% of the overall plant resistance, which is quite impressive in the context of the continuum. Quite impressive in the context of the quantitative disease resistance. So, another example illustrating that time and space matters in affection comes from a previous work in which we study, in fact, the growth of the colony of the fungus in a plant. And in fact, we show that to grow and to face the resistance of plant, the growth required the special Required the spatiotemporal organization of IV, and spatial organization means the cooperation between the cell of the IV, so by carbon by carbon reallocation. So the part in the necrosis, so composed by districted cell, in fact, district plant cell, support the growth of the apical part of the alpha. The applicable part of the hyphae, so because this part is isolated from a free nutrient in because it is in living and resistant cells. And this cooperation between cells, in fact, allows the division of flabber. And the two parts of the colony executed two different metabolic programs. And cooperation and division of flabber are plastic traits and depending mostly on And depending mostly of the level of resistance of the host, so it means that if you go a fungus on a medium plate, there is no very little cooperation between cell and mostly no division of labor. So this result suggests that the response of the plant, so the immune response, could be also structured in space and time. And that we want to explore further. And we plan to, in fact, link signal transmission. Signal transmission in plant around the necrosis to the expression of genes associated with resistance to understand how the expression of the modulation of this gene regulate the growth of the fungi. So this, in fact, it involves different time and length scale. So because the signal propagate at supracellular scale in the scale of the leaf, but also inform a plant which in turn Which in turn modulate lead to the modification of gene expression in cells far from the infection. And in this model, in fact, we neglect the plant growth because the typical time for sclerotinia to kill a whole plant of Arabidocystaliana is around 24 hours. So this is what we schematically what we plan to do. So we will consider the growth of the. We will consider the growth of a fungus as depending on time, but also depending on the expression of plant genes associated with immune response. And we will study the signal transmission and propagation around the necrosis. So at the moment, we focus on obvious signals such as calcium, reactive oxygen species, and because of the context of infection, we focus on two hormones that are just mentioned. That are jasmine and salicylic acid. And by image analysis using reporter line, we want to measure the transmission speed and the transmission distance of this signal during the propagation of the disease. And we want to link the propagation of this signal to the expression of this gene. So to do that, we will perform a RNA psych analysis. Analysis taking profit of a mutant line to evaluate how calcium rows and so on modulate gene and which gene are modulated by this signal. And hopefully we will link in fact the expression of this gene associated with very standard to the regulation of the fungal growth, so the regulation of the disease. So as you see in this model, As you see in this modeling, there is different time and length scale, and also different formalisms used to describe mechanisms. So we use continuous formalism to describe the growth of the fungus, but there is also a discrete event such as death of cells. And to do that, we will use the irritator, which is an implementation of DEV. DEV stands for Discrete Event System. Dev, DEV stands for discrete event system, especially designed in fact to take into account different time scale and different time and length scale. And it also allows the possibility to interactively interact with your model if you want to test hypothesis. So it's a bit new for me, but it sounds great. So with this. So, with this model, we would like to answer or to provide the beginning of the answer to this question. So, are these signals sufficient to understand the variation of a transcriptomic landscape? Can we activate abiotically the signaling cascade to in fact increase the plant resistance? Because it would be an elegant alternative to GMO and maybe a good solution to increase plant infield. And as you see at the moment, because moment because plant pathology are not most of them not based on a quantitative biology approach. There is in my mind too many actors in our problem. There is a thousand of genes moving in every direction and so we hope that by modeling we can simplify what is considered disease resistant and find what is really important and in fact tending toward a mesoscopic Tending toward a mesoscopic point of view or description of the quantitative disease resistance. For an applicative point of view, in fact, we developed at the moment single-cell transcriptomic analysis because it's meaningful to understand how the competitive disease resistance is organized in different plant tissue. But we hope with this model to identify molecular signature, to analyze the same data, but depending on space. The same data, but depending on space and time, which would be obviously really useful. And to finish, the less ambitious objective, but maybe the more useful, is thanks to this model, we will have tools to test, in fact, quickly hypothesis. And most of time, in fact, such a modeling approach is very powerful to design new experiment as new ideas. As new idea. And it was the case when we studied the growth of the fungus. The very simple biophysical model was more useful, in fact, to drive the experiment than the 1300 equation used to describe the metabolic network of sclerotinosclerosium. So, my question, not directly linked to that, but as you see, I work on mechanical signaling during infection and we Infection, and we do not plan to take into account the mechanical signal in infection. And the reason is because, from an experimental point of view, we are very limited. So, we can observe the reorganization of cortical microtubule during infection, we can measure strain field in living plant tissue, but that's it. And so, it would be great to develop this experimentally, this part of the work. This part of the work, and one possibility would be to use a mechanical probe, so combined with a fret film. And it was presented in 2010 as a very promising tool. And I'm a bit surprised that these tools are not central to work, especially work concerning growth and morphogenesis. So maybe someone has explained. So maybe someone has experience using this probe or recommendation or knowledge about that and I would be happy to gain insight about why this tool are so underused. That's it. Thanks a lot for your attention. And if you have some remark or question, I will be happy to interact with you. We have time for questions in the room on the internet or in the room. Yeah, so that's a really interesting modeling framework, and I'm curious how adaptable it is to other situations beyond community. So, if you were to do something like adding a droplet of oxen to a meristem, could you adapt? Into a Meristem, could you adapt this model rapidly to be able to understand all of the things like pathway activations and developmental responses? Could you hear the question? Yeah, no, not really. Sorry, what's the question? You remove the mask, it's really hard to. Sure. Sure. I just oxen, a memeristem, and right. So I'm asking a question about how adaptable and generalizable the model is. If you were to add a droplet of oxygen to a meristem and try to use this same model to understand the pathways that I created, how well would it work? Or would you need to make an entirely new model? Yeah, I can't answer this question because we can start the modeling. We can start the modeling now. So, if I would say if I was a guy coding eritator, I would say everything is possible, but at the moment, I know not real experience about that. Yeah, maybe I can reach me in a few months when we really test how much is simple to modelize using such a framework. But as a follow-up question, you were question uh you were showing the propagation of the of the fungus in the on the leaf would you expect that to propagate to other organs in the plant you would have different flows and you would need to study different types of the reaction from the plants yeah yeah it's a it's it's a very good question so um uh it's very interesting but um at the moment we are not planning to to um test all the fungus um Test all the fungus infects the whole plant, and maybe when the fungus infects the pestial of plants, it is a bottleneck and involves very fancy defense mechanism. At the moment, we want to deploy this modeling approach, but obviously, we want to understand further how the scale of the plant, how the strategy, in fact, is organized in the plant, because maybe the plant can. Organizing the plant because maybe the plant can sacrifice a leaf to its own survival. And yeah, at the moment, we have no clue, and it was nothing published about that. So yes, we will have a look on that. Okay, thank you. Other questions? Is someone have some experience with a mechanical problem? It was a real question. I will test by myself. Thanks a lot. Thank you again.
