All right, so the next one is Lambert Le Monte, and then after that we'll have Maggie Bailey, I think. So go ahead. Okay, so today I'll be discussing a bit about limit sets and gauge functions, specifically in the context of the Usurai-Sparedo family of distributions, and introducing new transformations for limit sets for regions for reasons that I'll explain soon. So, okay, so the interest of limit sets really is to gain more insight. sets really is to gain more insight into the extremal dependence of a random vector. And this is done typically by considering scaled sample clouds. So here we have random draws from a multivariate distribution and we scale it, you know, we scale these draws by some function of the sample size. So if we're willing to make a few assumptions, so the first one being quite easy that you can have a random vector which has exponential margins, in practice it's just Margins in practice, it's just attainable through the probability integral transform and then inverse transform. And if we're also willing to assume a convergence gene, which I won't dive into in details here, but if this limit on the left-hand side converges to a continuous function g, then we call that function g a gauge function. And it determines stuff about limit sets, basically. So here, in exponential margins, if we consider the scaled sample class. We consider the scaled sample cloud scaled by the long of the log of the sample size. We must have the sample or the scaled sample cloud in this case will converge in probability into a limit set G, which will be contained within the unit box basically by properties of the exponential distribution. And the shape of the limit set G can be obtained through the unit level set of the gauge function G. So they're interrelated in that way. On the left-hand side here, what you have is Left-hand side here, what you have is an example of a Gaussian copula and exponential margin and its limit set, and then the right-hand side, logistic copula with exponential margins. And what we expect is that as we sample more and more points and divide them by the log of the sample size, all of the points should fall between the origin and this limit set here described by the red curve. So, some interest with this is that it's been linked to other models in extreme value theory, specifically or more notably, possibly the Specifically, or more than notably, possibly the conditional extreme value models, so that there's a link between the shape of the limit set and the alpha and beta parameters for the conditional extreme value model. And it's been linked as well to other coefficients of dependence that can be read off basically from the shape of the limit set. And perhaps more importantly, there have been some methods developed by people in this room to estimate the limits at G, and perhaps more importantly, also. And perhaps more importantly, also, it provides a new framework for estimating probability of extreme events in some regions. So that is the key point. Really, through the gauge function G, there's a new framework for estimating probability. Okay, this slide is very heavy. It's just there to convince you that I didn't invent this distribution my way here. The U2I distribution comes naturally in the context of extremes, specifically in the Specifically in the framework of asymptotic dependence. And it's a popular class of distribution because it has a very flexible dependent structure. And perhaps the only thing to retain from this slide is that it's fully determined the dependent structure via the Virogram matrix gamma, which I'll come back to. But one thing to notice is that if we compute the limit I discussed earlier, the gauge function will The gauge function will look like this, and that corresponds to a limit set. It's okay, you can't see really well, but it corresponds to the unit diagonal diagonal line. So we expect all of the points from the cycle clause to collapse on this line. This would be true for any paragram matrix gamma. So no matter the dependence within that matrix, we expect to have this line, which is a bit uninformative. However, in practice, However, in practice, if we sample binary use surrounds in Pareto margins and scale appropriately, what we see is that the convergence to that line is not happening even for a million points, right? So this is not really useful. And as I said, it does not give us information about the actual parameters in the Verogram matrix. So I will skip a bit into the intuition to why we have new transformations that we consider. You can come to the post. That we consider. You can come to the poster if you want the intuition. But basically, we consider a new transformation. So instead of, is this? Oh, nice. Okay. So instead of just considering this original transformation on all of the margins, now we consider different type of transformations based on the structure of the user ice. And we also consider a third transformation, which is basically just a scaling, but a much weaker one. And what we observe is that if we consider those. Is that if we consider those limits and what they correspond to in terms of limit sets, we get some shapes that are first non-degenerate, right? They have positive measures, these sets, and they also vary in shape with the Bereagram matrix gallery. So yeah, in conclusion, basically for some families of distribution, like the important class of Eusterise, the limits have maybe degenerate and not offer intuition to the dependent. Intuition into the dependent structure. And the study of different scalings or transformation may lead to non-degenerate sets. And yeah, as I mentioned here in the case of the user rice, we have for new transformations limit sets that vary with the shape gap. So yeah, that's it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
