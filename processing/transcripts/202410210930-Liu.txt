So, this I'm going to present some work, early work with Yuan Kong from Purdue University on the shop interface model, which have three papers, but I mostly try to emphasize more recent work understanding face-field model, what exactly do, and what's the shopping face limit, and what is the correct time scale, and then also probably more complicated. Also, probably do more complicated things like separating with joint work with Han Chi and Yuan Go and on this sort of control formulation for small jobs. Okay, let's see. So basically, okay, the title is here is sort of use simple possible setup called Anzaga principle to formulation the model and computational way. Let's see, I hope it's work. Okay, so let me first, I mean. Okay, so let me first, I mean, many, many experts, as Ji Jin said, is an expert. I can go a little bit quick. So here's sort of the, let me just make a notation clear. So you don't complicate the three phase and gas, liquid, and solids. Then it's the surface tension. And you want to say dynamically how this surface evolves. Okay, so that's and then and also computation for these questions. There's many and many. Positive questions. There's many, many issues involved. And particularly on this surface, there's a pattern over there, and how dynamic to driving for this surface, and also the complicated phenomena, which topology change. So I begin with a simple support case, the sharp interface with the glove formulation, then we can derive exactly what is energy. Then later on, we do study in phase field model, they will deal with the They would deal with the proposed change or non-glove case, and I want to say consistent with the shopping interface model, and of course, then later doing some deliverable computational over there. So, let's say, so that's just beginning with just a notation. We have the famous Young's angle for stational problem. Okay, so doing this is there's many, many ways to that. many many ways to that and i uh but nowadays i guess quite convinced that is all computational should be very simple that means you doing two steps when the kinematic describe what is about so then you count in energy you have here for energetic variation and then this will be probably important in terms of the both analysis and the computation and that's the nowadays referred to on the principle in other words And that principle in others was one-way coupling. Say how to do the response. Okay, so here's sort of the basically many things quite boring part, but the complicated part is how to kinematically describe what is dynamic. It is. Okay, I'm going to explain this one. And despite this one is one thing which cannot do violation or a complicated particular transport equation, which is not a problem violation. You have to read it by hands to clearly describe them, particularly dynamic. Describe them, particularly dynamical patterns along the sort of moving interface and how to describe them in a careful way. And you try to avoid use any complications in different geometry to do that. And then, of course, and then the second complication itself is how to do the energetic variational, which value we can do that. So, and so I'm going to explain a little bit in this analog computation. Okay, so let me just. Okay, so let me just describe this guy, dynamic self. So you're doing describe self, but kinematic basically look at the velocity, how it behaves. And it's actually extremely simple. If you look at the surface here, you have velocity, they have two components. One is a normal component, one tangential component. If there are no such pattern, that's easy because just a late parameterization, you only care about the normal component. And if we want to have tangential. If we want to have tangent motion itself, then complicated like Magnoni face and how driving this face to move. So that's something complications. If we have electron charged particle, then what is the dynamic over there? So that's a complications here. But basically, all we care about is just describe this velocity field on the interface in a careful way. So that is, so now here's a starting point. So if you look at kinematic, you may describe. Local kinematic may describe what is configuration. So, here's sort of a starting point. It's actually simple. So, you know, we have the beginning with the claw case, simple case. So, you have a claw and at the boundary self and it's supposed to be zero, even time move, sticky zero. So, that is the only thing you require to know. So, now you just doing violation itself, then you have the sort of the dynamical, they have the how it connected with coupling. How is it connected with coupling normal velocity and sort of counter line dynamic self by this sort of dynamical counter angles? Now, important here is that this condition had to be respected. And this actually, the many models itself actually have some PD analysis which is missing that. That's very important. So we're looking back at classical, look at the gene or many others. So it's really say clearly, so this connection must be there. So, this connection must be there because they support to hold down this interface to there, and the many models are actually missing. So, let me just give you that. Okay, so that's I'm going to explain. So, now here's the continuity equation itself, you have to put the hands up. It's not one violation, it's constrainable. And the dynamic itself on surface is complicated, but in the case of glass, But in the case of Galax, the true simple and very dangerous Linus transport theorem. So let me explain a little bit how to make this argument simple, clean. So you basically, you know, this moving surface, you can take a parametrization variable on this flat substring. So now you want to have a flat substring self, all the dynamical is there, you can look at a dynamical in the middle on this substring. In the middle on this substring. So then, continuous equation is the only thing you need to care about for Linux transposing. And if you care for doing Linux transfer, Linux transfer will be integrated by paths. So that is completely accurate. So you describe a dynamic for this guy, the one, and even include the diffusion on the interface. And you know, more little bit careful on the diffusion on the interface. So that's what we have here. So that is very simple. Just describe it. Instead of looking at the surface, you look at Instead of looking at the surface, you look at the substring. And then each variable itself has corresponding buttons. So you look at any variable on the surface. You take this height function. It's an advantage sharp interface. So then you can melodate this density on XY space. So now it's a complete Euclidean space, completely open, flat. So all you just need to make Linus transversely level the Transpose convection diffusion is completely a calculus. And this is agree with classical that's some Hoverstone and some Gauteng and that sort of differential geometry argument. I have to be point slightly, Hoverstone made a small mistake in his delevation or sort of make a collection on that. All right, so that is the one, but this can have to be respected because continuity grashing is not for long violational. You have to. Violational, you have to really carefully deliver yourself, so that's sort of waiting. Okay, with this, then you doing this guy sort of for this step called nowadays we call it anzaga principle, basically called one-way coupling. So you basically say you want which variable to change and then how to determine it. So first of all, it's a virtual work. I would learn how to dynamic change. So you just set violational special. So you just violation all the spectrums of energy, important counting energy in a careful way. So that's what energetically is important, just counting energy itself. I don't know, particularly later on in phase sphere model was precisely energy with the map. You have to be careful, calculate. So, okay, here we're doing simple case. Then you're doing violation of yourself. Just take just a derivative. So now you have, say, this response theorem. So that means if you want to change it in V moving in this direction, you have. Be moving this direction, you have have a special force acting on this surface or whatever. Have you? So you basically ask a question. I only look at the surface and see how it moves. It moves and what force to make it work moves. So that is called the computer sort of response force over here. And then for this guy, but it particularly in case you consider the factor and it's complicated because what complicated. Because what compactly means as density of spatter on the surface change. So, what means the surface energy really means how many chemical bonds were broken down in the surface, which is a bound counting. And so, this is the energy itself is changed when there's a valuable button, and which is the violation formula is called this guy. So, this is an accurate one. And so, with the love this one, then looking at the toy, of course, everything could. Uh, doya, of course, everything could, and I like his book, he more carefully, more uh physical television agree with our sort of violation of television. Okay, so that is okay. So, and the television, this guy is doing this guy said, Okay, so now you have determined. So, if we do not have knowledge on this two response force, you have to compute it. So, so that's the next order going to be the key part. Now, is the nowadays is called the Anzaga principle. So, what does here, you look So, what does here? You look at the energy, see how it changes, which work, you change yourself, you look at the isolated. So, when we coupling, you look at the interface self, you know, you can put the two force necessarily to balance this dynamic. So, that under the principles, you how to find what's the most likely force on the system so that you give it dynamic. So, that's called the release maximum principle. Principle. So let's just show that. So the other one, and this is not canceled for Lukin calculations. And this idea comes from Rayleigh. Okay. So what does here is basically you regard the surface on the manifold in the infinite dimensional and how to determine what most likely happens. And so that is the one. So you have sort of variational. So now this variation itself dot means time delivery. If we want to see change. If you want to see change, the free energy change, because this interface moves, and then you have this violation of this guy, you'll expect to sort of put some distribution function. And this dispatch function is that I want to explain to you what kind of distribution function will give you light as a time scaling, what are the light dynamics, and particularly in phase field, what exactly are counting. So be careful, right? So here's sort of what I choose. We choose example probably stocks. We choose example probably stokes when you can choose different ways. I'm going to explain what geometrical dynamic and it's for stokes equation itself. And you compute this violation. You minimize this when you get the model. Okay, here's a full model with sort of making only flow. And so it's complicated, unfortunately. And I particularly should emphasize this. If the web causes mass macro systems, PD system is ever, you have to impose this. You have to impose this H equal to zero into the system, otherwise, this thing is not possible. Okay, so one and this guy is basically summarized very simple. You first put the hands on, compute the transport of the pattern on the interface. And then this is a case for graph is very simple, the Leynas transpose theorem. It will complete either Galilee. And if we non-Leyn's transpose theorem, if we're not graph itself, then you have to use some differential geometry. Differential geometry, but let's skip this part. Okay, so now once I have this one, then just simply compute a linear response function or minimize this linear and you get this sort of response, a coefficient of this one, depending on what you like. So now, question that this computation, this one is crazy, complicated. It's almost important because you have a dynamic of interface and a stock situation, then sort of for the transport, the three part. And for me, And for me, anything computer stocks question is extremely complicated, particularly with moving interface. And it's completely also this workshop before. And I also talked to Celine all the time. It's any easier to compute this guy, dynamically times a movie in France. So, okay. So, now, is this necessarily for many applications or not? The actually answer physicist says that it's not necessarily needed. So, there are two cases which most time people use, one called a small. Time people use one called a small bank number. In the case, small bank number itself, stock sequence is not necessarily needed. You use sort of motion barn curvature. I'm going to expand geometrically. Then another case which people use called synchron equation. You can please avoid this stock equation and computation becomes easily friendly. Even I can do it. Okay, so okay. So that is the one. So I'm going to explain. And so try to understand what is understand what is the leader needed for stock sequences so you are going to be proved a lemma which says this guy if you use the uh viscosity dissipation and compare with the motion binary curvature and then see the dissipation from the uh viscosity is always bigger than uh viscosity complex motion biomi curvature and this will sort of prove some kong lemma uh kong equal some category and so Some careful way. And so, this is sort of one. So, now most applications, what I learned for a particular small bangla number, small droplet use geometric motion called motion by McCurvich. So, that's what I'm going to focus on. Otherwise, Stock's question is harder for me to handle. Okay, so okay, so here you go. So, what it is means geometric motion or motion by coverage. So, what does here is this guy says. So, what does here this guy have interface? It had a normal motion over there. Then, what causes normal motion? Like a two-step is first validation or second is what is response. So, what does here's a motion by geometrical motion itself? This normal motion itself is subject to the sand flipping ton. And if we put a flixtion itself, that means put everything in there in this. There in this solar linear or this waterly many metric for this is a dynamic. So you put in there and you do violation of then you have very simple dynamic promotion by me curvature and computationally very easy and you don't need to solve stocks equation. It will be very convenient for me. Okay, so that is one and particularly very carefully you can do the balance of the young z angle. And so that's sort of the dynamic we have here. Dynamic we have here in your computer for this guy, and then this guy is, of course, actually spat. And this in the case graph, we have sharp interface and it's very the computer and it's almost like a program like Charming. It's just too simple. Nothing. So now with this, now next step is, of course, complications. You have non-glove and topology change, how to do that. Okay, so let me first show some calculations which involve. Through some calculations which involved a lot of the complicated one, and particularly have projection method, you know, the substring and obscure, and we actually did a careful work and proved the projection method into the converging and sort of, but this is something I don't want to explain to you, but computation works very nicely. You can go on this calculations and with some complicated verification and it works fine. And it works fine. So, this gives me to really understand what's a good way to study this one. Again, follow the same idea. So, here's sort of a little bit different. So, what do you believe in dynamic you care about? So, what the very beginning is sort of we have sharp interface and it describes dynamic very easily by called the energetic tunking energy. What do you have here? So, now you are doing space field model itself, you are doing the same thing. Model itself, you are doing the same thing. So, you first underline the principle is what the dynamic of this double interface, then you want to match exactly what it did. Okay, here's sort of for the recent work with and Yuan Gao and on this sort of both Alan Khan and Kanhele dynamic. Of course, many people expert in here. That's what I want to learn and talk. Okay, so here actually the calculation itself is basically counting energy. And the first counting energy self-e basically energy has. First, country energy self-executive energy have bulk energy and war energy. But bulk energy self is classical. I come from Wonder Wars. So you have this guy. So basically, it's a believing what is the leading behaviors. If we believe in leading energy is the interface, surface energy. And this bundle was energy work here. And this classical paper by Monica in 87. And particularly careful is the coefficients here. If we take the Ginz blando, on the On the phase field by stable state, and choose the gas phase minus one, liquid phase equal to one, and then this one, because this sort of classical gamma converge results tell you this term combined with coefficients exactly give it to you the surface area, giving the surface energy for the bulk. Okay, so that is very nice. So, then for the really beautiful paper, the work on this war energy stuff, that's what beautiful. Yourself that's sort of beautiful, uh, the war energy, which is this particular form, turns out to be everything consistent. Uh, many people you fool on this one, so that's the sort of particular three, phi, minus five cubic full. I'm going to explain why. Okay, so now first use this guy, you're very simple fact. If we choose two phase, minus one, one phase, and this is plus, minus one, then you this surface energy, the energy on the Energy the energy on the substring is a gas substantial gas, and the solid gas and solid liquids of electric gas can cast extremely simple form. So, again, this exactly energy what we have here. And with this one, so then you dynamic for this guy, okay. It's extremely simple. You just okay, this energy carefully computed. Uh, the energy have here, you put this dispersion, use. The dissipation you use the Anzaga principle, you derive equation exactly. This one be careful. This is the time scaling, what you observe is important. So here's observing here is, so this is the variation, left-hand side, L and Kai is after the data. Sometimes people use epsilon, just a thickness of the interface. And it should be respected for data T, this guy, and this comes from this dissipation effect. They had to put data small plant here. Put that as small plant here. So, then you have the both one and both the LMK, and this sort of you're giving rising this face-spear model. And then, okay, so why it works? So, it's a classical result by Robinstein, Stenberger, and John Keller. I say this guy. So, it's actually the very simple. So, basically, say you're doing the level set analysis in a simple way. You compute the profile over there, you scatter with small depth. There, you scatter with small data. And you plug into the system, so we level set, then sort of distance the Korean is one, and Laplace distance is the mean curvature. So that's the classical LNK curvature. Then you plug in here and the leading dynamic symbol here. Here, sort of sort of for this roundabout key observation. And then so you have this guy, and I get this time. It's going to match. year time it's going to must be zero because uh dominant balance and it's the curvature will balance with time dynamic so now for this guy itself and particularly time for alan uh kind healy calculation is complicated so you want to say this guy itself you compute the first integral is a signal equation for profile you tell first integral yourself there's constant must be equal to zero or the elevation itself is anything you need to do with max Anything you need to do is make sure constant right. That means this transition far field is constant exponential conversion to bi-stable state. And that is a profile expressed. And particularly if we calculate it's just tension function. The one. So now then, so then counterland dynamics are extremely simple. Thanks for this good war energy. So you just, this sort of for the gridian flow for the Reinflow for the face field. And then you need by bound yourself. This guy self-five plank the distance over there. And this guy no more is the five plank the one. And this is the word energy itself. And nice about the two special world energy itself is nothing but equal to this value and this guy exactly by derivative. So you cancel three terms out, you have very clean sort of. Very clean, sort of counterline dynamic, you have here, and so then you of course this uh counterline uh velocity, and this is the uh sort of cosine uh dynamic angle, and you came up sort of for relaxation. So it's equivalent Young's angle, and you relax to the one by the cosine relaxation, and it's untrained. And of course, there's a lot of uh important work, particularly uh by Shoping Wai and collaborating and this particular uh In this particular paper, I'll read is Shen Shinfo Wan Shomi and Shishi Ming Shoping and Shen Ming. So I can more complicate nothing if you go through detail. Those are experts. Okay. So now let me just when so first of all, I do this one because I want to recover sort of exactly sharp interface dynamic and this completely consistent. So if you take the sharp interface limit exactly, we begin with to derive this. To derive this dynamic of sharp interface, and okay, so that's for the case for cloud formulation with this. Then you're doing sort of computational with this one, I guess. Okay, so this method itself is just a stand person stand element in principle formulation or flux spin formulation itself. You just pass this one and you get a rider speeder, right as the formulation you can compare exactly with the sharp. Can compare exactly with the shop interface, which is let me say I can not be slow, and of course, carefully you need to use convex speaking, but I want to skip. Okay, so now let me back to the Kangele. It's more argument on Kangele than Elen Kang. So here's sort of the particular time scaling. So the time scaling, what Kanhele means, the Kanhele itself, the results working here, the first. Uh, the results working here, the first original proposed congeali by Morling in 57 for a solid synchron. So that's what I have here, and then together with his former students, uh, Sakaka is normally called models Kakaka analysis for the Kanghele equation because the Kanghele equation were proposed, related contributed modeling over there. And this was careful studying this question by Pego, my long-term collaborate, and she was studying this. Collaborate and so studying this monoskaka, or in other words, called non-local motion binding curvature. So that's uh one. So now, but time scale for this guy itself analysis of by Pego is not completely simple, it's quite the tricky part. So here's sort of a goal now. Any time scale itself, we can put in the version. Here's sort of order one, and here that is small quantity here. For this, we're mixing with sort of for HMI. With sort of for H minus one Goodyear and flow, and with LNK, when but there is a data over there. If we put in this one, then again, you have the sort of time scale which you can observe motion by Mikovich, but now not local motion by Mikovich. So you look at this guy. He is the older one, time-phase field, and if he is a new, and it's chemical potential. So now this guy itself is why is the Moros Kaka? Because it's Laplace over there. You make it more complicated. Laplace over there, you make it more complicated. So, uh, La Paz here. So, now signal line self is identical to L and Can because you choose L to again and you have the time scale here one, but then the one here, sort of many people work, I particularly like the work by Witzwa and collaborate and sort of on the solar film, which is originally come from the Morins in the one. And of course, many people use the Pankele for the Fluzi question. Partically for the fluze equation, which I have less understanding because that's what the molly was proposed on solid film. Okay, so that's uh uh loga. So now, interesting, I want to explain to you that numerically what is consistent, what is the get for Elenka and Kanhele. Elenka is very easy to understand because everything local, you can do a studying, but conjure is not local, you be careful. So at least, but now can't scale the right, you observe motion by me curved. You observe motion by curvature, either local or non-local. So let me just go into, okay, let me skip the new map party because Pendleton, let me show you some of the calculations, okay, set up. So now here's sort of comparison with the Alan Khan and the Khan Healer. It's not the same. Selina non-local motion button, what do you get? So that's something carefully required to understand. So the one so sort of you see the Uh the one so sort of you see the one and notice this because we get a right time scale so you use dynamic literacy prepelling is order one like t equal to one is a lich station solution for both L and Khan Kangele. So the Kankele slight difference is equal to four but uh okay that's a natural photo because now local motion by curvature gap. Okay, so you have the one I know with this example we pick it up from way too. When you do this guy yourself computer Sky itself computer the equivalent separate cap is actually quite easily. So let me just if we do some photoplot change, then you do this one. I know my time is up as let me quickly do that, show you. Okay, so my okay, my collaborate would also do a three-dimensional. And so here's sort of how to show you details. So if you have buttons that are not flat, it sort of makes It's up not flat, it sort of makes a small hill over there, and then you lift up a little different high. You have to see this splitting of the one, maybe a 3D would be more impressive, which I at least I'm very impressed. Let's see, how can I do? Ah, so this cannot. Is there any way to? Okay, cannot. Is anyway we can shoot a movie? Click on this one. Cannot, right? I guess I cannot. Okay. So, uh, too bad. Is is anybody shoot a movie? Is anybody movie? Yeah. Just click this one. Yeah, thank you. Okay. All right. So you say you make a small topographic change. You have very easily to computer this best transition over there. So let me move on a little bit. So that is sort of on the time scale. On the time scale for the Kanhele Elenkan, what do you get for the Elenkan Kangele calculation if we carefully compute the energy and it is okay? So, next is sort of for really tries to understand sort of for the button. And this particular spatian itself is used a lot in engineer called the electrostatic control for the droplets, which that's easy to control. And this work is Han Chi, Hanji Chi. Hanjiqi and Yuan Kai and Wen, and so you sort of follow the one and follow up early calculations of whatever we have here. But now, on top of itself, is this pattern, this charger pattern. So, if we give him some electric field, and electric field was driving the charger potential, you give you the tangent motion on the surface. And if you get doing careful calculations, you can compare this guy. So, again, follow the same idea for sort of Anzaga principle. Anzaga principle just counting energy, and it's very easy to compute energy because the energy is just counting how many energy you have. Yes, then you do invalidation and you know put dissipation and put a control there. So let me okay. And so then this guy itself again. So this water energy here, surface energy, then also this you have sort of electrostatic charges over there. Let me just. Let me just electrostatic phase to move the interface, which is computational. So you follow this dissipation functional. And so that's sort of the VII write down the graph formulation to easy to compute. And this is how the friction have here. Instead of use the locus stock specimens, which means the geometric motion, easy to calculate. And you minimize this guy, and then you have the This guy, and then you have the formulation. So, the formulation times are extremely simple. If control is an additional control available, the electro potential, electrostatic potential over there, you know, you add it to the system, it's driving dynamically with very little control for the example for the application. So, that's what we do follow the same idea setup, which we have. And then she did the calculations with. With the electrostatic, then, okay, so and particularly, we are really interested on how to do the control with those. Okay, okay, all right, so let me end up to show the beautiful picture of my three young collaborate, Yuan Gao and Gu Sen Fu and Han Chi Ji. And so those are people really did a good job. Great job. Yeah, thank you very much.
