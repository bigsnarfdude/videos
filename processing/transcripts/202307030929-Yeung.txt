Thanks so much for um giving me this opportunity to present some of our work for you today. Especially thanks to organizers, Juni. It's really really cool to see the history as well behind this. So the question broadly I'm interested in thinking about how different gene regulatory layers work together. And recently a lot of things in single cell epigenomics is very exciting because this type of field is becoming very multimodal. This type of field is becoming very multimodal in the sense that I mean you can measure more than just the open chromatin, like from single cell taxis. You can start to look at other chromatin states, like these heterochromatin states, repressed states, poised states. And a lot of interesting data science questions come about now, which is one of the things is what are the relationships between all these different modalities? And then can we learn something about the gene regulatory strategies that a cell can use to either enable or constrain what it can do in the body? Body. So today I'm really going to be focusing on kind of histo modifications here. And the way that people do these types of techniques at the moment, they use kind of antibody-based approaches. So usually one antibody associates with one histome modification. And these histome modifications are supposed to represent some sort of comatin states. But if you want to look at kind of two different regions, two types of chromatin states, like active or depressed regions, what you normally do is you take these complex mixture of cells that have many different Complex nature of cells that have many different cell types. And then you split them into two technical batches. And then in the first batch, you would stain your cells targeting an antibody that targets one histone modification. And then you would take a second technical batch, and then you would do the same assay with a different histone modification. And this type of strategy has been very useful because then you can look at all the different possible states that these cells can be in for one histone modification or another. But of course, this is only limiting to. But of course, this is only limiting to one histone modification per cell. Although these types of methods haven't been actually very successful to look at kind of very different types of chromatin states that people haven't looked at before, that are very distinct from the chromatin. So the analysis side, usually on the data science side, one type of method that works quite well is this kind of topic modeling called latent duration allocation. And I think it works really well because essentially it's a hierarchical multinomial modeling. So the multinomial Multinomial model. So the multinomial part allows you to look at sparse counts in a very natural way. And then the hierarchical part of the model allows you to look at relationships, to leverage relationships between cells. So just to give you a very brief kind of model of what it looks like, if you want to generate a cut in the cell, what you get is first you first choose a latent variable that's parameterized by some categorical or multinomial distribution, by some theta, and that tells you which of the latent factors to choose. And you choose one. Let's say you choose this one. Choose one, let's say you choose this one, and then after that, you choose a genomic region given what the latent factor is. So these ones, you would have kind of k latent factors. You have k different types of genomic distributions. And then since you picked theta one in the first iteration, then you would maybe generate a cut here. So that's how you would generate one cut in the data. You would kind of iterate until you get kind of the 10,000 number of cuts that you have in each cell. So this kind of model that allows you to get this kind of relationship between cells, but also modeling smart. Cells, but also modeling smart counts. Nothing very successful, and you have to add these kind of Jewish priors to help prevent influfinning. But essentially, one of the things that's limiting is that these kind of works for one histomark per cell. So you have to split things into technical batches. And the question is: can you start to think about doing more than one histomark per cell? And you might think this is not like a data science type of question, but I actually Type of question, but I actually want to show you that it actually can be. So, one way to do it is you can kind of add more antibodies into your assay. Then you kind of have breeds that come from all sorts of antibodies. And the idea is maybe you can kind of learn something from that. And there's also kind of purely experimental solutions where you can barcode from. Here I'm going to talk about this kind of mixing and maybe all of them. And once you have that, so basically the idea is you can start to look at many different histone modifications in one cell. Modifications in one cell. And the question is, then, after that, no matter how you do it, what kind of insights can you get from this data that you couldn't get when you just looked at one modality at a time? So that's kind of the key thing if you want to think about the data science model. So I just want to give you this method. It's called Singcell Chick-Seq. And the idea is that you want to multiplex these histomifications first and then deconvolve the next signal. This idea came kind of during the pandemic when we couldn't do any kind of experimental kind of optimization. So we're like, can we kind of do this purely on the statistical side? Of do this purely on the statistical side. So, the idea is you stain your cells now, you add a third chip back, and you stain your cells with two antibodies together, but now you're generating cuts. And the problem now is you don't know whether this cut comes from kind of the red antibody or a blue one. And that's kind of the inference problem. But thankfully, it's actually the problem is fairly tractable because we did all these kind of first two technical batches where you know all the different competence states that a cell can be in for the. Competence states that a cell can be in for the red histomodification or the blue histomic. So you can write a model that kind of links a profile from the red, from kind of the red state into the blue state, and then you can ask, that's kind of the likelihood model, and you can condition that onto the data, and then what you can get then is a probabilistic model that you can assign every single read back to its still modification origin. And technically, what we're doing is we're expanding these kind of multinomial models that I showed you. These kind of multinomial models that I showed you before into kind of linear combinations so that you can combine profiles together and then you can kind of do reference on that. Just to give you a little bit of snippet of what you can do, so we tried to look at dynamic relationships between two active marks. And we want to look at kind of more different types of marks. If you check out the paper, we looked at different repressive marks and active and repressive. Here I just showed you two active marks. And the idea is we're taking regenerative cells from blood. Regenitor cells from blood bone marrow, and we differentiate them into macrophages. And then we're trying to look at two different types of pistol marks: one's kind of active or prime regions, and the other one's more related to transformation. So maybe we're thinking there's some sort of forward relationships between the two. So what can you get from this kind of data? So if you can get kind of two marks in one cell, maybe one naive thing to initially do is kind of UMAP, but then now, because here's a UMAP on the left with the K4 monomethylation, on the right is the P36. On the right is the P36. The idea is maybe from now this cell actually, you have information from the same cell on both UMAPs, maybe you can link them together. Initially, maybe that gives you something. Maybe you can see, okay, there's a bit of very concentrated yellow here for late time. Maybe here's more diffuse. But it's still very qualitative, right? So here's kind of initial exploration, but we want something that can be more precise. So we want to think about kind of analysis methods that kind of really reveal what's the relationship between this. So, maybe just conceptually, what I want to show you is: you know, what are we getting when we start to look at multiple modalities, especially when the relationships are not really clear? So maybe with ATTAC-seq and RNA-seq, the relationship is kind of obvious. I mean, more generally, what is it really doing? So, imagine now you have sampling cells now. You can get information of both the histomotic A and B. So, you can think about it, you can get this kind of joint distribution, right? And if you think about it, this gives you more than what. If you think about it, this gives you more than what you get if you just looked at one, right? Because if you looked at one, then you're basically getting a marginal distribution. So here's a marginal distribution for B, this would be a marginal distribution for A. And so that's kind of not the same as looking at both together. And also the single cell part of the assay is important because if you just looked at just the single kind of a bulk measurement, you're always seeing some sort of a point estimate somewhere, let's say. Point estimate for BA and B. That's for BA and B. So, and then if you do that, you might be at a point where it actually doesn't exist if you looked at the single cell. So, this kind of single cell, and I'll say multimodal part, really is important to look at this kind of joint distribution. So, that's kind of the conceptual part. So, how do we learn that from the data? The idea is to start to think about the pseudo-times from the K4-modomethyl and K36 as kind of distinct. And then, for each cell, we want to ask: where is it in pseudo-time for K4-model methyl and where is it? For kids for model methyl, and where is it for the other student side uses? So, what you do is basically for every cell, you want to infer two different times: one's like a T, one's like a tau, and those are for related for the different historical applications. And those can be completely, you don't know what the relationships are a priority, right? So you don't want to add this kind of correlation or anti-correlation relationships beforehand. And so the function is actually fairly tractable because also these kind of multinomial models, and essentially. Multinomial models, and essentially what you have is this kind of a linear combination of two different historical applications. And what you can get for every cell now, you can get basically an estimate of where they are on the tau space, in this case it's the K4 monomethylation, and where the cell is on the T space, which is K36. And what you have is initially from the early days, you had this kind of K4 monomethylation that kind of progresses, whereas the K36 is relatively stable, and then the K36 catches up later. Catches up later. So you can see this kind of, what you see kind of priming sense. The key formula evaluation is telling what's going to happen in later time. So this really kind of precisely gives you what's the relationship in this kind of assay. So finally, what can you do with these relationships? You can start to model them maybe with some very simple ODEs for this kind of very standard one where you can say the accumulation of K36 depends on how much K4 you have and also this kind of Before you have, and also this kind of gamma parameter that will tell you how fast the cells will kind of reach a steady state. And this seems to be a reasonable model for this type of differentiation, I say, where this kind of MERTK gene, for example, this is a macrophage-specific gene, it kind of goes up kind of exponential relaxation, and then these are loss of progenitor markers. And then you can do that, fit back these gamma parameters for every. Fit that these gamma parameters for every, for many of these genes. And then you can summarize them in kind of a PCA. You can see that initially you have kind of a strong move towards this kind of a new steady state, which happens later in the movement. So now we can kind of also interpret these vectors in a meaningful way as well. You can see they're kind of larger in the beginning and then kind of slower in the end. So this is near the end. So the point I want Near the end. So, the point I want to say is that one of the data science ways you can do is to look at multimodal modalities, start to look at relationships or interactions between modalities. This can give you a lot of things that you couldn't get from just one modality at a time. So I showed you today this kind of joint distribution where you can actually see the relationships between modalities. We can also look at kind of other types of marks. So, these will be like repressive and active marks, and you can see how they're kind of related to each other as well. So, finally, maybe just kind of So, finally, maybe just kind of three things to summarize this point: is that we're starting to look at ways to look at data science-driven kind of experimental methods and design. So, in the first part, I showed you kind of an idea where you can really drive kind of the statistical side to look at kind of new experimental insights, where you can just do kind of one simple experiment that can give you things that you couldn't get if you just looked at one revaluable time. And I think that's really cool because now we're starting to take these kind of existing technologies and ask maybe you can actually get more than what you normally could get. Than what you normally could get if you just think of it in a little more kind of statistical approach. And the second part, we start to see these different covatin states are pretty interesting because they can be very distinct. They're not necessarily like the tax-seq and RNA-seq type of relationships. And the question then is, you know, how does this influence experimental design? For example, which crystal modifications should you choose, right? If you wanted to, you have $10,000 to sample stuff. If you want to look at kind of two things that are very Do you want to look at two things that are very correlated, or you want things that are kind of orthogonal, things like that? And also, things about integrative analysis is also important because we start to think about: is it appropriate to have one UMAP that has everything together, or you want to kind of look at it separately? It all depends on what's the relationship between these modalities. And then finally, the last thing I've been thinking about lately as well, these kind of snapshot data, how does it really underlie the real underlying stochastic trajectories? And so one of these things are kind of snapshots. Are these things are kind of snapshots, but maybe you can also add kind of experimental methods that start to kind of alleviate some of these limits. So I think that's all I have, and I'd be happy to take any questions. Well, thank you. For the pseudo-time analysis, I was curious: how do you actually derive the pseudo-time? Do you use both of the marks to decide that when you do the pseudo-type? Yeah, so we do it separately. So in the end, this type of this particular kind of system was fairly, so we did it separately, so individually. So we do a pseudo-time for this and a pseudo-time for that kind of separately without any information between the two. Because the assumption is maybe if they're related, you would see them anyways, kind of a linear line. If they're not, then you would see something else. Yeah, so that's how we would do it. And this simple case is very simple. This is very simple, kind of PCA type of supertech. Very interesting. I have a question about the maximum. So, currently you're getting two proteins, and then can you imagine that in the signature you're kind of having what's the maximum number of proteins? Yeah, so it's a good question. So, on the two, it's fairly robust, and we also did three. And I think what happens in the end, kind of on the experimental. kind of on the experimental purely on the experimental side is that you start to you start when you have add lots and lots of proteins you start to have to optimize the amount of proportional amounts of people each antibody because if you do like 10 and you add one that's 100 times more concentration than the other it just kills all your signal so you like there's more and more experimental tweaking as you add more so so actually what's really exciting is there's these kind of purely experimental approaches but then you can Purely experimental approaches, but then you can kind of double those immediately, right? Or you can triple those rather than trying to do everything on the computational side or doing everything on the experimental side. So I think doing both balances is something. You can do different pairs, but you can do one, two, one, two, two, three, or maybe. Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, so yeah, you can link them in different pairs. Can you do repress modern active mockery? Do repressive modern and active marker simultaneously? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, so we actually started with repressive and active mark. It's actually technically a harder one just because you don't really know the, there could be like modeling, like model identifiability issues. You can imagine like you mix two together, they look like exactly kind of another pair. But yeah, but we did all different pairs. So two repressive, we did two different types of repressive together, one repressive active and two active. And we also done simulations that showed like any kind of Simulations that show any kind of relationships can be recovered from this. So it doesn't matter which two you use. You're already like experimental solution having a benchmark. Yeah, so with the experimental, so we get the point, I don't have the slide here, but for our purely computational solution, we actually get 10 times more reads per cell than if you do purely on the experimental side, purely because the enzyme we're using is actually much more sensitive, but it's not very good at multiplexing. Very good at multiplexing. So they're using a good for multiplexing, but it's not as sensitive, so that we get to leverage the sensitivity of these levels. Just to quickly piggyback on that, can you do a histone marker pioneering factor? Yeah, so any kind of antibody-based, anything, you need a good antibody for anything. So so if you have good antibody, then then it works. I think we are hitting nine forty five. I'll try to keep us on time. If I see additional questions, please use Slack. Questions, please use Slack.
