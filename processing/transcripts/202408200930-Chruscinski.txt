From University of Helsinki. Sorry, I have some technical problems. Maybe I stop sharing and share again. Just a moment. Okay. Okay. So the outline of my talk is as follows. I start with a very, very, very basic introduction to what you know very well, Gorini Kosakovsky-Limba-Sudarshan master equation. And then I recall you what. And then I recall you how we define relaxation rates for Markovian semi-groups generated by this famous master equation. And then my plan is to discuss a bound for relaxation rates for arbitrary Archovian semigroup. I illustrate this bound. I illustrate this bound by very simple kind of paradigmatic qubit evolution. And then my main goal is to present a proof of this bound. Interestingly, the proof is based on a classical theory of Lepoon of exponents. And then I conclude. Okay, so. Okay, so very basic notation I will use in my talk. I will consider only finite dimensional scenario. And well, by positive map, I mean a linear map which maps positive operators in B of H into positive operators. And the map is completely positive if this extended map identity tensor phi is positive. identity tensor phi is positive. And now we have the celebrated Choi theorem, which says that actually if you have a map phi, it is to check for complete positivity, it is enough to check positivity of this extended map on a single element, which is just projector onto maximally entangled state. And then obvious definition of And then obvious definition of trace preserving maps and unital maps. Okay. So famous generator, which was derived by, well, was proved that this is the most general form of a generator which gives rise to completely positive trace-preserving maps. And if you define this map phi, phi of rho using this formula, then we have very, very compact form of the generator, which is displayed here. This is a dual map, well, adjoint with respect to Hilbert-Schmidt inner product acting on identity operator. And well, you know this very well. And well, yesterday we Day, we've seen this structure many times. Okay, so let me briefly recall the basic properties, spectral properties of maps and generators. But let me start with just stochastic matrices, n by n matrices with non-negative entries and enjoying this constraint. Constraint and due to the famous result of due to Frobenius and Perron, we know that the spectrum of any stochastic matrix, which is in general complex, enjoys this nice property that it is symmetric with respect to a real line. There is a leading eigenvalue. A leading eigenvalue, which is one. The corresponding eigenvector to leading eigenvalue, after appropriate normalization, defines a legitimate probability distribution. And all remaining eigenvalues enjoy this property. So they are confined to a unit disk on the complex plane. And actually, we have almost the same result. Almost the same result for positive and trace-preserving maps, in particular, completely positive. Namely, if I have an arbitrary linear positive map phi acting on a matrix algebra of n times n complex matrices, then again the spectrum is in general complex, but it is symmetric with respect to a line. There is a leading parent-frobenius eigenvalue, which is one. Now, the corresponding eigenvector, after appropriate normalization, defines a legitimate density operator, quantum state, and all remaining eigenvalues are confined to unit disk on the complex plane, so-called peronthrobenous disk. And we have And we have similar results concerning the spectra of generators, both in the classical case and quantum case. Let me just consider quantum case. Suppose I have a generator, L, generator of positive trace-preserving maps, in particular completely positive. So, in this case, we know. So, in this case, we know that spectrum, well, spectrum again is in general complex, but is symmetric with respect to real line. There is a leading eigenvalue now equals to zero, the corresponding eigenvector. After again, appropriate normalization defines the density operator or quantum state. And now, all eigenvalues enjoy this property that the real power. Enjoy this property that the real part is never strictly positive. And this very property enables us to define relaxation rate. So we have a set of relaxation rates, which is defined here. So this is minus a real part of in general complex eigenvalue. So we have d squared minus one non-trivial. Squared minus one non-trivial relaxation race corresponding to generate or giving rise to positive trace-preserving semi-group, or in particular, completely positive and trace-preserving. Well, it's not easy to talk to you without seeing your faces. So, from time to time, I will just ask, is it clear? Are you with me? If you have any questions, just Is just let me know okay. So now my basic question is the following. So after recalling this basic basic properties of spectra and defining relaxation rates, here comes the main question: Does complete positivity imply any constraints for relaxation rates? Is it possible that, well, they are Well, they are completely arbitrary, or there is some non-trivial constraint among relaxation rates. And let me to start with, let me present you very simple examples showing that indeed there is quite non-trivial constraint between the rates. Let me start with a very simple generator of qubit evolution. Sigma z is just. Sigma z is just z-Pauli matrix. And because of very simple form of the generator, it's very easy to find the spectrum. Right? Well, there is always one eigenvalue, L0, which is zero, but apart from L naught, we have three additional L1, L2, L3. L1 is 0, and L2, and L3. This is just complex conjugate per. So in this case, So, in this case, we have three rays, three relaxation rates: gamma one, which is zero, and gamma two, which is the same as gamma three, equals to gamma. Gamma is a parameter in the generator. Okay, and now look, if I define the total rate, right, which is some. Which is the sum of all of them, then, as you see in this very simple example, anything to the right is upper bounded by total rate divided by two. And actually, if I consider a bit more complicated example, now we have a generator which consists of three elementary generators with three arbitrary non-negative constants. non-negative constants gamma one gamma two gamma three then again it's very easy to compute the the spectrum right and knowing the spectrum we have three non-trivial relaxation rates each of them is just some of two of small gammas right the small gammas are usually called transition rate so relaxation rate gamma one gamma two and gamma three are some of two transition A sum of two transition rates. Of course, small gammas are arbitrary, but non-negative, right? They are completely arbitrary. However, relaxation rates are not arbitrary. There is a non-trivial constraint between them. And again, the constraint is essentially the same as in the previous example. Namely, if I define the total rate summing all of All of single rays, gamma one, gamma two, gamma, gamma three. Then again, you see that any single rate is upper bounded by total rate divided by two, right? So the same constraint as in the previous example. And eventually, let me consider one of the paradigmatic qubit generator, which consists of four elementary processes driving with. Processes driving with angular velocity omega. This L plus corresponds to pumping from ground to excited states with the rate gamma plus, dissipation from or dissipation or dumping from excited to the ground state with the rate gamma minus and dephasing with the rate gamma z. Again, it's very easy to compute. It's very easy to compute all rates. Right. In this case, we have a degeneral I say. Gamma one is gamma the same as gamma two, and usually people call it transversal rate. And additionally, there is gamma three, which is in this case, especially quantum opticians call it longitudinal rate. Right? Again, the same kind of constraint, but But if for this particular model, there is a celebrated relation between longitudinal rate and transversal rate, which is very famous in quantum optics. But summing up in all, these three examples, essentially the same kind of constraints between relaxation rates appear. Moreover, this Moreover, this example can be easily translated into the following corresponding master equation for the density operator. If you introduce well-known block vector, we get the following equation for the evolution of the block vector. Right? There are famous block equations. Block equations. And look, the condition to stay within a block ball in the course of time is the following, that transversal rate is non-negative and longitudinal rate satisfies this condition, where delta is just the difference between gamma plus well pumping rate and dumping rate. But look, if you Look, if you are interested only to stay within a block ball, well, to have positive evolution, these rates are independent, right? You can take independently transversal and longitudinal rate. However, if you care to have a velocion which is not only positive, stays within a block ball, but also completely positive, then immediately there is a non-trivial relation between transversal rate and longitudinal rate. To deny. So, this simple example shows how complete positivity implies quite interesting relation between relaxation rates, in particular between longitudinal and transversal rates for this very, very well-known model. And actually, this is not a This is not an accident happening for three particular models because more than 20 years ago, Gen Kimura, who is the co-author of this presentation, proved this general result that for any qubit evolution, two-level quantum system, you have three non-trivial relaxation rates, and there is a universal constraint, right? It was proven. So, these are examples I just. So, these are examples I just presented. These are just examples of this universal result. Okay, and a few years ago, we came with this conjecture, how to generalize this constraint, which is universally valid for Q. Which is universally valid for qubits to D-level quantum system, and we came up with this conjecture that for D-level quantum system, you have general d squared minus one non-trivial rights. So you define a total right, and then our conjecture says that any single right is upper bounded by total rate. upper bounded by total rate divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. Of course, if the dimension is true, we recover the previous result by Yinkimura. Well, you can reformulate this result in terms of relative rights. This is a definition of the relative rights. So the conjecture says that any single relative right is divided by one over the dimension of the Hilbert space. The Hilbert space. Okay, so we started with some simple numerics, which was very convincing, at least for a low-dimensional scenario. So these are three plots. This red line is just this bound one over D. You have a You have a plot, a cloud of eigenvalues generated by randomly chosen Lin Bladians. And if the cloud is on the right of the red line, it means that the conjecture is supported. So there was initial support from Initial support from simple numerics. And then we managed to prove that when it is true, it is tight. You cannot improve. Then we prove it for unital semi-groups. Unital means that maximally mixed state is an invariant state of the evolution. Well, that kind of. Well, that kind of evolution is quite important, in particular in physics, because well, if the semi-group is unital, then the entropy is entropy monotonically increases. Then we prove it for semi-groups enjoying some additional symmetries. In our case, Symmetries. In our case, it was covariance with respect to diagonal unitaries, diagonal with respect to some fixed spaces in the Hilbert space. Another nice result was that we were able to prove it for an important class of Davies generators obtained in the well-known weak coupling limit. And eventually, we got quite conversion. We got quite convincing numerics, right? Not only for low-dimensional scenario, but quite high dimensions. And we spend some time trying to prove that it is not only valid in these special cases, but it is universally true. And the rest of And the rest of my talk, I spent trying to show you the main point of the proof. Are there any questions? Are you with me? I think we have one question. Yes, please. You mentioned the result, I think I didn't touch the exact result you said. Sorry, I don't really. Sorry, I I don't hear you. Sorry, do you hear me now? Now, yes. Okay, sorry for that. Okay, so you mentioned a result about some entropy increasing. Can you please say one more time about that result? I'm not sure if I no, no, this is not this is not our result. It it it I know I know I know uh yeah, I understood that, but uh ju Yeah, I understood that, but just curiosity if you. No, I only mentioned that we were looking for some particular cases when we can prove it. And one of the case corresponds to the evolution for which the entropy monotonically increases, which corresponds to unital semi-groups. And for this, semi-groups. For these semi-groups, we were able to analytically prove this result. Nothing special about entropy, I just mentioned because it's quite important quantity in physics. I don't know whether you're satisfied with this short. Yeah, he says thank you. Okay, good. So now. Let me briefly go through the proof, which, as I said at the very beginning, uses some elements of. Sorry, I think we have one more question. One question. The capital gamma A, K, are the eigenvalues divided by capital Gamma or no? No, no, no. Or no? No, no, no, they are not. They are not normalized. What is gamma capital gamma k? How is related to the eigenvalues? Capital Gamma K is minus the real part of the eigenvalue, lambda k. Okay, and a capital gamma is just a sum of all capital gamma one up to capital. capital gamma one up to capital gamma d squared minus one. Hope it is clear. Yes, thank you. Okay, so let me continue. Okay, so the starting point is of course limb blood structure on Korini Kosakovsky-Sudarshan limb blood structure. And suppose I can solve I can solve it for some initial condition. So I have a family of density operators, rho of t. And because, well, it's a remission operator, I can find spectral decomposition, which of course is time-dependent. So eigenvalues are time-dependent, and eigenvectors are time-dependent. Right? Right. Well, if the initial, if rho, if rho naught is just density operators, this is a family of density operators. So the eigenvalues pk of t defines just the dimensional probability distribution. Right? And actually, it's not very difficult to convince yourself that. That original master equation for the density operator of t implies a master equation, kind of master equation for classical probability vector pk of t. This is the corresponding equation. Where now the classical generator, classical generator time dependent right is is defined here versus matrix matrix of rates l i j time dependent is defined by this formula where l l n is just noise operator from the link bladion right so having arbitrary arbitrary Linbladian with well positive transition Well, positive transition rates, small gammas. I arrived into the corresponding master equation for probability distribution corresponding to spectral decomposition of the solution at time t. Time t. And of course, using this definition of this relation between w and r, you immediately find that this master equation is nothing but well, classical Pauli rate equation. So once again, starting with arbitrary Lindblad generator, I pick up arbitrary solution. Arbitrary solution. I diagonalize. Well, I have to diagonalize at any moment of time. At any moment, I gathered eigenvalues and defined probability vector. And this probability vector satisfies this classical Pauli rate equation with time dependent rates. Time-dependent rates. But in this case, rates are well time-dependent but non-negative. So this is kind of Markovian condition for this classical evolution of probability distribution. So this is the first step of the proof. Just I translated the original master equation for the density operator. Density operator, that one, into the master Pauli Pauli rate equation for the eigenvalues at time t. Are you with me? Is it clear? Oh, this is very standard, right? And it was considered by many people for various purposes. Okay, so this was the first step, second step. First step, second step. So let me assume that the generator L is diagonalizable, which is generate case, right? You can easily, well, using some continuity arguments, you can generalize results for non-diagonalizable generators as well. What does it mean diagonalizable? You have the spectral representation, right? This capital XL is just right eigenvector. Is just right eigenvector of L and Y L is left eigenvector of L or right eigenvector of dual of L. So we have spectral decomposition of the original Ling Bladian and of course eigenvalues. Well, lambda naught is zero and remaining eigenvalues are in general complex, but with Complex, but with negative real part minus gamma L. So having a spectral representation of the generator, I immediately, well, if I know the spectral representation of the generator, well, I know everything, right? I can find a solution generated from arbitrary initial state ronod, right? This is just Not right, this is general formula for the solution, right? I simply exponentiate eigenvalues, right? So if I know a rho of t, I can find this probability distribution pk of t. It is given here. Okay. So this Pi of T is just spectrum of rho at time t. Very simple to obtain, right? If I know eigenvectors. Well, psi i of t are eigenvectors of rho of rho at time t. Okay, so now the crucial observation is. Is okay again the same formula, right? So I just repeated this formula. So this is the formula for the spectrum of rho at time t. And now the key observation is the following: that in the large recall that eigenvalues are of this form, right, gamma, lambda, capital gamma. Gamma lambda, capital gamma lambda is just a set of relaxation, right? So in the large negative time, the above expression, expression for the eigenvalues of the density operator, is exponentially dominated by the eigenvalue with the largest rate. So maximal relaxation rate. So asymptotically, when T goes. Asymptotically, when t goes to minus infinity, this solution pi of t will have this have this structure. This is the dominating term. And this function qi of t, well, which is defined essentially by this term, is bounded. Right? So, this is general. So, this is general observation for the solution. If you go with time to minus infinity, right? It is a solution is dominated by this term with exponent involving maximal relaxation rate, gamma max. Okay, and now comes simple observation from Observation from Lyapunov Core. So, well, you remember, I managed to translate original Lindblatt master equation for the density operator into the master equation for classical probability vector, which is essentially of that form, right, with some generator. And now we have the following generator. Have the following general result in the theory of differential equations. Well, pretty general. That suppose I have a first-order differential equation of that form, well, linar, right? With time-dependent generator. Then for any solution of this equation, I can define so-called Lapunov characteristic exponent. This is the definition. Right? And then Right, and then we have a very nice result which tells us that if the norm of this generator, well, well, here I use, well, I mean n-dimensional real space. So essentially, well, I did not specify the norm, but essentially you know that all norms are in this case equivalent. All norms are in this case equivalent to Euclidean norm. So I pick up some norm, right? To define the norm of the vector. And here I have a norm of the matrix. So this is a matrix norm, matrix norm induced by the vector norm in Rn. And this results say that if this matrix norm Say that if this matrix norm is upper bounded by m, then this Lyapunov characteristic exponent of the solution is also upper bounded by m. So I will, in the rest of the proof, I will use this very result. Okay, so coming back to our observation, now I will define this quantitative. This quantity going while using the asymptotic limit at minus infinity due to our observation, right, that if I go to minus infinity, I know the dominating term in the formula for pi of t. So it's clear that if I compute this quantity, If I compute this quantity, this quantity here does not depend on the norm and of course reproduces the maximal relaxation rate. So just to summarize, I started with the solution of the Lindblatt master equation. I found the spectrum. I found the Master equation for the spectrum, which is just classical Pauli rate equation, and then observe that any solution of this rate equation enjoys this property that the maximal relaxation rate of the original Lindbert-Master equation equals to character. Equals to characteristic Lepunov exponent of the vector P of t. So the final step of the proof is try to use, I will try to use this result that knowing the classical generator, well, this is just. Well, this is just this Pauli-Pauli classical Pauli rate equation. If I manage to find upper bound for the matrix norm of this generator, then I will find eventually upper bound for the maximal relaxation rate. Okay, and at this point, we have to decide which norm to use. We have to decide which norm to use. Of course, all norms are equivalent. However, it may happen that different norms in principle may give different bounds. So what we observe is that using this norm, infinity norm, so this is the norm in So, this is the norm in n-dimensional real vector space. This is just maximum of modulus of components of vector x. This is a corresponding matrix norm induced by this vector norm. Then it's not very difficult to show that indeed. That indeed Pauli rate generator is essentially upper bounded by total rate divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. And this simple result from the Lyapunov theory implies that characteristic Lyapunov exponent, which is in this case Exponent, which is in this case nothing but maximal relaxation rate, is upper bounded by the same quantity, which is total rate divided by D. Which completes the proof, right? And for analytical generator, the maximal rate Right is upper bounded by total rate divided by D. Okay, if I still have some time, well, maybe there are some questions. Of course, there are some technical things, but well, my claim is that, well, we may. Well, my claim is that, well, we managed to prove it, right? And now let me say a few words about possible implications of this result. So, my question is: what this result tells us about Tells us about more general situations when we consider time-dependent generators. Okay, so suppose that I have a general master equation with time-dependent generator L of t and formally I can find the solution, right? The solution, well, first of all, I find the family of maps. Family of maps. And of course, if I pick up an initial state rho naught, I can produce a trajectory of t just applying a map lambda t naught, right? Lambda T naught is defined here. This is the product exponential. This t is just a chronological product, right? Of course, in general, it's a quite non-trivial problem. Non-trivial problem to decide what are the properties of time-dependent generator, such that if you compute this formula for lambda, you get a family of completely positive maps. However, there is a very special scenario for which the answer is pretty simple, namely if for any t this L of T is just of the Lindblad form. Of t is just of the Limbled form, right? Then, trivially, this family is a legitimate family of completely positive and trace-preserving maps. Moreover, in this case, this family enjoys additional property. Usually, we call it CP divisibility, meaning that a map at time t can be divided into the work, it can be composed. It can be composed as a map at time, well, map from zero up to s composed with the propagator from s to t. And we call a map CP divisible if this two parameter family of propagators is completely positive and trace preserving for n t greater than s. And actually, this this prop this very property of divisibility is. Very property of divisibility, some people call such maps, such dynamical maps, to be Markogan. Essentially, this nice property is equivalent to the fact that this time-dependent generator has this simple property that for any t well greater or equal to zero is of the Linblood form. Okay. So, if I have a family of generators, time-dependent Lindler generators, then trivially, relaxation rates are also time-dependent, but non-negative. And if the map is this dynamical map, lambda notice CPDB. That the naught is CPD visible, then relaxation rates, time-dependent relaxation rates, enjoy this constraint for any T. So if I fix T, I pick up a maximal rate in the set of all relaxation rates, and this maximal rate is upper bounded by total rate divided by dimension of the Hilbert space. Dimension of the Hilbert space. Let me illustrate this by a very, very simple example. Again, qubit evolution. So, of course, you recognize this as a structure of the generator, but now this transition rates are time dependent. Gamma one and gamma two, they are just one. However, gamma three is minus hyperbolic tangent of t. Why is this very strange? Why this very strange function? Well, because for this function I can easily solve the exponential. And moreover, you see that gamma 3 is always negative, right? So it's in a sense highly non-Markovian dynamics. Because of this fact that one of the rates is always negative, people call evolution gender. People call evolution generated by such generators eternally non-Markovian because it is never divisible, right? Because of this fact. And look, it's a trivial exercise to compute time-dependent rates. And this condition here is violated, right? So Markovianity implies this condition. Implies this condition, however, for non-Markovian evolution, it can be violated, as this simple, simple example illustrates. So, just to summarize, somehow these conditions for time-independent for original lean-blood semi-groups and time-dependent constraints may be considered as physical. Considered as physical manifestation of complete positivity. In particular, this is important when you go to the laboratory and try to convince people in the lab to check something related to complete positivity. Of course, it's difficult to talk to these guys using mathematical terms. However, if they manage to measure relaxation rates, and very often these rates are just Very often, these rates are just directly measurable, then you can somehow try to convince people that well, the rate of the constraint of this kind is due to the fact that, well, original quantum evolution is completely positive. And somehow, constraints like this play a role. This plays a role analogous to the role of seminal bearing inequalities and so-called Legged Garg inequalities, sometimes called temporal bell inequalities. So violation of, as you remember, violation of Bell rule out local hidden variable model and violation of Leggett Garc rule out. Dark rollout assumption of macro realism. Similarly, violation of this time-dependent relaxation bound, well, violation of this, rule out completely positive semi-group, and violation of this time-dependent constraint, rule out Markovian evolution. If this constraint, if this condition is violated, the evolution cannot be Markovian. Be Markov and still there are some open problems. So, a few months in Leviko, I Darius, sorry to interrupt. I think we're pushing up against the end of time. Yes, last slide, okay. Well, open problem. So you remember that if this is strictly larger than two, there is a class of k positive. Class of k-positive semi-groups. So the question is: how to generalize this constraint for k-positive maps? Is it reasonable to replace one over d by one over k? This is my question. Another is how to generalize for k Schwartz semi-groups and eventually how to go beyond finite dimensions. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention. I don't know if you could hear, but everyone clapped. Any questions for the speaker? May I have a question? Yeah, go ahead if you have questions. Yeah, go ahead if you have a question. Thank you. Very interesting talk. I don't fully understand what is the relation of violation of these inequalities and complete positivity. I mean, if it is understood that if they are satisfied, then it is completely positive dynamics, at least in some situations. Situations. I mean, in one direction, I understand that it's if we violate that, it cannot be completely positive. But if they are true, what is understood in this case? No, no, if they are violated, this family of propagators is not physically legitimate. At least for some pair of T and S, this guy lambda T S cannot be completely positive. S cannot be completely positive, right? So you cannot divide a map, yes, yes, yes. But reverse is, of course, not known. I mean, right, right, you are right. Yes, absolutely. You are right. And but possibly there are some for qubits, for example, or for some restricted sets, is there is the strict characterization? I mean, if they are true, then completely. If they are true, then completely positive, or there are no such in general. I don't know. For some classes, yes, for some special classes, I have the result if and only if, right? But in general, you are right. In general, it is not if and only if. Complete positivity implies this, but not vice, not vice versa. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, completely right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other quick question? Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I have not understood where you use complete positivity in your proof. And well, and another related question: how about the case when the spectrum When the spectrum of L is not simple. So it is not diagonalizable. Okay, so when I use complete positivity, actually, this is my starting point, right? The starting point is lean blood structure. So I started with lean blood structure, and out of that, you know, I got this classical math. I got this classical master equation which involves this noise operator L of n, which comes from the Limbladian, right? So complete positivity was the starting point of the probe, right? Yes, right, I realized that, but it was not clear to me whether if you have a similar equation with only positive. Equation with only positivity, for example, what happened, not a situation, just a courier. Therefore, if I only assume positivity, I can easily violate the constraint, right? It's very easy to okay. I'll go check it. Well, concerning the second question, of course, very good points. So, well, diagonalizable, well, they are dense in the set of all Limbladians. So, by some kind of continuity argument, I believe that you can also include the cases where the eigenvalues are not simple. But thank you for the question. I have a question. You have your estimates in terms of eigenvalues of a generator, but usually it is a rather difficult problem to diagonalize the generator. There are many examples, for example in the stochastic limit, in which you uh the j in the generator they naturally appear some constant. They naturally appear some constants, which are the generalized susceptibilities. Yes, yes. Are there some inequalities which are of this, of your type, but which are based on the generalized susceptibility, which are much easier to handle? The connection between generalized susceptibilities and eigenvalues is very complicated, very non-linear. So, can you give a So can you give at least in some cases the this relaxation times or maybe an approximation of relaxation time and of this inequality not in terms of eigenvalue but in terms of generalized susceptibilities which are directly in the statement of the in the writing of the generator i see i see of course yes i see i see everything well uh thank you very much for for for for your comment i i for for for your comment i i would be very happy to um to talk to you more on more on that yeah let's thank our speaker again thank you very much thank you thank you
