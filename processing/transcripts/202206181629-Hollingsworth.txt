Okay, time for our next talk, which will be by Chris Hollingsworth from the University of Minnesota. The title of his talk is Constructing Discrete Frames from Continuous Wavelet Transforms. All right, so first let me also thank the organizers, so Keith and Brian and Volker for organizing this wonderful conference. It's really weird for me to feel like the most applied mathematician in the room, but I kind of do here. So we'll see. So we'll see how this goes. But yeah, I'm going to talk about constructing discrete frames from continuous wavelet transforms. So there's already been some nice introduction of this from Malad, and actually there's some things in Jason's talk I will probably reference here in terms of motivation. And I don't assume everyone is familiar with discrete frames, so I'll start by introducing that a little bit. And then I'll talk specifically about frames for signals on RN squared. So a discrete frame. So, a discrete frame is just a set of vectors, some countable set of vectors for Hilbert space H, provided there are positive real numbers A and B such that this inequality holds. And in functional analysis, this is just the equivalent norms between these two Hilbert spaces, where now we've thrown this discrete space in the middle. And in finite dimensions, the classic example of a frame is the Mercedes-Benz frame for R2. If you just take three. If you just take three equal length vectors 120 degrees apart in R2, you still obtain a nice reconstruction formula, even though this isn't a basis where this looks still just like the projection formula from an orthonormal basis. The advantage of this is it builds in some redundancy to the system. And so, in signal processing, you care about these kinds of things because when you reconstruct from this, it's much more resistant in the reconstruction. Resistant in the reconstruction against perturbations of the coefficients. So, if there's some noise in your communication channel or some measurement errors, then you get a better, closer approximation of the original signal from this reconstruction than from an orthography basis. So there are advantages in the applications to looking at frames as opposed to bases. Again, I've just put the definition up here at the top, and so we replace linear independence with some kind of stability. Linear independence with some kind of stability condition, where this lower bound is really just a spanning condition, and the upper bound is just that I don't sample so densely that I lose control of the norms, which I'll talk about a little bit more later. And as I mentioned, if the frame is not a basis, then this redundancy means that the reconstruction operator has a non-trivial kernel, which never occurs with the normal basis. And so if you design it well, and some of the If you design it well, then some of the error in your reconstruction lives inside the kernel of the operator. And so it can just vanish, which is amazing and wonderful. The problem is, especially when we move into function spaces, well, we're in the infinite dimensional setting, and so you just have some arbitrary list of vectors, which are not related in any way, and so implementation is still really difficult because you need some random infinite list of vectors. And just before we move on, Uh and just before we move on, uh it's getting late in the day, I'll throw some pictures up. And another place where all of you have used frames probably recently, maybe getting here, is GPS systems. You're somewhere on the planet, you want to know where you are. Well, if you just sort of get one satellite at the distance from it, you know, you live somewhere on that circle with three, well, there's measurement error. We're talking about things at the scale of the speed of light, so you have to. So, you have some idea of where you are, but you throw in more imprecise measurements, each of which still have some error in them, and all of a sudden you start getting really good resolution for where you are on the planet. So the underlying reconstruction of GPS technology relies on this frame theory. Right? So, we've all used this probably recently. Two important examples of frame constructions to address that problem about the infinite. To address that problem about the infinite list of vectors, is, well, we'll let psi of A C denote translation by A and modulation by psi. And I'll use subscripts when I talk about translation along with dilation by H. And if you can come up with countable collections of these acting on some fixed vector psi, then we refer to this as a Gabor frame and a wavelet frame if they satisfy these frames. A wavelet frame if they satisfy these frame conditions. So I only need to know one function, I need to know some family of translations and modulations or translations and dilations acting on it to construct my discrete frame. And so these are the families that we often see in these applications. And both of these look familiar from earlier talks, where we have Gabor frames, when we have modulation, and this is in the case of R, just And this is in the case of R, just writing down explicitly. And you can see that these are coming out of the representation theory of various groups. So you have maybe the Heisenberg group in the case of Gabor frames and the representations of the affine group in the case of wavelet frames. And we'll see more of this later. So let me just go ahead and generalize that definition to one for continuous frames, where we're just going to replace that discrete summation in the middle of the definition with some kind of integral reconstruction. With some kind of integral reconstruction instead. So we actually saw this in Jason's talk with the quantum states, where this was in fact an equality. We saw this in Malad's talk this morning, and we'll see it again shortly. And if you just replace that arbitrary, separable Hilbert space in the middle with some countable space with counting measures, and this just becomes. With counting measures, and this just becomes the discrete version of the definition. So, it really is a natural generalization. All right, so the key idea is coming up. I'm going to kind of outline some things we've already heard throughout the day. Given a square integral representation for some group G, we can find something known as a wavelet, which we heard about this morning. Given the wavelet, there is some isometry into L two of the group. That's known as the continuous wavelet transform. The continuous wavelet transform. The continuous wavelet transform can be used to find this continuous frame coming out of all of our theory we've seen so far. And so the question we have now is given this continuous frame, some kind of integral reconstruction operator like we had for quantum states, can you discretize it to come up with a discrete frame that could actually be used in numerical algorithms and implementations? Algorithms and implementations. And so we really do need some kind of Goldilocks zone of sampling because if you sample too sparsely, you lose information, that lower bound becomes impossible. If you sample too densely, then information around there, you lose control of the norm and it blows up. So there's actually a lot of work that's also done just in terms of density results when these things could exist. But concrete construction. Concrete constructions turn out to be really difficult to find. And I will go through this slide really quickly because of the crowd. So we'll be working with continuous unitary group representations, which are square integrable, just meaning that these coefficient functions are L2 functions. Normally I have to spend a lot more time on that slide. So this beautiful paper of Delpho and Moore from the Paper of Dufflo and Moore from the 70s says: well, given a square integral representation, there does exist some wavelet so that we can construct this map, which is an isometry between the groups. And using this isometry, we can look at calculations that have been in several talks already today. So we get that in the weak operator topology, f has to be equal to this reconstruction. This reconstruction integral formula. And so, in particular, these are known as parsable-type frames. Both of those coefficients A and B are 1. And this is the continuous version. So, this is what we want to try and discretize. And the group I'll be talking about today will be the affine group. And I will consider that as the semi-direct product group between Mn of R with GLN of R. Of R under that same operation we've seen in previous talks, where you just have an affine shift in the first coordinate and then multiplication by the invertible matrices in the second. And we'll think of A mostly as an abelian group where you can just stack your matrix into a vector when you want to consider it as just Rn squared. But we use the matrix structure primarily so we can think of G Ln R acting on there. And are acting on there in the natural way of nature's net application. And all the clickers, not wanting. There we go. So real quickly, I'll just run through a couple of papers and results on this area previously. So really, these Gabor frames drew a lot of interest, starting with this seminal paper of Gabor, where he defines the short-term Fourier transform. The shortcoming Fourier transform, which is an example of these things. This paper of Duffin and Schaefer really defines the discrete frames, even though these integral reconstruction formulas go back to the 1920s, Schr√∂dinger working on quantum states and some other previous work. But discrete frames didn't really get a lot of interest until the mid-80s when the machine's Grossman and Meyer. When the machise, Grossman, and Meyer started doing some of these computational things with wavelet reconstructions and Shirlet groups and these kinds of things. But the discretization question really got started. It was actually a bunch of mathematical physicists looking particularly at something known as cokinetic states and just trying to ask the question: when, given one of these integral reconstruction formulas like we saw in Jason's talk. We saw in Jason's talk. When does it admit a discretization? Just can you classify that? And so people spent a good bit of time. Given the case of semi-direct product groups, this paper here at the bottom is really nice. It says that the only time it works is if things are coming out of a square integral representation. So that was already nice. This is the only setting where it's natural to sort of examine this question. For an Fur and a couple of others did a bunch of work between 2000 and 2019 when Freeman and Spiegel actually give a fairly mild set of conditions that fully classify when these discretizations exist. And then there's also a ton of work in between there in terms of these density results and things of this nature, but there's really no concrete constructions finding these discretizations. But Bernier and Taylor give kind of a nice roadmap in this paper from the 90s as to how you might go about this. And in 2013, Maya, Keith, and Sais Dakova came up with one for L2 of R4. And so I'm going to go ahead and talk about how we generalized that construction to L2 of Rn squared. To L2 of Rn squared for all n, and improved some of the numerical stability conditions for this. And I'll talk a little bit about how harmonic analysis comes up in all these arguments and in the construction. So the key ideas from Bernier and Taylor's paper is that in general we start with Gn as some semi-direct product group of MNR with some closed subgroup of invertible matrices. Matrices. We look at the natural representation of the affine group here. We can find the closed form by conjugating with the Planck-Chirel transform. If either of these representations are square integrable, then we can find some function in the space that is a wavelet. And what we're going to do to attack the problem, to discretize this, is we're actually going to discretize Fourier space and use. A space and use that to come up with the discrete frame. And here I've defined everything specifically in the context of the affine group, but everything I'm going to talk about will apply to many other semi-direct product groups. And in particular, finding the representations and all of this, we're using induced representations, lifting up from characters or trivial representations. And so the tiling system is completely The tie-laid system is completely natural. It's exactly the thing you would think it would probably be. And all of these things are going to be with respect to the hard measure for the groups. We'll have some countable subset of our group GLN. We're going to take F to be some open relatively compact subgroup or subset of it. And we call the pair FP a tiling system if, well, the first condition just says that if I take two distinct elements for my action. For my action, F translated and dilated by P and Q, those never intersect unless P and Q are equal, up to sets of measure zero, and they cover the whole space up to a set of measure zero. So no big surprise there. So just some notation for the next slide. We're going to take the closure of F to sit inside the set FO. So really we're just FO, so really we're just expanding that sort of fundamental domain F, what's gonna, I will call the mother tile, by a little epsilon neighborhood, just to embed it inside some open set, but it's also gonna sit inside some hypercube R, which has some orthonormal basis, we'll call J. And one more thing, I'll define M. Well, now I'm gonna look at the action on F closure. On F closure and FO, this little, I've now added a little epsilon neighborhood around it, and so I'm not guaranteed that things don't intersect. And so M just counts the maximal possible intersections for two of these. So that's going to show up in our frame condition. And so the main result of a paper that came out last year with Maya is given a Thailand system of GL. Given a tiling system of GLN, we can choose a wavelet that satisfies this condition where it's one on the closure of F and zero outside of this little extension of it. Then the collection of vectors here coming out of the representation rho is a discrete frame for L2 of MNR, and it satisfies, in particular, this. In particular, this set of inequalities, where if you look at what's known as the frame condition number, the ratio of the upper frame bound and the lower frame bound, you wind up with just m, which was dependent on the geometry of the pile of the system. And so all of those were what I defined on the previous slide. So our representation, again, just sort of that natural representation. Again, just sort of that natural representation where this is coming out of translation by X here and dilation by H, just that natural representation of the affine group. And then that's just the exact realization of it on the dual when you do that conjugation. And so I'd like to go ahead and just talk briefly about where the tools for harmonic. Briefly about where the tools for harmonic analysis come out and this construction and how we're really shifting things around and the importance of this tile F and all these things. So we're going to just do a version of the proof with a bunch of simplifying assumptions to avoid all of the ugly technical details. So we're going to assume that we could take f to just be the n-squared dimensional hypercube. We'll take g hat to just be the indicator function on f. To just be the indicator function on f. And we'll take a hat still is now just the dual of Rn squared. And so when you start writing these things out, we want to get control over the norm of something living inside L2 of Rn squared. We'll transfer to the Fourier side and just start writing out what that means. And because we've discretized Fourier space. Discretized Fourier space, we can just break up that integral over each one of the individual tiles to make it a discrete summation. And then we're going to just introduce a change of variables to shift everything back to the set f. And then we'll define a new function, beta sub k, which is this f hat, and realize that this is just the norm of the Fourier transform. Fourier transform. But the wonderful thing about the set F now is: well, in this case, I can identify it with L2 of the torus in square dimensional torus, but in general, it is going to be some kind of compact group. And so then the dual of the compact group will be discrete. So I can pass again to the Fourier side now of this different group and write that out now as a discrete sub. Out now as a discrete summation. So that's all of the interesting things that's happened. So are we good here? This is a good point to pause for questions on that. All right, the next slide is just simple pushing everything around so it looks like what we want. So pretty much ignore the details, but I have already uploaded the slide to the website if you're curious. But just kind of writing everything out and chasing symbol pushing around. Symbol pushing around. Right, and so we wind up exactly with what we would like, which is now just the summation. And with those simplifying assumptions, we wind up with actually a nice typeframe where A and B are both one, but things are much more complicated in the real case, which is why we get that N. So everything so far defined depends on being able to actually find a tiling system of the space. So as long as we can construct a tiling system, As we can construct a tiling system, then all of this works. I can construct a discrete frame with the frame condition number of the M1. And so it looks like this when you do it for GLN Rn squared. I will just go ahead and simplify that to the case when n is equal to 2. So we're looking really at L2 of R4, and I've drawn a picture of. And I've drawn a picture of if you look in parametric space, then this is SWY space, and the set F looks like that little polygon there in the middle, the dark one. And when you act on it by this set P, these are the translations and dilations of that set. And then we factor out rotations to get. Rotations to get rid of that component in the lower triangle. And that's what we do in general. So we're just taking everything in the orthogonal group to cover the fourth dimension in this case. And so again, in that same paper, we provide this construction as well as the general one on the previous slide where this works for all cases. And so this construction. So this construction here was actually given in that original paper from 2014 or 2013, but we generalized it up to the general case here for A squared. And so this gives us now a concrete construction or a way to build infinitely many concrete constructions of these kinds of discretizations for this particular integral reconstruction wavelength formula. Wavelength formula. And the other thing that's interesting here is we were able to get a bound on m in every dimension, which just depends on the dimension. So here m is less than or equal to 3 to the n, 6 to the n, n minus 1 over 2, or that is coming out of the fact we're just looking at that upper portion of the triangle for a lot of this factorization. This is a really bad bound, so I'll just go ahead and preface it with like this. Ahead and preface it with: like, this is a terrible bound and it's not tight at all. For example, I think when you plug in n equals 2, this gives you something like 54. With just a little bit of analysis in that case, you can bring that down to at least 36. I think it's really somewhere around 28 or 29. But this is still a huge improvement over the previous construction where that frame condition number was about 17. That frame condition number was about 1700, which for numerical algorithms is so large no one would even consider trying to do it. And so, this was one of the contributions in my dissertation was just kind of modifying this construction to try and bring it down to something more reasonable where you actually could go and try and do some numerical implementation. All right, and then just the motivation for how we came up with this tiling system. For how we came up with this tiling system is actually coming out of this decomposition for semi-simple Lie groups known as the Arasawa decomposition, where we can factor it in this Ka in, where K is some compact subgroup, A is some abelian subgroup, and we have a diffeomorphism when we look at just the multiplication map between those three objects. Uh, and if you're familiar at all with numerical linear algebra, which feels weird to say in this room, uh, that actually for matrix groups just corresponds to the well-known QR or QU decomposition, and then you further factor that upper triangular part with an LU decomposition. So you get diagonal matrices in the middle, unit upper triangular matrices for this in portion, and K is that. Portion and K is that orthocom group. So you can decompose matrix groups in this way and we kind of looked at that factorization and tiled each piece individually, discretized each piece individually to come up with that. But we think that this kind of technique could be used for other semi-single e groups. That I have like one minute left, so perfect. Just a couple of comments. Comments, trying to find certain classes of signals where that frame bound can be further improved, and looking at the measure of the overlap of these tiles, you can actually find classes where you can get arbitrarily close to one, which is the best possible frame condition number. And we'll be looking for more natural descriptions of those kinds of function spaces. Or those sets of functions. We've looked at extending this to Sobolev spaces instead of just L2 of Rn squared with some additional regularity. And this is just the Fourier characterization of function spaces. But if you haven't seen Sovalev spaces, it's just functions so that HS would be the space where there are at least S derivatives which are still. S derivatives, which are still L2 functions. We were actually able to show that this construction doesn't work for any of them, which isn't surprising from some of the classic literature, but there are other ways of extending these kinds of decompositions to sobola spaces, which we'll hopefully pursue in the near future. And also, from Milad's talk earlier, we saw this new wavelet transform, continuous wavelet transform. Transform, continuous wavelet transform, and so Maya, Keith, and I are currently starting to work on discretizing this. But that little twist that was in there from Malad's talk about those little extra terms that show up cause a whole lot of problems in how do you actually discretize the space and get the frame bounds to still work out. So, we've started working on that, but it's very early. On that, but it's very early and definitely very different case. So that's it. Thank you all so much for your attention. I'm still getting away this late in the day. Okay, are there any questions or comments? From our Zoom Jason? Oh, sorry. Jason? Oh sorry, do you I mean yeah does this apply to like quantum state topography then? Can you that you see these frames like with coherent states and what's done with coherent states? Can you build measurements? Yeah, so what usually happens in most of these is people look at the affine group first because it's usually the easiest case and then they'll go to like the Heisenberg group representations and try and do this and then it has applications there. So we haven't started on that yet. So we haven't started on that yet, but it would sort of be the next natural step if we just kind of went in the same direction. Yeah. More questions? Yes. Yeah, no, um mine is not a question. Interesting. Uh uh how many cameras is like Um the topic what you were saying. So it was this one you say improvement. Um I was excited to just see what you're doing. Well cool. I'd love to hear about what you did too and we should chat maybe on the hike later. Time for maybe one more question. Online? Am I? If not, let's uh thank Chris again. And next talk is in about two and a half minutes, two minutes. Just try to get full screen if I just command L. Command L. So use staff 11, right?
