which is dependent on time and this a t characterize the root of the connection so basically a i g at time t is equal to one if the eighth connection passes through the node g at time t and equal to zero so it is zero one value stochastic process continuous time stochastic process the state Process. The state of the coefficient AAG at time t depends on the dynamical routing algorithm, which takes into account the topography of the network and the state of the node at time t. So it depends basically on the congestion on the different nodes at time t. So it's dynamically changing. Now the complete model that we consider is given here. Is given here. So we define the vector capital Y capital Un, which represents the level of congestion at each node of the network. So basically, at each node of the network, UG is equal basically to the sum of all TCP and UDP packets going through these nodes at a given time T. So here, H UDP connection is a UDP connection is represented again by this Poisson process, and HTCP connection is represented by the solution of the stochastic differential equation driven by the Poisson process. So this is our model under consideration. Let's see some few comments on the model. So first, remember that UDP connection do not depend on the state of the network. On the state of the network and therefore are independent. So, here again, if you take a look at the UDP or at the process and process that represent the UDP, so the UDP doesn't depend on the state of the nodes of the network and therefore all the UDPs are independent. However, the TCP connection interacts through the conjacent vector, so here we can. Congrats and vector. So here we can see from the model that both coefficient A and B depend on the mode vector Un, so depend on the state of the network at each given time T. So therefore the TCP connections are affected also by the UDP connections before because the UDP are going also throughout the node of the network. So this is interesting interaction. Interesting interaction in the sense that the UDP connection does not depend on the TCP connections. However, the TCP connections do depend on the UDP connections through the nodes of the network. So the structure of the interaction also is changing given the dynamical routing table protocol. So here, remember that the coefficient A, P, and A U here IG, so A, I, G, and Ig, so I g and I g u here are time changing, so they are stochastic processes, and therefore their interactions is changing with time. So it is continuously changing. One of the questions of interest is to study the behavior of the system one when the number of connections get very large. So when we say that the Large. So, when we say that the number of connections gets large, we refer to the sum of all the TCP and the UDP connections. So, basically, the idea is to investigate the mean field property or the mean field behavior of the system. So, first, we will introduce a mean field scaling in order to study the behavior of these systems. So, the mean field scaling. So the mid-field scanning, the goal basically is to get first, so first of all, is to get no trivial scanning limit when the number of connections get large. So goes basically in theory to infinity. So this is done in order to investigate the qualitative property of the corresponding Markov processes. And also, it will reduce the high dimensionality of the systems because here we have basically basically NP plus NU connections. So we have a high dimensional system. Therefore, if we can prove the mean field property of mean field behavior, we will reduce this dimensionality. So the idea, the classical idea in the mean field scaling is to introduce a factor one by n into node vector u n. And this basically n and this basically in practice can be interpreted as that we scale the capacity of the router with size capital n and again is the total number of connections going through the network so the mirfin scaling basically again here what we do is that we replace the vector the original vector u n by bar u n where we introduce this factor so one divided by n and By n. And therefore, what we obtain, we obtain a new form of the mode vector, which is basically given by the empirical means of these two quantities. So the rescued system of the TCP connection is given for each A between 1 and P by these new equations. So these new equations is, so the difference between this one and the first one is that we have This one and the first one is that we have replaced the original mode vector by this new risk covered vector bar Un. So now, given the symmetry between the TCP connections in sense of exchangeability, because all the TCP connections are equal in the sense of exchangeability, so they have they follow the same equations. So we can expect a mean field phenomenon to hold and therefore we. Phenomenon to hold. And therefore, we investigate the convergence of the very scarred system toward a limiting process when the number of conditions get very large. So the first assumption is that there exists two constants which gives the proportion of, or the limiting proportion of both TCP and UDP connections. And obviously, the sum of these two constants should be equal to one. To one. So basically, what it means is that both the number of TCP and the number of UDP goes to infinity, when their sum goes also to infinity. So here we have some hypothesis in order to prove the weak conversions of the scarier system. So the hypothesis are basically done on the coefficient of the TCP equations. So we suppose So we suppose that A and B are lip sheets are bounded. We also suppose that the stochastic process lambda, which will learn the rate of the UDP connections, is also bounded by a given constant. And finally, we suppose that there exists exponential moment for the initial condition of both the TCP and UDP connections. And using this hypothesis, we can prove the following proposition. The following proposition. So we suppose that we have initial or we have converging initial conditions in the sense that the initial conditions are exchangeable and P0 chaotic. So from this hypothesis, we can prove that the limiting process or that the risk carried process converge weakly toward the typical process WT, which is solid. Process WT, which is the solution of these new equations. So, the difference between these equations and the equation or the rescario equation is that we have replaced the rescue vector by this u star, which is given basically by the expectation rather than the empirical mean. So, here we have the expectation of the product between the Between the stochastic process AW and AV rather than the previous restored vector here, where we have here the empirical mean. So basically, this is typically a null of large numbers. So we can prove that this proposition or this result holds. Finally, the The last point is to investigate the equilibrium behavior, or in other words, the long time behavior of the system. So, the idea is that we can investigate the stationarity property of the solution of the SDE of the numerating equations. And we hope that the equilibrium properties of the numerating process are expected to provide a good approximation for the corresponding property. corresponding property for the basic network with narrative finite nodes. So first you have to remember that the Markov process is the Markov process characterized by the limiting equation is not homogeneous Markov process and therefore we cannot use classical theory when we deal with homogeneous Markov processes. Markov processes. Well, here, in order to be simple, we will ignore the UDP flows and investigate the equilibrium behavior of the SEMPFID model without UDP conditions. We will just focus on the TCP conditions. So, basically, we will consider, rather than considering the limiting process, we're considering this sample field limiting process, where basically we don't have UDP connection. You suppose that here we just have TCP flows. We just have TCP flows, and therefore, here this new mode vector, which is just basically equal to the expectation of the product between A and W. So the limiting process WT depends on the joint distribution on Wt and A T, as we can see, because it is basically equal to the expectations. So therefore, since that A and W are interconnected, You are interconnected, so we can think that if there exists stationary distributions, so therefore, the stationary distribution will be a joint stationary distribution for both A and W. And functionally, so far we cannot prove the existence of this stationary distribution. However, if we suppose this stationary distribution exists, and therefore, if we take P as this stationary distribution, and also we Stationary distribution, and also we take p as the initial distributions. Therefore, this quantity or the mode vector will not depend anymore on the time t. And therefore, we will obtain a new equation where u basically is replaced by a constant, a given constant. And therefore, this equation, for this equation, we can prove that there exists under some condition can Under some condition, can prove that there exists a unique stationary distribution. But of course, remember that these results hold just if we suppose the existence of stationary distribution for the limiting process, which so far we cannot prove. As conclusion, we can say that we propose a Markovian model for TCP and UDP connection in TCP and UDP connection in communication network with dynamic routing table. And we have investigated the property of this model. When the number of connections is potentially huge, a mean field result with an adequate scaling is proved in order to reduce the emotionality. So far, we don't have existence and uniqueness result for this testionality distribution. And if we suppose And if we suppose that the joint stationary distribution for W and A exist, then the resulting generic process has a unique stationary distribution. Of course, the big question is to try to pull an interchange of the mark time and the large size gibbet, but this seems to be a hard problem to solve. So I will finish by give you some related literature, some papers. Some papers. And finally, thank you for your listening. And if you have a question, don't hesitate.
