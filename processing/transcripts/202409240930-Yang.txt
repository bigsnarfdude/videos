I will continue yesterday's studies. So maybe I first make about yesterday. So yesterday we studied about the definition of de Broving for Bince Manifold. And it's a complex manifold, and there's a multiplication on the tangent spaces and a unity vector field, Euler vector field, and invariant slight metric. So it's given by this principle. And we also studied intersection form, which is a controversial Which is a contravariant metric. So, and also we look at the flat pencil. So, this G alpha beta are components of this intersection form in flat coordinates of the invariant flat metric, and the eta alpha beta are components of the Of the invariant flat metric. So, in this flat coordinate, so eta alpha beta here are constants. And this gives a flat pencil. So, in this flat pencil, if we give some additional condition like homogeneity. And also plus some the so-called blood exec condition. Then these three conditions will be equivalent to the structure of the Bohm infravenis. So it's equivalent to the Bohm infra Benis manifold and yeah, here manifold. So maybe I but this equivalence, I will not explain the details and we also studied PDEs of hydrodynamic type and in this setup we consider Hamilton. Uh we consider Hamiltonian system plus diagonal leisible. So this these two conditions in generic situation, according to TARF, it gives integrability. And in this setup, we also mentioned Baiham Tunyan or Bai Persung structure. And we have Baiham Tunyan structure, it is equivalent to the flat pencil, according to Dubawinovikov. To Dubawinovikov, it's also equivalent to this side. So, and if we again, if we impose some homogeneity and some flat exact condition, then we will get a Fourier manifold. So in principle, this structure about the Bromin for Winston structure and about the PDEs of hydrodynamic type, they are equivalent. Type they are equivalent. Okay, so we also studied an important notion called the Boeing connection, which is a flat affine connection. Yeah, this is about a review for yesterday. So I will start today's topic by ending the second section about. Ending the second section about PDEs of hydrodynamic type. We will look at more general Boeing Chang normal form. So we have epsilon perturbation, epsilon square perturbation, and so on. So it allows infinitely many terms in this Bohemian Jung normal form. And the basic notions about integrated about conserved quantity or infinitesimal symmetry is the same as before. For example, they say you We say u beta x equals m 0 alpha beta u u beta x plus the same pattern plus dot dot dot. We call it an infinitesimal symmetry if it It commutes with this equation. Let's call it A. So this equation we call it B. So if B T B S B S B T And similarly for conserved quantity, so as far. Which is a local functional is called a conserved quantity or a first integral or conservation law if. If EF ET equals zero. So the definitions about this infinitesimal symmetry and conserved quantity is almost the same as PDs of hydrodynamic type. So we will just skip some, for example, about integrability. Integrable PDE, Hamiltonian or bi-Hamiltonian structure, and so on. So they are all singular. Okay, now we can introduce an important notion in studying these PDs is called. These PDs is called neurat type transformation. So a generalized change of coordinates of this type plus more terms. This type of change of coordinates. Change of coordinates. So, if there's only the first term, it's the ordinary change of coordinates that we all know. But in the study of PDEs of Duval Vincent normal form, so we allow also dependence in the derivatives of U. So for this type of transformation, Type of transformation, we call it MURA. Oh, so sorry, sorry. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. So it's called the Mura type transformation. If this C0, if the first term if the Jacobian between the first term The first term, this gives some functions of u, and the Jacobian is non-zero, never vanish in some open set U. Okay, so and all mura type transformation form a group. We will denote it by G. So, from here, we can see why we want the PDE can involve infinitely many terms. Because here, this neural type transformation, if you wanted to invert this transformation, in general, you must. Transformation, in general, you must have infinitely many terms. And once you have this, when you do transformation between one PDE to another PDE, even if the beginning the PDE has finite number of terms, after the transformation, it has infinite many terms. So when there is, when we allow PDE to have infinite many terms, then there is a group action. This group action is the mura. Is the Mura group? It's a huge group because this is the ordinary coordinate transformation group, and that this group involves more free functions. So it's a very big group. And this group, I will just write briefly. So this group acts on PTEs. PTEs of the Bohemian Chang normal form. It sends a symmetry, sends a symmetry, infinitesimal symmetry to an infinitesimal symmetry. It sends a conservation law. Law or conserved quantity to a conserved quantity and it sends Hamiltonian system to Hamiltonian system. It also sends bi-Hamiltonian system to bi-Hamiltonian system, and also it sends integral system to integral system. And so on. So it's so it acts on this different set of PDEs. And so the general question in integral system is to classify certain Borming-John normal. The Borming-John normal forms in certain setup by Mura. So, I mean, modular Mura group action. So, yeah, so this is about the second part. Now we can move to the third part. So, the third part is about principal hierarchy, the Guomanjiang hierarchy, and some applications. Okay, so b before any questions. So any questions? Yes, yeah, probably, yeah. Yeah, so but the nice thing is that for this manifold can be considered as the one help us to like the normal, the standard form, to make all infrastructure try to match for this manifold. But it's not always possible. Manifold. But it's not always possible. Sometimes F manifold or some other manifolds are also needed. Okay, so let M be a devolving for Wins manifold. And we have mentioned that we have a deformed flat connection, the devolving connection. It's a deformation of the original Lady Tripitak connection. Of the original Lady Tripita connection associated to the invariant flat metric. So then let's consider the flat section of the Warbling connection. So when z equals zero, we know that we have the flat coordinates v1 to vn. So then if we consider the flat section, actually we know that it also corresponds to That it also corresponds to a set of flat coordinates, and they must start with V alpha plus the deformation terms. So let's done alpha n right is analytic at z equals zero. So this theta alpha zero. So this eta alpha zero is V alpha. So V alpha will be, we always use eta alpha beta to raise or lower down the indices. Yeah. So and then we last time, yesterday when we proved the flatness of the Barbing connection, we already write down the differential system for the flat section. For the flat section. So, if we just substitute this answer, this deformation is a deformed flat coordinate. So, when z equals zero, it is the alpha and then it deforms. If we just substitute this answer into the differential system, we will obtain some recursion relations for this theta alpha m. I will write this recursion here, and this recursion will determine all. And this recursion will determine almost uniquely all the theta alpha m terms. Yeah, so I just repeat theta alpha zero equals d alpha. And then from the differential system, if we will find that this recursion equals So starting from theta alpha zero, we will be able to get theta alpha one. And starting from theta alpha one, we get theta alpha two, so on and so forth. So and of course, here there are some integration constants each time. So how do we fix the integrate integration? Do we fix the integration constants? We can first give a normalization condition. We have n such plus sections. So the normalization is one of the normalization is this, and also we have this normalization. So, here, remember our unity vector field V iota. So, in this truth of flat coordinates. So, and also, when there is an Euler vector field, we can also propose homogeneity to these functions, theta alpha n. I will just skip this normalization. Okay, so from all So, from all these conditions, roughly speaking, we can fix these deformation terms. And these deformation terms, we call it calibration of the Frobenz manifold. So, it is related to the given toll S calibration. Okay, so now we have the definition. The principal hierarchy of the Fabrize manifold is defined by the Minister of Life. So we simply use all the deformation terms as the Hamiltonian density and they will generate Hamiltonian flows with the Poisson structure given by this invariant flat. By this invariant flat metric, because we already know if this eight r for row they are symmetric constants, then according to the Bermudian-Wickoff theorem, this will give a Poisson operator. And this zetaf, this theta, beta, n plus one are Hamiltonian densities for these flows. And it is easy to check that all these flows they commute. Commute so they commute each other, commuting flow. So last time we mentioned that for one PDE, we call it integrable if it admits infinite many infinitesimal symmetries parametrized by an arbitrary functions of one variable. And we didn't mention. And we didn't mention that actually, whenever there is such infinitely many symmetries, we can put them together and they actually not just commute with one equation, they mutually commute. So because of this, we put them together and we can consider a solution of all these equations. It's called the integrable hierarchy. And in particular, here we get. And in particular here, we get an integral hierarchy. So integral. So which means this set of infinite many equations, they are mutually infinitesimal symmetries to each other. So, and we are able to solve them together. So, how do we know it is integrable? Actually, there is one way that you can show this set of equations by Hamiltonian. As we mentioned in generic setup, bi-Hamiltonian will imply the Hamiltonian plus diagonalizable, so existence of Riemann invariance. And so, ban Hamiltonian is the stronger structure. And the second Hamiltonian structure. And the second homogeneous structure is given by our intersection 4. Yeah, and in this way, one can show its integral. There are also many other ways you can also directly check they mutually commute. And so you will find that the reason they mutually commute also is Commute also is can be is equivalent to WDVV associativity and some other axiom in for this manifold. So for us, one more property which kind of hidden in history and was motivated by convention theory is that the Hamiltonian densities have another, one more. Have another one more property. We call it the tau symmetry. Tau symmetry is just a name, it's not an infinitesimal symmetry in our sense. The torque symmetry means the following. So the Hamiltonian densities satisfy these identities. So, this is called tau syncry. So, I mentioned that if you do directly the commutativity to check the commutativity, you get the W D V D associativity and axiom A2. So, this cosymmetry, when you just substitute the equation in the In the left-hand side and right-hand side to check, because it's just the easy exercise. So you can try, and this will give, you will find that it is guaranteed by commutative algebra. So because our Fluvin's algebra is commutative, so at each point, the tangent space, we have a Foreven algebra and this commutative. And this commutative implies this power symmetry. Okay, because of the tau symmetry, we know that this alpha m they are Hamiltonian densities and they generate all the flow. All these flows are Hamiltonian flows. And according to Nota theorem, these Hamiltonian densities are also conservation laws for all these equations. So each Hamiltonian density, they are conservation laws. They are conservation laws for, I mean, they are conservation laws for any of these equations. So it means if you solve this system together, this theta beta m is still conservation law. So it's conservation law or conserved quantity. So we call it conserved quantity. Call it conserved quantity for the hierarchy. Yeah, so along each equation, this Hamiltonian, they are conserved. And because of this, we know that the derivatives of this Hamiltonian density with respect to time is they are conserved. So their integral must be zero. So they must be the x of something. The x of something, right? By because we are integration along s1, so it must be a total derivative, and we denote it by and the tau symmetry tells us this omega alpha and one, they are symmetric. And also, their derivatives are also symmetric. So, it's symmetric. So, because of this, we know that for any solution. For any solution For any solution u of there exists a function tau such that Um the second derivative the derivative of log pot with respect to alpha m1 beta m2 equals omega alpha m1 beta m2 the receptive v. So these omegas they are smooth functions. Of the Forebens manifold alpha m1 beta ah sorry, yeah, thank you yes so so because of this uh how symmetry implies this uh set of equations and it tells us for any solution v of pH sorry to Of pH, sorry, to any solution to pH, to the principal hierarchy, there exists a function such as the log of this function, the second derivatives of log tau equals this omegas. So we call this function tau. We call it Genus zero genus zero tau function of the solution. Actually, for some reasons later, we also put epsilon squared for the Euro habit. And the Have it and the log of tau is called the free energy, genus zero free energy of the solution B. Okay, so now let's consider about how do we solve this principal hierarchy and about the solutions of the principal hierarchy. So, because our principal hierarchy is an evolution system, so which means the left-hand side is, so the derivatives with respect to times are only on the left-hand side. And the right-hand side is about a space. Because of this, the solution of the principal hierarchy is specified by their initial value. Which is V of T when T 0 equals X and other time equals 0 is our initial condition and we denote it by F of X. So because here it's easy to check the d dt iota zero equals t iota zero equals d dx. So we identify t one of these times two to the space x. So here, the solutions of this principal hierarchy, they are specifically uniquely specified by the initial data. So it's this fx. Okay. And I will also give a definition of the so-called Riemann map. Of the so-called Riemann map. So once we have a solution and we put key zero equals zero. In this case, we keep t10 to t n zero. And in this case, we get a function of n variables. And this will be called capital V. capital V which is P10 to T n zero and I call this the Riemann map because it's exactly what Riemann how Riemann considers these PDEs he considered PDEs, he considers the initial value and you solve this equation and but you you also keep the the not just the initial value, you also keep some more independent variables and you get a map. It's a map between manifolds. So it's I call it the Riemann map. Actually, this is how the Riemann considering his study about hodographs. His study about hodographs. Yes, I mentioned time-space exchange is another transformation, but it's similar, very similar. But this is what really Riemann was studying. And now comes to the particular, a very special solution called the topological solution. The topological solution is the one that when f, when our initial data is given by fx, tax. So this is the topological solution. It's uniquely specified by this initial condition. And if you use this initial condition, you can solve all these PDEs together. You get our Together, you get our solution Vt is a solution of infinite many variables, and the corresponding Riemann map. In this case, it's extremely simple. The Riemann map is just T alpha zero. So, in this case, the Riemann map is the identity map. Yeah. Okay, so and the corresponding solution, as denoted by V, is called the topological solution. Yeah, and now when we have the topological solution, we will have a corresponding, also corresponding top function. A corresponding also corresponding tau function, and this tau function will be called the topological tau function. Yeah, I've just okay, so so this topological tau function will give the genus zero information of with all the possible descendants for the corresponding theory. So yeah, now this principle hierarchy in principle dissolves about all. Resolves about all genus zero things. So now, what about higher genus? Which one? Yeah, yeah. Yes, this is trivial, but when you substitute, when you consider this as the initial. This is the initial data, you solve all the equations. Here is trivial because I only solved the first n equation. So when I solve t dt10 dt n0, if we solve equation, the first n equations, we get this identity map. But if we solve also m equals one, two, three, four, five, we will get all the information. All the information we want. But there is, because of Riemann's work, there is a nice way to solve this PDs of hydrodynamic type by the so-called hodograph method. So I will not explain that because it's more like an algorithm. So I just say that there exists and yeah, uniquely determined by this initial data. That solution is also easy to. Solution is also easy to obtain. Yeah, but a very huge expression. So, right. So, now the question is, how do we go to higher genus? So, for higher genus, we will look deeper about the flex section of the growing connection. So, in our proof of the flatness of the Barbing connection, we write down already, as we mentioned, the equation for the flat section. And now let's look at more carefully. So, this flat section will satisfy a PDE-ODE system. Of this type. And all these coefficients, C beta, there are some functions on Four Beauties manifold, and the matrix value functions, and this U and mu, they are all given by structure of the Bormin' Four Benefits manifold. And so here, mu in particular, mu is a diagonal matrix, constant diagonal matrix like this. Like this, they essentially they correspond to the in Gunwitten theory correspond to the Hodge reading. So this system in particular, this one, this one, the second star two, it is an ODE system. And this ODE system, it has a function singularity. At z equals zero, and it has a irregular singularity, irregular singular point at z equals infinity. So the axioms of for this manifold guarantee that this two systems are. two systems are compatible and this equation is S monojromic. Because of this we can compute the monochromatic data of this star 2 and at the friction singular point the monogramy data is just given by this mu right but there might be some resonance because of the resonance Because of the redness, the monologued data will be given by two constant matrices. One is mu. Nu is already diagonal. Tells us how the solution change. We will make a small loop around zero. So, but because of the resonance, so at z equals zero, there will be two constant matrices, mu and r. They're both constant matrices. So, in given toes, language is mu and rho. Language is mu and rho, and in commutant theory, this corresponds to Kaprada by the first turn class of the varieties. So and at infinity, it will given by because it's irregular and the Punquary rank is one. And for this, this monogramy data. monogamy data at z equal to infinity will given will be given by two constant matrices is two stokes matrices but because of our more symmetry about u and mu actually we only need one stokes matrix s and the two uh singularities are also connected by a central connection matrix c so these are the all the monologues So, these are all the monogamy data of this S monogamy system. So, why? Yes, why is because I make transpose for simplicity. Yeah. Yeah, it's simply the section, but after transpose, otherwise, the matrix will be the left multiplication. It will be the left multiplication is a little bit not very convenient. This system is from the flat section of the bobbing connection. Yes, yes. So yeah, so from this mu and R, so R, they have the properties Have the properties r alpha can be non-zero could be non-zero only if mu minus mu theta is a positive integer. So this is the resonance condition. And from the constant matrix mu r evolving They construct the corresponding Versor operators and according to the classical work of Dubao in Zhang and independently of Liu and Tian. Liu and Tian, they prove that the topological genus zero tau function can be killed by the in genus zero part can be killed by the result operators. So by Li, I bigger than or equal to minus one. And yeah, so like yesterday we have Li Lj equals I minus J, L I plus J for. That's j for ij. So for the genus zero part is killed by Li for I bigger than or equal to minus one. And now we just impose the following condition. So Li Z equals zero and the log z equals sum epsilon two g minus two. epsilon 2g minus 2fg g from 0 to infinity and fg equals to some capital fg which is v top of t and d v top t dx up to the three g minus two we top Top of t e x d minus 2. And we consider this sequence of equations using these ansats. The result given by Dubai Zhang says that the solution to this system exists and is unique up to overall constant in F1. Yeah, and maybe I can. And maybe I just erase this. Ah, sorry, sorry. Yes, in the semi-simple, yes, maybe I write here. Yeah, we can always consider this set of equations, but when m is semi-simple. So, I didn't mention what is semi-simplicity. So, for this algebra, it's called semi-simple if it didn't contain new potents. And for this manifold, the word for this manifold is called semi-simple if generic points are semi-simple points. Okay, so semi-simple point, which means the tangent space. Which means the tangent space corresponding for this algebra is semi-simple. So when M is semi-simple to Boring and John prove that solution to this answer, this sequence of equations. Sequence of equations, maybe we call it double star. But this is unique and exists and unique up to a pure constant absolute constant in F one, capital F one. So Capital F1. So, yeah. And using this structure, we can construct some deformation of this principle hierarchy, a particular deformation. So we can define u alpha norm equals v alpha plus epsilon square vx dt alpha zero capital F G. So this transformation you see. This transformation, you see, capital Fg, they are functions of V and its derivatives. So if we look at this expression, it looks very similar to a mura-type transformation, but actually it is not. So it's not mura type, but it's a so-called quasi-mura map. Because I forgot to say that this unique solution. This unique solution has polynomial dependence on V alpha 2, V alpha 3, and so on. So, so for when G bigger than or equal to 2. For g bigger than or equal to 2, this Fg has polynomial dependence on the gets, but has rational dependence or yeah, it's a rational has rational dependence in V1. In V1. Because of the rational dependency in V1, this map is not a neural type map, but we call it Causi-Mura type map. And if we substitute, it's like coordinate change. If we substitute this Causi-Mura type map in our principal hierarchy, we substitute this. In principle hierarchy, then we will obtain a hierarchy called the Guangzhou hierarchy. So, I want to mention that in this construction, That in this construction, we only use the Fermin's potential. No other data is needed, just the Fermin's potential. Okay, now let's look at some examples. Okay. So, so far. Okay, so so far, any questions? Yeah. Yes, yes. Yeah, yes, yes, because only when M is semi-simple, we have this existent uniqueness of this solution. We obtain Fg. Yeah. Yeah, the solution Fg or Z exists. So for non-semi-simple case, we don't have. Uh, we don't have uniqueness for the solution, so it's undetermined. Yeah, our principle hierarchy is still there, yes, yes, uh-huh, yeah. We require flat unit, yeah. Oh, yeah, yes, it is recently it is generalized to the case with uh uh without flat unity, yes, yes, by uh John and By John and yeah, his collaborators. Yeah. Yes convertness this, I'm not sure if it's related to compactness. So, semi-simplitis is a very So, semi-simplicity is a very difficult question. In Gumu-Witten theory, by the Worldwide conjecture, semi-simplicity is equivalent to existence of full step reflection in the boundary derived category of the variety. Yeah. So, yes. Okay, now let's finally move to the last part for application. Before application, I also want to add another. I also want to add another remark: is that we construct such a hierarchy by solving the topological solution. But once we have this hierarchy, it's not just for V top. Here we consider V top, but actually for any solution V, for any solution V of the principal hierarchy, we can substitute this V in this map and the corresponding. This map and the corresponding U also satisfy the Born John hierarchy, and the corresponding Fg capital Fg gives rise to categoric Fg and that gives rise to some partition function C, which is not part, which might not be part topological partition function. That partition function is also a top function of the different solutions. This is the main point I want to send. I want to send. So let's look at the example. So F equals one over six, V cube in one dimensional, in this case, V equals V one. And you can solve out explicitly the unique expression. And F two equals the four one one five two. four one one five two v1 square one seven v two v three uh v1 uh cube maybe a here's cube and plus v2 cube 63 v1 4. So these are the unique solution and so on. You can get f3, f4 and so on. And the z, in this case with the topological solution, gives you partition function. solution gives you partition function of GW is the partition function of GW invariance of a point and according to Witten-Kontavich theorem the DZ hierarchy in this case coincides with the KDV hierarchy With the KDV hierarchy. Okay, now we can consider different initial gate data. So in this case, we only have one variable. So Vx equals X is identity map. And in this case, we get a GW invariance of a point. So it's topological. And second, we can consider v equals f equals 4t squared divided by 1 over x square. In this case, this t is Alexander Off coupling constant. So, it is the analog of the Duft coupling constant in GUE. So, this case is for generalized speech doubling. Yeah, I think Professor Nobri will also talk about generalized DGW in his front schedule. So, yeah, so this T. Yeah, so this T is epsilon times N. N is the size of the matrix. And there's the third example. So in all these examples, you can solve the principal hierarchy and substitute this V in the same Fg. All these are the same, and you get the hieroglyphous. Invariance, corresponding invariance. And V. Peterson, the third example is V. Peterson volumes. In this case, you consider by inverse function theorem, the Riemann map is difficult to write, but we can write Difficult to write, but we can write the inverse of the Riemann map. So, in this case, the inverse of the Riemann map is given by this equation. And you use this initial data. So, if you use this initial data in the corresponding principle hierarchy, right, and then you substitute to the same FG, you get the V-Peterson volume. You get the weak Peterson volumes of the moduli space of the Lehman Manver modulized space of curves. So Fg is R universal. So maybe I have a bit of four minutes, right? Yeah, I will give another example. So another example we call example. Another example we'll call example three. So I will skip example two about our spin, but I looked at the more interesting example is example three is the polar. In this case, our Frobenz manifold usually denoted by MP1 and the free energy, sorry, the potential or people call pre-potential or gene zero prime. Or gene zero primary free energy or de Bromin potential is given by, or the Dubrin for Botanical is given by this function, right? So my claim is that all the starting point is this function, and it gives a huge, different huge partition functions. So for example, in original P1 case, our BD Riemann map. The Riemann map is just the identity map. So this is the first one is GW invariance of P1. In GW invariance of P1, you just consider this identity map and you substitute to the corresponding FG, you get the higher genus invariants for. Higher genus invariants. For example, in genus one, this F1 has the following expression. So it's 24 log dv dx square minus exponential u d u d x square minus 24 u. So you substitute in this expression, you get Gw invariance, genus one, g w invariance of p1. One Gw in variance of P1. And the second example is the GUE Gaussian unitary ensemble. In this case, I just write the Riemann map, V1 equals V2, 0, and V2 equals log X, which is log T1, 0. If you substitute this initial data and solve the corresponding principal hierarchy by Riemann's. Hierarchy by Riemann's holograph method, and then substitute to all this Fg, you obtain all heterogeneous GUE free energies. And the third example is LUE, is La Guerre unitary ensemble. In this case, I computed that this Riemann map is given by this. X is simply T10 and V. And V two V two equals log T line zero, T by zero plus A. I'm sorry, it's not very at the corner, but yeah, I hope it's T10 times T10 plus A divided by one minus T20 square block. And this here, A is a parameter. A is a parameter. A is a parameter. So if you use this initial data, and you will obtain all possible growth and function. Yeah, and the last example is JOE. Jacobi unitary ensemble. Jacobi unitary ensemble. So in this case, the VB map V1 equals this is the expression is very long. So I computed it, but yes, and actually it's in collaboration with my co-author. So yeah, we can publish that soon. Yeah, thank you.
