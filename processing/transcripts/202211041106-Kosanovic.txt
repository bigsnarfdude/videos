Thank you, Maggie. And thank you, all the organizers, also for allowing us to follow from virtually. I tried to come to as many talks as I could, but for some I really had to go to bed. Okay, so yeah, Peter's talk was a really nice introduction for mine. So I'll just go into a bit more details. Just go into a bit more details and basically talk about, as Peter mentioned, these two papers. So, first, I wanted to briefly give you a guide to these two parts of what was initially one paper. So, in this high D paper, as we call it, we do study general D-dimensional manifolds and embeddings basically of K-disks with. Basically, of k disks with this given boundary sphere in the boundary of the manifold. And then we use this notation mg. Yeah, so we have a dual that also lives in the boundary. And then we have this mg, it's a space when you attach a handle. But it's not going to be so important for the rest of the talk. It's just a quick review. So, yeah, so we study the space of disks in M, and as Peter explained, And as Peter explained, this can be the looped to a space of k minus 1 disks in mg with a certain epsilon augmentation, so a bit more data than just the embedding. And then the second kind of part of that paper is to use DAX's work to compute the first interesting homotopy group of that space. By interesting, I mean the first one which is different than that for immersions. And this score. Emergence. And this corresponds to going to the second stage of the Goodwilly Weiss tower. So emergence is the first stage, and then you have to go for this homotopy group, you have to go and look at a second stage. And in the 4D paper, we concentrated on four manifolds and two disks. So in this case, we just have a circle in the boundary, and then a circle has a dual sphere. And then we can compute. And then we can compute this set of isotopic classes of disks. It comes actually with a group structure and it recovers results for spheres and it's related to the mapping class group. So these are like some contents of this paper and I'll talk a bit about that. So I'll concentrate on this, the relation to the mapping class group in this talk, and also at the end, I'll sketch how this is related to. Sketch how this is related to what you might know as the Liebald trick for spheres. Let me just mention that although Peter said that as low-dimensional topologists, you should look at this paper, I also do think that it's this knowing this in general can also be interesting further than this application. So, for example, you might try to put D. might try to put d equals to five and see what kind of classifications of disks or arcs or spheres in five manifolds you can get. And since this conference is also called topology in the mention 4.5, I wanted to mention that because there are some settings where you can basically relate this to concordance as well. So in concordances, there are also some kinds of I mean, concordances are also some kinds of embeddings, and there is a way to, you know, when you take a phi manifold to interpret that. Okay, so here is the plan. I'll talk about the setting and then about these results, about mapping class groups, and then about spheres a bit. So, what is the setting? So, this will be similar to Peter's talk, but maybe a bit reversed. So, I'll actually start with just any smooth Just any smooth four-manifold with boundary, and I guess it's oriented and compact, but I don't know, we just didn't think much about what if it's not. So let us say that the goal is to study diffeomorphisms of X that are identity on the boundary. And as we heard in this overview talk that we had, not much is known about diffeomorphism specific. Diffeomorphism space, but also not about the mapping cause group, just the pi zero of this space. So I'll denote that by square brackets. So the idea that's crucial for our approach is that in this very general for manifold x, we fix that arc u. So similarly as Peter was had a similar picture. Had a similar picture. So, if I fix a neat RQ, I want to study diffeomorphisms that fix its tubular neighborhood. So, the tubular neighborhood here is like, I denote it as H1, and I think of it as a handle that I want to remove, like a one handle that I want to remove from X. So, okay, so neat means exactly that I'm transverse to the boundary, the Zarc is transverse. Transverse to the boundary, its arc is transverse and intersects the boundary of two points. And actually, I will also pick U, which is homotopic into the boundary. So there is some homotopy maybe fixing endpoints that pushes U into the boundary. So you can just think of, you know, you had your big manifold X, somewhere in the boundary, you pick two nearby points and like a short arc in X between them. Okay, so that was X. And now, if I think about the complement of that tubler neighborhood or of that handle, that's what I'm going to call the manifold M. In this manifold M, I have this parallel push-off, this green arc U plus, coming from pushing my arc U into the boundary of this handle. And I can also observe by my, yeah, so somehow. Yeah, so somehow I also want to pick now this other arc that connects these two endpoints. That's this purple, U minus. And I can do that so that U minus union U plus is now homotopic in M. This was by my assumption, basically, that U will be homotopic into the boundary of X. Okay, so this is exactly like in this picture. And moreover, we have this dual, namely, u had a meridian sphere in x. So now that's exactly going to be this g which intersects u plus in one point. And this is what we call a dual. It's just a sphere in the boundary of M, which intersects my sphere. In this case, it's just a circle, my circle K in My circle k in exactly one point. So that's one observation that my u plus has a dual, that my actually k has a dual. And the other thing is that k cannot be null homotopic in the boundary of m. Okay, that's just something to observe. So it cannot be null homotopic precisely because, I mean, it has a dual. Okay. Okay. But okay, K is now homotopic in M and it has a dual, and then there is this usual trick how you use that to prove that you have an embedded disk, so this orange disk that K bounds. And this is that you know that K is non-homotopic, so there is an immersed disk, and then for every double point that you have, you can use your dual to tube it away. So this is simply. Q-bit away. So this is similar to what Peter was doing with half disks. It's just now that we also remove this handle. Okay, and what we will consider in this setting for this manifold M is the set of disks in M with this fixed boundary K up to isotopy. And so that I also denote by this square bracket. That means that I'm really thinking about the components of the spatial embedding. Of the space of embedding, so disks up to I2B. Okay, are there any questions about this setting or the two settings? Okay, yeah. So here's a couple of observations about X and M. So first of all, it's that when we started with X, it was an arbitrary form manifest. With X, it was an arbitrary four-manifold, but now M is of special shape. It can be written either as a boundary-connected sum or a connected sum with D2 cross S2. So that requires a bit of thinking, but basically this D2 will correspond to this disk U and this sphere will correspond to G. And other way around, you can recover X by Can recover X by attaching a tree handle to G. So exactly in this picture, you just want to fill in this handle that you removed, and it really corresponds to just attaching the tree handle back to G. Okay. So plan is that what we're going to try to do is relate the mapping class groups of M and X, and we will see that they are related to the Light Bulb trick. See that they are related to the Liebald trick for disks that Peter talked about. And in the end, I wanted to talk a bit about spheres, which is not exactly related to this, but okay. Okay, so here is the first alema about these mapping class groups, actually about diffeomorphism groups. So, first of all, remember that M Remember that M, that I can obtain X by gluing a three handle to M. So I have this inclusion. I can include diffeomorphisms of M into X just by extending by identity over this handle. Similarly, if I remove from M the neighborhood of my disk, remember the orange disk U, if I just remove it, I have some other manifold with boundary. And then I can And then I can extend over that neighborhood of U to get a diffeomorphism of the whole M. Okay, so I have these two inclusion maps. And when I compose them, I actually see that the image of this composition is this subspace, which I really define as the image. So these are all diffeomorphisms of X, which are identity on. Which are identity on U and on H3. Okay, so here this is a typo. This should be neighborhood of U, but you can think of it also as a tool handle. And this is a hint how to prove this lemma. So the lemma says that, okay, this diagram commutes. And moreover, these maps are homotopy equivalences. So what you should take from here is that, so although the feromorphisms of M include into diffeomorphisms of M include into diffeomorphisms of X, actually diffeomorphisms of X are homotopy equivalent to diffeomorphisms of M minus U. So as a corollary you get that say on mapping class groups you get surjection from M to X and it also splits. Okay it basically splits by inverting this homotopic equivalence and then including back. So that's a splitting of this map. So that's a splitting of this map. So that's first interesting thing to observe: how you can relate these mapping class groups. And our goal now will be to determine the kernel of this surjection. So it's really a surjection of groups, and we are just seen in the kernel. And we will see that the kernel is related to the set of disks in M. In M. So I need for that to discuss a bit these disks in M, but conveniently Peter already did some work. So we have this short exact sequence where here on the right. So I'm looking really at disks in M. So you should have this picture in mind. So I'm looking at disks which have the same boundary as this U, and U is something. And U is some fixed disk that I chose at the beginning, and it's like my fixed embedding, like a base point. And U stands for unnot. It's just a name. So we are looking at all disks that we can fit here up to isotopy. And that's related to pi 2 of x. And here we have some quotient of the group ring. So let me tell you a bit about this. So, first of all, pi just denotes the fundamental group of m. And yeah, if you're confused about okay, here I have m and here I have x, well, pi 2 of x, precisely because we saw that x is obtained from m by attaching a tree handle, it's easy to see that you're just killing g, all the multiples of g. This is a comma. Yeah. This is just g, and we kill all the multiples in the. kill all the multiples in the second homotopy group of G. And then Zπ is just the group ring and when I will also need this reduced thing where I take out the trivial group element. So this is the set of all linear combinations of GIs which are non-trivial. And then I think although this is a group ring, now I just have an abelian group. Group ring, now I just have an abelian group. So I just think of this as an abelian group. Okay, so let me tell you what this, we call it the little dex, because we have a capital DX and this one. So the little dex is a homomorphism from the pi 3, so the third homotopy group of your four-manifold, to the Sabelian group. And let me tell you how to compute it. So you first start with a class. A class in your homotopy group, and you want to represent it by a tree sphere, which has a particular shape. Namely, you want to foliate this three sphere by arcs. And so it's a tree sphere, so you can foliate it by a two-parameter family of arcs. Okay, and the way I think of this is that you fix endpoints, and then you go. Endpoints, and then you go around and swing your arc across your S3. So, with these endpoints fixed, so you want really them to be always the same. And they will be, you can by some count of dimensions, you will see that most of these arcs will be embedded. So, only at finitely many times t the arc F T will be immersed. Will be immersed. Okay? And then the x of that class is just a sum of sine double point loops of those arcs. So this appeared when Dave Gabay was presenting the X invariant. The point is now that you just have an arc, and on the arc, you have the direction. So you just go to the double point, you go around the double point loop, and then you go back. So this is. So, this is how to compute the X invariant. And this foliation, the reason that this is relating to this foliation is also, okay, so Peter skipped talking about this, but I just wanted to mention that this is maybe what Ryan calls a scanning map. So, you take a map or an embedding and then you scan it by lower-dimensional manifolds. But I don't know, we prefer to call it foliation. Call it foliation because there is the name scanning is also maybe overused, and it's used for some other things in geometric topology, for example in smoothing theory, where it's slightly different. So we call this one a foliation map, but it's basically the same. Okay, and okay, so this sequence is a consequence of the fact that we proved that We proved that disks up to isotopy is actually the fundamental group of the space of arcs. And then Dex tells you how to compute this. But now, because this is a group, you see that this has a natural group structure. And Peter talked a bit about what the commutator is and so on. So that also this sequence is an exact sequence. Okay. Are there questions about this slide? Are there questions about this slide? It's a lot of information, but somehow I wanted to consider other things in my talk, so I wanted to summarize this and maybe also mention how we think about this DEX invariant. Ah, yeah, one important thing I wanted to mention is that, for example, this thing is defined for any four-manifold. And this is what Peter showed you in the last slide. It's just, you could think of this as an invariant of a four-manifold. It's just It's just some homomorphism from its third homotopy group to some abelian group. And I studied this in another paper where I tried to compute as many things as I could about this. Also in other dimensions, but in particular in dimension four. And there are some, I think, open problems that are interesting there, computing it for some four manifolds, seeing whether it can see s something more about the four manifold. Something more about the four-manifold than just homotopy type or so. Okay, so back to mapping class groups. So this group now of just so this group has some This group has a subgroup which we define as those disks K that on the boundary circle K have the same framing as our disk U. So it's just some framing condition. It's not very important. This basically differs by a Z from this group. So you can define this as a kernel of Kernel of some Euler number. I need it because this is exactly what the kernel will be. So the difference between mapping class group of M and the mapping class group of X will exactly be the set or the group of disks in M up to isotopy. And as we saw already this part, that this is a surjection and that it splits. Splits and now we actually have the complete extension and we can also describe how this bottom group acts on this kernel. So what you do is you take a diffeomorphism of X and then you take a disk here, K and you want to get another disk, right? So this other disk is obtained by applying the following diffeomorphism to Applying the following diffeomorphism to K. So you just push your diffeomorphism from here to the middle and then you apply light to K. So this gives you a new disk that's exactly going to be the action. And then you can study because of this action, you can kind of figure out examples where this is not trivial and so this semi-product is not semi-directed. So this semi-product is not, semi-direct product is actually not a product. Well, we didn't yet try to quantify how rarely, but yeah. So that's one thing, that's this extension. And yeah, I'll say a bit more about this map, I think, in the next slide. But one way to understand it is to study, you know, you take a disk here and you want to see what. Here, and you want to see what is the diffeomorphism that you get of M. So the diffeomorphism AM of K, it induces the identity on the fundamental group and you can compute it on pi 2 classes. And on pi 2 classes, this is something Peter calls transfection formula. I'm actually not sure why. But what it does is you take this class F, this sphere, and you subtract some multiple of the sphere G. So G is also a sphere in your pi 2 of M. And what multiple you take, it's determined by this equivariant intersection form of M. So you will take, as input, it takes two spheres. Well, one sphere is your F and the other sphere is your F and the other sphere is you take your K union this minus of the U of the disk Q so the two discs are glued together so this is how how this how maybe you can you know try to study this diffeomorphism A of K this is how it acts okay Okay. So I have a couple of remarks. So for example, first is that if you take K, which is homotopic rel boundary to U, so namely it comes from that DAX kernel, then this AM of K lies in a sort of a Torrelli subgroup. So what I mean by a sort, Torrelli should mean maybe acting trivially on homology, well, usually. Really on homology, well, usually, I don't know, in simply connected case at least, you say it's acts trivial on homology. But this one we know acts trivial on pi 1 and pi 2. So it's some sort of a Torrelli subgroup. And yes, so as I mentioned, M is a sort of a stabilization of X. So this means that, you know, Uh, you know, I said M is either a boundary connect sum with S2 cross d2 or a connect sum. So you can think of this as a stabilization in the world of manifolds with boundary instead of stabilizing with s2 cross s2. And then you can actually relate this result that I showed you to techniques of Wall when he has this famous theorem that he constructs diffeomorphisms. Of the, you know, he takes the stabilization of a simply connecting manifold. So a simply connected manifold connects some S2 cross S2. And then he shows that you can realize every automorphism of the intersection form of that. But the way he, you know, he shows that, I mean, there are many steps, but one step is really to construct some diffeomorphisms. And the way that he does that is really related to what we saw here, so to this map. Here, so to this map. Yeah, so this paper that I mentioned on the Dex invariant, I have a little summary of this. So a bit more about maps. So the map I is induced from the inclusion, so of diffuse of N into diffuse of X, and its section is induced from this composite. Induced from this composite, as I already mentioned. Whereas this map A, so A actually stands from the ambient isotopy extension, and that's the inverse of that foliation map. So what it does is you take a disk K, you first glue minus U to K, and then you foliate it by one parameter family of parts. So now you think of. So now you think of this one parameter family of arcs foliating this sphere. But you think of this as an isotopy of one arc. And whenever you have an isotopy of a sub-manifold, you can extend it to the ambient isotopy, so isotopy of true diffeomorphisms of the manifold, and that will end up in some diffeomorphism. That end diffeomorphism will fix. Will fix U and actually the whole handle H1 and that's a diffeomorphism amu of K. And in particular, that diffeomorphism will take U to K. Because when you think about this, what does it do to you? Well, it first will swing back on minus U, and then it will swing. And then it will swing on K, right? So U will first get contracted close to the boundary, and then it will get extended to K. So you can see this very explicitly, what happens. Okay, so here's, I wanted to do an example, and it's actually maybe it's perfect because Ryan gave his talk just before me or before us. So I'll do. Are before us. So I'll do the barbel diffeomorphism as an example. So I guess it's already in what Brian said, but maybe just to fit it into this picture, you just take x to be d2 cross s2. Okay? And then in x, you pick a little arc that you remove. And that's how you get m. So now you get this other factor of d2 cross s2. factor of d2 cross s2 basically from from that other arc that you removed. I mean you can think of x also as d4 minus 1 arc and that's what the point of view that Ryan had. So he thought about the barbell as d4 minus 2 arcs. But in this picture, okay, this is x, this is m, then what do we have? Well on one hand we have this extension Ah, we have this extension where you relate diffeomorphisms of m to diffeomorphisms of x, where the kernel are embeddings of d2 into your manifold. This is the ambient isotope extension map that I just explained. On the other hand, if I want to compute this, well, then we have this Liebulb trick theorem. So we, in this, this is an example of a setting with a dual. Of a setting with a dual. Because you're trying to embed D2. Basically, you know, your boundary condition is the same as this boundary condition, D2. So your U, for example, is D2 cross a point in this factor. And then you're trying to see what other embeddings you have with that same boundary. So this has a dual, namely this is two. So this, you have the extent. So this, you have the extension for that. So it's a group where here you take pi 2 of x. This is just z. And here we have that quotient here. And then it's not hard to see that this is just going to be z, I mean, because we don't have a fundamental group, it's just quotient of z. But then to go to embeddings, embeddings with a zero, so the ones with the trivial ones with a trivial Euler number, that z will also disappear. So what we'll have is that the embedding zero is just this z and this is what we get. So diffeomorphisms of the Barbel manifold is an extension of this guy by z, and the barbel diffeomorphism is exactly the image of one. And you can see what this map A does. So that's this map A. Oh, sorry, this is a type of. These maps here are wrong. I just copied, but here we should be, you know, it's this other extension. Here it's like, yeah, okay. So the element one is the variable diffeomorphisms of Badne and Gabi, and it's obtained as follows. Where does the Z come from? Where does this z come from? It comes from pi 2 of this, so it basically comes from this sphere s2. And then going through what I said, you see that what you take as so I define AO1 as this ambient isotopic extension with respect to U of K, where for K, so for U I take just the standard. Just the standard disk, as I said, in the first factor. And for the K, I take the connect sum, so the unconnect sum of this u with the sphere of the other factor. So I didn't draw the picture for this, but maybe you can remember one of Ryan's pictures. So you have that disk U is in one factor, and then you go and connect some into the other sphere in the other factor. Sphere in the other factor. And when you ambiently extend this, you get the variable diffeomorphism. Okay, are there questions about this? Okay. So I wanted to at the end to talk a bit about spheres with a dual, also because Aru talked a bit about A bit about this in the other session. And I wanted to maybe clarify some things: how Friedman Quinn is related to the X. Since it somehow appeared in different sessions. So I had this urge to connect it. And it's not really related to mapping class groups. So we can, so let's first recall what this result. First, recall what this results Leibalb trick for spheres of Dave Gabay and Rob Schneiderman and Peter Teichner is. So I'll state the latter version, the complete classification. So if you have a smooth oriented four-manifold N, and you have a framed sphere in its interior, then you want to consider the set of all spheres which are dual to that one fixed. Which are dual to that one fixed g. Okay, so now we have an n-manifold, it can have boundary or that does not have boundary, it's not important. Now G is in the interior. It's a framed sphere in its interior, embedded. And we look at all other spheres that are dual to G, up to isotopy. And then if F2TN is the, you know, you take the field of two elements and you just Field of two elements, and you just take Tn is the set of two torsion elements in the fundamental group. So you take this and you consider it as an abelian group. Then their theorem says, well, it can be reformulated as follows. The set of such spheres with dual G is related to, so what you can do is you can take homotopy classes. Can do is you can take homotopy classes. So, here I didn't explain actually this notation, but these are homotopy classes of spheres in N which have G as an algebraic dual. It's not so important. Important is that spheres which are homotopic are in the kernel of this map. Okay, so, or maybe better to say, are in the pre image of zero. Because for now, we don't have a group structure on this, we just know that this is a set. Is a set. So I just look at what goes to zero here. In other words, what is homotopic to some fixed sphere. But this first term is you take the quotient of this abelian group by this mu3 invariant, which can be thought of as like a Friedman-Queen invariant of three spheres. And so this is your kernel. So to determine whether two spheres Spheres which are homotopic are also isotopic, you just need to compute the Friedman-Quinn invariant. And our notation here means that you can also explicitly determine that, as Peter mentioned, this geometric map. So, the action. So, here you maybe fix one sphere and then you can act by elements here, and that's given by this finger moves and then. And then tubing into the dual. But then Friedman Queen is the inverse. Okay. So that's the statement that I had. And then I want to explain a bit how you obtain this from the case of disks. So So, right, so I still have this fixed manifold, four-manifold n and a dual g in the interior. So, what I'll define, I'll take n minus a neighborhood of g as my manifold m. Okay, so here is here is g, g is in green, and then I just, you know, I just drew this like thickening of g. I see Mg as this disk, so the meridian disk to G is this disk here, this little interval. And its boundary I denote by K. So once I remove open tubular neighborhood of G, what remains on the boundary is this black circle. In this picture, it's two points. K. Point k and that's the meridian circle of my sphere. And then I observed that, of course, you know, g was framed, so when I took out this tubular neighborhood, I just got many parallel copies of G in the boundary. And in other words, this circle K has a dual, namely a push-off of G, which I also denote by blue G. By blue G. For example, this one. That's my dual. So once you, you know, you take your closed manifold, you remove a neighborhood of your dual sphere, you are in the case of disks. And you can look at now disks in M with boundary little circle K. And that corresponds to, you know, previously you had this orange sphere R that was dual to the green sphere G. Dual to the green sphere G. But now instead of R, you're really removing this little meridian disk, and you're just looking at embeddings of this orange disk, which has boundary K in this manifold M. Okay. So then this is the connection. So I want So, I want to connect the previous theorem of Robin Peter for spheres to this theorem for disks. So we can really recover this lower sequence by just showing that it's isomorphic to this upper sequence. So we say, okay, you had spheres with duals in N, but what you can do is really consider disks in M and it In M and it will turn out that you have that these natural vertical maps are all isomorphisms. So you will recover this lower sequence. And what's more, you will also recover the maps, you will also identify this Friedman-Queen invariant as really just being the DAX invariant. So let me say a bit more about what the vertical maps are. So here, really, I do the reverse of what I just explained. I just said if I had a sphere R. Just said if I had a sphere R here, when I remove the meridian disk mg, I get a disk. So, going the other way, if I have this just a disk up to here, then I just add this mg and I get a sphere, right? So that's this map, but that's also this map, but it's not important. This is what previously, maybe here I had pi 2 of m or of x. 2 of m or of x, something like this. But okay, so that's how we go vertically here. And let me explain why we have a map like this. Ah, yeah, sorry, I didn't explain this little sigma here. So, this exactly comes from the fact that when we want to compare whether two disks are homotopic, we want to compare them in M and the sequence that M. And the sequence that Peter and I previously showed you always had pi 2 of x here. And that was inconvenient because we don't want to go to x and compare there. We really want to compare here in M. So this square bracket means homotopy classes of disks in M with this boundary. So if you want to take the kernel of that map to pi 2 of m, then you have to go to this different kind of a bit different kernel, namely you have to take these invariants. Take this invariance of this group ring. You know, on the group ring, you have the action by sending g to g inverse. And here you have to take things which are invariant under that action. So then why? Yeah, let me just say this. So this is a crucial observation. If you take invariance, so you take linear combinations, you know, of of epsilon i g i such that you know sum of epsilon i g i is equal to the sum epsilon i gi inverse then that's this this group here then when you mod out by this relation g plus g inverse you really do get just the two torsion and just over a z mod two so this is the maybe crucial thing that to point out and that's how it Out, and that's how exactly how the DAX will reduce to Friedman Quinn in this situation. Namely, in this situation, the little DAX will really produce this relation for us. Because we are in a very special setting, somehow coming from closed case, this relation will always be there. It will always hold. So, it will always be in the image of this. And that means that, you know, when you take this quotient, it's going to be just this quote. Is going to be just this group, and then the rest of the little decks will really become μ3. That's related to actually Peter's favorite theorem that he showed you in the last slide. Yeah, so to conclude, this Friedman-Queen invariant here really can be thought of as the DAX invariant for spheres, but they do have really different origins and they're defined differently. They're different defined differently. And the reason that they agree is that in this case, when you came from a case of spheres and removed a sphere, you really have this case that M is actually not a boundary connect sum, but a connect sum. And when you have a connect sum, then you have the separating three-sphere. And that three-sphere is what causes, because if you remember, that a little dex is defined on. A little dex is defined on three spheres. And this three sphere is what gives you this relation. Okay. And yeah, just to go other way around, you could also define Friedman-Fin directly for neat disks, but only in this case when your disks are, you know, when you're in this situation, when you want to embed disks as this factor, only then will this be a complete invariant. Otherwise, you Invariant. Otherwise, you have to use Dex. Dex is the stronger invariant. Okay, I think that's it. Yeah, thank you. At the very end, and you said that's the only situation in which it's a complete invariant. Do you have an example where it doesn't distinguish to this or like a past? Doesn't distinguish to this, or like how do you know it's not a completed thing? So, yeah, I mean, basically, you can find examples of maybe not on top of my head, but I guess like any like any example where M doesn't really have pi 3. And so you know that you don't get this at all definitely. And then you know that what you actually have here is precisely things of the shape. things of the shape G plus G inverse. That's one type of the generator. And another type of generator is G, which is two torsion. So G squared is one. So this group is generated by those two types of generators, whereas this one is just generated by the second type. So this is bigger in general. Okay, yeah. But I think, I mean, it's still true that when you reduce the X modulo, this, that it is equal to. Or this, that it is equal to Freedom and Fein. It's still true. Yeah. I have a basic question. So UQAP setup is for both these DAX and FriedmanQuinn is upgrading homotopy to isotopy. But as I understand it, the DAX invariant is an isotopy invariant. An isotopy invariant and Friedman-Quinn is concordance. And so, in this setting, are you showing that those three relationships all coincide? So, the way that I think about this, that's a good point. Yeah, I mean, Friedman-Queen invariant is an isotope invariant when you think about this question of, you know, you have two spheres with the same dual. And then it's really classified, and you know that they are homotopic. Classify, and you know that they are homotopic. Then Friedman Queen is a zero if and only if they are isotopic. But it also can be used as a concordance invariant in some other settings. For example, that's what Michael Kluk talked about, right? He had a setting where only one sphere had a dual and he wanted to determine whether they are concordant. And there it was a concordance invariant that you can. It was a concordance invariant that you can use there, yeah. And maybe you know, you don't have a frame dual and so on. So it's like it's some other settings where this invariant still shows useful, but in this setting, it's really an isotope invariant, as well as DAX. DAX is an isotope invariant for disks. But actually, I mean, we tried in our papers to distinguish between these two DAX invariants. You can also think of DAX invariant as an invariant of families of arcs. That's how it originally arrived. That's how it originally arises. It says that in the setting, and then it's defined for any four-manifold. For any four-manifold, you take arcs in it, and then you take the fundamental group of that space, and the x-invariant is invariant of that. But then when you have a dual, when you're in this setting, then this set is the fundamental group of space of arcs. So that's why the DAX in. So that's why the DAX invariant classifies. Okay, thanks. But maybe another answer to this question was that the DAX invariant is only defined when the disk is already homotopic. So homotopy is one thing. And if they're homotopic, then the Dax invariant is defined. And isn't it true, Danitza, in the setting of this rule, that the Dax invariant is an isotopy invariant? And then when you go down to the Friedman quinn, so you model by In quin, so you model by G plus G inverse because they are always realized by these. Yeah, and then it's a concordance in there. Yeah, so I think we have all three things here in the game. Yeah, you could see that way. Yeah. And three and sin gives you concordance and X gives you isotope in the setting. Isn't that good? Yeah. Yeah, I think, I mean, that's actually related to what I said in the beginning. If you want to go to dimension five, yeah, there is a way to interpret. Dimension five. Yeah, there is a way to interpret, you know, for example, you have your DAX invariant of disks, but maybe for some reason you want to go down, you want to reduce module disks. Then you get a Friedman-Queen invariant, and you can ask, oh, what does Friedman-Queen classify? And it classifies precisely concordance classes of these disks. And one way to see this, which is maybe complicated, but it's that what you do when you go down is you kill G plus G inverse. G inverse and G plus G inverse are precisely those self-feeding disks that Dave Gabay has. And those are concordant. You can see that they are concordant very easily. Because what they look like is like you go over a group element and then you put your tube into a meridian of what you already have. Maybe I should have a picture of this. picture of this but this has a dex invariant g plus g inverse so it has a frequency invariant trivial and you can see that they are concordant because there is a concordance given by take a disk take a sphere on on the side and then a tube is born connecting them so there's like a concordance between them yeah yeah so it's very nice i don't know like i really like that Know, like, I really like that when we figure out that this quotient tree is really what puts them together. Stop and think and yeah. Thank you. Thank you, organizers. Yeah, sorry you couldn't come, Danitza, but hope you're doing well, and thanks for giving your talk anyway. Well, and thanks for giving me talk anyway. Hope to see you next year.
