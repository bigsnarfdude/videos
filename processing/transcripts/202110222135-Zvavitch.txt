Hi, hello everyone. Let's start with our last talk of the conference. It's going to be given by Arten Zivamic from Kansas State University. He's going to talk about some such estimates in karmics geometry. Please. Thank you so much, Jung, and thank you for organizers for inviting me. I really hope that one day we will. One day we will be able to have a conference face to face, and it's going to be a lot of fun. So, I will talk about some just estimates of the measure of Misdkovsky sum, to what the sumset estimates words. And so, I will usually 99% of the talk will talk about very convex sets. You can even think about them as a bodies, so they're compact sets with non-empty interior, also, non-empty interior. Also, non-empty interior will be usually not required, but they're going to be convex and compact, so very, very nice. And by absolute value, I will denote just the volume to save some space. So sometimes I will write the dimension here, but I usually will forget to write which dimension is it. So, and I remind you what it Minkowski sum. So, it's just Minkowski sum of two bodies, two sets. You take K and L, you pick a point in K, point in L. Pick a point in K, point in L, and you add them up. So, the inequalities that I want to talk about come in a bit quirky but very nice way. So, some years ago, Sergei Babkov and Makshay Madiman developed quite a cool technique how to jump from entropy inequalities to inequalities in convex geometry. And so, using this technique, one can create some very nice conjectures. Some very nice conjectures, or even create some inequalities. So, for example, this is an inequality that they proved, and this is something that I will talk about quite a bit, and we'll try to show you why it's interesting and natural. So, I mean, and the inequality says the following is let A and B1 BM be convex bodies in Rn. Then we have such a cute things about volume. So, A in the power, volume of A in the power m minus one times. A in the power m minus one times volume of a plus the whole sum of whatever left is less or equal, some constant product of a plus b each of the bodies. So if you can say see a here plays some special role. So this is main convex body in this inequality and everybody else dancing around it. But we will talk about it a bit later in a much more detailed form. I also wanted, so I said that I will. I also wanted, so I said that I will talk about Konwick's boys, but there is one question that they created, Sergei Makshai, together with Weng. So, the question that I really love, and I just couldn't not to say it. So, this is the following question that if you have not convex now body, just for a second, not convex if a not body is set, and you added m times. So, how it compares with averaging it m plus one time. So, this is, I mean, looks like the most easy questions. Looks like the most easy questions that one can ask. And you know, all this convex geometry is the only problem that it's not solved. So, even for two bodies, so if you add two sets together, and does it increase, decrease comparing to adding three sets together? So, I will even will not, because I talked about this quite a bit, I will not remind you why it's interesting. I think it's interesting just because you can look at it and it's interesting. It's something that should be solved. And so, for example, with And so, for example, with Matteo Frededelitzi, Mac Shea, and Arnaud Mercimbleti, we solved it in dimension one. And here it's because I will talk more about upper inequality, essential to say that the idea of solution was actually borrowed from additive combinatorics and from work of people in additive combinatorics. And so, what also interesting is that this inequality is actually, I mean, between two and three is actually not true. Two and three is actually not true, starting from dimension 12. And so there is quite a gap. So we have no idea about dimension two, for example. Yes, the only thing, just to finish this story, is that if you go to dimension two and three, but say that A, a star shape, then there you can actually solve it. And from dimension four, you can also solve it. But there, there is also a gap you need to ask that's M, so the number of the sets is large in some way. So the Some way. So, the only reason I'm showing it to just to remind you that something like this is very cute and you can work on it. And that is a type of inequalities that can be produced by inspiring by inequalities in fact in information theory. So, back to our story. So, again, from now on, everything is as convex as it gets. And here's the question. And so, what is also interesting is that you can look at it, forget about story. Forget about the story about Sergei and Makshay and say that that was more inspired by additive combinatorics, and so how you can see it. So, there is also a very famous Plunker-Rouger inequalities. So, for example, this is one of them if you have sets A, B1, BK. And so, if you try to imagine, say, I mean, we're in a simple way when you intersect with integer lattice or something like this. So, you can also talk about. Like this, so you can also talk about commutative groups. But there is one set which is main, this A, and say nothing is empty, and so you know that A plus H B I is bounded by the number of elements in A times some multiple, which depends on I. Then you actually can find a set in A such that you can create such a bound. And if you look for a bit, look for a bit, then I mean, you recognize that alpha one, alpha k is this. Alpha 1, alpha k, this product, I bet I would denote k by m, it would be nicer. And then you will see the product of a plus bi on the right. So this is very similar. And there is no a to power m minus 1 or in the power k in the left because it just cancelled in this inequality. Yes, I only left those multiples alpha i. So it's very, very similar to what Sergei and Makshay proved or proposed. Okay. Proposal. Okay, so I'm even more interested in a more simplest case of this inequality. So let's talk about inequality. And here I wrote ABC. This is a misprint. I haven't noticed. I'm very sorry. So, but let's talk about inequality like this. There are three sets, A, B1, and B2. And you add them, A plus B1 plus B2. You multiply by A, and you're curious, I mean, how to bound it with A plus B1 and A plus B2. And so from the inequality that's And so, from the inequality that Sergey and Maksha proved, it's 3 to the n, because if you substitute m equals 2, 1 plus 2 is 3, and that's what you get. So, there are many questions. 3 to the end sharp, for example. I mean, hopefully not, because if you look to the previous inequality, you really want it to be number one. We'll see that it's not true. And this is we'll see it soon, but you really want it to be one. And I mean, you want it one if you look to this edge. You wanted one if you look to this additive combinatorics idea. You look at one if you hope, but I mean in three to the end, in some way it's a payment for using the ideas of jumping from information theory to convex geometry that you pay if you do it directly. So, there are many reasons why you want to remove it just because if you remove it a little bit later, but for example, if you take a But for example, if you take log of this inequality, then it looks also very interesting and represents something that's called some modularity. So, in this particular case, log submodularity of volume. So, it would be really, really much nicer if this n log 3 would not exist. One of the other questions that I can ask, so if, and we will see, if this 3 to the n impossible to remove for general class of Conrig's body. General class of convex bodies. Probably you can create some cute class of convex bodies, useful class of convex bodies for which this constant can be removed. Okay, but let's move forward. So that's what Babkov and Madiman proved. So what can we do? So to first to stay what we can do, let me kind of denote that the best constant that you can reach here for any A, B, and C is if you divide left-hand side by the right. You divide left-hand side by the right-hand side, yes. So, this is this is the constant that I'm trying to estimate. And I mean, if you take it supramo, so the maximum required constant over all convex bodies, so ABC always convex bodies for me. And now I will denote them ABC because it's just shorter. So, that's what constant that I'm looking for. And I mean, there are many, many questions around here you can ask. For example, Cordard asked the following question. Ask the following question: If you just assume that one of those bodies is if clide and balls and two others are any bodies, can you do something about it? And stuff like this. So, there are again the whole set of the questions that you can ask. So, the first thing that we tried is the following. So, indeed, you can play with this. So, in dimension two, you can show that the constant should be one, and I will actually prove it for you. And in dimension three, you can show that the constant is for sir. Show that the constant is for certain, which is very funny, kind of. And I will also explain why. So there is quite a reason. And in dimension higher than two, I mean, precise constant is about two to power n minus two. So, I mean, you can do a bit better if you play with binomial coefficients more careful, but to make it, you know, understandable of going on, that's the estimates that's possible. For example, if you in Possible. For example, if you indeed assume what Corder asked, if one of them is a ball, then I mean you can show that the constant is indeed one when one of the bodies need you need to assume that it's a zanoid. Another body can be anything what you want, but one of the bodies is xanoid. So by zanoid, I mean, as you all know, I wrote finite, definitely it's an error. It should be Minkowski sum of seven. Be Minkowski sum of segments. So you first define zonotops, which is Minkowski sum of segment, and after zanoid is a limit of zonotops. Very good. What is also interesting and looks strange, especially now, that if you take this main set A to B simplex, then in dimension two, three, and four, you again can show that for this particular case, the constant is one. And so, I mean, this is again quite an interesting. This is again quite an interesting thing, which I will also explain to you why. And so, what I'm even more interested than to show those constants is to explain to you where they come from. So, and I mean, why it's actually very, very interesting. So, what I also should say is that the lower bound was also done by Pyotr Nayar and Thomas Koch. So, this bound, I mean, sorry, which I write three to the four. Write three to the four, three halves to power n over four. So it was also done by Proter and Tony. Okay, let's move forward. So here's a question. How we're gonna solve it? You know, quite naturally, we're gonna use the mixed volume. So we're gonna decompose all of this into mixed volumes and see what we need to prove. Just, you know, with the hands, with our powers, we're gonna decompose it and make calculations. So, a small reminder. So, a small reminder: what is it mixed volumes? We all know that volume is homogeneous of power n, has homogeneity n in Rn, but you know, there is much more. If you take R convex sets and multiply them by lambdas and add up, what you actually get is a homogeneous polynomial in lambda one, lambda r of degree n. And so, here I wrote it, and so those. And so, those coefficients of this polynomial is actually called mixed volumes. So, there are millions, millions of very interesting properties of this guy, and guys, and extremely cool inequalities and stuff like this. And so, just to discuss it would take me really, really a lot of time. So, I will just remind you very basic, most basic properties. So, two. First of all, if you plug all the same, you get a volume, and this is. All the same, you get a volume, and this is more or less if you believe in this beautiful theorem about decomposition of volume, this is easy. And second, that the symmetric in argument, this is also not hard. And third, that it's actually multilinear. So if you put a sum in one of them, you can decompose it. This is a bit harder, but very, very natural. And the last one, actually, the one that I'm gonna use is. One that I'm gonna use is the following: that if you just plug in two bodies and forget about those lambdas, the things that I will not use, then you get this binomial looking decomposition, which is actually binomial. And it's have the following form. And just to make it shorter and look nicer, we agree that when you repeat AI times, I write this A in a parenthesis I, and we repeat B and minus. I and we repeat b n minus i time I write this n minus i. So this is such a notation. So that's actually the formula that I'm going to use. And I'm sorry, I'm going to make it's a little bit hard to read. Please try, but I needed to put the formula just to show, you know, because you always need to include at least some calculations. But I really wanted to show you what's happening. So we are having this inequality. I'm looking for this concept. Equality, I'm looking for this constant CN. I'm trying to make this constant CN as best as possible. Very good. Then we're doing it very, very directly. I'm sorry. We take a left-hand side, left-hand side, and we decompose it. So I look, you know, volume of A, I don't touch at all. And I have volume of A plus B C. So you treat B C as just one set. So you get this decomposition. So, I mean, definitely you can, you could do it in one set. You could do it in one step, but I prefer to do it in two steps. So decompose BC after you will understand in a second why. Now you decompose AB and you decompose AC. And I'm sorry, you simply plug it in. So what, why I haven't decomposed BC? Because from here, we're going to compare those two sums that you created just element by element. And so when I look in the So, when I look in the sum which is on the left, so A times A plus B C, I pick, I fix homogeneity of A. So, I always fix homogeneity of A. And I'm trying, and I'm picking from the right the summons, which has two homogeneities. So, unfortunately, I mean, otherwise it will be absolutely impossible to read. I didn't write for you the product of A plus B times A plus C, but you understand that this product features two. This product features two sums, so I just pick an element. So I'm doing already a step a bit slower. I mean, and maybe losing something. So I compare sums elements by elements. So to prove this inequality that I dream about, it's enough to prove this inequality for sums. So my sums, my goal, actually, now it's just one sum on the right. My goal is to find Cn, which satisfy this inequality for all. This inequality for all k. You remember because I picked summons, I compare only some summons. Very good. And you can guess what I'm doing next. So now I decompose B plus C again using this binomial idea, multilinearity of mixed volumes. You can see it in any way you want. So I'm that here I wrote it for you, just again that you will see what's going on, and that this is actually not drastically hard. Drastically hard. So it decomposes into sums. So here it is. And you know, I shifted the sum on the left by k just to make it easier to compare because here the sum would be on the left till n minus k. So I shifted and we'll see that it's easier to compare. And again, I will compare it element-wise. So we'll compare the elements where A have kind of the same homogeneity or Same homogeneity, or if you want elements for each m for each fixed m, I compare those sums. Now, what I also don't try that when you fix m, you can see that there are some awful binomial coefficients on the left and some other binomial coefficients on the right. So, you take a piece of paper, you start canceling out, and that's what you get. So, to prove this inequality, it just begins those lines, I'm sure. Again, those lines, I'm sure all of you can repeat. There is no much than careful combinatorics, which all of you can do, I'm sure. You just need to open the summon mix volumes and say that you believe that it's enough to compare some corresponding summons and you arrive that to prove this inequality about three sets, so something that was inspired by information theory and this additive combinatorics. Additive combinatorics, you need to prove such inequality. So now, this part I really want to put in a normal font so you can really read it. So, again, the statement is like this, that to prove this inequality about those three sets, it's enough to prove this inequality. So, this I explained. So, we are looking for the best constant Cn, which would satisfy this inequality for all m and j. You see, I mean, I cannot make C. You see, I mean, I cannot make CN dependent on N and J, and definitely I cannot make it dependent on A and B and C, but that's what I'm looking for. I mean, in some cases, if I'll talk about A to be simplex or A to be Euclidean ball or A to be something else, yes, I can say that I can find C N which satisfied for all B and G, J, J, G, and which is the best. So let's see what we can say about this inequality. First, you can say, Artem, it's a joke. First, you can say, Artem, it's a joke if m equals zero and j equals zero. Indeed, I mean, it's just equality, and you can select c n equals one. So, this is very easy, and there is nothing to talk about. But what is absolutely amazing that this inequality glues you with a whole story, which seems at first completely disconnected to the strange inequality. And so, this story for me kind of goes to the following. Of goes to the following way, so let's fix dimension two. Let's talk about dimension two. And so, the question is: what is the best constant C2? So, in dimension two, I mean, I don't care where my, I wrote i and should be m when my m and j are equal to zero. So, I only left with the case m equal j equal one. So only with this case, so in dimension two, and actually it's only one inequality, and here it is. I just substituted. It is. I just substituted, I cancelled out some trivial things, and that's what it is. It's volume of A divided by 2, mixed volume of B and C, less or equal what is the best constant C2, such as less or equal V ABC times mixed volume of AC. So this is two-dimensional inequality. And so there was a moment when it took me quite a long and bloody time with my friend Ivan Sopronov to prove it. An absolutely disconnected story to this. Disconnected story to this. And after we prove it, we actually found out that many. So we Ivan taught me that this is connected with algebraic geometry. And so that's why we said that this inequality and actually upper inequality can be called Bizou inequality for mixed volume. But after we did it, we found out that many, many, many, many, many very bright people done it before us. So I also write here. Before us, so I also write here the names of people who done it, something about it after us. So many people worked on these inequalities. I mean, some of them may have a problem now to recognize it because I have here M, J, and N, but this is exactly what many people try to do in this or another way. And so, for example, with the constant one, it's usually C2, this constant C2 equals one when it's volume of A times volume of mixed volume of B. times volume of mixed volume of B C lesser equal than twice volume of AB times volume of AC. It was proved much before us with Ivan. And so there was a number of works when this was done. So I don't want to read all names. I think you all know them because if I'll do it, I will not have a time to show you what follows. But we actually used those results to show the following. To show the following, that if we use those results about those inequalities, so let me call it bizou inequalities for mixed volumes, then I mean, you can achieve those constants. In dimension two, I literally prove to you precisely that it is one using this two-dimensional result. In dimension three, it's four-thirds, and you need to use this result, which is a generalization of two-dimensional result, which comes from recent. Recent work of Brasidikus Giannopoulos and Leakopoulos. Sorry, and in addition, you need to use a very interesting paper of Jean Hiao, so where he actually provides a best constant for this inequality in many, many cases. And so to prove it in general, you need to use a combination of those two works. But unfortunately, there, starting from dimension four, even the combination of those two works does not give. Of those two works does not give the best possible constant. And the constant that we get, I mean, I approximated it just a bit, but it's 2 to the power n minus 2. So, but what is very interesting is not only the constant, but the way how it's connected to those inequality with mixed volumes. What also cute is that when we worked on this inequality with mixed volume ion, then actually connection is fired by algebraic geometry. Connection is fired by algebraic geometry saying that if A is a simple, then a number, not all, number of those inequalities will become, I mean, with the best constant and very, very nice. So you get what you want. And so that's how we knew that this inequality for three bodies when A is a simplex works with constant one in dimensions three and four. Very strange. Starting from dimension four, we have too many of this inequality. Many of these inequalities for which we don't know that it's how to work with simplex there. And so we don't know if it's constant one when A is a simplex. So this is simply unknown. Okay, so but in general, what is very interesting is the connection to these inequalities for mixed volumes. To show even more connections, let me explain to you how you can get a lower bound. And so this is again not something very high. Something very heart, and as I told you, for example, Pyotr and Thomas, Pyotr and Iar Thomas Koch also did it, but it shows immediately another very, very interesting connection. So, first of all, it's clear that if constant not one, and I already prove, I mean, hinted to you that it's not one, but let's assume that we know that it's not one, then it's gonna be power one. Why? Because it's more or less trivial, because if you have. It's more or less trivial because if you have constant not one, you know that it's not one in two-dimensional n and m, then after constant will multiply, and that's very easy. You just take product sets in Rn and Rm. And I mean, this inequality just works trivially with products. Everything adds up. I mean, it's trivial that constant would multiply this. It's going to be power constant. But now, what you notice next, which is also completely not. Is also completely not cute. That if you keep a, so keep a, I denoted it by k here because I wanted again to show who is who. If you keep a and instead of b and c, you put intervals, you will get such a nice inequal, sorry, such a nice inequality for projections. So if this inequality for three sets satisfy for any A, B, and C, then plug it in B and C to be different. B and C to be different intervals, you get such an inequality for projection. And by the way, what's written here follows more or less immediately from decomposition of mixed volumes, or if you know how editing a segment creates a projection, that will follow from there. But that's, I mean, you can see it in a number of ways. And by this P with U and U perp, I denote just orthogonal projection on a. Just orthogonal projection on a space H. So here it's orthogonal. On the right, it's orthogonal projections on hyperplane orthogonal to U and hyperplane organ to V. And on the left, it's orthogonal projection on a hyperplane orthogonal to U and V. And here I assume to get it in this form, I assume that U and V are orthonormal. So to make it a bit simpler. So what is interesting that this inequality was considered in many, many other Considered in many, many other works. And for example, Giannopoulos, Herzolaki, and Paoris, they proved this inequality with the following constant, which is, I mean, quite nice. But what is also nice is Fredelizi, Genghianopoulos, and Miere observed that there is an example which shows that this constant is sharp. And by the way, the example is very nice. I mean, I could just write it down here, but you take a projection of. You take a projection of L1 ball, so of course polytope, but I mean, you don't take trivial projection, you take almost trivial projections. So you don't project to coordinate spaces, you need to turn it a bit. And so using this, you can, I mean, create many proofs that some constants are sharp. By the way, it's essential that for me in a second will be that K is L1 ball and not in no way cube. So this I said, and so using this. This I said. And so using this, you immediately say, wait a second, then our constant in inequality for three sets must be at least 2 minus 2 over n. And so now substituting, say, n equal what? 3, n equals 3, doing a little calculation, you see that it's greater than 4 thirds. And so in dimension 3, you cannot get anything better than 4 thirds. Better than for third, so this shows that this constant sharp and start. Oh, sorry, starting from there, you can play more or less in other dimensions using this product rule. I mean, you can play with it a bit to create this power constant that I shown before. But this is not a core essential for me. What is really interesting for me from the proof, let me go back to the proof, is connection to this inequality mix. To this inequality mixed volume, and from this construction is connection to inequality of projections. And I mean, inequality for mixed volumes is also connected to inequality of projections. This is one also can feel because any project, one of the formulas to write those projections, probably one of the easiest one, especially if you talk about projections of codimension two, is to use mixed volume with segments. Okay, so here it is. So we were trying. So, here it is. So, we were trying to see how you can move forward from here. And so, what we first found out was the following observation that actually, if you consider any collection of sets, but such that this collection of set is stable by sum and dilation. So you can add any two sets and you dilate it and you're still in a collection. And assume miracle of miracles happens. Assume miracle of miracle happens in our inequality for three sets is true in this beautiful collection of sets. I don't know. So, for example, I mean, one of those collections of sets is a plane. So, at least it doesn't look so stupid from the beginning. So, as I told you, that this is the collection of sets is plane. So, if we have something like this, then we have such an inequality for mixed volume. So, this is, I mean, I mean, not immediately follows one from each other, but the calculations that I showed to you, you can make it believable. So in any collection, when you have one, you will have two. And what is also very, very nice, that if you have two, you will have one. So in any collection, close by taking a dilation, and when you allow to take Minkowski sum. Minkowski sum, if you allow to take Minkowski sum, then those two statements are just equivalent. And so here, this inequality for mixed volumes really comes with unbelievably best constants. So you cannot make it better. It's hard to believe that you can make it like this, but I mean, it's impossible to make it better. It's much better than what you expect from what knows before. So it makes it very hard to believe that this is possible. And just in case, in this As possible, and just in case, in dimension two, indeed, two divided by two minus one is two, so that's why we had it in dimension two. So, after, I mean, yes, so if you can add and if you can multiply, this is very, very nice. But I mean, is there some other natural inequalities that you can glue here? And so, we needed to use a bit more properties. And so, if you have another collection of sets, so Have another collection of sets, so convex bodies, compact sets which are preserved on the linear transformation. So, here I don't want to ask for now, I don't want to ask addition. I don't want to ask, I don't want to ask for addition. I mean, dilation is also linear transformation. So, if they are preserved under linear transformation, then I mean, there is a whole set of things which become the same. For example, this cool inequality for a surface area, this This, I mean, which I it doesn't look so cool. I think if you write it with the projections, it looks much cool, and many of you have seen it before. This inequality, which is very cool for projections, this is again with an unbelievably best constant, which is one. It's very hard to believe. And if this square root scares you for a second, don't be scared. Assume that U and V is orthogonal and remove it. Don't think about it. Remove it, don't think about it. So, such inequality becomes also true. And I mean, this inequality, which reminds you of inequality for three sets, becomes also true. Yes, so this is when our sets are just intervals. And so, I mean, links between those two inequalities, for those of you who imagine how to work with mixed volumes, should not be very hard. The inequalities that we already discussed for mixed volumes is also become. Mixed volumes is also becomes true, but here I must assume that Z1 and Z2 are the noids. So here I assume that Z1 and Z2 are the noids. And so A must belongs to this quirky class closed bilinear transformations. And finally, there is even more to it. So there is a sixth statement which tells you that if you consider such a strange polynomial, which is a volume of A plus T multiplied by a. Plus T multiplied by a parallelogram. So this is a parallelogram just a sum of two segments. So you can treat it as two segments. So just imagine parallelogram. It's up to you. Or even, I mean, you can assume that those two segments are orthogonal. It doesn't make any difference and say that it's a rectangle. Then Pt is a polynomial on a real as a polynomial on a real line. So you kind of open this polynomial and then it has only real root. Only real roots. So, this is also equivalent. So, we were able to show that there are kind of two sets of equivalent statements. So, first, our inequality, our inequalities that Makshei Madiman and Sergei Bakov kind of proposed and from information theory can be true with constant one. This inequality, which is Which is, you can sometimes call inequality for this time local Alexander inequality or bizu inequality for mixed volume. It's true for unbelievably perfect constant. There is an unbelievably interesting ratio between volume and surface areas. This is number two in the second class now. So those classes are not connected. Very nice inequality for projections. Again, Inequality for projections, again, this inequality for mixed volumes. Okay, so this shows that this inequality for three sets is actually, I mean, very, very connected to all this story. So connected to many, many inequalities, which seems to be quite natural in convex geometry. So now one of the issues was, as I told you, to find They told you to find the set for which all of this will be true. And so, the natural questions that should be asked and what we try to think about quite for a while is all of this can be true for the set of zanoids. So, starting for the three bodies inequalities and going back to much more interesting question, which is blue question in second list, number two, or question for projection: Is it all true for zanoids? At all true for the noids, and so this is actually the case. So, that's kind of the main fact that I wanted to tell you today. So, is the following: that if you take Z to be a class of zanoids, then this inequality for three sets is actually works with constant one. Then for any A, B one, B two, the inequality, which is this reverse inequality or bizou inequality. Bizou inequality for mixed volume also true for with this unbelievable constant. And again, it's absolutely essential that A is a zonoid here. I mean, this inequality was known if A is not a zonoid with another constant. And it's known that you could not improve it by this inequality about projections that I shown to you. That is absolutely essential that A's and the node here. After goes this inequality about surface area, kind of three and four, they are also similar to each other in some way. And again, it's absolutely essential that A's is anoid. Otherwise, it's not true. And another inequality is inequality number five, and it's absolutely essential that A is anoid. Otherwise, in a more general class, it's not true. And finally, there is a statement about roots of polynomials. Statement about roots of polynomials. That's if E is a zenoid, then such a polynomial will have only real roots. Okay? So yes, I should be done. I have one more minute. The only thing that I also want to show you is the following inequality, which actually tells you that this inequality for I didn't write it down. This inequality, so inequality seven, it's strongest out of all of them. So, kind of it's much stronger than six, five, four, three, two, one. So, I decided to write it later. So, actually, this one is also true for the class of the xenoids. So, xenoids satisfy this kind of absolutely cool inequality for projections, and all previous inequality would follow from it. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Artem. Are there any questions?
