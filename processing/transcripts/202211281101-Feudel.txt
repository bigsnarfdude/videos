And Sebastian Mikzwolek from Ireland, who is probably also known to many people here, in the audience. So we are dealing with a lot. A lot with the impact of climate change on ecological systems. So, this is one of our major topics, not only on ecological systems, but with climate change in general. And so, our main subject is basically critical transitions. What does it mean? So, we are dealing with systems where we have different stable states. For instance, this is one of the This is one of the possibilities, and there are relatively sudden changes qualitatively in the dynamics of the system when certain parameters or external forcing cross certain thresholds. And then we speak about either regime shifts if you talk to ecologists, or you talk about instabilities when you talk to mathematicians, or if you talk to climate science people, so then you talk about. People, so then you talk about tipping points. So they are closely related, and so the general approach is critical transitions. And in many of these studies, it is more or less assumed that we have different stable states and there are transitions in between them. So examples are numerous. We can think about the Atlantic overturning circulation. We can think about melting the sea ice in the Arctic. Ice in the Arctic. We can think about many other things. I have only here depicted one ecological system, the collapse of coral reefs, is also a very prominent example where people think about different stable states. There is another theory which is related to it, which has been developed in ecology, and this is resilience theory. And there people think at the simplest form at that time here, so that this is something. So, that this is somehow the return to the original state after perturbation. So, perturbations are a rather important ingredient to this kind of discussion. But so, I would like to address here two challenges for the whole subject of this type of changes. And one of them is that, as I said, often, and many examples are in the literature. Examples are in the literature, it is assumed that we have a bistable or a multistable system. So, what happens if we just have one stable state? Is there also something like Dipping? And so, what is the role of time scales, which is exactly the topic of this conference? And so, this means we are dealing with searching for tipping in another class of systems because we are taking into account exclusivity time dependence. Into account exclusively time dependence, and that means we are looking at tipping in non-autonomous dynamics. But tipping in general, so to say, can be more or less listed as those different mechanisms. So bifurcation tipping, we had an example just in the last talk, so where you go through the bifurcation diagram and go slowly through some bifurcations, or you can have noise-induced transitions, which is also long-term. Which is also a long time already studied, you can have for this related to what Holling thought about resilience. You can think about large perturbations, that means shock perturbations which bring you to another basin of attraction. You are just kicked out of your basin of attraction and then end up in another state with another basin of attraction. I would like to focus on the last one. So, this is rate-induced tipping, where we have now Where we have now the transition to a different state in the system where we have only one stable state. So there is also some in bi-stable systems. I'm not going to address that. So I will focus on rate-induced tipping, so where we have only one stable state, and in rate-induced tipping, so to say, time scales are the crucial dependence. What means rate-induced? It means that the qualitatively different state Qualitatively different state is assumed when the original state, so to say, in a time-dependent environment is not tracked anymore by, so to say, the trajectory. But there is also a critical threshold, which is not a critical threshold, which is, so to say, associated with environmental parameters in the sense of bifurcations which are happening, but so there. But so the critical threshold is here the rate. That means if the rate is too small, then everything's fine. Our trajectory is tracking the stable state it was in. But if the rate is too fast, then a tipping event occurs and the system goes into another state. And this is the right thing, I think, to study climate change. Because in climate change, we have exactly this situation. So we have an intrinsic dynamics. So, we have an intrinsic dynamics of a circle system. So, either, so to say, in ocean and atmosphere, or in our cases, usually it's in ecological systems. And climate change is acting on another time scale. And this other time scale is important to what's happening as a response, so to say, to climate change. And this is what I would like to address with two examples. One is in ecological systems, there's a lot of discussion. There's a lot of discussion with loss of biodiversity. So that means mankind is going up, so to say, here, but the biodiversity of species in the ocean, for instance, is going down. So there is a steady decline of biodiversity. This is one of the threats we have to face when we talk about the effect of climate change and ecology. There is another threat. And so this is the emergence of how. So, this is the emergence of harmful algal blooms. So, this is the particular type of algal blooms, which happens as you see all over the world here, US, Baltic Sea, New Zealand, different types of species which can all of a sudden develop a huge blue, which can have other toxic influence on the ecosystem, changing the whole ecosystem dynamics, because their magnitude is so large. Here is a time series. Large, here is a time series. So, for instance, this is a much larger bloom than the usual spring bloom, or here, so the concentration of this edgy can be as large that they can change the ocean colour. So, these are threats, as you see. So, this is the number of these kind of blooms occurring over quite a some decades. And we see there are a lot of blooms more which we have to expect. Which we have to expect. Now, okay, so let's see what it has to do with rate-induced transitions, and how can we explain or say, how can we offer a kind of understanding how these kind of transitions can happen determined by, so to say, environmental parameters which are changing in time, and they are changing either on the same time scale roughly as the internal. Roughly as the internal ecosystem dynamics, or they are changing even faster. That means we have a trend here, some arbitrary time dependence of our environment, and we look what is the impact on the ecosystem. And so possible realizations is not only climate change, it's also land use change or whatever you can think of. All other organic changes we do to the nature, this could be here important. Here in Lottand. And so, as I would like to mention again, so to say, we have only the threshold which depends on the rate of change. And secondly, we focus only on those transitions where we don't have any alternative state in terms of, say, stability, usual classical stability analysis. So, we can think about changing the or moving the stability landscape so that Stability landscape so that our trajectory goes either to this kind of state where it can track the stable state and goes down, or so we do it too fast and then our trajectory reaches very different regions in state space, which can be the dangerous excursion, so to say, in nature, giving rise to, for instance, the collapse of a system or such and harmful either glue. And this is what I would like to discuss. What I would like to discuss, and I start with the harmful algebra. And this is one of the old models, so which uses the idea of an excitable system basically to describe an harmful algebra. So it has been developed by Truscott and Brindley, and people who are familiar with the Sigmagumo system would immediately recognize the kind of nyclines. It's very similar. And so here it's phytoplankton and zooplankton. So the plants. And zooplankton, so the plants of the ocean, and then the grazos, which graze on phytoplankton, and they can develop this kind of pinks here. The phytoplankton, if zooplankton is somehow suppressed and is low, so then this kind of bloom can be there. There is only one stable state, as I said. This is this one where the nitrides intersect. And so, this is our model we are going to discuss. Now, we are changing environmental conditions, and we do it in Environmental conditions, and we do it in time. So that means this would be now the mathematical, so to say, description. But here is our environmental change. This is just the change in the growth rate, so which is determined by environmental conditions, and we change it with a certain rate, and also only, so to say, in a certain interval. So because you cannot change it, so to say, at infinitum, so because environmental change. So, because environmental changes would not go up to infinity. So, therefore, it goes up to a certain value. And now we look at the trajectory and we see: okay, so if the rate is small, nothing interesting is happening. Basically, so the phytoplankton, which is only shown here, is tracking the stable state. So, this would be this one. And if the rate is much larger, then we see this huge bloom appearing. So, that means this. Bloom appearing. So that means this induces a phytoplankton bloom, which was, so to say, assumed to be a toxic one by the modelers, Trascott and Brindley. And then they came up with this kind of model which produces this toxic blue. But they couldn't explain how it works. But we can explain this. And so here come the critical manifold, and I'm thankful that this has already been explained, so I don't have to. Been explained, so I don't have to go into detail what the critical manifold is. And we would have now a three-dimensional state space, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the time-dependent change of our growth rate. And then we see that we have stable parts of the critical manifold, so which would be the red ones, and the blue ones are the unstable ones. And you don't see this very nicely here, but there is a trajectory, so to say. There is a trajectory, so to say. The dashed line here is the stable state, so the original stable state, which is moving, of course, along this line of dots here, this dotted line, and there is an initial condition, which of course follows now the dynamics in this three-dimensional space. And this is a tracking one because it stays in the neighborhood of this. Of this moving stable state here on the stable part of this critical manifold. Now, we can of course also have a different behavior, and this is that we have no tracking. So, this was what we have seen in the slide before, but there is another trajectory which can happen, and so we see, so. And so we see, so for the different rate, and this is what I have shown in the beginning, so for the small rate, everything's fine, it's tracking. So just to see the details a little bit better, so you see here this kind of inset. And this is the tipping behavior. So because now the trajectory is more or less passing the fold, making this large excursion, and then goes back to the stable state. And so that means. And so that means we have here this critical rate in between, so which makes a trajectory or pushes a trajectory from tracking to tipping. And the idea is, of course, now to compute what is this critical rate. And we can do that by using, so to say, the reduced system, which was also already introduced here, and project the fast dynamics of. Project the fast dynamics of the phytoplankton, which is the fast variable, onto the critical manifold and use desingularization, which was also already mentioned here. And what we can compute is basically so a trajectory, which is a command trajectory, which goes through this folded saddle here. And this is our dynamics in this projected reduced system. And we see that this Carnot trajectory is. This Carnot trajectory is more or less dividing the state space here, the initial conditions, in two parts. It's like a kind of boundary because when we are above here, the trajectory is tracking. If we are here, the trajectory is tipping. And so that means that if the trajectory starts below this Carnot trajectory, it's tipping. It's tipping. That means for each initial condition, we have one critical rate. So, where this dynamics changes from here to here. Because this Carnot trajectory is, of course, dependent on the rate, and therefore with the rate, it's changing, and then we end up, so to say, with these two different behaviors. Of course, the critical manifolds are all computed with a with a time scale separation, which is ideal, so which is Which is ideal, so which is basically infinite, but of course, this is in reality not the case. And therefore, this is what we can compute basically with the perfect time-scale separation when the time-scale separation goes to zero. So then we see, so to say, that on one part, so here from this folded settle, so the trajectory will not reach the fold. Here it would go to tipping, and here is our canon. Shipping, and here is our Canard trajectory. So, when we have a normal time-scale separation, the picture looks different, and then so there is only the Canard trajectory, which is just crossing here, and all the other, so there is no connection, so to say, between the stable part and the unstable part of the critical manifold in this part. And what we can also see is that now we can also have the formation of multiple. The formation of multiple phytopartal plants. So, because when we see, so to say, that our trajectory is tipping, then depending on this canal trajectory here, so its location, so the trajectory can come up again here, so where still the tipping condition is fulfilled, and then it makes another turn before it ends up beyond the colour. Ends up beyond the canal trajectory. So that means this is also a possible explanation for, say, when we are moving our environmental conditions too fast, so we are changing the environment too fast, then we would even risk that we have several ones of these kind of harmful algal blooms, which was not the case if we would have a slow rate here in this process. In this process. So we can also look at another system, which is the paradigm in theoretical ecology. So this is the Ossenzweikmach alpha mod. So it's also a predator-prey system. So we have a prey at the predator. It looks almost the same as the previous one, except for this term here. So this is different. So this will be discussed at the very end once again in the comparison, so at the end of the talk. At the end of the talk. So, the supposition here is the same. And we have also a slow-fast system, and I forgot to mention that also for the other model. So, because there is a time-scale separation already here in the dynamics of the ecosystem, because what we have basically is that the prey is developing much faster than the predator. So, because this is a typical property. So, because this is a typical property of ecological systems, so that means you have a so-called allometric slowing down at the baseline, so to say, of the food web. So, you have a very fast generation cycle, and as you travel up, so to say, the food web to the higher trophic levels, so it becomes slower and slower, so there is a natural time scale separation always here. So, that we can use slow-fast dynamics, so to say, to explain. Dynamics, so to say, to explain the things. So we do the same here again, but we are changing now something different. So we are now changing what is called the capacity. So that means this is basically land use change or also climate change so that we decrease now the food, if you like, of the prey. So this is another ingredient. So what we could do, so I mean in the previous one, we So I mean in the previous one we had changed the growth rate, now we change environmental conditions and also with the certain rate, which is then the habitat quality. The outcome is basically the same because so what we get is we get trajectories which track and we get trajectories which tip. So all is the same so for small rate of change tracking for large rate of change Rate of change, it's tipping, and we have again our canal in between, which is the boundary here, and between, so to say, the tracking trajectories and the tipping trajectories. And that means, again, as in the previous example, so we have this type of dynamics where for each initial condition we have a critical rate where, so to say, the dynamic changes. To see the dynamic changes from tracking to tipping. The outcome for the ecosystem, however, is very different for the two systems I was considering. In the first one, it was an extraordinary increase in a population, so in the ecosystem, reaching abundances way above what the normal thing is. And in the second example, we have a collapse of the ecosystem because what we see. The ecosystem. Because what we see is a collapse of the prey. So, when it's tipping, so we reach here the close neighborhood of this part of the critical manifold where prey is almost zero. And that means there is a decline here. Now, this is, of course, unwanted, and therefore we were thinking of whether ecosystems can counteract. Because this is the good thing about nature, they can adapt. They can adapt. And adaptation would be another time scale coming into play. And we have here a rapid evolution which has been introduced by Cortes and Elmer, so where they looked at the predator-prey dynamics and an evolution of the mean trait, alpha, of some trait, some property of the species which are active. So this idea relates more or less genetic variance, that means the speed of evolution, with physics. Speed of evolution with physiological limits and with the fitness gradient to optimize the kind of trait. And so now we are looking at this type of dynamics where CODIS and Elna look at this from completely different perspective. So they try to stabilize their ecosystem by preventing the system to oscillate because, in oscillations, as you see here, the population densities become usually very low, and that Usually very low, and that means here the system is prone to extinction. So this species is prone to extinction. Now we wanted to combine this with rate-induced tipping now. So bring together rate-induced tipping and evolutionary rescue. Because in ecology, evolutionary rescue means that if you are, so to say, getting close to the extinction threshold with no evolution here, but with evolution. Here, but with evolution, so to say, you are more or less expelled again from this area below the extinction threshold that your system can survive. So now we are combining this kind of ideas. So we have rate-induced tipping and we have evolution. And we try to see whether this, so this is what we have seen before. So we have either tracking or tipping, so the collapse would be here or in the time. Collapse would be here, or in the time series would be here. But so the mathematical condition for tipping would be going over the fold. Ecologists would not think about this. So because, of course, you can go over the fold, but if you are not reaching the extinction threshold, then what happens to the ecosystem is basically you have a low population density, which can more or less get back to normal values afterwards when your environment. Afterwards, when your environmental change is over, so therefore, sorry, what matters? Nothing. But so we want to change it in such a way that we call only the whole thing, so to say, as a collapse of our ecosystem when the prey population really falls below this threshold. And this is what people in evolution People in evolution do. And now we have three time scales. So we have the time scale separation in the population dynamics. We have the time scale, so which is now the environmental dynamics, and we have the trade dynamics here. It's the same kind of idea. But no, the subtle interplay between these three time scales would finally determine the outcome. And this is what we can see. This is what we can see. And so, indeed, evolutionary rescue can make, so to say, this distinction. So, if we have fast environmental change and fast evolution, we can lift this curve so that we would not reach the extinction threshold, but we stay above it. So, this would be, so to say, the trade evolution, and here we see. Evolution, and here we see the outcome for our systems. And finally, so we would see that this would be the area of rate-induced tipping. Rate-induced tipping would be then when we fall below the extinction threshold. But evolution can make an evolutionary rescue, and that means it lifts the curve, and we would have no tipping, so to say, due to the rate. Due to the rate. And as a final point here, I would like to have a look at general food webs. So can we expect these kind of things? So these were very, very simple conceptual models which I have discussed. And this is how a normal food web model would look like. So we have terms which are, so to say, here, only for primary producer, but then Only for primary producer, but then we have here growth terms or gain terms, and we have loss terms, which are predation, and then there is mortality. And what is mostly used are two types of grazing rates, because predator prey is grazing in this food zone. And when we look at this, there are two functions which are mainly used in almost all models. It's a Holling type 2 and it's a Holling type 3. And it's a Holling type 3. And when we look at the two models I have discussed, the Rossen-Zweig-MacArthur is Holling type 2, the Trascot-Brindley is Holling type 3. That means these are the generic models which are often, or most often I would say, even, used in food web models. And that means, since they are common ingredients, we have to expect that rate-induced transitions are happening in food webs when we In food webs, when we change, so to say, environmental conditions too fast, and it can either be a result that we have loss of biodiversity or that other populations have an outbreak, so that they become very large, and then so they would dominate, so to say, the ecosystem dynamics. So that means rate-induced transitions are highly probable to happen. Highly probable to happen in ecosystems, and so it's only a thing to see that. And this is my summary. So, what I've shown is really, so to say, that rate-induced transitions can play a very big role in ecosystem dynamics, but rapid evolution can prevent the population collapse, which is the good news for us. So, because if everything dies out, so where are we finally? So, but of course. So, but of course we should have in mind that what we have not taken into account is that genetic variance, which is assumed to be the speed of evolution, declines with the decline of the population density. And this is not in the model, and this can counteract the final evolutionary rescue and finally bring us again to population collapse. Thank you very much. So I'm not quite sure. So on your previous slide, you have your discussion on why you would expect this rate-induced transition. And so you have this very rapid. Have this very rapidly changing term, right? This sort of sigmoid shape, that is the essential ingredient. But only for one of the models. In this one model. This is just a parabola. It has no excitability. This one has no excitability. Okay, I'm not talking about the exciting. Okay, I was thinking about the excitability, but the fact that you have a response where there's a very steep rise. But then you're the the Then the actual rate that is changing was the carrying capacity, K. So the carrying capacity was changing here, not here. Here we changed the profit. Yeah, so my question is, would it matter what you change if you think like, oh yeah, we make this beta term time invariant or something? That's completely irrelevant. It's the fact that you have this steep rise, or is there a balance between the two or some specific terms? The two, or some specific term, that you say this is the one that would cause it, and that would not. So, in this situation, the transport brain day, we changed first the carrying capacity, but then, so to say, so it was also happening, no question. But so, therefore, from this point of view, mathematically, it's not relevant. But when we look at the values, so how much we So, how much we have to change our carrying capacity. So, then it turns out that this would be beyond, so to say, biological relevant values. Mathematically, it happens. It doesn't matter. But one has, of course, to check whether, so to say, the intervals in which you change your environmental conditions are realistic or not. And if they are not, okay, so then forget it. Okay, so then forget so yeah so just quickly so in the Rosenstein Graph model we have this plane, the numerical plane x equals zero, right? Yes. It wasn't clear to me whether you also need to come to that in the last plane model. In the trust of Brain Blame model you don't. So because so you could. In principle you could. Yes. So so So we have not taken this into account, so because we wanted to see more or less the huge blue. So our focus was on the blue. But in principle, we could of course also put the focus on the extinction threshold, which we didn't do for this model. So just to show that there are two possibilities. But in principle, yes. But in principle, yes. So after the excursion, you also come close to the extension threshold and you could have the same kind of arguments. Yeah. Was another thing? Could you please go back to the slide where you had the genetic variance part? This one? Yes. So how do you interpret this in terms of the ecological? Of the ecological problem? Okay, so this is the genetic variance. So that means this is the speed of evolution. So the more genetic variants you have, so to say, the more possibilities you have to create species having different traits. This one, so this is if you multiply. This is if you multiply those two guys, then you get a parabola which is so which is upside down. So that means you have an alpha min and alpha max. That means there are physiological limits in which a trait can vary because this cannot be, so to say, arbitrary. So this limit. And this is a gradient here. So it maximizes the per capita growth rate of the credit drop. So this was our choice. This was our choice. So we could have taken here also another optimum, so to say, which would change, or another trait which would change in evolution. It depends, of course, which trait you choose. This was our choice. But you can take any other. So, would it make sense then, for example, because I believe this is like a typical assumption in population genetics that this kind of phenomenon That this kind of phenomenon happens randomly. Say? Yes, so this is in principle, so this is only the dynamics, the trait dynamics of the mean value. So which is basically derived, not by us, by others, from a stochastic process. So in principle, so therefore, but I didn't have to have time to go into this. To this. But here you see them. So these are the distributions of traits which you would have, but we are considering only the evolution, the time evolution of the mean value, which is a simplification. Then would one expect to have noise-induced if you have if we assume that it's not the mean value but just the stochastic process? This is a good question. We never thought about this, I have to say. So, but I think this is very nice to think about. I think there could. I think there could be, but okay. So far we have not even thought about it. So let's move to discussion and lunch or at all.
