Pedro, thank you very much for letting me participate in this workshop. It's a pleasure for me to share with you some math. Of course, it would be better in Oaxaca, but online, it's really a pleasure. So as Bruno said, I will talk about the fractional ending equation and in particular of the equation where we have the serine critical exponent. Serene critical exponent, and this is a recent work with Hardy Cham. And first of all, I want to give some motivation for studying this equation. And the classical Lehman equation, which is this equation that you can see here, is an equation that has been studied for a long time. Already in 1939, we can find some results. Can find some results. And it's because it's modeled some stellar structuring astrophysics. So it's got to be the interest of a lot of people. And one of the main things that the one important things is the possible formation of singularity of the solution. When we have a solution, we want to know if it's regular or will have some singularities. So when we talk about the solution, So we talk about the solution in the whole ball. Since it's possible that we have singularities, we will talk about distributional solution. And we are going to look for the ones that have this singular set or these singularities. And in this classical case, it's known due to Sering and Lyons that if we are below the critical Sering. Below the critical sering exponent. So, if we have a superlinear exponent, but it's smaller than n divided by n minus 2, then if we want the singularity to be non-removable, the only possible solution is the fundamental solution. So, the different solutions which has a singularity start to appear when we arrive to this. Here, when we arrive at this critical serine exponent. And the behavior of the solution is well known. The behavior, I mean, the local behavior when we are approximating the singularity, the blow-up, let's say, it's well known up to the Sovelv exponent. So when we are between serine and Sovel included, then we know that this is the rate of the blow-up. And in the case of Serine, And in the case of Serene, we need a local rhythmic correction. And this is due to the work of a lot of people, Leons, Gives, Sprague, Caffarelli, Aviles, already in the 80s. And it's possible also that we find some singularity, but this is not the case we are going to treat today. So I will just say that it's possible that they appear. So how do we start? So, how do we study this local behavior close to the singularity? Well, we take the pure power solution out and we do this change of variable and using the N-the-follow change of variable. So, when we approach a singularity that will be x close to zero, we can, without the loss of generalization, we can assume that the singularity is at zero. So, when we approach this. So when we approach this zero with the and therefore a change of variable which is x equal to let's call it r the radius e to the minus t then when we are making the study in the variable t, this means we are close to infinity. And with this change of variable, our lane ending equation becomes an autonomous ODE of second order, which is this one that we have here, which is really nice. And in the local case, Really nice, and in the local case, we can apply ODA study. We have a face portrait, we have everything, and it's really easy to study, or at least it's already known how to do it, right? But what is going to be important for us is that we observe that we have here these two coefficients, which are a constant coefficient, and they be positive when we are between the serine and solid expression. Sering and sovelt exponent. The first one is always positive if we are below the sovelt one, and the second one is going to be positive if we are above the serine critical exponent. And what is more important for us is that when we have this critical serine, then this term is going to disappear. And then when we study the behavior close to the singularity, that said this is going to be the same. Or close to the singularity that said this is when t goes to plus infinity. Then we, since we are taking, we know that we have the decay in the in we need to impose the decay in our solution, we see that this term is going to disappear and this term is going to disappear if the V is present. And then we can isolate the V and we see that the behavior is going to be given by. Behavior is going to be given by this constant V, a power of it. But in the case that the over term V is not there, the asymptotic behavior is going to be determined by this first order ODE. So we already see here that it's really critical. This is a ring exponent, and the local behavior is completely Local behavior is completely different. The study of the local behavior to singularity. So, what happens when we go to the fractional setting? In the fractional setting, I will reduce to the case S between 0 and 1 always. And then, the fractional setting, we have the fractional Laplacian says instead of the Laplacian or equation in this one that we have here. And then we do the same change of variable. We take the pure power solution outside and we do the ender for a change of variable. And then Marl was explaining yesterday in her talk, Marl Gonzalez, that we can use some conformal geometry. And then we can transform this equation in a new equation, a new PDE, where we have here a new operator with a new a new um we someone is writing in my slides okay so we have uh um this new um singular operator with this singular kernel that has a um a good behavior we know the behavior close to the um the singularity and the behavior uh close to infinity but what is uh more important But what is more important for us today in my tone is that we still have an operator plus a constant times a linear term. And then this constant, as was happening in the local case, it's going to be zero in the case that we have the sering critical exponent. So this term is not going to be here when we are in this critical case. So well, this So, well, this makes the stride completely different, as was happening in the local case. And the range between n divided by n minus 2s and n plus 2s divided by n minus 2s has been studied in two different works by Kafare Liji, Siri and Chung, and by Jiang and Zhou. The first one is for the critical sovereign and the other one for the intermediate range. And the critical serine was not known. I have to say that recently we found the work on Wei and Wu, where they generalize the local case using the extension and the follow-ODE method. But what we are going to present today is a completely new method that let us see that even we have a non-local PD. PD, the behavior close to the singularity is going to be determined by this first order OD. So, this is some kind of a spoiler of my talk, but just to give some interesting results, so I hope some people keep to hear the rest of the talk. So, this is the main idea, and then I will start to... I'm sorry, I think you see a line. Someone draw it and I don't know how to remove. I don't know how to remove it. I hope it's okay for you. So I will go to the main result and I will start to give you some result. Since it's the last day and one of the last talks, I will not give so many proof, just the idea, but I want to focus on the result that we have and gives the key of the idea for each one of the serum. The serum. So I will give the existence of singular solution, singular in an isolated point. I will also show you that it's possible to have solutions which are singular in any arbitrary closed set that we choose. That, okay, the solution we provide is radially symmetric, but this is not something causal, but they have to be all radially symmetric. Radially symmetric, and also you can ask yourself why I am imposing some difficult condition, in this case, the homogeneous. Later, we will see that we have the result also for not homogeneous. But why do we need to impose some boundary condition? This is because we have some Louvre theorem, so if not, the only solution is going to be this zero if we have the equation in the whole space. And later we'll arrive to this exact local behavior, which is the share meaning by the. Local behavior, which is determined by the first order OD. And if I have some time, I want to give some hint about how to arrive from this study to the construction of a metric which are a singular metric which has constant fractional curvature. So the first result of the set is the existing of a singular solution. And well, we have a solution which is given by this expression. Which is given by this expression. We have the explicit expression, but what is important for us is that the first term is a generalization of the local behavior plus some error term that goes to zero. So we have a solution which is singular and has this specific expression. And of course, I will, since we have the singularity, as I said before, we will talk about very weak or distributional solution when we refer to the whole ball and not the ball minus the singularity. Whole ball and not the ball minus the singularity. And the idea for the construction is I think nowadays is well known and it's based in Green method, in this case non-local Green method. But the key idea and why it's important this paper is that in the local case, the first work done by this equation, so we have the work of Abiles, but later for Later for construction related with metrics, Picard did a generalization and he used weighted LP spaces. The problem is that if doing bluing with derivatives is hard, when you have fractional cases, it's even harder. And when you have this critical case with logarithms, I do not recommend anyone to try. You can, but it's really a mess. So we could first do the Do the local case using weighted L infinity spaces and let it regalize to this non-local case, which is doable. I mean, we have variable computation, but it's much better that if we have to do every derivative of the logarithms. So we can do this local algorithm method in this L infinity spaces with some weight. And for that of you who doesn't know what is the gluing, well, what you Is the gluing where what you usually do is you have an approximate solution and you have to perturb it a little bit to find the exact solution. So the approximate solution in the range above the serine critical is the pure power solution, but here we obtain the fundamental solution. So we need to add a logarithmic correction for this to work. We need to add some other To work, we need to add some other term, but this is technical and I don't want to go through that. But just we have our this and the approximate solution, and now we need to find a perturbation that makes it a proper solution, right? So then what you usually do is you linearize your equation around the approximate solution and you find an equation on your perturbation that you. On your perturbation that you need to solve. And if it disappears, thank you. Thank you very much. So, if you are able to invert this linear operator, then if you have choosing a good approximate solution and choosing good weight in order to invert this operator, then you can apply fixed point and contraction. Apply fixed point and contraction, and you are done. And this is not so easy usually, but in this case, we are in the stable regime. So, our linear operator is stable. We can find a super solution when applying a continuation argument from the fractional application to our linearized operator, and we are able to do it. So, the key is to be able to do it in this L infinity spaces and use the L-infinity spaces and use the stability of the operator. And later, the positivity is a construction close to the singularity, and later we have maximum principle on a superharmonic function. So it's okay. Okay, so we have the existing of this solution, but what happens if we want it to be singular in a different set, which is not only the zero? Then we can find a solution, and we can find not only one solution, we can find two different sequence of solutions such that if we have any. Solution such that if we have any bounded domain, omega, and we take a set inside this bounded domain, then we can find two different sequence of solutions such that they blow up when we approximate this closed subset. And how do we do it? So this is not our great result because we just do some modification because the idea comes already from the local case done by. Case done by Packard for the serving case and has been later generalized to the rest of the stable regime by Cheng and Lin and also to the fractional case for the stable regime, but not covering the serving. But the idea basically is the same, just the computation get more and more messy. And the only simplification that we did in order to deal with this more and more complicated computation is that, okay, Computation is that, okay, the idea is that you use a variational approach, and later you can prove that you have your energy functional satisfy the Palace mass, so you can apply the Montan Pais and geometry, and you have one solution, and later you can apply directly minimization arguments from the energy, and you get two different solutions, that sequence of solutions that will give you different energies. So, you know that they are different, right? So, you know that they are different, right? But to arrive to this, what you start with is with the existence of quasi-solution. With quasi-solution is a pair of functions that satisfies this equation, but with some f here. And later you need to impose that they satisfy some small smallness condition that we call eta smallness, because you impose that the norm in usually is in LP. Usual is in the LP space of the function u and f is a smaller or equal than value eta. And you can prove the existence of this quasi-solution by induction. But our simplification is that we keep our function u in the LP space with p, the critical serine, but we are able to pass from the taking this function f that we are adding here, and instead of a Getting the norm in the in an L P star space, then we do the estimate in the L infinity space, which is a smaller space, and then it simplifies a lot the computation. So now we know that the S is, we know that they can be singular in a set as the one we wish. And now, why do they need to be radically symmetric? So, we have been seeing a lot. So we have been seeing a lot of symmetrization and also moving plane. But I will present another result about the symmetry. So it's not the first time that this multiplying appear in fractional stuff. It's already known. And what we do is just a small modification in order to make it also useful when we have the singularity. When we have the singularity, so the singularity will not be important for the method. So we basically use the moving play by Chen Li Lee. That said, what they do is like, okay, we are working at N, we take one variable, the variable x1, let's call it, and we take one value, this is landa, and then they take this hyperplane and they mention that has to be the hyperplane minus a set of exposures. A set of uh it's possible to redo the same with the minus a set of measure zero, so they take the hyperplane, and then if you take a narrow strip here, and if you have your domain, which is contained here inside this narrow strip, then if you have an equation that satisfies this inequality, let's say, where v is any function which is bounded from below. Bounded from below, then if you have that your function is positive in this strip and you have this anti-symmetry, then the function has to be positive in the whole domain. So this is done with this moving plane. And basically, the idea behind is like, yes, imagine you have minimum where the function is negative, so you can evaluate your fraction. So, you can evaluate your fractional Laplacian in this point, and later you can compare with a proper integral, which is smaller than the fractional Laplacian, and that will give you a contradiction, and you will arrive that the function has to be positive in the whole domain. So, the only thing that we do is just take use this moving plane, and since we are Moving plane, and since we are working in the ball, what we basically take is that our domain is going to be so we have here this hyper plane, but we are going to remove the zero and the reflection with respect to this line that determines the hyperplane. And then we define our anti-symmetric function as the function minus the function evaluated in the The function evaluated in the reflection point, and then we can see that it satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem. And we can apply and we will intersect this with the ball because we are working, the ball I should remove because the C should be a little bit more over here. So, our domain is going to be here. First, you need to start the moving plane with this. With this domain, to prove that the supremum of the values where you can reflect and you have the positivity is bigger than minus one and later repeat it to see that this has to be zero. So you have to arrive to the origin. So it's really positive in all the domain, let's say. So we can reflect and arrive to the CO. So the usual moving place. Usual moving plane and later, why do we need to impose this digital condition? And then, as I said before, it's because we do have a Lubille theorem. So the first, so the Lubille will be a consequence of this theorem. But if we have a function that satisfies a Harnack inequality and that also satisfies. Inequality and that also satisfies this inequality that we have here, then we know that the function has to be equal to zero. And how do we prove this? So basically, what you need to do is using that your function here has the kernel, like the green or there is potential, basically you can buy. Potential, basically, you can bound it from below and you get a lower bound. So, with this, using this inequality, directly you get the lower bound for u. Later, you can use the Kelvin transform. And we saw that if you have that U satisfies this inequality, then the Kelvin transform satisfies a similar inequality. Similar inequality, and then using this inequality that is satisfied by the Kelvin, and using the Harnack, again, that the Harnag is this Harnag that I write here. If you have the equality here and U is positive, then you can control the infimon and the supremum. They are comparable up to constant, let's say. And then we can get using this Kerbin al-Hagna. Kirby and Hagna, we can get a lower bound, an upper bound for B. Actually, we can get that B is smaller or equal than a constant. And then using this both and using again the inequality for Kelvin, we are able to find that u is equal to zero in v2 minus v1. We get an inequality for u and we can in when we are close to the singularity, you let extend. Singularity, you let extend to zero, and you get that equal to zero. And later you can recover ball by ball and recover everything. So, this is the result. And then, using the green representation formula for our fractional Laplace, for our equation, using the risk potential, we can, and using it in HARNAC, we can apply the result and see that in our equation, we have U equal to 2. Have u equal to zero if we pose it in the whole in the entire domain. So this is so now I am missing the exact local behavior and the first things to observe is that okay the result holds for any boundary condition that I write here, the only thing that we can do the The only thing that we can do the representation with the Poisson kernel, but once this is the only thing we need to impose, and then once we have it proved for the homogeneous case that we know that it's radial because of the moving plane, we can pass to the when we look for radial solution, but it's not homogeneous. And for that, you just use the Poisson formula, as I said, and you get an error term. And you get an error term that we do not know the sign, but we can control in such a way that it became not important and we can eat with another term and we can proceed. And in the general case, when we don't know anything about if it's radically symmetric or not, you just need to do the spherical average and you get another term, but it's going to be eaten in an error. So, I mean, it's a lot of computation, but So, I mean, it's a lot of computation, but the key is to prove the homogeneous case. And to prove the homogeneous case is going to arrive to the first order ODE. And then what you need to do is to write the end there for a change of variable and remove the pure power singularity, which is the power that we were saying before, and then use the green representation formula. And using the green representation formula, we need to. Representation of formula, we need to play a lot with integral, and using HARNA, we are able to write our function as this integral representation that we have here. And the good thing is that if you say here we have a positive or zero term, so this is going to be bigger or equal than this equation that we have here. And if you call this A of T and you derivate, you realize that the inequality we have is exactly Quality we have is exactly a first-order ODE. And then we can control the behavior with this first-order ODE, getting the upper bound, the precise asymptotic behavior, the lower bound, and the exact behavior. So I will not go through the proof because I think actually I don't know how much time I have, but the main thing that I want to point out here is that for each one of these steps, we use only the Either we use only the OD that we have, that we will get some improvement in each step using the same OD. We get some upper bound that later led us to improve and get the exact constant and exact behavior and harness. So this method is not only useful for this fractional application, but if we have an equation where we can use a green can which is Use a green cannon which is comparable to the risk potential in the interior, and we have some kind of HANA inequality. This is going to work. So we can always pass from this non-local PDE to a first order ODE, which is much, much easier. And now I don't know how much time do I have. If I have some channel. It's over. It's over. Just for just for a just for just for a remark if you want if then you want to see so the then i will just uh go to the last uh one and say okay how can we construct uh go to the construction of a singular metric and this is the so-called jamabe problem that you usually have to do several steps but the main thing is that you have to do gluing method and you perturb a solution A solution in which a solution locally using so you have a you want to find a solution in the whole R n which is singular in a sigma so you see sigma like that and you take a tubular neighborhood around so locally you see it as a Euclidean space and once you have this local solution you apply gluing method again to solve it in a couple space so Mar was Space. So, Mark was telling you about this method to pass from the non-local PDE to an infinitely many second-order ODE in order to solve this gluing method, so this linearized equation that appears to apply this method. But this is not working for the serine-critical exponent because, as I said before, it's critical because we cancel the term B. Cancel the term B. So using this sering study for this behavior with a first order OD, we are able to cover the missing case in the fractional geometry problem with the maximal possible singularity for finding the metric which is complete and is good. So we are able to use this. Able to use this as an approximate solution and construct the solution that behaves in this way. So, sorry for going so fast at the end, and I hope I was not too heavy in my talk. Thank you very much. I think unfortunately, there's no time for questions. If you want to contact directly at Sarah for more remarks and clarification, so in the meanwhile, we'll meanwhile uh we'll we'll thank her for uh for this very nice talk thank you very much and uh yeah um
