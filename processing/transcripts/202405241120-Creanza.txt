And thank you for having me. So, I'm going to talk about theoretical approaches to understanding social evolution. So, thinking about modeling how behaviors change over time and how this can apply to different species. So, we all know that humans learn. This is my offspring editing a TPB paper. So, that is fun. Whether that's genetic or cultural remains to be determined, but this kid is going to read it. And human culture. And human culture overall is uniquely complex. So we have language, we have ways of transmitting information with high fidelity, we have writing, which is a means of observing information, we have teaching, means of deliberately transmitting information. But humans are not the only cultural animals, and so one thing that I study specifically is vocal learning, the transmission of vocal cultures, vocalizations that can be learned sometimes from parent offspring, sometimes from other individuals in the population. And this has evolved numerous. Population. And this has evolved numerous times, but it's pretty rare. So these are three times in birds, in hummingbirds, parrots, songbirds, in bats, in cetaceans, elephants, and in habits. So how do learn behaviors change over time? And how does this cultural evolution interact with other evolutionary and demographic processes? And so one area of this that I focused on a lot of different areas of this, both theoretically and empirically in my lab, but something that we've been thinking about for That we've been thinking about for a while is how do some populations have larger cultural reverse parts than others, more tools, more advanced technologies. And the canonical example of this is something that Ordin and I have modeled over time. The tool repertoire in Australia versus that of Tasmania. So in Tasmania, there are many, many fewer tools of the Indigenous populations when they were first contacted than in Australia and the mainland. Australia and the mainland. This was a small and isolated population, and there's a fossil record of them having boomerangs, bone needles, fishing equipment, clothes, sewn clothing with these bone needles. And when they were first contacted, they were mostly wearing furs. They were not fishing, even though they were. They didn't have the boomerangs anymore. And so the tools that were presumably there when these people settled Tasmania had been lost. Had been lost. There are many outdated hypotheses about what happened over time. This is one of them. In 1977, Jones proposed that Techniques could have experienced a cognitive decline over time and no longer possessed the capacity for their prior cultural repertoire and said, were they doomed to a slow strangulation of the mind? And so this is gone past stuff like this, but the idea that we need to explain The idea that we need to explain how, you know, a cultural capacity in a way that is cultural itself and doesn't invoke inbreeding or other ways of strangling your mind, I think is important. And so the first paper that really kind of took off doing this was Joe Hemming's paper in 2004, where he set up a model where everyone tries to copy the best tutor, and individuals that try to copy the best tutor. That try to copy the best tutor are more likely to produce a slightly inferior copy than a better one. And we know this in trying to teach people things all the time, that you can transmit your knowledge, but often imperfectly. And so this leads to a prediction that larger populations will have more complex cultural repertoires. So we don't need to invoke differences in intelligence, how we want to define that, to explain differences in cultural repertoires. We can just invoke a simple learning model. Learning model and find a similar result. But something that has happened over time is that people have tried to test this hypothesis, and sometimes they see evidence for it, and a lot of times they don't. I'm putting up a lot of studies here, and not all of them I think are of comparable quality or data collection analysis, but there are people who have found a relationship between technological complexity and the population size of the populations they study, and there are people who have. And there are people who have looked mostly at hunter-gatherers and have found not that relationship, some different relationship, usually no relationship. So I have done some collaborative work with Oren's group, with Laurel Fogarty, South Moxpunk, and Mark Feldman to try to think about ways that this assumption could, the underlying assumption could be consistent that larger populations are capable of learning with larger repertoires. Learning with larger repertoires, but you'd still find this discrepancy in the data. So, we have in humans, we have a number of ways that we've thought about this: that populations that are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations could lose tools, and thus a population of the same size would have fewer tools. That the connectivity between populations could be predictive, and so more if you're connected to larger populations, that gives you a source of new tools, and your actual population size matters less. Different levels of specialization, that if the Or specialization: that if the population is fragmented, that you can have small groups of individuals that know a certain tool, increasing the tool repertoire by making it more sensitive to stochastic loss. So noise in your tool repertoire. And also different social network structures, which I'll talk about more. So, the only way I know I had spice to stuff is to talk about birds. And so, what I thought I would do today is kind of think about how we've tried to use. Think about how we've tried to use this same kind of conceptual framework to think about bird song learning and how it could not only be a thing that, a paradigm that applies to human populations, but be something that applies to animals as well. So does this framework apply to non-human learning? And so I have a couple of examples to share. It's just like the human literature where you find counterexamples. But this is one where the called the erosion of animal cultures and fragmented landscapes, where a group study a group studying the this is so we have male population size here and mean individual song marks from here and this is the DuPont Slark it's a one of these words that has a person's name it hasn't been a DuPont's Lark so this is an example this is would be one song this would be another song so each of these unique songs contributes to the song repertoire This is the bird that sings a song and then sings a different song and then sings a different song. And they can get up to eight or ten of these. You know, eight or ten of these song repertoires. And we find those larger song repertoires in the populations that are bigger, have more individuals. And so this is consistent with the prediction of the human model. Here's one called Loss of Vocal Culture and Fitness Costs in a Critically Endangered Songbird. This is the region's honey guide. And what this group found was that this bird population got down to 27 individuals, I think. And the small number of birds are. Individuals, I think. And the small number of remaining birds, a lot of them had produced vocalizations that sounded like other species. And so this is what a species-specific song used to look like. And then the current endangered population sings these songs, which they aligned to other songs in the environment and not to the bird species-specific song. So there's some kind of, they were still trying to learn, but they were doing so erroneously. So there could be kind of interesting cultural ramifications here. Here. And then a population from in Canada of song sparrows found that there were simpler songs in the less dense population. So if you had more, fewer individuals that you could learn from, it seemed to decrease the complexity of the song. So here's one. Pretty simple song, as long as barrows go, and here's a lot of harsh one. So that's a couple of key examples. That's a couple of key examples. And so we returned to the framework of Hendrix model and apply it to Burns. But I think that what we tried to do is add some interesting, I think, deviations from the original assumptions that make it more relevant both to humans and to birds. So the original model is set up with a price equation framework. The change in skill level is equal to negative alpha, which is the difficulty or kind of how much. Or kind of how much individuals that try to learn deviate from the best tutor, plus beta, which is how much the population varies in its attempts to copy the best models with variation. And then times the quantum B, the Euler gamma constant, plus Ln, natural water population size. So this scale by population size is constant, and the two parameters, alpha and beta, are the ones that we're going to vary. And so the fundamental thing that comes out of this first, Thing that comes out of this first with the model as it is, is that in larger populations, you have a distribution of individuals that have different skills. You sample the best one and try to learn some error rates. So the 100 individuals in the next generation each sample the same population. And the tutor skill level on average, it has 100 chances to get a little bit higher than it used to be. So on average, in each generation, the tutor skill level increases by some amount. If you have a smaller population, say 20, so similar Say 20. So a similar distribution at first, but you only have 20 chances to try to exceed the tutor. And overall, you're more likely to decrease. And so the skill level decreases in the small populations, increases in the larger ones. And so what we tried to reformulate this model, make it more applicable to birds, but I do really think a lot more applicable to humans. We tried to kind of challenge some of these initial assumptions and then see how social networks played a role. So here's our That works later role. So here's a golden crown sparrow. So this is one that this descending initial whistle is kind of a species-specific characterization, but at the end, they tend to either have or not have a little trill, and it seems like it's the kind of fringes of the population that have lost it. So this is kind of another example of the social network and density rather than kind of sensitive population. Network and density rather than kind of census population size that might be playing a role here. So, in work that I've done more empirically, we've shown that song complexity can be affected not just by population size, but also by sexual selection pressures and lots of other things. So, this isn't the only thing that's going on with song complexity. How long the birds live, how big their brains are, how special as they are in plasticity, all of these things primarily sexual selection pressures that are favored. Sexual selection pressures that are favor, the females are favoring our revitaurus, the birds tend to evolve them. But what role can population size play? So, if we take this kind of gumball distribution, we sample it, the beta again was the variation, and the alpha was how distant the average individual is from the best tutor. We took this initial framework with the equations. So, a higher alpha or a lower beta make it less likely to. Or a lower beta make it less likely for a trait to be contained across generations. But the smaller n means there's fewer individuals in the tail, you're less likely to get out there with your scale. So the first fundamental assumption that we changed was that trait difficulty is constant as the scale level varies. So this is that basically that distribution set stays the same, and as individuals try to learn and get worse and worse, the difficulty of the trait stays constant in the original model. Constant in the original model. And so our proposition for bird syllables, but I think it applies to humans too, is that if you're transmitting, if you're getting worse at the trait, the best tutor is worse and worse, that worse manifestation of the tool is probably easier to learn than the best one. So if you're really, if you started out making a super complex bow and arrow thing, and then 10 generations later, your population of 20, so much is like bending a stick, that's probably easier to transmit than the original kind of high-skill. The original kind of high-skill variation of the tool. And so we decrease the trait difficulty as the skill level decreases. And so essentially that's asking what are traits became easier to learn as it took less skill to make them. So in the original population, in the original formulation of the model, you'd have skill level increasing in a large population, you evoke a bottleneck, the skill level plummets. And so if you challenge that assumption, you say that less That a less skilled tool has less difficulty to learn, then it plateaus at some value. If you have a battleneck, the equilibrium value decreases, but is, so you're getting a trade that's lower, but you're never losing it outright. So here, when the skill level decreases past zero, Henrik assumed that the tool is totally lost. And here we assume that it re-equilibrates at a much worse manifestation of its original form, but remains. Of its original form, but the remains of the population. So, the human relevance to this could be that some populations, if they're smaller, can preserve simpler variations of tools instead of losing them entirely, or kind of like losing suites of tools, but preserving something that does a similar function. And in birds, we could think that songs would lose kind of their most complex elements, but still birds and the population would sing. They would just all become mute because the population was small. And then the other fundamental assumption here is that Henrik made was that you sample your entire population and find the best person to learn from. You pick that person and you try to learn from that person. And so I think we know from PopGen and from our spatial simulations that our populations are structured. We don't have the information necessary to sample the entire population, know and remember exactly who's best, and copy that person. So what if individuals sampled only one person? So, what if individuals sampled only their social networks? So, if we don't, if we have some social networks here, so on the top, we have degree of 10, and the bottom we have degree of 5. So, similar size population, but fewer connections, and our initial simulations implied that the trait will improve with a degree of 10, but get lost or decrease with a degree of 5. And so, just a simple kind of set of parameters chosen to show. Set of parameters chosen to show that you can have the same population size and either gain or lose the tree depending on the connections. So, what we did was set up a set of populations where every individual could learn from 25 other birds, but this was either in a population of 26, so each individual had the whole population to learn from, or it was in a population of 100, and you chose 25 individuals to learn from. So you have the same number of potential tutors, but a much higher skill level if the tutors are. Higher skill level if the tutors are from the larger population. So the benefits of having a larger population remain, even if you only sample a subset of them. And something that I thought was really interesting with our simulations was that it didn't matter if we have a static social network or a dynamic social network, we still saw approximately the same skill level at equilibrium. So we thought it might be kind of, you know, reinvigorated the song if individuals every generation were sampling a different. Individuals every generation were sampling a different subset of the social network, but it didn't really seem to affect the scale level very much, but the population size certainly did. So, populations of the same size could have different cultural repertoire sizes depending on their number of social connections. So, thinking about that, I think, ties back to some of the empirical bird literature that I mentioned, where populations on the fringes or in less dense areas, even in kind of non-endangered populations, could have reduced song complexity. Reduce song complexity if their social connections, based on how many other territories were around, were decreased. Really important. Probably maybe slightly more perverted for humans. But if you have kind of tight-knit, small social networks as part of larger populations, there's going to be a bit of trade-off there, I think. So, with that, I want to thank my lab, thank all the people listening for organizing, to Mahomes Filing Pete. Organizing. To Maud's spelling, in particular, and to everyone for joining because it's an engaging conference. Thank you so much. Having a good time. I was so Muller's ratcheting, really. I was like, oh, I've been to client. Yeah. So, of course, maybe, does anyone ever do these sorts of models for Bertosol where you cover or you reinvent so you have a vaccine to the form? So, give them back the mutation to the more complex song or add a new bit to your song or develop a new bone here. Yeah, so there have been some empirical, there have been some empirical studies. So, definitely, I think in some of these more endangered populations, they have tried to kind of introduce external individuals, literally do back migration. In some populations, of some species, isolated birds sink things that are Isolated birds sing things that are more complex, and then some they sing things that are simpler. And so, if you have individuals that really can't find a tutor, they sometimes produce weird looking stuff, and sometimes they just kind of whistle to themselves. And so, that depends on the species. The one paper is the only instance I've seen where a small population starts to integrate kind of heterosecific vocalizations, which I don't know where that. I don't know where that ends, where that road leads. That one's really challenging. And I'm sure it's really concerning to people who are trying to conserve those birds. If they're not attracting mates of the right species and there's only 27 of them, there might be a hatch. Models we do have. In the models, we do. Yeah. Are there birds where like they learn the little Learn the little bits of the song from their parents or the others, and then they rearrange them into their own. Yeah, so there's a there's kind of a fight club mentality where there's first rule of bird songs. You can't make a rule about bird songs. There's birds that do that and there's birds that don't. There's birds that learn from their father and they'll sing it if that's all they learn, but then if they'll meet up, you know, they'll establish a territory and they'll imitate their neighbors potentially. Imitate their neighbor, potentially a bird that kind of has a territory of fitness to compete with. There's birds that rearrange, there's birds that improvise, there's birds that integrate lots of other individual songs into their own repertoire. So if you are thinking about kind of a paradigm, you can almost always find a species that does something similar. Because we're connected to Lord's Ratchet, so that would say that if you had songs of the same complexity, If you had songs of the same complexity, but in one species they learned the whole song, right? And the other species, they learned the bits and pieces, put them together, that kind of song would be easier to maintain. That's interesting, yeah, because they find the pieces that they can learn and integrate them into one. Success. We just introduced recombination. Yeah, recombination. Yeah. That'd be super interesting. But I think that we, so in more empirical work, we've been trying to kind of disentangle different ways of measuring complexity together. Disentangle different ways of measuring complexity and get at something like that. Overall, we often measure it with an overall syllable repertoire size, but if each of those syllables is really simple versus really structurally complex, it's certainly more challenging to learn. So kind of, do you lose, are you aware of how the dials turn there? Are you more likely to lose one type of complexity depending on your learning strategy? So you focus on bird variability with Among bird variability within bird song variability? Do you have any leads on how that is affected by the sound? Within individuals? Within individuals? Variability in what sense? In their songs. Between song variability. Like. Different. Oh. Like an individual has a repertoire of different songs. Not just for it, sings part of their songs. Part of their songs, like often maybe they forget part of it, or like they don't see part of it. So, I can think about both ways how, in larger populations, you might have more within birth variability or in smaller populations. Yeah, that's a great question. We've done some work on kind of the interplay between syllable repertoire and song repertoire, which is like you can have 30 syllables, but you can sing all 30 of them in a row every single time, or you can have. 30 of them in a row every single time, or you can have 30 vocals, and you can sing some subset of five of them in 100 unique ways. And so there's different strategies there, but I haven't linked it back to kind of any of these population identities, which are really interesting. They're thought of as kind of different singing strategies and kind of how do you display to a potential listener either a male male aggression or female attraction for male singing. How fast are you kind of saying this is everything I know? Know if that's ever, you know, they're only supposed to know one song versus if they're only supposed to. Those are kind of considered different, like, you know, attraction compulsion strategies, but I haven't thought about it in the cultural way of, like, could it be interacting with these other venues? It'd be cool. And we should probably bring things to a close, please. Join the seminar's thinking all speaking.
