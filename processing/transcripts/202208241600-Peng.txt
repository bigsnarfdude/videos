Ken, I started my PhD study at Simo Freezer University, and I'm very happy to have this opportunity to share our project and this wonderful workshop. I'm definitely learning a lot from previous presentations. And the title of my presentation is Association between the COVID-19 Hospital Delisions and SARS-CoV-2 with photoviral signals in Ottawa, Ontario. So you may notice that. Ontario. So you may notice that our title is a little bit different from the workshop's schedule. I have to apologize for that because at the moment we submit the description and the project is still in the early stage and later on we changed our title. So this project is joint work with Dr. Elita Bes-Ronov, Dr. Shamin Ding from University of Waterloo, and also Dr. Jung Hu from Simon Fraser University. Fraser University. So, the outline of my presentation looks like this. I'll start with some background information about the wastewater surveillance data, and then I will describe the data we used in our analysis. And our data analysis consists for two parts. The first part is the correlation analysis, and the second part is the nonlinear model with random time leg. And in the end, I will have a discussion section. So, let me start with. So, let me start with the background. So, Waste Water Summit's data has been previously used for monitoring a wide range of behavioral, socioeconomic, and biological markers. And SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 is excreted in the faces of infected individuals and can be detected in the wastewater. So, the viral signal has been detected in the wastewater surveillance system using a technique called RTPCR techniques. RTPCR techniques. And in this page, I provide a summary map of the global source code to wastewater monitoring efforts. So you can see there are more than 3,000 wastewater treatment sites recorded in this map, where only 153 of them provide the dashboard, and not all of the dashboard has the data available. So more detail about this map can be found at the link. Can be found at the link shown here. Our study focuses on Ottawa City in Canada. So the location of Ottawa is to the north of New York City. And unlike other big cities, Ottawa's wastewater are monitored by only one wastewater treatment site. Other cities could have multiple wastewater surveillance sites for different regions. So this is good because the wastewater in Ottawa will match perfectly. Will match perfectly with other COVID-19 pandemic indicators such as the hospitalizations. And another reason we focus on OTWA is also because at the moment we start the project, only the Ottawa has the public available wastewater data. And here at least some literature review of the previous applications of wastewater seminars data. So it has been used for So, it has been used for monitoring the regional community drug abuse and industrial pollutant chemicals, and also monitoring polioviruses in the global polio reduction initiative. And during COVID-19 pandemic, the wastewater seminars data has been drawing people's attention. Ghanai's paper discussed the possibility to use wastewater viral signals to predict COVID-19 epidemiological data and time-like. Biological data, and time-laged correlations conform with water-based EPDM knowledge predicts new COVID cases and hospitalizations. Also, the distributed lag model has been considered as a useful method to explore the relationship between the wastewater viral signals and COVID-19 epidemiology. So, that's the background, and then I'm going to describe the data we used in this analysis. So, firstly, our So, firstly, our wastewater surveillance data in Ottawa is obtained from the Public Health Environmental Surveillance Open Data Model, and which is a Canadian Open Wastewater Database. The more detail about this database can be found at this GitHub project. So I think it's worth to mention that right now the database is still in progress. And I believe right now, still, there's only auto data within this. Data within this database. But other data from other cities are available, but not publicly available yet. So there are two different genes which can be used to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and they are called N1 and N2 gene. The auto-autata for viral copies of N1 and N2 genes are normalized using another virus called PMMOV. The proposal to do this is to The proposal to do this is to remove seasonal effect and the weather effect, such as rainy and snow melt. Detailed methodology about this normalization can be found at their data dashboard. In this project, we use the average of the N1 and N2 gene concentrations because they are measuring the same thing. So, in this plot, I show the general process of the wastewater measurement. So, the people get infected, and the fees is Infected, and the feces from infected individuals go to the CR catchment area and then go to the wastewater surveillance site. And then the wastewater scientists obtain the samples from the wastewater treatment site and bring it to the lab. Then they use the techniques I mentioned before to detect the N1 and two genes, then calculate the wastewater viral signals. So you can see there is a delay between the people getting infected and then producing. People get infected and then produce the wastewater signal. And then there is another delay between people get infected and people go to hospitalizations. Therefore, to look at the wastewater data could be very useful to help government make decisions since it's faster than the hospitalizations actually respond. And another data we used in our project is the COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Related hospitalizations. This data is also public available from OpenOtoa dataset and can be founded at this link. And this page, I show the time series of the wastewater viral signal versus the COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ottawa. So our data are very simple. We just have two time series. One is the wastewater viral signal, another one is the hospital regions. So from this plot, the orange line is the seven days. The orange line is the seven days moving average of the wastewater viral signal, and the blue area is the COVID-19 hospitalization. So, to do some preliminary data analysis, we can first observe that there are some strong association between the COVID-19 hospitalization and wastewater viral signal. So, if you look at the orange line, you can see it captured most of the trend of the hospitalizations. However, we also noticed there are a couple of There are a couple of periods which the wastewater viral signal doesn't match well with COVID-19 hospitalizations. For example, the Delta wave, which is around July 2021 to December 2021. And also, if we look at Omicron BA1 wave, which is around January 2022 in Ottawa, we can see the wastewater viral signal is not that high, but the hospital. Not that high, but the hospitalization is very high compared to other waves. And also, if we go to the Omicron BA2 wave, that's around May 2022, we can see the wastewater virus signal was very high, but the hospitalizations are only few. Therefore, we found that the relationship between COVID-19 hospitalizations and wastewater virus signals may not be linear and may vary across different waves. And we believe the further analysis. And we believe the further analysis is needed. Therefore, the goal of our project is to enhance the understanding of the nonlinear and time-varying relationship between the wastewater viral signals and COVID-19 hospitalizations. So by now, my presentation looks not related to the surrogate marker, but I do want to mention that one of our goal is to motivate further research to use wastewater viral signals as a surrogate marker in COVID-19 pandemic indicators, not only for Indicators, not only for hospitalization, also the cases, that is. And then the first part of our analysis is the correlation analysis. Hugsy's paper evaluated the correlation between the five days and three days moving average of wastewater viral signal and COVID-19 epidemiological data, such as positive cases, hospital admissions, and ICU admissions using different time nets. Using different time legs and for different waves, they pick the dates to separate each waves. And we extend this time-step correlation analysis by systematically calculating the correlation between the wastewater virus signals and COVID-19 hospitalizations by allowing different time windows of the moving average of wastewater and allowing different legs, also different periods of pandemic. The detail is like this. So, our analysis consists for more. Our analysis consists for multiple rounds. Each round consists for 100 days and move forward by one day for each round. For example, the analysis starts from day one to day 100, which corresponds to June 16, 2020 to September 23rd, 2020. Then the second round goes to day two, to day 101. The third round goes to day three, to day 102, and so on. And for each round, And for each run, we do the following steps. Firstly, we calculate the correlation between the total one days lag, total two days moving average of the wastewater viral signal and the COVID-19 hospital regions. We let the total one take the values from one up to 50, and to one is representing the time leg. Tau 2 take the values from 1 to 30, and it's representing the time window of the moving average. Then for each run, Then, for each round, we choose the top one and top two, which optimize the correlation between COVID-19 hospitalizations and wastewater viral signals. So, what can be explored by doing this? Firstly, we can investigate the optimized choice of the TO1 and TO2 for each period. And then we can investigate how the correlation between wastewater virus signals and COVID-19 force speed relations varies over time. Also, we can investigate the value of the variable Over time. Also, we can investigate how the values of optimize tau1, optimize tau2, and their sum vary over time. So, why are we interested in the value of optimized tau1 plus tau2? Because it's representing the farthest we use to construct this maximized correlation. So, this table shows some example of the results. For each period, we will have an optifines to one. Optimized tau1 and optimized tau2, as well as the optimized correlation. And in this page, I show the results of this correlation analysis. So the first plot is showing the optimized correlation over time, and the second plot is showing the optimized Tau1 plus Tau2 over time. First thing we can observe is that the value of optimized Tau1 plus Tau2 and also the value of the correlation between wastewater viral signals and COVID-19 host populations vary. That in hospitalizations varies over time. Then, if we look at the first plot, we can see there are two periods where the COVID-19 hospitalization are weakly correlated with the wastewater viral signals. The first period is around July 2021 to September 2021. That's mainly the delta wave. And another period is the end period of the omicron. Is the end period of the Omicron BA1 wave, which is around January 2022. And if we look at the second plot, we can observe a couple of interesting time points from this plot. The first one is around December 2020. You can see the optimized TO1 plus TO2 have a big jump first, then decrease very fast. And similarly, from those two time periods. Those two time periods. I checked those time periods and I found that the optimized TO1 plus TO2 gets high while the COVID-19 hospitalization increases and gets low while the COVID-19 hospitalization is on the way down. Then we realized maybe those time-varying correlation is caused by the population immunity from the vaccinations. From the vaccinations. Therefore, we checked the vaccination information from the OTWA. The vaccination data in OTWA is also public available at this link. They have a dashboard to show the detailed vaccination coverage over time. And we did some literature review, and we found that the vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 went over time, but the protection remained high. But the protection remained high against severe COVID-19. To include the vaccination information in our modeling analysis, without detailed data, we decided to use a simplified approach in order to include those VAND vaccination informations based on the findings from previous research. So we assume each dose of the vaccine, so no matter the first dose or a second dose. matter the first dose or second dose, but each dose of the vaccine contributes to the COVID-19 hospital regions after T1 days. And the effectiveness decreases theta percent per day. And we make assumption that T1 follow normal distribution with mean 14 and standard deviation 3. Theta follow the normal distribution with mean 0.1% and the standard deviation equal to 0.001%. And after applying this assumption, And after applying this assumption to our vaccination doses, we get this curve, which we call it adjusted vaccination contribution to the hospitalizations. And we will use this in our modeling analysis. Before I jump to the modeling analysis, I want to briefly review two models. The first one is the distributed leg model. This model includes leg exposure variables as covariance, and it has following. Varies and it has following form: the expectation of the response variable at time t is equal to an intercept plus a linear combination of the lagged exposure variables. And another model is the generalized editing model. This model investigates the nonlinear covariance effects to the response. So it has the following form: the link function of the expectation of response is equal to an intercept plus a equal to an intercept plus a smooth function of x1 and smooth function of x2 and so on. So each smooth function consists for multiple basis functions and the proposal is to include the nonlinear effects from the experimental variables. And in this project we used a model called distributed leg nonlinear model. This model is first introduced by Gasperini and Tuscany. Gasperini and 2010, and it has the following form. So the link function of the expectation of response variable at time t is equal to the intercept plus the following two terms. The third term is just a linear combination of the covariance that has the linear effect to the response. The important part is the second term. They call it cross-basis transformation of the initial covariance. Mutual covariance. So it's basically this model simultaneously describes association along two dimensions: predictor dimension and leg dimension. So the wx is the number of the basis function used in the predictor dimension. And the w sorry is v. The vl is the number of basis functions in the leg dimensions. And xt is the vector of the leg exposure at time t. Lag exposure at time t. For example, if we want to investigate the time lag from 0 to 10, then x t is going to be the x value at time t, the x value at time t minus 1, and up to the x value at t minus 10. And the vector w t dot is the cross basis transformation of the original xt. So it performs the basis functions in predictor dimension and also. Predictor dimension and also the basis function to the leg dimension. Therefore, if there are vx basis functions in the predicted dimension, vl basis functions in the leg dimension, then the wt dot is going to have the length vx times vl. That's all the combinations of the basis functions in two dimensions. And the beta is the related unknown parameters. And here I provide some literature review of the previous application of this model. So, it has been used to investigate the lagged effect of air temperature on hospital admission of adults, and also the lagged association between climate variables and hospital admissions, and the lag association between temperature and mortality. And lastly, the association between long-term exposure to PM 2.5 and the risk of And the risk of ARIS among children and their symptoms. So, in our case, the model, we write our model as the following form. The link function of the expectation of yt given wt and vt is equal to the this expression. So the g here is the log link function and alpha is the fixed intercept. The f1t is a function of time t, which summarizes the monthly contribution of other factors, such as. Other factors such as school close because those factors are not included in the model. Alpha plus this function of t can be thought as a time-varying intercept. WT is the adjusted vaccination contribution and date t, as I mentioned before. And WT is the historical wastewater viral signal and date t. So, in this project, we assume that the time lag between the people predicted. league between the people produce the wastewater viral signal and the people goes to the hospitalization it's some number some random number from 0 to 15. therefore we consider the lake range 0 to 15 so the wt is basically the wisp for the virus signal and dt and dt minus 1 up to dt minus 15 and the s is the cross basis transformation of the wt the model is applied to omicron and pre-omicron periods Omicron and pre-Omicron periods separately, since, as I mentioned before, the virus, the behavior of the virus changed a lot during the Omicron period. So here I show some results of our modeling. We found that the model is able to capture the true trend of the COVID-19 hospitalizations with very high adjusted R-square. And the estimated gamma here is the coefficient of the vaccination. Is the coefficient of the vaccination information? So we can see the estimated gamma is both smaller than zero and also significant. So this suggests that the vaccine has the benefits to the hospitalizations. And we can also see during the Omicron period, the gamma hat is much smaller compared to pre-Omicron period. So this may suggest that the vaccine, the protection from vaccine against COVID-19. From vaccine against COVID-19 hospitalizations, may not as strong as the pre-Omicron period during the Omicron period. And the cross-basis functioning are very complex. Therefore, we use the plots to interpret the model results. So the first set of plots here shows the relative risk, which is the y-axis, and the versus the x-axis, which is the risk for. Which the wastewater viral signal and specific time leg. So the first two plots are from pre-Omicron period. The second plot is the bottom plots are from Omicron periods. We firstly notice that the relationship risk gets high when the wastewater viral signal gets high. And also, we see that the association is not significant and small time length during on-comp period. We can see this from the left bottom plot. Bottom plot. Here I provide another set of the plot. So this is plotted as the relative risk versus the time leg and the specific wastewater viral signals. So I plotted it as when the wastewater viral signal is at medium level and at high level, that's the 95% percentile. So look at the first two plots, we can see that during First two plots, we can see that during the pre-omicum period, the relative risk of hospitalization is at a high level when the leg is small and it keeps flat for a while, then increase a little bit while the time leg becomes larger. But in the Omicron period, the thing is different. The relative risk is not significant when the leg is small and it increases to the highest level around nine days time lake. Time lag, then decrease a little bit. And that's everything I want to cover about the results of our project. Then I'll jump to the discussion section. Firstly, I summarize the contribution of the project. So this project enhanced the understanding of the relationship between whistle viral signal and the COVID-19 hospitalizations, and evaluated the viral signal as a marker of increases in the COVID-19 hospitalizations. That in hospitalizations. However, there are some limitations about our data since we are using public valuable data and they are simply just two time series. So firstly, our data don't contain the variance of concern in with water surveillance data. So we cannot clearly see like which wave is it. And we don't have the age vaccine status in the COVID-19 hospitalization data. But the good news is that those data And the good news is that those data should be available and we are contacting the data provider in order to obtain those data and the progress is started. So if we have more data, then some further investigations should be able to perform. So firstly, we would like to investigate the methods to account for the interaction of population levels of immunity and viral signals from wastewater data when predicting. Water data when predicting healthcare resource impact. And also, we would like to combine data on a larger spatial scale if we have the wastewater data from other cities in order to borrow strengths across all regions. And another important direction, I think, is to validate the wastewater viral signals as a surrogate marker of COVID-19 pandemics. And I think I may get some very useful suggestions from. For suggestions from you, because this is pretty much a new topic for me. And that's everything about my presentation. And here's my references. And thanks for your time. And I look forward to your comments and questions. Right, thank you. Okay, so we have about a half hour here left for further discussion, really, for either speaker. For either speaker, but maybe just to start off if there were questions for Ken. Sorry. Yeah, thanks. I thought that was a really interesting talk. I've heard a bit about wastewater, but I didn't really know the details of how it comes about and how you model it and so on. And so that was really interesting. I was trying to think of a Think of like some practical consequences of this modeling, basically, because if you could do this in real time, then maybe you could say, we expect so many hospitalizations within the next two weeks that you need to prepare for it. So that would be sort of an actionable consequence, I guess, of this, if you could do it in real time. And the other thing would be, you know, like in the U.S., we have the. You know, like in the U.S., we have these community-level colors, I think red, green, yellow. And I don't know if this could contribute to like categorizing a community in a particular color. I think maybe not because you'd sort of want that coverage around the country to do this wastewater kind of modeling. But anyway, I'm just trying to think through like. Anyway, I'm just trying to think through what kind of actionable things you could do with this modeling. And parenthetically, I know it's helpful for polio because if you think you've eradicated in an area and you see it in the wastewater, that's a huge warning signal that the game has changed entirely. So that's sort of a clear use of wastewater modeling. But I'm just trying to think through the other things you can do with this. Yeah, thanks for the comments. Yeah, thanks for the comments. I think those are very make a lot of things, a lot of sense. Because if you look at, because at the beginning of our project, we also want to try to predict the future, how the hospitalization will changes. But then we realized that that is a very difficult job with the given data because you can see the relationship is pretty much dynamic in terms of a lot of things. Like if we use the Like if we used the data on TL Omicron BA1 wave to predict the omicron BA2 wave, then the hospitalization should be like extremely high. But the thing is actually different change there. So, and also another trouble we have is the wastewater seminars data itself has the variability. So, the scientists take the samples and calculate the wastewater viral signal, and within those Signal and within those procedures, some error may be produced. And for example, if we look at the March 2021, here is a big drop of the wastewater viral signal. We actually checked why there is a big drop of the wastewater viral signal. And during that period, there is a big snowmelt in Ottawa. And they also mentioned the period of this part of the data may not be reliable, but they, I mean. Reliable, but they, I mean, we are not able to do anything with that. So, there are also some other research focus on how to reduce the noisy within the wastewater virus signals. I think that could be one very interesting direction, like how we how to adjust the wastewater virus signal in order to use it as a surrogate marker for COVID-19 pandemic indicators. Yeah, Kent, I thought this was also a great talk, and you partially answered my question about the prediction aspect. Actually, could you talk a little bit more about any other challenges with doing the predictions that you originally wanted to do? Yeah, so firstly, as I mentioned, the thing is dynamic in terms of the relationship and also the lake range. The lake range. So, at the beginning, we also wanted to investigate the lake between the wastewater virus signal show up and hospitalization response. And we found that this lake is also changing over time. So, maybe at the beginning of the pandemic, the COVID-19, I mean, the hospitalization changes very fast when the wastewater signal shows some change. But later on, for example, Change, but later on, for example, this period we can see it lagged actually a lot. So, how to decide, in order to predict how to decide like what leg range to use is also a big challenge because this leg is changing over time. And we don't know what kind of variants will show up. And also, we don't have the detailed information about the percentage of the different variants within the wastewater viral signal. But I know the data is available there. So if Is a variable there. So if we can get that data, maybe it will help us to make the prediction. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is, in terms of using this model, is this something that, because you said it's been used in other applications, so is this something I can just easily pull up and start applying to data? Or do you have code available online? I haven't. I haven't made the code available online, but for this model, the author of this model also provided our package. So that package is very flexible because as you see, the important part of this model is basically this cross-basis transformation of the original data, just like the smooth functions in generalized additive model. So if you apply that cross-spaces function to the True variable, then you can combine this S with any other models like the generalized additive model, generalized linear model, or simply linear model. You can combine this thing to other models. So they provide our package to perform this transformation. You just have to pick like the basis functions you want to use. Okay, and just so that it's called DLNM. It's called DLNM. Is that the name of the R package? Yes. The name of the R package is also DLN. Okay, perfect. Thank you. And no problem. Thanks. Thank you. Does anyone online want to jump in? Yeah, this is here again. I have to say that I really enjoyed it, also this talk. Two issues that were mentioned is the rainfall. The rainfall. And for example, in Belgium, in the meantime, we do correct for rainfall in the wastewater so that actually that issue is out of the way. And not every station and not every method allows you to identify what variant is circulating. But if you want to, it can be done and it has been done in some countries, they do that. They do that. So, especially at a time when there is a transition between variants, that's useful. Of course, we have had longer periods of time when the same variant is circulating. And if you then know how to translate, let's say, circulation, yes, and therefore also cases to hospitalizations and perhaps even mortality. You're fine. Of course, you're not for a new variant. You're not for a new variant, the wastewater is not going to tell you what you need to prepare for in terms of hospitalizations in the beginning, but after a while it comes. So it will not be equally useful at every point in time. But most of the time, with a few further corrections, I think it's a great tool. And it's amazing just how informative and how precise it is. Yeah, thanks for the comments. Yeah, thanks for the comments. I think those make a lot of things because I also noted later on after a while we started this project. We also noticed some other cities provide the wastewater virus signal data. But we found that different cities may have different like the units of the wastewater virus signals. Some cities provide the normalized one, some city provides the raw data, like how many copies per meter of the wastewater. Per liter of the wastewater. So, to put all the data from different cities together, there's some extra procedure needed. There are, of course, a few cases where we realize that it's slightly less useful. For example, when you have a big festival, you would think that you can discover that very easily in the wastewater, but no, the Porta cabins actually get in the way. That's actually the system cheats a little bit there. And cheats a little bit there. So you'd have to take that into account. And because of the chemicals, I was told I'm not an expert, even that is difficult. So you would have to take the chemicals out, but I'm not sure the organizers would love that. Yeah. All right. Other questions, including for the our first speaker, Professor Zaik? Okay. I have a question for Shukui. So, I love functional PCA and I think it's really cool to apply it in this setting, but I wonder if you looked at any other outcomes or summaries. And my concern is this: that the eigenfunction that you identify has that really big slope at the beginning. Has that really big slope at the beginning. So, most of the places that are going to have that really big slope in the beginning are the places that got hit hard early on. New York City and I don't even remember now, but the big population centers. And those are the places that they're going to be more likely to have locked down late because nobody knew what to do when they first got hit. And then the places that had the wave much later are going to have a much better shot. Are going to have a much better shot at locking down very early on because they saw what was going on in the rest of the country. So I just wonder if you looked at a different summary of the COVID burden, you might see something different. I don't know if you did. I don't know if this answers your question. Actually, what you mentioned basically are the county characteristics. Are the county characteristic that we need to adjust to? Is that what you mean? That's exactly what we try to do. Besides the lockdown timing, we also add the county characteristic from the ACS data. That somehow addresses your question, but not really perfect, I know. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's a complex question to answer. Okay, I'm sorry. Questions on there. Okay, I'm sorry. Did you win it? Okay. So I was actually going to follow up real quickly on that because you used as your timing for lockdown the onset of five cases. So most counties in the U.S. are pretty small, like 20,000, 30,000 people. So getting to five cases in that county is very different than getting to five cases in, you know, Los Angeles County or even a moderate-sized county with a moderate-sized city. So does that cause issues for your modeling? Modeling, uh, yeah. So, like, uh, how can we define the timing? That is a big thing. Um, so the best we can do, like I just mentioned, we can use the county characteristic as a predictor to adjust to it. But to define, if we want to define, customize the starting time, it will be like a two. I feel it's two o'clock. I don't have a good way how to define, customize this. How to define, customize the starting point. Like, how do you define the day zero? That is a problem. So, we have to have some consistent rule. So, I just use five, tried a few different numbers, four, three, six. Don't see big difference. So, five looks like a better number. Sorry. Thank you. Seems like you could use rate up to a point, I mean, for very small counts. Use rate up to a point. I mean, for very small counties, it's not going to work, but yeah, yeah. Other questions occluding online going once, twice. Okay, well, I think we had a very nice, excellent, interesting afternoon on focused on a couple of different topics, including COVID-19. different topics mood and COVID-19.
