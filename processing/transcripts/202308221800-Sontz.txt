Oh, okay. Yes, so you really. So I want to start with the references. The first reference is something from a little over 40 years ago by two. I assume these are Italians who wrote a book. I don't know either one. Who wrote a book? I don't know either one of them. They had some really relevant thoughts. Chris Isham wrote some nice notes on quantum theory in the 90s with some interesting problems. The third reference is my recent article on the foundations of quantum mechanics. I must admit to you that I have no expertise in quantum gravity and even less in. Then, even less in cosmology. But I've worked in quantum theory a long time. And this is a new organization of standard quantum theory based on probability, which is of course quantum probability, a probability unique to quantum theory. A lot of the ideas actually appear. the ideas actually appeared uh in 19 appeared in a book in 1932 this is the english translation in 1955 by john foy neuman and uh a lot of i've found a lot of people in both the physics and the math communities are ignorant of a lot of the content of this book and the last one is a rather interesting article by new gene wigner So I think I'm the first person here to talk about probability as an aspect of quantum theory. I want to claim that this is the basic aspect of the kinematics of quantum theory. And probability theory, you even find this in Isham's book, he doesn't really. He doesn't really, it's an issue. Quantum theory of what? Of what? Probability theory of what. So we're going to talk about probabilities, but probability of what? Well, probability is clearly probability of things that happen. And things that happen are called events. So it's not a theory of the probability of measurements, of all measurements. Of measurements, although measurements do happen and they are events, and it's not the probability of other aspects, it's not the probability of an inner product or other aspects of Hilbert space. What are events? Well, if you look at the book by in 1981, and I'm sure that's not the first place it appears, this is the definition of an event in quantum theory. Of an event in quantum theory. It's an orthogonal projection acting in a Hilbert space. That's an event. Why is that an event? An event is something that you observe, so it's an observable, so it's self-adjoint. An event is either something that does occur or does not occur, so it has a two-point spectrum. By convention, 011, a projection operator has that property. It's self-adjoint, orthogonal projection operators are self-adjoint. Projection operators are self-adjoint, and they have two eigenvalues. One of which will be interpreted as that the event occurred, and the other one is that the event didn't occur. The event not occurring doesn't mean there was no event. It's difficult to formulate these things in English sometimes. The collection of all events relevant to a physical system, you have to grab them together, put them in a bundle. This is called quantization. Quantization is producing a theory for a quantum system. In my use of the word quantization is not taking something else and quantizing it. It's putting a quantum theory on a given particular system. It could be a quantization of a classical system. Second quantization, which occurs in physics, is a quantization of a quantum system. Is a quantization of a quantum system. Okay, and you put them all together, and these events will generate some kind of an algebra. The algebra that I want to generate is a von Neumann algebra. Why? Because the projections determine a fundamental algebra. Every fundamental algebra is generated by its projections. So I want to So, I want to focus on von Neumann algebras. If you like C-star algebras, I just want to take the double commutant and get the enveloping von Neumann algebra. This von Neumann algebra should be non-commutative. This is just another aspect of Direct's famous saying that the observables in quantum theory do not commute. That commute. Now, here's another justification for why events, the top of the, well, the top of the slide isn't visible. Why we call why events are so central. Observables are clearly central. Are clearly central. Self-adjoint observables are usually thought of non-controversially as self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space. And self-adjoint operators are always characterized completely by a projection value measure, here denoted as E sub A of a Borel set. And you retrieve the operator by this integral formula. This works for on the Formula. This works for unbounded as well as bounded self-adjoint operators. And there's a one-to-one entrecorrespondence between these two structures. So if you want to talk about observables as self-adjoint operators, that's fine, but it's equivalent to talking about the projection-valued measure. Of course, a projection-value measure you can call a quantum event a valued measure. That's what these guys are: quantum events. Guys are quantum events. And this quantum event is actually, again, using spectral theory, the characteristic function of the Borel set B applied to the self-adjoint operator A. And this reinforces the interpretation that if this is one, the event is this is the This guy is commonly read as a takes a value in b. It's the event that a takes a value in b. And if it does, then this function will return the value one. This operator, which is an event, returns the value one. Otherwise, it returns the value zero. So that's the interpretation of this event. It's the event that A takes a value in B. When A is unbounded, we include it in the quantization by requiring that all these events should be in the von Neumann algebra. Okay? And all of this, what I'm saying on this panel, is found in von Neumann's book in 1919. In von Reuman's book in 1932. Okay? Though he doesn't use this word, he doesn't call them events. That comes later. I don't know the history. I don't know who was the first to do it. But already by 1981, people were calling these events. So let's consider all the events inside this von Neumann algebra. We want to understand how to take the probability of these guys. How to take the probability of these guys. So we're going to use something called a state. That's not a state. That represents a state. And you can multiply that guy by any complex number of norm one, and it's still the same state. But you can use it that you can use this vector, unit vector, to define a probability function from this set of all. From this set of all events into the unit interval. And this is the standard formula. It's sometimes called Born's rule. It is Born's rule. It is Born's rule. I prefer to call all formulas for probability in quantum theory Born's rule. Born had the original formulation in quantum theory. In quantum theory. So, this particular formulation is very, very close to standard probability theory. It's temptingly close, where the standard probability theory is based on measure theory. For example, there's a certain kind of sigma additivity that holes here. And I think this has been a source of confusion for people. They think that this is the probability theory. Probability theory that goes with quantum mechanics. It's not enough. We need more. You need to have multiple events. Having probability for isolated events, you'll never do science. Science is based on correlations. So if you see an event, if you have an experiment, you just don't have an event, you set it up with a prior event, and then you're studying correlations. So, Alice and Bob. So Alice and Bob communicating on a long distance by some magical thing and they have some correlations. How do you explain that? Yes, you have to explain that. But just a single event, if you just see Bob or just see Alice measuring spins of spin one-half particles, what are you ever going to be able to say about that? So you need a theory of probability based on multiple events. Multiple events. So here's the definition of the probability that E1, event E1 occurs followed by E2 occurring later, given a unit vector psi. That's the formula. You evaluate, take psi, act on it with E1, act on it with E2, take the norm squared, you get a number in 0, 1, which can be. You get a number in 0, 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. Now, I've shown this formula to a lot of people, and they give me a lot of hard times about it. This makes no sense. E1 times E2 is not an event if E1 and E2 do not commute. That is true. It is not an event. But I'm not taking the probability of an event. I'm taking the probability of a sequence of two events. If he wanted any. If E1 and E2 don't commute, there's no joint probability distribution in R2. It doesn't fall into Kolomogorov probability theory. That's true. This is quantum probability. This is not Kolomogorov probability. Now, I keep asking people to look at my paper to tell me what's wrong with it. Just tell me what's wrong with it. I just want to know what's wrong with it. And they usually tell me things like, well, I don't deal with it. Things like, well, I don't deal with human consciousness, which is true. But a paper isn't wrong because it doesn't deal with a topic. They tell me I don't deal with other topics as well. But I did make one error in the paper. I didn't mention this. I discovered this after I first wrote this formula down and understood its significance. It down and understood its significance, and only learned later that this is Wigner's rule, which appeared in that article in 1963, 60 years ago. This is Wigner's rule. So if you want to argue with it, go argue with Wigner's ghost. That's what Wigner said this probability should be. So that's an error in the paper, an error of reference. And I didn't update it, even though I learned of it. Update it, even though I learned of it because of the way things get published. So, now that you have the probability of a sequence of events, you can define the conditional probability. The conditional probability here of E2 given E1 is this sequential probability divided by the probability of E1 alone, all with respect to All with respect to a unit vector psi, provided you can divide, otherwise it's zero. This appeared over 40 years ago in that book, this formula, this exact formula appeared 40 years ago. And so they didn't isolate the numerator as this consecutive probability, but it's an easy thing. And it seems they didn't realize that Wigner had that before they did. Okay, here's another one. Okay, here's another way to write that conditional probability. It's the same formula. I'm writing it as that quotient. Okay. So the numerator is the probability that E1 occurs in E2, and then dividing it by the probability that E1 occurs. And you can put the denominator inside the norm squared above in that way by taking out the square. That way, by taking out the square, and then you can define this quantity to be psi tittle. Psi tittle is that vector. And that's called the collapse of psi by E1. You find that in all the textbooks. So psi has been collapsed by the event E1, one says, or it's been collapsed by a measurement. What's going on here? This is a two-step algorithm. This is just something that you learn by rote in school, and the teacher never tells you the reason why. And you never know why minus times minus is plus, except that the teacher said so. So it's a two-step algorithm for computing the conditional probability of two events, one conditional probability. The collapse itself is not an event, it's not a physical process. The events here. Process. The events here are E1 and E2. Events are encoded in this as orthogonal projection operators. This is not an orthogonal projection. It's just a mathematical step in an algorithm. I mean, I could go back and look at this formula and use that as an algorithm. What's the ad algorithm say? What's the add algorithm say? Compute the numerator, compute the denominator, divide. That's a three-step algorithm. Would anyone ever say that the division step occurred physically? If so, when? If so, where? But on the other hand, you will see everyone in the physics literature, myself included, because I wrote a book with errors in it, it says this is actually. And it says this is actually happening physically. But this process of going from side to side too has nothing to do with space-time coordinates. So there's no non-local spooky action going on here. All that's going on is there's a simple algorithm for computing conditional probability. Why do people use this simple algorithm rather than conditional probability? One, they don't know the definition of conditional probability. One, they don't know the definition of condition probability. And two, they only know the probability of single events. So they have to reduce it to something like this, which they can teach to their students and that they can understand themselves. But it's really just this guy back here. So with independence. It just followed the same idea that you have in classical probability theory. So the notation is the same. Independence of these events with respect to psi is the probability of E2 given E1 is just the probability of E2. Of course, you need the denominator not to be zero, but you can clear the denominator and reduce it to this form. So it's the probability that E1 first occurs in E2. E1 first occurs, then E2 is the product of the probabilities. That's independence. People will object. It depends on the order of E1 and E2 on the left side. It does not depend on the order of E1 and E2 on the right side. That is correct. It does not. What does that mean? It means two events can be independent in one order and not in the other. There are examples. Okay? If they're not independent, they're correlated. But we don't use the word correlated very much. We use the word entangled. So that's what these are called. They're entangled. If things are not independent, they're correlated. These correlations are entanglements of events. My hypothesis is that all entanglement is essentially at the end of the Is essentially at base entanglement of events. Because events are, it's when events are correlated that you have entanglement. Correlations, just like probabilities, refer to things that happen. Events happen. Especially, of course, people in this audience know that there's something called an entangled state, the spin singlet. The spin singlet of two spin one-half particles is a very famous and well-known example. You have a tensor product space, which is sometimes known as Alice and Bob. And in that context, you have what are called entangled states. But actually, they are disentangled events. Bob has some events, Alice has some events, and with respect to this. Events and with respect to this entangled singlet state, these events are entangled. It's the events that are entangled. But there are also examples where you have entangled events in CP. Well, actually, in the bounded linear operators in CP, that's the phenomenon algebra of type one of all linear operators on Cp, where P is a prime. As a prime. This space, of course, is a Hilbert space, and it's not representable in a non-trivial way as a tensor product. So, if you want to think about Bob and Alice, either Bob or Alice is going to be trivial, but there are entangled states here in all possible combinations. They're entangled events here, all possible combinations. You see, I'm trying to get things said straight, but I mess it up myself. Mess it up myself. Okay, so what happens when you do have a measurement? What's a measurement? I don't have much to say about measurements in this approach. Measurements are just other events. We've already seen them. You take the projection value measure of the observable A, that's E sub A, and you evaluate it at some small interval of the real line, where small is whatever is adequate for the discussion. For the discussion in hand. So that's what measurement is. It doesn't have to play any special role in probability theory of quantum theory. It's just another event which can condition later events and can be conditioned by earlier events. Okay. Isham in his book discusses what he calls a quaternity of problems. Close a quaternity of problems in quantum theory. Conceptual issues in quantum theory. These are the four issues. The meaning of probability. Of course, he expounds on these in great detail. These are just catchphrases. The meaning of probability is it's everything that explains how events occur. Events occur. The role of measurement, I just told you, it's just another event. The reduction of the state vector, which is collapse, that's just one step in a two-step algorithm. It's nothing very important. It's just minus times minus is plus without ever anyone telling you why. What's quantum entanglement? Quantum entanglement is lack of quantum independence. I have many more examples. I have many more examples of this in that paper. One example is this famous often repeated example. We have two spin one half particles coupled in the single state and analysis and while we're making highly correlated observations, measurements on them. You work this out with this probability theory, and this probability theory explains everything. By the way, Explains everything. By the way, there's no time evolution. This is all kinematics. This is all kinematics so far. So what about gravity? Well, here's my thoughts on gravity, because I don't know much, is the little I know. Okay, so quantum theory is a theory of events. So is relativity, special relativity, and general relativity. Special relativity and general relativity are series of events. Good grief, events and events. There should be some relation. So, my guess is that for any space-time manifold, there should be some family of fundamental algebras indexed by the Planck's constant, first appearance of the Planck's constant. Planck's constant before was there, it was one. In quantum theory, Planck's constant is one. One, but you want to study a quantization of something classical, you want to take the semi-classical limit to go back. So you need Planck's constant as a parameter to go back. So you need some kind of a family of fundamental algebras, non-commutative, labeled by Planck's constant, which has this space-time manifold as its limit in the sense That I don't know what somehow to be defined. Quantizing Einstein's equation would be a further step. In fact, the first problem in this approach would be to take Einstein's equations away as zero is flat. It's Minkowski space. How do you start with just regular Minkowski space and produce these fundamental? These fundamental algebras and thank you very much for your attention. Just a remark, I was here these people that try to construct an algebraic button field theory where they impose Lorentz covariance and phenomenon algebras. Are you aware of that? Never manage like theory, only a free theory. There was problems with the quantum gravity, there was a problem with defining the vacuum. It was not unique. Are you aware of these problems? There are lots of problems. One of the problems is that Hank proved that the interaction model doesn't exist. Excuse me? The interaction model doesn't exist. Interaction model doesn't exist, which is due to the unboundedness of operators. Yeah, Haggs Hague's program has had less success than the Whiteman-Gording axioms, but none of them have gotten to a full. Well, let me put it even more dramatically. You take a course on quantum field. You take a course on quantum field theory, and after two months of learning all this abstract math, the professor comes in and says, we're going to calculate a cross-section. You go, oh, this has something to do with experiments. Oh, so those are the events in quantum field theory are just hidden. They're hidden and they come in very late. And what I'm trying to say here is, I think events are. Here is, I think, events are central to quantum theory. They're clearly central to all kinds of, well, that's even special relativity theory. And the fact that they are points only means that they're measure zeros. So you really shouldn't, you don't have to take events to be points, measure zeros. You can take them to be open sets on your manifold. Your manifold. And this leads me to suspect that the von Diamond algebras that are actually relevant here are type 3. Yeah, that's true. Type 3. Well, that was proven for these quantum algebraic quantum fields. Yeah, yeah, these are type 3. So a lot of people are always thinking, oh, here's my Hilbert space. And they just go on. And what they're implicitly assuming is that they are working with a type 1 fundamental algebra. The Hilbert space, the Hilbert space defines the type one von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators. And that's my function. They don't even mention it. That's just implicit. And then they find all kinds of things inside of this phoneme algebra that they don't like. And they have hard, you know, they need super, they need super sectors and selection, new selection rules. And they just didn't, they're quantizing wrong. It should not be a type one. It should not be a type one. Go for type two at least. It's proven that for Lorentz convents, you have to go to type three. Yes, yes, type three. And these are tough guys. Yeah, yeah. And I don't know very much about them, but I want to learn more. It's a question, yeah. Question. It has been nagging me for some time. If you go back to when you define the probability of A1 and A2. probability of A1 and A2 disparate there. Now, what happens if psi, the wave function, does not belong to the domain of E1? So no, no, because when you count the probability, if you go back a little bit more, pip psi E1 E2 is defined, yeah, yeah, for example. Yeah, yeah, for example, here, here, is E1 E2E1 acting of psi. Now, if psi doesn't belong to the domain of E1, E1 is fine on the home of the screen. No, it's a bounded operator. E1 is a projection. All these are also operators with two dollars. Okay. And two classes, okay, so they're projections. You're okay, events and projections. Okay, so these events are given a variety of names which confuse people. Well, at least they confuse me, they're called yes-no experiments, they call propositions. Okay, often called logic. They're not propositions. Okay, so E1 is a projection over one of the eigenvalues of a, presumably, of a operator. So when you're measuring, you're measuring something. So your E1 is the projection operator in one of the In one of the directions of the eigenvalue of a self-adjoint operator. If the range is one-dimensional, but the range of the projection operates. Yeah, sure, it can be a projection in a sub-space of the spectrum. That is what I think. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I am asking a question, but I don't know if it makes sense at all, like my previous question. So okay, so E1 acting on psi picks up one specific component of psi? No, the projection could do with anto-shrink. E1 is a projection. This is a range which could be infinite dimensional. When you act on a vector, it just projects it down onto that. Let's see, a diagonal projection onto that closed subspace. Yeah. So who decides what subspace you want projects to? That's the quantization problem. The quantization problem is to pick your events appropriately to describe the quantum system that you're presented with. Okay. So, not if you have a Hilbert space, it has an enormous number of projection operators. Not all of them go into the von Eumann algebra. The selection of the von Eumann algebra is essentially the selection of the events. Events are the physically occurring things that you will observe. So, you have to pick. If you can get intuition from classical physics, that's fine, but let's do some other way. Okay. For example, how was Spin introduced? I don't think Spin was introduced by Father sitting around and scratching in a second pricing system. I want to point out. Okay, so if I go to very, very basic textbook level, okay, so I have a screen. Textbook level. Okay. So I have a screen, a fluorescent screen on which I'm to which I'm sending a beam of, say, electrons. So before the electron has hit the screen, the standard thing is that there is a wave function which is spread. So the electron can be anywhere. Then there is a sentence which says, okay, now the wave function collapses, which means that which is associated with the electron, creating a spot at one point on the screen. So that's it. So that's it. Whatever collapse of the wave function in the textbook language. And it hits one point, so it has collapsed there and not somewhere else. So what would be that description in this language? The fact that it hit the screen at a certain point would be a finite resolution. So we can divide the screen up for a finite number of sectors and getting into one of those sectors. So E1 active on psi make it hit at one specific point it describes that and not it not hitting some other point basically. Well Edison hit the point to hit the areas if hitting a point has grown that doesn't matter yeah sure make it into a send that's fine that's fine yes You know, this two questions, you have a graduate student who thinks he knows quantum mechanics, and you have him write down the wave function for the hydrogen atom, and then you say, well, okay, what's the probability that this guy, this electron has one more radius from the nucleus? And he gives you some funny number. The answer, no, it's zero. Sure. The answer is. Yeah, of course, you have to look at the name. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, no, that's not the important point. The important point is: okay, there's an event which now is electron falling in some region, some cell on the screen. And that, in your language, is E1 acting on the wave function and the outcome is the that event that you see basically. Well, it it it depends what you want to describe. It depends what you want to describe. You want to describe a subsequent event, use this formula. Sure, yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it is very interesting, but I think I'm probably going to have to completely. So we have not much time. Is there any urgent question from the audience from the Zoom? So we thank Stephen again.
