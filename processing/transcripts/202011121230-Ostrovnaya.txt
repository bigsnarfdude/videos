Great. So at first I wanted to thank the organizers for organizing such a great workshop and inviting me. So I work at the Department of Biostatistics in Sloan Catering Cancer Center in New York, doing a lot of collaborative statistical research. And I'm a statistician by training, so I'll have a more A statistician by training, so I'll have a more kind of statistical talk today about the methodology. So, as I'm sure you all know, microbiome has been shown to be very important for human health. There's been many papers in the last decade describing various associations between microbiota in the human body and various disease states. So, it's very promising area of research. Very promising area of research, and a lot of interventions can be based on modifying potentially microbiota to fix diseases. So, there's good reasons to study and study microbiome and analyze samples from humans. So, from a statistical point of view, microbiome data have several features that make it kind of specific. Specific, not very easy to analyze. So, often the microbiome data are multi-dimensional, high-dimensional. There's a lot of bacteria profiled in one sample, and the data are compositional. So, what that means is that the bacterial abundance within one sample, a sample all sums up to some number, total read count, that is a fairly arbitrary number. So, if we normalize the data. So, if we normalize the data to represent relative abundance of a bacterial species in a sample, the data, then this relative abundance sum up to one. And if we ignore this compositionality, it might create some problems for the analysis. In addition, these data are often sparse. There's a lot of zeros, so many bacterias will have no abundance, zero abundance in certain samples. And there have been many methods. And there have been many methods developed for testing differential abundance between different kinds of samples. For example, finding which bacteria is present in one kind of sample but not in another kind, like cancer or control or case and control. So with that background, we're building up on the existing literature. We actually propose to a method for instead of finding individual bacteria. Finding individual bacteria that are differentially abundant in different groups of samples, we propose to look for pairs of such bacteria that have differential relationship between two groups of samples. So the motivation between that is that different bacteria are, of course, interacting in a body. So they might be competing or coexisting or somehow. Existing or somehow affecting each other. And we think there is a good rationale that this relationship can change depending on whether the two samples interact within a healthy individual or diseased individual. So our goal for this research is to test whether the relationship between two bacteria is associated with case control status or some kind of a binary disease status. Status. So I'll jump right to the method that we propose, and I try to spare some mathematics, some too much detail. So we will be using stability selection framework to analyze such data. Stability selection is using resampling and feeding multiple penalized regression models on this resampled. On these resampled samples. And penalized regression, I don't know if probably most people know, but it's a kind of a logistic regression with extra penalty on the parameters. So slightly different numerical procedure is used to estimate the parameters and such model. And with some kind of penalties, for example, LASSO model, many of these parameters might be shrinked to zero. So stability selection framework actually. So stability selection framework actually does it multiple times on sub-samples of the patients. So here we assume there are n patients and p variables and usually p is much bigger than n or it's usually a large number and variables would be bacterial species and we have a binary outcome y here. So essentially when I talk about looking at pairs of bacteria we're we're going to create pieces We're going to create P choose two pairs for all possible pairs: one, two, one, three, one, four, and so on. And look at these relationships. And the way we specify this relationship is by creating this binary pairwise marker Z that takes value one if bacterial abundance in species J1 is at least C-fold higher than Higher than or lower than in bacterial J2, and it's zero otherwise. So we're basically trying to dichotomize this pairwise relationship. So if we set this parameter C as equal to one, so we simply look at binary marker whether first species or J1 species has lower abundance than J2. And we hope, for example, that in kids, And we hope, for example, that in cases that might be the case, that most often bacteria one has a lower abundance than bacteria two. But in controls, the relationship is opposite. So this is a simple example of such a relationship. But we make it a little more nuanced by allowing this parameter C, threshold C, that might allow the two bacteria to be compared when they're not on the same scale. Compared when they're not on the same scale. They don't have similar scale of abundance. So the algorithm would propose that we named PAIRSeq would go as follows. So we repeat a resampling several steps for each resampling step. So we randomly split N patients into two groups of patients. So there are two non-overlapping groups of patients. Two non-overlapping groups of patients randomly. On one of half of these patients, we estimate the optimal value for this parameter C. And the way we estimate it is that it best separates this pairwise binary markers between cancers and controls using minimal entropy in this case. So we'll find some optimal value of C that best separates the data. And if both values of bacteria Bacterial of bacterial abundances are equal to zero, then this pairwise marker Z is taking a randomly value zero or one. So after we estimated the optimal values of C for each pair of bacteria, we calculate, create these pairwise markers, Z, with these optimal values of C, but on a sample of patients that were not used to estimates. Patients that were not used to estimate C's. So, on the opposite half of the patients. And in that half, we fit a LASSO model, so penalized logistic regression using this created fitted pairwise marker Z defined in a previous step with using randomly drawn vergalization parameters, so the lambda. So that's a parameter that tells you how much. That tells you how much you want to penalize your parameters. So most often LASO shrinks most parameters to zero. So many of them would be zero and some would be non-zero. So in each of these LASA fit, we estimate which pairs actually had non-zero coefficients. And then we repeat this procedure thousands. And then we repeat this procedure a thousand times or so and calculate for each pair of bacteria how often it had a non-zero coefficient in LASSO. So if this proportion, which we call stability score, if that stability score is high, then it means there's likely a solid association with the outcome. And if the stability score is low, so only maybe a few spurious Few spurious Alasso models pick this particular pair, then we don't think there is a relationship with the outcome. So, original stability selection had some strong assumptions about independence of the variables, and it guaranteed some theoretically justified error control. So, there was some false positive and false negative that you could set. That you could set. Here, because we are free of these assumptions, we don't think they would hold, we use the stability score more as a ranking tool. So we can just rank the pairs based on the stability score and choose some top amount, or we can choose those that have higher stability score than pre-specified threshold. So the good things about this method is: first, it allows flexible pairwise. First, it allows flexible pairwise relationships by selecting optimal threshold. And these two bacteria can be on different scale. And it accounts for presence of zero in both features. And because we look at, compare abundances only within the same sample, there's no need to normalize the data. So this composition analogy basically irrelevant to us because we only compare abundances within one. Pair abundances within one sample. And the difficult part about also doing all pairwise analysis is that pairwise markers are highly correlated because, for example, pair one and two and one and three share one bacteria and there will be pretty high correlation across these pairwise markers. But using resampling and LASSO will allow us to minimize the effect of these correlated pairs. Correlated pairs. So I'll just illustrate this on an example from oral cancer with 121 oral cancers and 242 normal controls. This is a published data set. So after aggregating bacterial abundances from almost 3,000 units, we end up with 61 bacterial genera to analyze. So we have to get rid of those that have. To get rid of those that have too many zeros that are observed in fewer than 10% of the samples. So, with 61 genera, there's 1,830 pairs to look at. So, that was almost 1,800 variables to look at in each LASSO model. So, and the sample sizes you see in hundreds, not thousands. So, feeding this model. Fitting this model, this method that I just described allows us to find two pairs that have high stability score, higher than 80%, and it's on the right. So you can, the pictures you can see on the right. So you see in the red samples, which are cases, the one bacteria has much higher abundance than the other relatively to their scale, but it's the opposite relationship for controls. So, of course, So, of course, we don't know yet if this is a real association, so it's hard to establish because we don't know the truth. So, we've done some simulation studies. Before we go to them, I'll just mention what would happen if we analyze it using just logistic regression with pairwise markers without having a stability selection framework. So, we would have 900 900 pairs with p-values less than 0.05. And that's because there's also a lot of bacteria that have differential scale might also show up as significant here. And 794 would be significant after FDR adjustment. And if we use this logistic regression with the main effects, so with pairwise relationship and Pairwise relationship and two bacterial abundances, a relative bacterial abundance, there will be slightly less, but still 33 pairs after FDR adjustment. So of course it's hard to judge. So PairSeq found two pairs that are relatively high, but this kind of naive methods find many more. But it's hard to tell who is right. And the thresholds are not fully comparable. So we run some simulations. So we run some simulations by using this very data set. We use bacterial abundances from this very data set, but we create the outcome case or control using certain statistical model, which we look at three possible scenarios. In one scenario, two or six pairs are associated with outcome using logistic model, and the effect sizes are estimated from the real data. So we use beta that we estimate. Real data. So we use beta that we estimated from the real data. So in this case, we use the whole realistic data structure, but we know the true status of case control. We generate them using known signals. And then we also test two null scenarios where only individual bacteria are associated with outcome, or outcome is completely independent of microbiome. So, and we probably compare the performance of this method to. This method to just naive kind of analysis of pairwise markers with or without adjusting for main effects. So this figure kind of shows true positives and false positives of the methods for different scenarios across different thresholds. Because it's not, you know, if we use the stability selection threshold of 60 to Threshold of 60 to 90 percent. So we look at how many features would be called interesting based on this threshold. Or for FDR, we use certain significance levels between 0.05 and 0.01. So in this top left figure, we can see that true positives are almost two, and this is the case where there are two true positives. Where there are two true positives, and the number of false positives is very small. So it's decreasing once the threshold gets consistently more stringent. But if we used FDR adjustment, we would find six pairs significant instead of two. So a lot of false positives. But true positives will be also somewhat smaller. And so the relationship pretty much. And so the relationship pretty much similar patterns for scenarios with six true signals. And both proposed method and kind of naive method have comparably small false positives with the null scenarios. So I'll summarize. So we propose a method for finding pairs of bacteria. Finding pairs of bacteria that have differential relationships depending on their case control status, and we think that allows further look into networks of bacteria and kind of their patterns of cooperation and competition. And the proposed method due to this adapted stability selection framework provides much fewer false positives than the naive analysis. And the GitHub package is pending. GitHub package is pending. It's actually out there, but will be finalized soon. And my collaborator on this project is Sean Devlin, and Axel Martin helped us with some software issues. So thank you, and I'll be happy to take any questions. Yeah, thank you very much. So if you have questions, please type them in the chat or just speak up. The chat, or just speak up, unmute yourself, and then so when you so you said you came up with two pairs basically with your analysis in this particular data set, right? Did you look at the function of these genomes in detail? Because I think, I mean, two genomes is pretty, it's a nice data set to look at it in detail. We did, yeah. We did, yeah, so they show up as an important bacteria in the literature, but I mean, without that, so they definitely some relevance there. So there's a lot of also main effects, so it's important to that we're separating this from main effects. So we not being able to validate them, of course we don't know for sure, but they show up as relevant for cancer. And in as relevant for cancer, for oral cancer. Thank you. And there's one more question: How is it possible to validate the predictions of this method experimentally? How can the effects of interactions between bacterial species be verified? I mean, experimentally, maybe if you could follow the samples from normal to disease state. Normal to disease state, for example. I mean, that's of course a high ask, or maybe it's maybe it's possible in mice, for example, not in humans. But you hopefully, if you profile repeatedly microbiomes of a mouse that is in the process of developing cancer, hopefully you will see how this relationship between the two bacterial is shifting from one pattern to another as the sample, you know, as mice develops cancer. So that's how I see it. Okay, thank you.
