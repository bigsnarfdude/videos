It is from a joint work with Philippe Castillon. So the starting point of this work is the following theorem by Alexandrov. So the statement given a positive measure on the unit sphere, and let me assume that the total Assume that the total mass of this measure is coincides with that of the uniform measure. And let me assume further the following condition there that I usually call Alexandrov condition. So given a convex subset of the unit sphere, I assume that the mu mass of omega plus sigma of omega star, so omega star. Star. So, omega star is the polar body on the sphere. Maybe I will recall the definition. And so the sum of these two masses must be smaller than the total mass for the uniform measure. And under this assumption, there exists a unique convex body, say C where the origin where uh the origin is uh within C and uh such that this measure mu is a curvature measure of C. And in the Euclidean setting, uniqueness is only up to dilations with respect to the origin. Okay, so our goal with Philip was to generate With Philip was to generalize this theorem for a convex body in the hyperbolic space. So it's something we did some time ago, but I think it fits well the subject of the conference. Okay, so there are many other theorems of this kind proved by Alexandrov, like Mingaffi theorem or Christopho's theorem, but I have Or Christopher's theorem, but I have no time to describe them. But okay, it's not just a single theorem like this. So what do we prove? Okay, let me now write the statement. See if it works. Yeah, it's fine. So So the statement is similar. So we start with a positive measure on the unit sphere. Now the total mass of this measure must be greater than that of the uniform measure and And there is also an Alexandrov condition for convex subset of the sphere, which is slightly different. So the left-hand side is exactly the same, but on the right-hand side, the assumption, well, it involves mu instead of sigma. Instead of sigma. So, compared to what I wrote for Euclidean bodies, this is slightly weaker given the fact that the total mass here satisfy this relation. And there is an extra assumption about the atoms of mu. Their mass must be at Must be at less than half of the total mass of sigma. Okay, so and we do not have this last assumption in the Euclidean case just because you can infer this assumption by using the second one and choosing omega to be just a point. To be just a point, right? And in Euclidean space, you get the third assumption, but here, because the right-hand side here is now mu of Sn minus one, we have to add this assumption. Okay, this is for the assumption. And now, what is the conclusion? Well, we can prove that there is a unique convex body C. A convex body C in the hyperbolic space, and well, as before, the origin is within the body, and Î¼ is the curvature measure of C. Okay, and last. Okay, and last the condition, right? The three conditions here are necessary. Okay, and in the hyperbolic setup, there is no dilation, so it's really plain uniqueness. Okay, so some remark so maybe some remark about this curvature measure. So, in the case of a polyhedron, it's easy to guess. It's easy to guess the definition. So let me draw a picture. Okay, and let me assume that the origin is here. And then in this case, what is the measure? You just choose direction toward the Just choose direction toward the vertices. And let me call these directions, say, I don't know, maybe ui. And then mu is the sum of alpha i delta ui, where alpha i is the corresponding angle exterior. Angle, exterior angle at the vertex. Okay, so in this special case, there is no problem to define the curvature measure in the hyperbolic setting. You just mimic the Euclidean definition. But I claim that for general convex body in the hyperbolic space, it's a bit more complicated than in the Euclidean space. In the Euclidean space, and roughly the reason why it's like this, it's because of holonomy. Okay, somehow you, I don't have time to be really to give many details, but you want to define a measure on a single sphere. And we know that on a non-flat space, of course, depending on the course depending on the paths you you choose you you get different isometries between tangent spaces so you have to be careful to to define this curvature measure and maybe a last remark it is uh it is indeed uh true that you can prove uh this result maybe there is a question Maybe there is a question. So, do we miss something? Yeah, so there was a question in the chat concern. Yeah, okay. So, I mean, I'm gonna say a bit more about that. If you take any convex body in the hyperbolic space with the interior like this, and you define, you consider its curvature measure, then the curvature measure satisfy all these. Satisfy all these conditions here. Okay, sorry. I must. Sorry. Okay. Yes, thank you very much. My pleasure. So, yeah, as I said, you can indeed adapt Alexandrov's proof for the polydrone case. Or the polydrone case. So I mean the polydrone case means if you consider a measure mu like this, which has finite range, so roughly the convex body you're looking for is a convex polyhedron, then indeed you can adapt Alexandrov's proof, which is a topological argument, roughly, very roughly. But maybe it's important to emphasize that, okay, in your key. That's okay in Euclidean space, once you've got the proof for relative to the case of convex polyhedra, then you can proceed by approximation to prove at least the existence of a body. And this is no longer true in the hyperbolic space because somehow we are lacking of, well, we seek for compactness, which is which is given for free in Euclidean space just because you can dilate your body without changing the curvature measure. Okay, so that's the main difference, I think, compared to the Euclidean space. So yeah, maybe given the time I have, I want to say a few words about the uniqueness. words about the uniqueness of the body. In other terms, why when you know the curvature measure of a body, then the convex body is completely determined. And also maybe I will have time to say a few words about the proof of this Alexandrov condition, but I'm not sure. Sure. And well, as we will see, one of the main tools comes from integral geometry. Okay. Um Okay, so let's see definition of the curvature measure. So, as I said, the problem is because it's non-definitely. The problem is because it's non-flat, and so we have holonomy. So, the idea is to use: well, there is a well-known duality for convex body in Euclidean space, and we can do the same in the Minkowski space. So, instead of the Euclidean inner product, I consider the Minkowski metric, so let me write the formula. Okay. And so in this space, so it's a Lorentz space, there is, let me draw the light cone. The hyperbolic space here is realized as an hypersurface of this space. And so there is a very natural duality, which is, well, at least classical in the case of convex polyhedra. I don't know if it's I don't know if it is completely classical for general convex body. So now let me consider another hypercioface, which is the level set of Q equals one. So it's called the Dussiter space. And very, very quickly, sorry for that, there is a very easy correspondence between convex body in the hyperbody. Body in the hyperbolic space and some convex body in the Dossiter space, which follows from the standard duality of cones. So if I consider a cone, I hope you can see it on the picture. Yeah, apparently it's fine. So here is a C, a convex cone, and the intersection of this cone. And the intersection of this cone with the hyperbolic space is a convex subset in the hyperbolic space. And now, if I take the polar code of C, right? So let me call it C naught as usual. So of course here it's with respect to the new metric Q and the intersection of this cone with the dust. Of this cone with the Dossiter space is omega star. It's a let's say it's a convex set, so it's I call it a convex body, even if it's unbounded. Okay, so what is the problem here? So, of course. So, of course, the accabolic space is a Riemannian, but if you're not very familiar with the Dossiter space, here it's also a Lorentz space. The metric here is not positive definite. And so could be a problem, but if I draw another picture of my dual My dual convex set. So let me draw it in the case of a polyhedron. So then convex set is here. And what is a support hyperplane? Well, it's an ellipsoid. Right, and like this, and the reason why, well, it is just an hyperplane, right? It is just the intersection of an hyperplane with the Dossiter space, and to the normal of this plane correspond to the point on the boundary in omega. In omega. Okay, so you can use cone and vector hyperplane to do geometry between Desiter space and hyperbolic space. Okay. And so now the point is, given, sorry, yeah, for any, I don't know, maybe H Support hyperplane to say omega star or the boundary. Well, the restriction of the Minkowski metric to H is positive. So as a consequence, you can So as a consequence, you can define the area measure of the boundary. Just because, as can be guessed from this picture, the boundary of omega star here is homeomorphic to the sphere. Well, in some sense, in a radial way, right? Just take a port. Way, right? Just take a point and you look above, and you get a nice Billy-Schitz homeomorphism. And this, plus the fact that support upper plane are, say, are space-like, you can compute the area measure of the boundary of omega star. And as a consequence, you have a very Sequence, you have a very natural definition of a curvature measure. So let me write it down. So it's G is a gauss map, P and sigma. So what is P? If omega is a convex in the hyperbolic space, I have the origin within, so I can. Within, so I can parameterize the boundary of omega in a radial way, as I explained just before for the other convex body. So, this is the definition of capital P. G is just the ghost map, right. G is a ghost map from boundary of omega to what? Well, again, it's easy to check that you can identify using this model, you can define the ghost map with values into the Dossiter space. Into the Dossiter space, as in the Kiden space, it's a multi-valued map in general, but okay, it's fine. And so now with this definition, in Euclidean space, the curvature measure is defined like this, right? With G the standard gauss map and P the corresponding radial homomorphism. And you just then you just measure the size. Then you just measure the size, the area of all the normal vectors. And here, instead of that, we do not use sigma, but of course, we use the area measure of the dual body. Okay? And this is the definition of the curvature measure. And now it's well, it's an exercise to check that in the case of In the case of a convex polyhedron, the definition I gave, so you know the one with the vertices here, coincide with this more general definition there. Okay. Okay, so that's it for the definition of the curtain measure. Not the curvature measure. Okay, so now let me explain how integral geometry come into play. And so it's based on a generalization of the well-known sorry Crofton formula. Formula. So, well, so the Crofton formula is a way to compute the volume of a closed hyper surface in Euclidean space by means of the intersection number. So let me call sigma this closed hyper surface, smooth, say. And so you compute the intersection of sigma with a line. Line a fine line, say let me call it gamma, and then if you integrate over the space of a line with respect to a suitable sorry suitable measure, then you do have equality. Okay, so and it's related, this measure L is a relative. Measure L is related to the Grassmannian. Now there is a version of the Crofton formula in the Dossiter space, which is due to Solanes and Toifel Jill Solanes talk about this kind of thing. Talk about this kind of thing earlier this week. So, in the Dossiter space, their result is more general than just Dossiter space, but what we need is the Crofton formula in Dossiter space. So, the issue is now we say the Grassmannian space is not compact anymore. Compact anymore, so we have an integrability issue with this intersection number here. And the idea is simply to consider the difference of two hypersurface, right? So sigma one, sigma two, say smooth hypersurfaces. And they prove that then the volume Volume. Well, so of course, you cannot consider any hyper surface, you need them to satisfy this property, meaning that they are space-like. Again, the metric restricted to tangent space is a positive, and for such hypersurfaces, you have a cross. You have a Crofton type formula, so the difference of the volume is given by an integral. Okay, so it's sigma 2 intersected with gamma minus sigma 1 and now gamma is a Now gamma is a closed juristic. Okay, so that's a way to circumvent this compactness issue because roughly most of for many, many geodesics, the intersection numbers coincide and so what you get is integrable at the ID. That's the ID. And now, by approximation, you can prove the same formula for the boundary of convex body in the Sitter space without any smoothness. Okay. And okay. Now the question is: okay, what can we prove with this formula? Well, it's a consequence. I think the same consequence was proved in Euclidean space. There is a Space, there is a monotony property for the area measures. Okay, so let me state it with more detail. So, given two convex body Convex body as above. And let me assume that, say, for instance, omega one star is included into omega two star. Okay, and say, well, okay, they are contained in the upper alph. Of the sitter space. Then the volume of the boundary of omega two star is less or equal to that of omega one star. And if equality holds, then the bodies. Then all the bodies have to coincide. Okay, so it's a kind of isoparametric inequalities. And well, this is a consequence, actually, of the Crofton formula. And maybe a few remarks. Maybe a few remarks. Given the definition of the curvature measure, you see this result is not far from the uniqueness. Well, it's a bit more technical because what you need is to prove a kind of a local version of this assumption and also you And also, you have to be aware that the curvature measure, okay, it's related to the area measure, as I said before, but the relation, well, it's a bit twisted by the ghost map. But still, it's the same ID. And by using similar IDs, you can prove that the curvature measure. The curvature measure characterizes in a unique way the convex body. Okay, because for instance, if you assume that the same conclusion holds, then of course, if the polar bodies in Desiter space coincide, then applying the duality again, of course, you get so that omega one coincides. Omega 1 coincides with omega 2 whenever the curvature measure are the same, right? Somehow that's the scheme of proof. And maybe of, okay, okay, there is another application, but I think my time is over, so I'm going to stop here. Thanks. So let's thank the speaker. speaker um there was already a a question asked in the chat um by by joseph fu so maybe maybe he he wants to ask it now yeah hi uh thanks for the nice talk uh just just simple question i guess uh you talked about uh the curvature measure of polyhedral but i guess i if i understand correctly If I understand correctly, if the body is smooth, then this curvature measure is the so-called Gauss chronicle curvature, the integral of the determinant of the second fundamental form. Is that correct? Well, not exactly. Let's say first you define the curvature measure on the boundary, right? Say like this. And if the convex body is smooth, then indeed. Convex body is smooth, then indeed on the boundary it coincides with what you say, but then I pull back this measure onto the unit sphere around the origin. This is the p-term. And this is what makes this definition invariant by dilation in the Euclidean case. And with your definition, this is not invariant by dilation. Is not invariant by dilation. Of course, if you dilate the convex body nucleian space, then you change the second fundamental form. Okay? So you're just pulling it back by the by the by the radial homeomorphism. Right. Exponential map. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, thank you. Are there any further questions or remarks? Yeah, I have a question. So what happens if you allow part of your convex body to go to infinity in hyperbolic space? Because in hyperbolic space, you have an infinity that is okay, maybe it's at infinity, but still it's well defined and. But still, it's well defined. And can you say something? If part of your convex body is at infinity, what happens to these measures? Yeah, I don't know precisely because already in Euclidean space, it's not completely obvious. You need some information about somehow, as far as I remember, I think there is some result like this. There is some result like this in Alexandrov's book, but there is some assumption on the kind of asymptotic cone, right? And the problem is, I guess, sorry, if you, okay, let me come back to the definition. Well, you lose this property, I guess, if the body. I guess if the body is not compact. And well. I don't know. I don't know what can be proved. I thought maybe at that point, I thought maybe the infinity was better in a hyperbolic state than in Euclidean space, but maybe it's not the case. I don't know. It's not clear because it's important. No, no, it's not really better. No, no, it's not really better because the no okay so maybe I can ask one oh okay so maybe maybe uh Joseph Hoisington would like to ask a question so um please please Joseph yeah are there are there interesting things where a measure Are there interesting things where a measure can be realized as a convex body in Euclidean space and also in hyperbolic space, and how the realizations are related? Well, it's not there is some in the approach Yeah, um there is some well how to explain that um somehow uh say for for for the first half of the proof you can cheat a little bit and uh do as if you well I mean and do just Euclidean geometry, okay. But but then then it's not completely a Euclidean problem, right? Because problem, right? Because, well, here the duality somehow in the hyperbolic space is better than in Euclidean space. I mean, it depends how familiar you are with this picture here, but it's an actual duality. While in Euclidean space, well, I would say that The corresponding duality is something like this. So let's say now it's Rn plus one. And I take first an horizontal hyperplane where the last coordinate is one, another one with where the last coordinate is minus one, and then you can. And then you can mimic what I did. So if you take a convex cone and the polar cone and consider the intersection, it corresponds to omega and omega star, right? But now it's not completely satisfactory. Not a completely satisfactory duality and not really useful in your Keyan case. So I don't know if somehow you could deform the nice duality in hyperbolic space to get in the limit the Euclidean duality and maybe compare the approach, but it's not complete clear to me. And also the existence part The existence part is also rather different. We prove the existence part by solving a variational problem, and in Euclidean space, it's also possible to do that, but the functional are really not the same. I mean, in Euclidean space, it's a linear functional, while in the hyperbolic space, you have a non-convex functional. Yeah, so. yeah so so far it's not completely clear how uh so i'm sorry but it's yeah so so we are over time sorry so so unfortunately we need to stop and okay and proceed to to to the next show sorry no problem thanks okay so then um let's thank the speaker again and
