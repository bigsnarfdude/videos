Graciously his laptop, or else I wouldn't be able to share with you this ongoing work that we have been doing on investigating how the character of disclination lines is affected by the Gaussian curvature of the confining circles. And this coupling between Gaussian curvature and defects has been shown in 3D surfaces. So, in passive liquid crystals, point defects are attracted. Point defects are attracted to Gaussian curvature of like signs, which helps minimize the distortion in the liquid crystal. And additionally, this has been seen in active pneumatics too. But the question that we want to answer, the general question that we want to answer is: to what extent can the surface Gaussian curvature influence the types of defects that arise in a 3D liquid crystal? In a 3D liquid crystal bulk. Specifically, we ask this question in the context of the wonderful experiments that our collaborators have done when they put a mix of 5 CB and 8 CB liquid crystal in between a flat and a curved surface with a hybrid anchoring. And here, in the case of the curved surface having undulations going along one direction, what they find in Direction. What they find in experiments is the formation of these parallel disclination lines that are stable. And in simulations as well, we only find this configuration of alternating winding of disclination lines. However, when the curved surface has undulations going on in two directions, so think of your egg crate. What happens in experiments, you can see here it starts in pneumatic, and then it is cooled down into the smectic. And then it is cooled down into the smectic phase. So, as everyone has heard about the focal clonic domains, you can see the focal clonic domains that arise here. And again, there arises as it's heated back into the nematic there. You see the formation of these disclination lines again. But the arrangement seems to be different, and there seems to be several metastable states that arise in these experiments. experiments. So here is the an arrangement of the disclination lines. And why is it that when you have a non-zero Gaussian curvature now, why does it all become weird? But specifically, what we want to answer is: how does Gaussian curvature affect the arrangement of these disclination lines? These disclination lines? And how does the non-zero Gaussian curvature of the curved surface affect the winding characteristic of disclination lines that arise in the nematic? So what we want to do is simulate the formation of these disclination lines coming from the spectrum to the nematic. And we use our friend Landau Dijen free energy that we have seen throughout this week. And what I use is the three. What I use is the three constant of distortion free energy in order to have in order to have separate in order to be able to dictate the different modes of distortions in the pneumatic with crystalline. But I mentioned that I wanted to model from smectic to pneumatic. So clearly this is not coming from anisotropic. Not coming from anisotropic phase. So, what we do is we adapt this Landau DeGen free energy and use a multi-step application of Landau free energy minimization in order to start from a smectic-like phase and go deep into the pneumatic to get the disclination lines. So, the first step is to assume an arrangement of the focal conic domains as shown here, and we make use of the fact that inside Make use of the fact that inside focal conic domains, the director, the arrangement of the director, is known analytically. However, the first challenge is that how do we patch the director field outside of the focal conic domains? So we do this first step in which we perform a relaxation of the bulk constrained by the director field inside of the focal conic minutes. Of the focal conic menu. So, from here, we get a smectic-like arrangement of the director field in the entire liquid crystal bulb. Now that we have that, we perform a relaxation in the entire liquid crystal bulk. Note that I have these ratios of K1 and K2 to approximate the divergence of the twist, the twist elastic. The twist elastic parameter in the spectrum phase. And finally, to drive the results deep into the pneumatic, we perform a final relaxation with a one-constant approximation. So what do we get? This is one of the metastable states that we find in the nematic phase. And as Pa mentioned earlier, the sclonation lines either end on the boundaries. Either end on the boundaries or end on themselves, as shown clearly here. And also, I mark the positions of the focal conic domains that I used when I initialize the system. So also, I show an inset of the other metastable states at Yambao. But how do we make sense of this array of disclination lines? So, in 2D, we can So, in 2D, we can easily assign a charge for defects by looking at the winding of the director field around that defect. However, in 3D, the director field can rotate continuously around a disclination. So to characterize the 3D disclination lines that we find, we use this rotation vector, which tells us the axis at which the The director rotates around the destination line. So here are the special cases: the plus one-half wedge, which corresponds to a plus one-half winding, and then we have a twist configuration, and finally a minus one-half wedge profile. So we use this tool first to understand coming first from an initial And coming first from an initial isotropic configuration, which was obtained from an isotropic dinematic quench in the same double-endelated system, but with one constant approximation. And this is the director field. The green lines are the defects, and the blue tiny lines are the directors on the flat surface of the flat surface. The flat surface. So we calculate the rotation vector and we get this parameter, this angle beta. So I color this by the angle beta, which is the angle that is made between the rotation vector and the tangent vector of the disclination bytes. So earlier it was mentioned that the free energy density, the saddle splay free energy density, gives us a sense. Gives us a sense of the winding or the winding of the charge of defects. However, we also find that this parameter is proportional to the negative of cosine beta. So we specifically look at the endpoints of the defects. So those endpoints of the defects that touch the flat surface, as I have marked in black here. And we calculate the And we calculate the saddle slave free energy and compare it to the Gaussian curvature of the curved surface directly on top. And we find this distinct separation between points with negative saddle split, which correspond to having a plus one-half winding, whereas you have these end points. You have these endpoints that are found in regions where you have positive Gaussian curvature and negative saddle splay-free energy corresponding to positive winding. So clearly we can see that although this is looking at the flat surface, the Gaussian curvature of the curved undulated surface determines the winding of the disconnectation endpoints on the opposite surface. Now we go back to the spectral. To the spectral-like kinematic result that I've shown earlier. And we find that most of the disclinations that we get in this spectrum-like to pneumatic configuration, so this is after the third step when all the elastic constants are equal to each other. Despite twists not being penalized more, we find that there are minimal twists in the system, only in this region. only in this regions where there's I drew the I drew the omega vector and we find that there's this tiny twist as the height of the as the height of the disclination line changes. Now comparing and then looking at the same the flat the end points of these defects we find again this separation although we find that for Separation. Although we find that for the points with negative one-half winding, they are mostly located where we have zero or slightly negative Gaussian curvature. And then comparing with the this is comparing with the results that arose from the isotropic to pneumatic phase transition, we can clearly see the difference. Can clearly see the difference of the winding character or the types of disclination lines that arise. Also, I'd like to highlight: we have these plus one point defects that appear as the split core disclination lines or split core defects. And in the initial smectic-like configuration, comparing with the isotropic initialization, we have a correct. Initialization: We have a characteristic that is different from both, suggesting that we have for the isotropic initialization, we get this divergent form of the plus one point method, whereas in the smectic pneumatic phase transition simulation, we get this plus one converging type of plus one. Plus one defects. So clearly, we see that the disclination configuration at the nematic phase depends on the initialization of the system. So there's still a lot that we want to do. So we've only looked at the endpoints of the disclination lines. Hopefully the next time I'm able to see you, I'll be able to talk more about the behavior of the disclination bulk and how this couples with the Gaussian curvature or if there are other factors that affect the That affects the winding of the disclosation. And with that, I wanted to conclude my presentation. And also, I wanted to thank my advisor and my gracious labmates for being so kind and understanding. And I also want to thank everyone for staying here, despite it being 8:30. And I'm open for questions. So in one of the first simulation pictures you showed of the pneumatic configuration relaxed from spectrum, it looked like the pneumatic disinclinations ended at exactly the points at which the ellipses touched each other. Yes. Do you have an explanation for why that's the case? Show the thing that he's talking about. Here? Yes. So at least in the picture on the left, it looks like the destinations go to the boundary. Yeah, exactly where the latest is the focal plane touch. I would think it's probably because of the arrangement of the display, the initial system, the initialization coming from the spectrum-like arrangement. You would have. You would have a defect here. So I suppose that it did not get annihilated at very deep relaxation.
