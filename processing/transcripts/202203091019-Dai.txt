Yeah, we are pleased to have Irving Dye talking about equivariant knots in knot for the model. All right, well, thank you for the invitation. All right, well, thank you for the invitation to speak. So, the title of my talk is Equivariant Knots and Knot Floor Homology, and this is joint work with Abhishek Malik and Matt Stoffergen. So first a little bit about what I want to say in the talk. So the talk is nominally about equivariant knots, and I realize that perhaps not everybody in the audience has thought about equivariant knots. So my goal will be to tell you a little bit about equivalent knots, tell you some interesting things. Tell you some interesting problems, some things that we could solve about equivariance, and then also some problems which thinking about equivariant knots unexpectedly helps you to solve. And in order to do this, before I begin, let me just give a very broad outline of the talk. So the first thing I'm going to do in the first part of the talk is tell you about equivariant lots and equivariant questions. And in particular, I will tell you about a result about the equivariant slice genus. And I didn't say what this is, but you can probably imagine what it is. Then in the second part of the talk, I want to talk about something which at first seems completely unrelated to equivariant knots. And this will be distinguishing slice surface. Slice surfaces of a knot up to isotopy rel boundary, distinguishing slice surfaces. And I want to give an interesting example where somehow thinking about equivalent knots has something to do with sort of pairs of exotic pairs of sliced disks. So I mean exotic pairs of sliced discs. Slice this. And I'll explain why this second part of the talk actually is related to the first part of the talk. Okay, and then at the end we will see if there are any more parts of the talk. All right, so let me begin. So firstly, let me formally define an equivariant knot for you. So in this talk, when I say equivariant knots, I mean a pair of k mean a pair of k comma tau. k here is of course a knot in S3. And tau, this is an orientation preserving involution of S3. So tau is a smooth involution of S3, orientation preserving. I will assume that it has non-empty fixed point 7. Non-empty fixed point set. And of course, tau is supposed to fix my non-K subwise. Now, you might ask, well, why do I, you know, there's certainly other sort of involutions on S3. You could say that, why not say tau is, you know, orientation reversing, so on. So, you know, I think this will be talked about in some talks later, later this week, but for the purpose of this. Later this week, but for the purpose of this talk, I'm only going to consider this sort of symmetry. So let me just install the intelligence very briefly by drawing a sort of silly, you know, horse. So here I have the trefoil, okay? And so the trefoil obviously is sort of symmetric, you know, about 180 degree rotation around this axis. There is, of course, also another symmetry of the drift oil. Symmetry of the trifoil, where I sort of twirl the trifoil around sort of the core of this solid torus, 180-degree twirl around the core of this solid torus. Okay, and in fact, you know, so if you have an involution tau on S3 with non-empty fixed point set orientation preserving, it is actually a theorem that the fixed point set of that involution is in fact an unknotted copy of Sy. So it's the unknot. Of Sy. So it's the unknot. So in fact, here I could actually basically have just told you an equivari is exactly what you think it is. I could assume that there's just this axis of symmetry, and I literally have a knot which is symmetric about the axis of symmetry. Now, of course, in this picture, I've sort of taken the point at infinity and drawn it for you. So this is what I mean by an equivariant mount here. And to establish some terminology, actually. To establish some terminology, actually, if you look at this, these two kinds of symmetries that I've drawn here, they actually have slightly, they have different names and linear. So this symmetry, you observe that the fixed point axis of tau has two fixed points of the knot. So this sort of symmetry is called a strong inversion of the knot. And such a knot is called strong. Um and such a knot is called strongly invertible. And in this picture, this axis of symmetry, there are no fixed points on the knot. Okay, and this is called two-periodic intervention. And this is just like words. It's just some terminology for two slightly different kinds of interventions. Okay? So these are equivariant knots. And well, you know, why study equivalent? You know, why study equivariant knots? Okay, so the first thing I'm going to tell you is that equivariant knots are quite common. So there's some statistic that 85% of knots, up to and including 10 crossings, emit at least one strong inversion. Of course, those knots are somehow small, but the phenomena of having this kind of symmetry are a knot is not a rare phenomenon. It's an extremely common phenomenon. So there are many, many equivariant knots. And I should say there's And I should say, you know, there's a little bit of subtlety. It could be that I have a knot which has a symmetry, but I could draw the diagram in just a way such that the symmetry is not apparent. So actually, it is not obvious how you know when you've sort of listed all the symmetries of the line. Whether there's some hyperbolic geometry and things like that, Snappy can tell you the symmetry group of the knot. So there's some interesting math that goes into that. I'm not going to talk about it in this talk. So, but actually, let me give you the story of how we sort of became interested in equivariant knots. So, the story, so this is sort of like a little aside. So, there are a couple of interesting facts that relate equivariant knots to some other things in topology. Okay, so if k If K is an equivariant knot, well, of course, I can perform surgery on K. Let's say I perform 1 over n surgery on K. Then 1 over n surgery on K gives is, of course, a 3 manifold, and the 3 manifold inherits asymmetry. If you're not asymmetric, then the 3 manifold also is symmetric. So 1 over, let's say, 1 over n surgery on K I give you, actually, any surgery on K. n surgery on k, actually any surgery on k, but in particular, 1 over n surgery on k is an integer homology sphere sort of with symmetry. Okay? And well, it turns out that if k is slice, then actually this homology sphere bounds a contractible manifold. So this 1 over n squared on k bounds smooth contractible manifold. Smooth, contractible manifold. Okay, so now I have a smooth contractable manifold with a symmetry on the boundary. Okay, and well, if the disk for K, if the slice disk for K is also equivariant, which I haven't told you exactly what it, well, I'll say more precisely this in a moment, but you know, probably is what you think it is. If the disk you think it is. If the disk for k is equivariant, then the boundary symmetry on this contractible manifold extends over the contractible manifold. But if the disk is not equivariant, or you can't find an equivariant disk, then it's not obvious whether or not the boundary symmetry here extends over the contractible manifold. And of course, if you know a little bit about a smooth form manifold topology, then you know that I'm describing to you the situation of a point. Describing to you the situation of a point. These are fundamental objects in the study of smooth form manifold topology. So actually, the current project grew out of a previous different project. So this previous different project was sort of past project, and this was also with Matt and Abhishek, but it was With Matt and Abhishek, but it was a different Matt. So, Matt Hedden and Abhishek Malik joined work with Matt Hedden and Abishek Malik, where we studied quarks, and especially some quarks that were constructed in this manner as one over surgery on some symmetric slice knots. So then this sort of got us interested in equilibrium knots and things like that. Equivariant knots and things like that. Now, I won't talk too much about this, but there is a connection, there's an interesting connection between equivariant knots and quarks. So, this is one motivation for studying equivalent knots. Okay, all right, so what kind of questions can you ask about equivary knots? Well, so in the So, in this talk, I want to give you one particular question. So, what's like the most obvious question you could ask? Well, let me give you a definition. So, if I have an equivariant knot, either strongly invertible or periodic, so I can define the equivariant slice genus of the knot. And this is exactly what you think it is. So, instead of D4. So instead of G4, I could denote this G4 tilde. So G4 tilde of K is equal to, well, this is the minimum genus of sigma, okay, where sigma is an equivariant slice surface for K inside of B4. Okay, and what do I mean by an equivariant slice surface? Well, given the fact that I told you that the I told you that the tau on S3, you could just assume that it's 180-degree rotation along a very trivial axis. There's a very obvious extension of that involution over B4. So there's an involution of B4, which of course on the boundary of B4 restricts to the obvious rotation in S3. And of course, an equivariant slice surface, a smooth equivalent slice surface is, of course, just a slice surface which is invariant. Just a slice surface which is invariant, which is set Y sent to itself under this involution of before. Okay, so this is the equivariant slice genus, the smooth equivalent slice genus of an equivariant knot. I have a question about that. So knots can have different kinds of periods and different kinds of symmetry. Implicitly, I am fixing an involution on this K, and I'm suppressing it from the image. Of course, for different symmetries of the same. Of course, for different symmetries of the knot, could be different. So whenever I say equivariant knot, I have in mind a particular symmetry of the knots. All right. So this is the equivariant slice genus. And of course, the most simple version of the question is, as I was referencing with this discussion, of course, could you have a slice knot which admits a symmetry, but there's no symmetric slice disk. So that would be, you have a slice knot with equivariance genus greater than zero. Not with equivariance genus greater than zero. Okay? And of course, so the overriding question is: what is the difference between the equivariant slice genus and the usual slice genus of a knot? And so let me give you a little bit of history of this problem. Okay, so and it turns out, so the reason I made the distinction about the begin in the beginning about strongly invertible and periodic knots is that strangely enough, the tools That strangely enough, the tools I use to study these two different kinds of symmetries turn out to be sort of very different. So, just some sort of historical results. So, if you're studying a periodic knot and you're studying whether it's equivariantly sliced, this is well studied by several authors. I'll just list a few. And it turns out that there are some conditions on the Alexander polynomial of the knot that restrict it from being equivariantly sliced. If you have a periodic knot, there are some conditions on the Alexander polynomial where you can say, this is sliced, but I'm not equivariantly sliced. And this is specifically for sort of periodic symmetries. So for strongly invertible knots, Rudable knots. This is also well studied. And I should say that the work about slice, equivariant sliceness in the periodic case, I think the papers are sort of around maybe 2000. And for the strongly invertible case, it's also well studied. I think the paper is around maybe 1980s. This is by Sakuma. And Sakuma And Sakuma turns out that, as you can imagine, there's some sort of equivariant concordance group. And Sakuma actually constructed a very, very powerful invariant, the eta polynomial, which, so if I denote the equivariant concordance group, let me call it C tilde. Turns out the eta polynomial gives homomorphism from the equivariant concordance group to some set of polynomials. Some set of polynomials. I think maybe it's the TT inverse of a. I don't exactly remember. So, but it's actually quite a powerful thing. This is very good at barring strongly invertible slice knots from being equivariantly sliced. And so let me emphasize, so both of these sort of sets of results were specifically about obstructing equivariant slices. There's no, as far as I know, there's no way to obstruct. As I know, there's no way to obstruct, for example, to get bounds on the equivalent genus using these techniques. But in a fairly recent paper, sort of, I think maybe last year or two years ago. So Keegan Boyle and Ahmed Issa studied Studies sort of say higher genus periodic case. So this is Oilissa. And they proved the following really nice result. So it's due to them. So they showed that actually there exists, you know, exists family of Of two periodic knots. So these are for which, of course, the equivariant genus minus the usual genus becomes arbitrarily large in the fountain. So the notions of equivalent genus and regular genus can be. Can be arbitrarily different. And they asked whether this is true for strongly invertible ones. And so, of course, what I'm going to tell you is that we answer this question in the affirmative using not formality. So this is the equivariant question that I wanted to present to you in this talk. So let me just Let me give the uh sort of the main sort of technical theorem of the talk. So this is theorems slash program. So the idea is that if I give you an equivariant knot, k comes. not k, tau. This is going to be an almost contentless theorem. If I give you an equivariant not k, tau, then we can define some numerical invariants using not floor homology. I will just write the names of these numerical invariants. So these are V upper, V upper, alright, V upper tau, V lower tau, V upper iota tau, V lower iota tau. Okay. I would have tau, okay? And these invariants, these are sort of invariants of this knot together with its symmetry. And of course, appropriate functions of these invariants bound the equivariant slice genus from below. In particular, if any of them are non-zero, then the non is obstructed from being equivariantly sliced. So some functions of these Bound the equivalent in this triple. And so, of course, we just find some family and calculate these invariants and then obtain this result in the strongly invertible setting. Now, the reason I've said it's a fur slash program is, of course, in life, it is not sufficient simply to define urine variance from fluorohomology. One must occasionally. One must occasionally be able to actually compute them in particular examples. So, you know, in addition to defining it, of course, there's some surrounding schema for calculating it in various cases, which encompasses some expanding bag of tricks. And I will get into that a little bit maybe near the end of the talk. But I'm not going to exactly tell you, I'm not going to exactly give the exact definition of the user. If you are very familiar with us, If you are very familiar with floor homology, then you probably have a very, you know, the construction of these sort of numerical invariants follows very well-established lines. And I think that rehashing those lines would be very boring. And if you are not very familiar with floor homology, then I think you will also find it boring. So I'm not going to give the precise definition of these invariants, but I will say two very, very vague things about them. So the first thing About them. So the first thing, of course, is that these are defined using sort of the induced action of your symmetry on the knot-floor homology of your note. So of course the idea is: well, if K has a symmetry, then of course, you would believe that the knot-floor homology, not floor. The not-floor homology, not floor complex, okay, also inherits an automorphism coming from the symmetry. Actually, this is not 100% obvious for reasons that I will say at the end of the talk. But of course, this is the idea. So we define this, and then you can cook up some numerical invariance using this action of the Nauthor complex in a very standard way. So this is the first vague thing that I want to say. The second vague thing is that actually these invariants here Um these invariants here, these are actually large surgery invariants. And this will also become relevant at the end of the talk. So what this means is that nominally these invariants are defined using the induced action of the symmetry on the not-floor complex, but actually you could also define them by taking Large Sergi and your knot and looking at the three-manifold Hagar floor homology of the resulting three-manifold. Hagard floor homology of the resulting free manifold, okay, which I just told, you know, I told you also inherits a symmetry, and you could sort of study the symmetry action on that fluore complex. And I should say that the reason that the symmetry action on the three-manifold level is related to the symmetry action on the not level, this is some sort of surgery formula, aquivariant surgery formula, which was actually established by Abbas. Actually, established by Abhishek, one of the co-authors on this project. So that interpretation, which will be important, sort of is due to him. And in fact, that's why we embarked on this project. We were trying to study the three-manifold action. But then we were like, well, maybe we can use the not-level action to answer some questions about knots. So this is how this browser developed. Alright, so that's sort of all I will say at this moment about the definition of these. Okay, now, so how did we construct our family that gives the analog of Boylus's theorem in the strongly invertible setting? Well, it's actually laughably simple. So the family is like this. Okay, so let's let K here, so K here, let me So K here, let me, let me, maybe I'll say Kn. So Kn here is going to be the 2n 2n plus 1 torus knot. The 2n 2n plus 1 torus knot admits a strong evolution. In fact, it emits a unique strong involution up to conjugation. And what do you do? Well, the first thing you think about is taking the connected sum of k n with itself. Now, on the connected sum of k n with itself, The connected sum of k and length itself, it turns out that there are two obvious symmetries. Okay, the first thing I can do is I can take the connected sum sort of like this. You know, I've drawn the symmetry axis of this knot. I just stack the knots on top of each other. I connected some like this. The connected sum also has a symmetry, which fixes each of the factors of the connected sum. There's also another thing you could. There's also another thing you could do, which is you could take the knot, can, okay, you could rotate it 180 degrees out of the board. Maybe I should technically draw it something like this. If it connects on this way, and then could have a symmetry, there's the obvious symmetry which exchanges the. There's the obvious symmetry which exchanges the two factors. Now, actually, technically, you might worry whether this is now connects something Kn with Kn reverse or something like that. Somewhat confusingly, because Kn admits a strong inversion, it is isotopic to its reverse. So I will just think of this as Kn, both of these as Kn, some K. But I have these two strong inversions on Kn some Kn, and somehow they're very different, because one of them fixes each one of the factors and the other one commutes the two factors. Okay, now what do I do? Well, then, what I obviously, well, Well then, what I obviously, well, you know, maybe I should have actually drawn the picture already. So then I just take the first thing and I subtract the second thing. So here, I sort of mirror the second thing, okay? And I take the connected sum of the first thing. Okay, and while this, and sorry, so now the connected sum looks like this. Apologies for the Some looks like this. Apologies for the slightly lousy picture. Okay, but so this knot is, you know, trivially sliced. Okay? But it turns out that it is not equivariantly sliced. And in fact, this family, as n gets larger and larger, furnishes the example that is the generalization of Boyle and S's, or the analog of Boyle and Niss's theorem, right? And again, why should you expect that this knot has high equivalent denness? You know, it has high equivariantiness precisely because these two subtracted two involutions from each other, which were very different. One of them interchanges the factors, the other one fits in the factors. So we calculate our invariants for this family, and the invariants become very large. Now, you might ask, how do you calculate the invariance for this family? Well, it's not very exciting. So the Taurus knot is very simple. You know, sort of the action of tau on the torus knot is determined for formal reasons. You then prove a connected sum formula. So you can calculate the action of tau on kn some kn. This other symmetry down here is a little bit more complicated. But after all, it doesn't look that silly. I just interchange the two factors. Calculating this symmetry, the action of this symmetry is a little bit more subtle, but it can be done. And then of course you have the connected sum formula, so you can sum these together. So, you can sum these together and you just calculate everything going. Okay? All right. So, this was the construction. Okay? Which sort of, okay, so this was fine. You know, there was a very well-defined echovariant knots question, and sort of we answered it using these invariants. Okay? All right, so that is what I wanted to say about equivariant models. So now I want to tell you about something that seems like completely different. Okay, and I think this is a very Like completely different. And I think this is very interesting because it's an application of thinking about equivariant knots to a question which is not a priori an equivariant knot question. And this will be about distinguishing slice surfaces for a knot up to isotope. So if you have a knot, you have some smoothly embedded sliced surfaces in the four-ball. And of course, usually we care about those sliced surfaces up to isotopy rel boundary. And, you know. And, you know, it turns out that there's an interesting phenomena which occurs, which is that you could have two slice surfaces, okay, which are sort of isotopic in the topological category, or maybe I should say topological, locally flat category, but are not smoothly isotopic to each other. People like exotic phenomena, so this is an example of an exotic phenomena. In recent years, there has been sort of an interesting set of results and papers. Interesting set of results and papers by several authors about finding such examples. So let me give some history. So well, before actually giving the history, let me point out to you. So of course the question is how to find sort of exotic pairs of sliced surfaces. Of slice surfaces or not. Okay? So, of course, you know, they're two points, right? So, when I come up with an example for you, you know, you have sort of two slice surfaces, okay? And, well, you know, trivially, you need to know two things. I mean, first of all, you have to have some reason that sigma one and sigma two are topologically isotopic. Isotopic, sort of rel boundary. And then, of course, you have to have a reason why sigma 1, sigma 2 are not smoothly isotopic, rel boundary. So sigma 1, sigma 2, not smoothly isotopic, rel boundary. And of course, depending on your background, one or the other of these questions is the easier one to answer. So I will focus on the second part of the question. And how does one usually Of the question. And how does one usually, you know, how do you obstruct smooth isotopia of surfaces route boundary? Well, it's, you know, this is a sort of in some ways very straightforward consequence of, you know, the quote-unquote TQFT structure of, you know, mouthwater multi or things like that. You know, if you have, you know, if you have, you know, if you have, let's say, a slice surface, you know, you can sort of puncture it, you know, and get the unlocked. You know, and the slice surface, you know, in one And the slice surface, in whatever kind of homology theory you care about, like not floor homology, cobon homology, et cetera, the slice surface will induce a map from the complex of the n-not, which is always sort of standard and trivial, into the complex of your not K. And all of these theories have the sort of, roughly speaking, the nice property that up to homotopy of the map does not depend on the smooth isophanic. Depend on the smooth isotopic class of your surface. So if I give you two surfaces, I compute these two maps, I look at their images. If the images are different, I conclude that my two surfaces were not smoothly isotopic. And this is not certainly not my idea. It is a very old idea. And basically using this idea, the last few years, there was, you know, there have been several papers There have been several papers finding interesting examples of sort of exotic pairs of slice surfaces. So let me name a few. So using not floor homology, I'm going to say positive genus here. So this was studied by Andres Juhas, Maggie, and Ian. So using not floor homology, they gave examples of pairs of higher genus exotic surfaces, genus greater than zero. In fact, they didn't just give pairs, they gave infinitely many larger families. So they used not floor homology. And then slightly more recently, using cabana homology. Using Habanophomology, well, I'll put it in the Pobanophomology. There's a nice paper by Kyle Hayden and Isaac Sinberg, which gave an example of an exotic pair of disks for a splice, not that we're distinguished by their maps in cobotopomology, actually. That example had previously been known to Hayden for some other reasons, but it doesn't exactly For some other reasons, but it doesn't exactly fit into the story, so I'm not going to talk about that previous paper of his. And I want to point out something, which is that in the first result, it turned out to be, it's sort of difficult in the knot floor case to exactly calculate these maps. And it turned out that for their proof, it was very important that the surfaces have the genus greater than. Are there genus greater than zero? And so they actually asked whether or not there was this question: can not floor homology distinguish exotic pairs of disks? So this was an example of hygiene of surfaces. And here, in Cavado homology, somehow the maps are explicitly computable. So they were able to do an example of an exotic pair of disks using Cavada homology. And of course, Kyle and Isaac also asked the same question. Can knophler homology be used? Can nophalo homology be used to distinguish an exotic pair of this? Okay? And we actually answer this question in the affirmative, and it has to do with equivariant knots. Okay, so I want to tell you about this. So what in the world could symmetries of knots have to say about exotic pairs of surfaces or distinguishing surfaces? Distinguishing surfaces up to isotopy real boundary. Okay, so let me let me give you, let me introduce like a slightly strange definition, okay, which is this is a slight modification of the notion of equivariant genus. This is called the isotopy equivariant genus, which we define. So the isotopy equivariant genus is, of course, going to be the minimum of genus sigma over all isotopy sum. Isotopy, sounds topological, isotopy equivariant slice surfaces, sigma for, you know, K, N B for. Okay, so what do I mean by the isotopia invariant? A slice surface, okay? So remember I told you that the symmetry on S3 extends to this obvious symmetry of B4. So a slice. So a slice surface sigma is isotopy equivariant if sigma is isotopic rel boundary to its reflection under this symmetry extension. Okay, so I don't require that the surface be exactly equivariant. I just care that, well, the surface then is reflecting an isolation. Well, the surface then is reflecting an isotopic rel boundary. Okay, now you might think that this is like a very constructive notion, and indeed it is a constructive notion. And in fact, we don't have an example in which we know that this quantity is different from studying the honest equivariant slice genus. But it turns out that the invariants we wrote down, they don't just bound the equivariant slice genus, they actually bound the isotopy equivariant genus. Now, why is Now, why is that useful? So there's a trivial observation which is this. Suppose that I have a knot, and the knot has, let's say that the slice genus of the knot is, I don't know, three, and I calculate the isotopy equivariant slice genus, and the isotopy equivalent slice genus is six, is bigger than the actual slice genus. Well, I can take any... I can take any slice surface of genus less than six and take its reflection. And those two surfaces are automatically not isotopic rel boundary. I mean, tautologically, if they were isotopic rel boundary, then the isotopy equivariance of lexogenus would be at most that number. So, for example, in particular, if I have a slice knot, and I calculate the so-called isotopy equivariant slice genus of that slice knot, and it's greater. Slice genus of that slice naught, and it's greater than zero, then I can take any slice disk for the naught I want, and I take its reflection under tau b4, and I know that those two disks are not isotopic to each other real well. Now, this is like a very trivial consequence of the definition, okay? But I want to emphasize this is a very strange shift in perspective. Usually when I'm like, oh, I want to construct examples of non-isotopic slice surfaces, you know, Slice surfaces, you know, I give you the slice, you know, you have to have some reason. You know, the slice surfaces have to be very different, you know, in some sense. You have to some reason. I give you the surfaces, and you're like, oh, there's some reason these two surfaces. I have to look at the surfaces. But in this formulation, I don't really care what the surfaces are. The only important thing about the surfaces is that they're related by this symmetry. Somehow, the non-isotopicness of the surfaces are tied up with the tied. Are tied up in the complicatedness of the symmetry on the knots. So the slogan is that calculating this isotopy equiferidinus of K gives a way of generating a Non-isotopic fly surfaces in the presence of a symmetry on K. You know, if K is symmetric, then the point is that I think my meaning is clear. Okay? And, well, okay, so then, you know, I haven't said anything about exotic pairs. Okay, now, you know, of course, distinguishing, you know, surface. Distinguishing surfaces of the isotopia with no other restriction is actually, there are many, many ways to do this. You don't have to go through the, you know, the thing about the floor homology, distinguishing the surfaces, you know, rel isotopy is, you know, rel boundary is, you know, is interesting because in principle that could give you a difference between the smooth and topological category. But, you know, of course, you know, if you just want to distinguish things, if you don't care about the exotic question, then, you know, for example, you can compute things like. Then, for example, you can compute things like fundamental group of the surface complement and things like that. So, does this strategy actually happen? And I need, for example, example where you can get exotic pairs of surfaces? And the answer is yes. So, I've drawn here a particular example. So, this example was in fact, this knot is originally due to Kyle Hayden. And, in fact, he And in fact, he brought this not to our attention, so we are indebted to him for sort of asking whether R. Sorry? Isn't that 3, negative 3, 3? This one? No, no, it's not. This is some 15 crossing knots. The 3, yeah, it is not. Sergion, this is also a cork, which I will say, but this is not. I don't believe it is. This is like about a 5 to 15 crossing knot. It's 15 crossing knots. Well, all right. So he, so this knot is a slice knot. Okay, there's one slice disk, which is given by compressing along this red curve here. There's another slice disk, which is given by compressing along the other obvious reflected, the reflected curve. And of course, those two slice disks happen to be related by the obvious symmetry. And Kyle and then, you know, Kyle and Isaac. And then Kyle and Isaac showed that this pair of disks is topologically isotopic, but not smoothly isotopic. And maybe I'll just say a few words. So the topological isotopy part follows from work of Anthony Conway and Mark Powell. So this is Alexander polynomial one-naught. And these, you know, Kyle made a calculation of the fundamental groups of these disk complements, and both of them are Z. And so by. Of them are z, and so by some Friedman-Similar theorem due to Anthony Conner and Markel, those disks are topologically isotopic. But for example, you can calculate the Kavanov maps for these two disks, and they are different, and so they're not smoothly isotopic. So this was his example. And we actually replicate this example using not port homology. And as I said, in fact, we show that not only are these two disks not isotopic, relative Disks not isotopic rel boundary, but any pair of symmetric disks for this knot are not isotopic rel boundary. Okay, so you know, we do the calculation, the isotopia covariant genus of this particular knot is greater than zero, even though it is still isotope. Okay, and in fact, something slightly stronger is true. Actually, it turns out that I can modify this definition of isotope equivariantinus even further, okay, in the following way. In the following way. So here, I search for slice surfaces σ inside of B4, which are isotopic to the reflection. But it turns out that I could actually say I allow you to search for any smoothly embedded slice surface sigma inside of any homology ball. Any homology ball W, so any homology ball W whose boundary is S3, okay, and I can also relax the notion of sigma and its reflection. So instead, before I said sigma has to be isotopic rel boundary to tau b4 sigma, okay, here I can allow you to use any Or I can allow you to use any smooth self-diffeomorphism of W such that it restricts on the boundary to the symmetry of S3, okay, and then sort of I require that sigma is isotopic to its quote-unquote reflection. So I can weaken the notion, I can weaken the format of. Notion, I can weaken the four manifold, it doesn't have to be four, bb4, and I can weaken the notion of reflection. Reflection now literally means that I take any extension of my boundary involution to a self-defeism of the W, and I push forward the surface under that, and I ask whether those two things are isotopic rel bound. Okay, and again, in fact, you know, the homology, isotopy, echovari genus of this knot is greater than, you know, I mean, our invariance bound this notion as well, which is not very surprising if you know about, you know, homology. If you know about flow hormones, okay, so again, let me emphasize: this is a very peculiar thing, okay? Like, you know, this knot is slice and it has a symmetry, but it is not like, you know, the slice-ness is not symmetric in the broadest possible, you know, sense that you could ask for. Okay? All right, so maybe you will ask a very fair question. Fine, so how do we do computations? We do computations. For this knot, well, so maybe I will say a little bit about that. Though this will be sort of slightly more technical, but so well, the idea for doing some sort of, you know, again, let me emphasize, you know, in principle, you know, saying something like, I have some induced symmetry of the not-floor complex, usually that sort of thing is almost impossible to compute directly. Impossible to compute directly in fluoro homology. So you need some sort of trick to try to get a handle on these sorts of invariants. The trick we use is some sort of monotonicity under something like crossing changes or definite coborces. So for example, a very simplified version is: if you're familiar with various invariants in not for homology, then you know that if you do some crossing changes, then Some crossing changes, then you know a little bit about how those invariants could possibly change. Maybe you know you do a crossing change, you know, one invariant has to be less than or equal to the other. Okay, things like that. Very paraphrase. So you might imagine that, well, if we set up these, you know, we set up this formalism, you know, if I do, let's say, an equivariant set of crossing changes, then our equivariant invariants will satisfy some sort of monotonicity property. Okay? And actually, Property. And actually, there's a sort of generalization of this idea, which is that because I told you that the invariants, these sort of V upper and V lower invariants, are large surgery invariants, what you can do is you can pass the large surgery on the not, okay? And the invariants are actually defined on the level of the three manifold floor homology, and you can construct an ecovariant negative definite cobordism out to some other three manifold within the luxury, okay? Three manifold within the new field. And it turns out that these invariants are in some sense monotonic under some, you know, this sort of thing. So for example, if you're sort of, if you are a little bit familiar, the most basic example of this principle is like, you know, the D invariant, which is, you know, maybe people are familiar with D invariant for, let's say, homology spheres. You may know that the D invariant satisfies some monotonicity property under negative definite couples. So R invariant. Negative definite coupletism. So R invariant satisfies some monotonicity proper under equivariant negative definite coordinates. Okay, why is this relevant? So actually, the way we compute this example is that, so this knot is a genus one knot, so actually plus one surgery on this knot constitutes large surgery. And you look at this picture for a very long time, and you observe that, for whatever reason, you could consider an equivalent. A equivariant abortism, which is given by attaching two minus one-framed angles along these two curves here. Okay, and hopefully, you believe, because this is just a metric-looking picture, that this is an equivariant cobordism, and because of the framings, it turns out that it is an equivariant. Negative definite cobordism. And then you are inspired by this picture to understand the three-manifold you get at the other end. And it turns out the three-manifold you get at the other end is minus one surgery of. Is minus one surgery on the dot 6, 2. Now, somehow then you are happy because you're like, I have achieved a great simplification. This knot is a bona 515 cross of knots. 6,2, of course, is 6-crossing knots. Now, of course, you might think there's no particular reason why calculating the invariant for 6-2 is somehow easier than this 15-crossing knot, but it is. So, you do, again, various similar tricks. Again, you know, various similar tricks, you know, trying to find cobordisms from that manifold to even simpler manifolds and things like that. And it turns out that at the end, you know, minus one surgery and six, two is, you know, the form homology is sufficiently simple that you can actually pin down what the invariants for that are. And then you just simply apply this monotonicity thing, and you say, oh, therefore, actually, the original thing that I care about, its invariance are bounded away from zero. Okay? All right, so that's sort of a brief brief review. Yes, yes? What about Uh yes, yes. What about doing uh like maybe a month or two around the clubhouse? Which one? Like this? Yeah, like that'd be fair enough. You know, I mean like there are many, many things one could try. You know, the problem is that at the other end you have to get something. You don't want to get something that's trivial, okay? But you also need to get something that's like sufficiently simple that like you know something about it. So there's no like There's no, like, I mean, I think we certainly tried what you're saying. You know, coming up with these sorts of domination cobornisms is a bit of a finesse. I don't know that there's any systematic way to go about it other than to just try many, many different verses. Okay? All right, so fine. So this is sort of an interesting application to This is sort of an interesting application to an a priori non-equivariant question. Maybe at the very end, I realize the bell has rung, but everybody else seems to have gone over time. So I will also impinge upon your patience and go slightly over time. Maybe let me talk to you at the end a little bit about a slightly more technical question, which may be, I think, a more interested people. Maybe I think I'm more interested in people who sort of know about equivariant knots and also know about knot floor molecules. So, let me tell you one last thing, which is about the equivariant concordance group that I mentioned earlier. So it's actually the strongly invertible equivariant concordance group. So if I have, like in the picture that I had with the torus knots, suppose I have some knot, some strongly invertible knot k1, with axes like this, and I have strongly invertible knot K2 with axes like this. And I have strongly invertible not k2 with x's like this, well then you would say, I can just perform, I can take the equivalent connected sum, just by, for example, stacking one of them on top of the other, right, and sort of taking the connected sum in this manner along the axis. However, it turns out that the order that I put one on top of the other actually matters. Because of course, if I put K1 on top of K2, then this is isotopic to the original, right? I could shrink K1 and move it around. I could shrink K1 and move it around K2 to go down here. But there's not an equivariant operation. So, as equivariant knots, it sort of depends in this picture which one of K1 and K2 I put on top. And in fact, it is known that actually most of the time you get a definite equivalent knot, depending on which one of K1 and K2 you put on top. And so in fact, in the actual definition of the equivariant concordance group, the data is not just an equivalent. The data is not just an equivariant knot, but in the knot, you actually have to specify an oriented half-axis. So somehow the equivariant knot actually has to come with sort of pictorially a choice of half axis with an orientation. You know, the half axis goes between the two fixed points on the knot. And then when you perform the connect to sum, it's sort of multiplying. Say, I take the first half axis and I put it down here, and I put the second half axis and I stack it up. Second half axis and I stack it on top of it. And now, despite it is known that as the isotopia or diffeomorphism of covariant class depends on the order you take the sum, it is actually still an open question as to whether or not the operation of connected sum is or is not commutative in the equivariant concordance group. Because it could be. Because it could be somehow that if I reverse this order, these are equivariant concordance in whatever appropriate sense that's in the equivalent concordance group, even though they're not actually the same equivariant not. And I mentioned to you Sakuma's eta polynomial, of course, the image of that is abelian, right? So such an, you know, I'm very cannot distinguish the order of taking the conducted sum in the equivalent concordance group. And, you know, the overarching And the overarchingly expected answer is that the epigram-concordance trip is not abelian. But so far, there's no proof of this. And, well, it turns out that let me now say some like even bigger things, okay? It turns out that the invariants we define uh are not a priori abelian. A priori abelia. Okay, so in principle, it is possible that our invariants could distinguish. So, you know, I mean, I told you we write down some numerical invariants that distinguish, you know, that bound the isotopia covariant genus. But if you are a little bit familiar with this machine of local equivalence, of course, what we really do is we construct a map. We can construct a map from the equivariant concordance group to some local equivalence group. Local equivalence group, which we call the C, set of C, tau, I over K complexes. And it turns out that this local equivalence group is not a priori abelian. So all other constructions of local equivalence groups appearing in the literature are abelian, but actually it turns out that the product operation on this group, you know, the standard proof that it is abelian, does not work. Okay, so I think I will actually stop here. Are there any questions? Is there anything here? Could you just try to hack in there? We're going to try to choices you make. I mean, I think that, like, I mean, it is a possible Like, I mean, is it possible to add equivalent pairs of twists in such a way such that the knot is still slice and the disks are still Z discs? I think that's not obvious. I mean, maybe, but I think that it's a, I don't know. I don't think so for this particular example. So I guess I missed something at the very end, but it sounded like what you were saying is you can. Sounded like what you were saying is you can promote some of this invariant to a sort of invariant that takes values in a non-abhoi object. Well, we don't promote it, but can you answer that question? No, no. So, I mean, so firstly, I mean, Second World's invariant has nothing to do with not floor commodity, so we're not promoting his invariant. But this was more, you know, I think it's probably unintelligible, unless you're already sort of steeped in the lore. The lore of this sort of construction. I mean, what do I do? But I mean, is the thing holding you back that you have an invariant that takes values in this not a Bayian object? You just have to. No, it's even sadder. It's more like the object, we cannot prove it is a B. So, you know, I mean, this was more for like sort of not, you know, sort of. More for, like, sort of not, you know, sort of floy theory experts. You know, most of the constructions of this sort of thing, you immediately see that the output group is abelian. But somehow in this case, you don't see that. And we don't really have any reason to believe that it is abelian, but so far we cannot prove that it is not abelian. And so the and then and then even on top of that, we would have to find an actual example in which this is realized. That's possible. I mean, there's still hope. There's light, you know? There is a little light. Okay, sorry. Thank you. So if you have the connect some of an app with its reverse and the strong inversion app exchanges the two, I guess the equivariant 4gness of that is just the 4genus of the original knot. So what you get in that case for your invariants, like you get some invariant of just the original. Like, you get some invariant of just the original value. Um, oh yeah, I I don't think um unfortunately, you know, the you know, this this picture, the involution is not that interesting. So you don't really recover any more information than you would recover from sort of the original just not floor complex of this thing, which would often give you information about the four genus of this thing. So it lines up exactly with what you say, you know, that you sort of do not get any interesting. Yes. So in this case, it's not a strong inversion. Uh no, it is. Um so there will be a fixed point up here and there will be a fixed point down here. Oh I see. Or online. If not, let's thank Irving again. We're going to take a five-minute break and start at 11:25. Actually, we have a current project which is a technology very similar thing. We think that it is related and it is quite difficult for us, but it's very difficult for us to see.
