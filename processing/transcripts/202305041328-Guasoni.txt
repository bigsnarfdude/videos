For the opportunity to be here and for having the patience to update the conference one year later so that we could be here in flash. Okay, so I'm talking about this work in progress, so it's still a bit off around the edges with Marco Weber, who is in Singapore. And the objective when we started this work, there were multiple objects. There are multiple objectives, let's say. But let's say one of them is to understand how intertemporal hedging works in equilibrium. Okay, so what is intertemporal hedging? If you like, but for a choice literature, you know that when you have a utility function which is not long, then typically you do not just buy assets because of the immediate risk return trade-off, but also because you prefer to avoid. You prefer to avoid fluctuations in investment opportunities, for example, the interest rate. And so you prefer to buy certain assets which pay you well when your investment opportunities become worse. Okay? That's usually the idea. Now, what is the problem with this? Is that this works when you have, let's say, partial equilibrium models in which the price is exogenous, but if there are a bunch of But if there are a bunch of people and we all want to enter some intertemporal hedging portfolio which involves anything other than holding the market, we cannot all do this, okay? So, because the aggregate agent has to hold the market in equilibrium. So, if I hedge, there is somebody else who is not hedging because he's willing to take the opposite position that I'm taking. Okay, so that's the idea. So, we want to understand more or less how this. More or less how this intertemporal hedging can work in equilibrium. And so to understand this, we needed to look at some equilibrium model in which you have a bunch of agents with different preferences. Otherwise, this is just not going to work or you're going to get some strange results, okay? In the sense that we are trivial. Okay, so what do we do? So I'm not going to talk a lot about the literature because of, you know, this is. Because of, you know, for the sake of time constraints, I'm just giving you a few pointers. Industrially complete markets, which are not exactly what we're doing because we have some incompleteness. Incomplete market equilibria, which is to some extent what we're doing, but only to a partial extent because our market is half complete in a sense that I will make clear shortly. We have fundamental noise, otherwise, there is no intertemporal hedging to do, and we're going. And we're going to see what we get in terms of not 8 theorems. Part of what we get is not rate, but what we get is due to 8. Okay? So let's keep going. So the main content of the paper, in case you have to catch a flight in the next five minutes, is what is here. So we have a bunch of long-lived agents. We have heterogeneity in three dimensions. In three dimensions. So, one is excavation, the other is time preference, and the third one is the income. So, each of us has a personal income which is partially correlated with everything else, but not perfectly correlated with them. Then we have a stock which pays dividends, and then we can create bonds in the sense that we can make perfectly enforceable contracts whereby we agree to pay each other a constant coupon forever. Okay? Forever. Okay? So these are not issued by any external entities, these are endogenously agreed-upon content. And we can, of course, have cash, meaning short-term borrowing or money market, whatever you want to call it. So the fundamentals are going to be stochastic because otherwise there is no investment opportunities to hedge. And we're going to consider at the equilibrium, so the agents are considered to be relatively small. The agents are considered to be relatively small. And the main result is that we're going to get dynamic fund separation with three funds: so, stock, cash, and the console bond. Importantly, we see that there is trading only in one of these three assets, which is the console bond. There is zero trading in the stock, even though the fundamentals that are oscillating are precisely the growth rate of details. The growth rate of dividends. So you would expect that stocks themselves would be the natural hedge against changes in the growth rate of dividends, but no, the result is the opposite. Okay, so let's look at the details of the model. We have a group of agents with exponential utility. Each of them has some subjective type reference basis. Subjective by preference beta, some subjective basic version alpha. And they also have a personal income, which I will talk about shortly. What they can do to finance their consumption is to use their personal income. Nobody else can earn that. They can borrow or lend to each other and they can earn the dividends. Now, exponentially for the pricing model. Exponentially for surprising models may be seen as not the ideal choice. You have to strike and deal with the devil in some way or the other. Why are we using it? Part of it is certain attractability, but there is a deeper reason, which is that we want these agents to coexist forever. So if you are familiar with the equilibrium literature with power utilities, you see that with power utilities, what happens is that there is a What happens is that there is a so-called survival index, and it is only the agent with the lowest survival index which survives in the long term. So, in the long term, you have essentially a representative agent regardless. So, here instead, you have that these agents will coexist forever, and so there will be an organic stationary equilibrium. And this is one of the benefits of exponentiality. Of course, the cost is that we are not going to see any wealth effects, so this is certainly something that So, this is certainly something that price we have to pay to use these preferences. Okay, so the dividends are growing at some rate, which is stochastic, but the volatility is constant. The stochastic rate is our stadium process, which oscillates around some baseline new bar, and then it has some there is some correlation between the shocks to the dividend and the shocks to the growth. Okay? So, that's also toxic. Okay, so that's also positive. The incumbents have their own drift, which is constant, and their own boundary motions, which are different from each other, but each of them will have some correlation with the two common noises. So we have two vectors of correlation and an additional correlation between these two guys. Alright, so budget equation is a mouthful, but it is not anything difficult. But it is not anything different from what you expect. The wealth will change for a bunch of reasons. So you're getting the dividends, you're getting the capital gains, you're getting the coupons, and you will have some interest charges and income depending on whether you're lending or borrowing, and there will be personal income and consumption. So this is what the budget equation looks like. Looks like. So, summarize, we have as exogenous inputs, the preferences, the distribution of wealth, because there would be some initial distribution of wealth, and the dividends and the incomes of the agents. Equilibrium condition and standard, you know, at an equilibrium, so you have one net supply for the stock, zero for the cash and the bonds, and the condition that the consumption must equal the dividend plus the incomes altogether at the aggregate level, of course. At the aggregate level, of course, and the outputs, of course, are going to be the prices, the interest rates, and the consumption training strategies. Okay, all right. So, first we have to say what is an admissible strategy. Again, we try not to spend too much time on this, but it is important, okay? Otherwise, you get paradoxes. So, because you're we're using exponential utility, you cannot say that wealth has to be bounded from below by zero or the same for consumption. Or the same for consumption. So, how do you do something meaningful without allowing for infinite borrowing? So, something that works is the following. You say that consumption has to be bounded from below by some polynomial plus some other polynomial integrated with respect to the noises. And you can choose this polynomial freely. And you can have a polynomial with. And you can have a polynomial which depends on the personal income of each agent. And you do the same thing for wealth, okay? So you are not allowed to consume too much and you are not allowed to send your wealth to minus infinity. You can have negative values, but eventually they cannot blow up more than polynomial. And this is enough, and you do not need to give strange definitions in terms of dual values of. Dual values of the problem. Now, the equilibrium is given by three conditions. So, first of all, you need a pair of strategies which are trading in stock, trading in bonds, and consumption, which has to be admissible. You need that this tradefall must be optimal, and you also need the market clearing to hold. Here, market clearing means you have total, somebody is holding all of the shares in the stock. Holding all of the shares in the stock, the total amount of bonds is zero, the total amount of cash is zero at any point, and the total amount of consumption is equal to the dividends plus the total income flows at any given time. Okay? So, with these conditions I know, sorry, I'm sorry. What do we get? So, first of all, the interest rate. Believe it or not, this is one of the most attractable pieces. One of the most detractable BCs. So you get that the interest rate itself follows a Vasichek type model, and the oscillation that you get is about some baseline which has two terms which are familiar. Basically, this is just the aggregate time reference. This is the aggregate growth, including both the dividend and the aggregate income. But then you get a bunch of corrections for the precautionary savings, and you get two corrections. And you get two corrections for the common noises. And you see that the common noises in terms of risk are penalized only in proportion to the square of the aggregate risk diversion, so the alpha bar. This would be the risk diversion of the representative agent which you had in a model in which the personal incomes don't exist and therefore is a complete market. And then you necessarily get a representative agent. Here you don't get a representative agent. You don't get a representative agent, but the representative agent still shows up with these preferences for certain sense. Now, this is true for these two common noises, and intuitively the reason is that these noises can be shared because they can be traded. The individual risks, they cannot be traded, so they enter the precautionary saving in a different way, which does not depend only on alpha bar, but it depends also on. Only on alpha bar, but it depends also on the distribution of the alphas, on the distribution of the escalation modules. So this is a different penalization because this is idiosyncratic income risk which cannot be shaped. Okay, so from this formula you immediately see that there is no representative region. Here the distribution does matter. Okay, so the consumption can be broken down into a few pieces. Be broken down into a few pieces, which have some familiar quantities. So, the personal income, this is clearly part of the consumption, the dividend share, the random investments, and these are typical in basically all models of this kind. Then you start seeing something which is less typical. So, one is the inter-interpolate shift. So, this is what some agents want to do to their consumption stream because they have different. Consumption strain because they have different preferences than other people. So, if I am much more impatient than all of you, then I will want to borrow from all of you so that I can consume more earlier. Then, of course, I will consume less later because of self-finance. And this shows up in this intertemporal shift, which you see is multiplied by linearly increasing function. Then you have the dividend share, sorry, the risk-sharing parts, and this is where essentially. Parts and this is where essentially you start seeing the intertemporal hedging which is taking place in equilibrium. So you have the share of dividend risk. Notice that this is just the cumulative shocks to the dividend. It's not the dividend itself. And the share of growth risk. Now notice that if I want to have enough information to make my consumption choices, it is not enough for me to look at the market prices. You cannot just look at PT. You cannot just look at PT, I cannot just look at RT. I also need to keep track of the overall shocks to the dividends and to the growth. So it is a mark of equilibrium, but not only in the current public information. You need also enough past public information to extract these two pieces of information. Now, how do we finance this? Now, how do we finance this? So, this is just theoretical, but how we what are the what is the training strategy which replicates this? So, in order to look at that, we need to first discuss what are these coefficients depending upon. So, this is the intertemporal shift, this is the dividend hedging, this is the growth hedging. So, you see that the dividend hedging and growth hedging have at Hedging and growth hedging have a typical structure of risk share. So, what I want to do is to basically hedge completely my share of risk. This is my sigma i or delta i. This is the share of, this is the part of my income risk which is hedgeable with the stock essentially. Now, I would like to hedge this, and you would like to hedge yours, but I And you would like to hedge yours. But at the end, if we all hedge, the sum is going to be something different from what it has to be. Because the sum has to be zero. So at the end, we all agree to share this risk, each of us in proportion to his own risk aversion. And so we do this rationally, and at the end, each of us is going to hold as much risk as required, net of hedge in his own position. Now, for the interteporate shift, there are a lot of. For the intertemporal shift, there are a lot of effects that are happening. So, you may want to have a higher intertemporal shift because you have higher risk aversion, a higher time reference than other people. Or maybe because your income grows faster, or maybe because you have more ideas and graduate risk. So, there are multiple effects there. Now, stock holdings. What do you do here? What do you do here? You hold a constant number of stocks. If you didn't have any personal incomes, you would just hold the standard risk sharing of the stocks. But you do have personal income, so you want to hedge that. And this piece hedges your personal income. That's not the end of the story, because now by hedging this, you have loaded up on girlfriend. If the two shocks were uncorrelated, this Two shocks were uncorrelated, this would be the end of the story. But now you have to hedge the hedge, and this comes with the minus because this is the hedge of the hedge. So you have to hedge your hedging part, and this becomes your constant. But what matters here is that the whole thing is really constant. So we at the beginning choose our own shares and we don't change it forever. Okay? Now, what we do change is the bond holding. Is the bond holdings, but before I can show you those, I have to show you the bond price. This is just to show you that it is a deterministic expression. It's not pretty. I'm sparing you the formula for this premium. It is as charming as this premium. So the bond price is just a function of the current growth in dividends, or vice versa. In dividends, or vice versa, since this is a function of the interest rate, you can look at this as a function of the interest rate, which would be more classic, let's say. The bond holdings are dynamic. Now, this is interesting in my opinion because there are a few papers where you see that they draw a link between the market being complete and the equilibrium involving no trade. Equilibrium involving not I. There is a paper by Judd and others, for example, in 2003, which explicitly makes this statement. What you get here is that if you wish, you can turn off all the incomes of all the people, in which case you will eliminate a few terms like this, this, and nothing else. But the strategy will continue to remain dynamic. The strategy will continue to remain dynamic. So you will have a dynamic strategy in a strategy that involves trading for all the people in equilibrium, even though the market is indeed complete, which is the special case in the absence of all the incomes. Okay? So am I running out of time or still a few minutes? Probably a couple of minutes. No bell, no problem. Okay, sorry. Okay. Okay, so start with fund separation. Suppose you insist in having a no-trade equilibrium. So it's nice to have a dynamic trade-fund separation, but you really insist in not thinking about trading. You can do that, but you will have to have more assets. Okay? So here for the dynamic no trading, sorry, you need three assets. Need three assets. No, I okay. This one. Okay, I lost my bag. You need cash, stock, and the console bot. If you want to have no trading at all, you need five assets. These five assets are going to be the stock, the bond, the hedging, The hedging contract for the DNA risk, a hedging contract for the brokeries, and no cash. And then you can hold positions in these five files. Okay? Now, if you have some patience, you can extend this to multiple assets. The main implication of the multiple asset case is that you're going to get this Cape N like relation, but it is not exactly Cape N. But it is not exactly Kappen because what you have here are not the covalences between assets returns and the market return understood as the total the total sum of all the asset prices. You also have to include the contribution that comes from aggregate income, which is correlated with the dividend. Okay, so in this sense, you have to use the So in this sense, you have to use the right bucket portfolio, which is a classical argument of the so-called role critique. And this is the end of the story. Hope I didn't overuse my time. So we wanted to understand at the temporal hedging equilibrium. What we've got here are fluctuating dividend growth and investment opportunities. Incompleteness is coming only for the personal incomes. You can use stock, cash, and bonds, council bonds to. And bonds, the console bonds to applicate all the edgeable shocks. And you don't trade the stocks, but you do trade the bonds to achieve this intertemporal edge. And that's the end of the story. Thank you. Questions? If you heard the. Sorry, I broke it. Where is the source of the trading stock? Is it the that was also my question? Is it just exponentially physically? If you have some other If you have some other utility, would it be so? Okay, so if you have some other utility, there will certainly be some sort of paid which comes from income effects. Sorry, from wealth effects. But this has nothing to do with the type of hedge. So, I mean, you can write models that are tractable for that, and even with a single representative agent, you see that there starts to be. You see that there starts to be: if I have two assets, for example, one of them goes up, then the price of the other also goes up, basically because the shadow of demand for the other would go up, and so the price has to go up to prevent the supply to exceed the demand. So, in a certain sense, it is not necessarily related to the intertemporal engine. So, then becomes relevant, which is why here, if you don't. Which is why here you don't have, even if it's incomplete market, you don't have everything. But that was the question. So, the only completeness that we have comes from the personal incomes. Okay, so if you want, you can turn it off, the personal incomes. You still have no trading in the stock, but you still have trading in the console because the stochastic interest rate or the stochastic. Stochastic interest rate or the stochastic dividend growth is the source of the investment opportunities fluctuations, and you want to hedge that. So intuitively, at least for me, the reason why you do not use stocks, but you only use bonds, are two. One is that you can use the bonds. So if you remove the bonds from the asset menu, you will start using the stocks. Stars. But it is better to use the bonds because the bonds, where is it? The bonds are only a function of mu t, which is what you want to hedge. The stocks instead have two sources of noise, both the w mu and the wt. So if you use the stocks, you will get an inferior. An inferior form of hedging because you're going to add idiosyncratic risk according to the WD dimensions. That's what we might be my pleasure.
