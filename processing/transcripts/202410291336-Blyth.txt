For organising this. Very interesting meeting in such a beautiful venue. So, this is work that I've done with Emilia Garrett, one of the co-organisers, on water waves in infinite depth with constant porticity. So, this is the sort of cartoon of the problem. This is fluid down here going down to minus infinity, and then just a passive constant pressure region above. And there's a wave of travelling wave. A travelling wave moving at constant speed from left to right, the way I've depicted it. There's gravity here. Almost everything I'm going to say actually will ignore gravity, but if I have time, I'll put gravity in at the end. Zeta here represents the vorticity, and that could be positive or negative. So the wave could be travelling in I mean what I'm doing here is modelling a shear current. So the wa the um the wave could be travelling in the same direction as the shear current or in the opposite direction. So it could be either sign. It could be either sign. In this incompressible flow, so we've got the Poisson equation for fluid for the stream function sine bar. Okay, and then it's convenient to shift into a travelling frame of reference so that the wave is static, in which case the condition at negative infinity does not just sort of stay in this. Okay, well, it's inconvenient to deal with the Buston equation. So, to deal with the Buston equation, it'd be much nicer to deal with Laplace's equation than we can do mappings and this sort of thing. And this now follows what Eric was talking about this morning: that if we introduce what I'm going to call a shifted stream function, so that's now psi without a bar on top, it's now crucial that the vorticity is constant. Okay, so again, Eric mentioned this this morning. If the vorticity is constant, you can get rid of it by shifting the string function by this quantity here. So, then psi without a plur on it won't satisfy. Now to plaw on it satisfies the Laplace equation. And then via the Cauchy-Biemann equations, you can introduce this conjugate hormonal phi, which I discovered from Eric's talk, sometimes called the generalized velocity potential. Okay, so this is the problem we're going to solve now, is this Laplace problem. Let's state what the output problem is. We've got Laplace's equation, fluid on the free surface. Of course, the kinematic condition, eta here is the shape of the surface. Surface. And then the dynamic condition on the surface comes from Bernoulli's equation. So, I guess when you derive Bernoulli's equation, normally you write everything as the gradient of some terms. Well, if the vorticity is constant, you can still do that. So, the u cross omega term in Euler's equation, you can still write as grad of something, and something here, as long as it is a constant. So, you use Bernoulli's equation to get the banner math condition. Okay, so that's the problem we want to solve, and what I'm going to do is. The problem we want to solve, and what I'm going to do is describe travelling wave solutions to this problem first, these have been computed by other people, and then look at their limit their stability. Right, okay, so let's non-dimensionalise the problem. We'll take the wavelength of the basic travelling wave, so we'll assume that the travelling wave exists, take its wavelength as the length scale, use the wave speed to get two-dimensional. Uh, towards the end of the uh, to the end of the talk. So, there's capital omega, which I guess you can either think of as the strength of the vorticity or the framework for this problem. Okay, what I'm going to call omega plus and omega minus, they both depend on g relative. Now, if you let g go to zero, then this bottom one is going to go to zero. Then, this bottom one is going to go off to minus infinity. I think the limit g goes to zero there. That will go to negative infinity and essentially here. And then there's only one branch of travelling waves which will come out of which is one focus. Okay, so the way we do this is again, other people have talked about this. We follow Diachenko et al. In fact, there's a couple of papers before them, but I think they're not mentioned. Nod mentioned in his talk. And you take the period, map it into a semi-infinite strip in conformal space. And if we do that, then introduce the trace of this generalized velocity potential on the surface. So little casi is just a parameter parametrized on the surface. x tilde and y tilde are then described as surface shape. And because it's a parametric description, we're going to be able to do overhanging waves for this computation. So you do all that. So you do all that, okay, and you end up with this system. So Diachenko et al. and the other papers, they did this for irrotational waves. Ruyong generalised that in 2009 to the system you're looking at with constant water. Okay, so there's the dynamic boundary condition at the top. The tilde is just mean everything is on the surface. So now instead of solving cold fluids, we're just solving solving terms of surface. Okay, let's start then by looking at steady travelling waves. We can then look at their stability. Okay, so I set the time derivatives to zero on the previous slide. There's my shifted spin function with the bottom-free surface from before, and then it turns out. And then it turns out that, well, if you just differentiate this slide bar is a constant on the free surface because it's the original. And then take all the stuff from the previous slide, all boils down to one equation, which is this condition here. And that's what we want to solve for steady travelling waves. And if there's no gravity, then this turn just goes away. Capital C on the right-hand side is the constant defined as part of the computation. Computation. So, okay, still this problem is this problem has been done before by other people. I think first by Simon and Saffman in 1985, and then by Jean-Marc and Brock in 1996, by Vera and Dinachenko more recently. So, here are the two branches. I fixed G, and if we look at the upper picture first, fixed capital G, so there's still some gravity here. There's the two branches coming out of omega minus and omega plus. And omega minus is negative, don't you? Omega plus is positive. Definitely maybe a plus. Of course, we have hand branches that kind of go off the scale of my picture, and up you get one something very similar to this. Something very similar to this this morning. What's really interesting about these is that these look very similar to crapillary bottles. Now, if you keep going, and again, Eric elaborated on this this morning, I mean it's surprising that you can keep going, if you keep following this
