Can I say it, everyone? Yes. Okay, can you hear me clearly? Clearly? Yes, I can. Okay, so now I can get started. Hello, everyone, and it's my pleasure to present this work in CanQ. And the title is the equilibrium and social optimality in queues with service rate and customers joining decision. Okay, this is a kind of joint. This is kind of joint work with Ri Ling Tian of Yanshan University, China. So this presentation has the following parts. We start with the introduction, some literature, review, and then I present the model description. We talk about the information scenarios and I show the numerical results. Finally, I Finally, I make a conclusion. Okay, first I want to talk about the system I'm going to focus on. It's a queuing model with three features. The server can work at two different service rates, like high or low service rate. And customers can make their decision of joining or balking. Joining or bulking based on their service utility. And thirdly, the QLANCE information may or may not be available for customers. Okay, so this model is motivated by some service systems in practice. Those systems usually can adjust your service capacity during the operations. This adjustment. This adjustment usually is based on the congestion level. There are many examples like a border crossing station between US and Canada and the hospital ER rooms, some highway toll plaza and call centers, tickets, queues. Sorry. So there are many examples. Okay. Now I want to give you a brief introduction about About literature here. So, where this work is positioned in the literature. Okay, the related literature is in the queuing area, certainly. And for the multi-server setting, I studied at the US-Canada border crossing stations in the year 2009, and it's called congestion-based staffing. That means the number of servers can be. Of servers can be adjusted based on the Q lens, and so that's a multi-server setting. And here in this paper, we focus on the single-server setting. This kind of queuing system belongs to the vacation queuing models. In particular, the model I present here is kind of working vacation model. Kind of working vacation model. Okay, so this means that the server can reduce the service rate from the normal rate to a low rate when the system becomes empty. Okay, so the low service rate instead of zero service rate. That's an extension of the queues with server vacations. Over the past 10 years, several researchers Several researchers in the queuing area studied the equilibrium joining or bulking strategies in the MM1Q setting, okay, with working vacations. However, here I want to make clear, those working vacation models, they actually focus on a special case. A special case of threshold value is one. That means whenever there's a customer in the system, the server adjusts the read to the normal rate instead of the threshold. And Guerr and Hessen in 2011 and 2012, they studied first time the unthreshold MM1 queuing models. One queuing models with the joining strategies, like with the customer choice. But that's not working vacation. Working vacation means the service rates are never zero. It's just between low and high. And the Gua and Hessen's work is between zero and mu. That means it's like a regular vacation, not working vacation. But they consider the threshold policy, like anything can be greater than one, and they resume the One and they resume the normal service rate. The Q lens must exceed a threshold M. Okay, but so far, there's no study on the threshold policy with the server working vacation. Like the server can switch between two rates, like low and high rates with customer choices. So, our focus is to study the queuing system where the service rate is adjusted by the Is adjusted by the server between two rigs, okay, low and high, okay, with a threshold policy. And customer can make their joining or bulking decision based on the Q lens and their service utility. Okay, the setting here I think is quite interesting because we consider both server and customer decisions. Okay, so we want to invest. Okay, so we want to investigate the customer equilibrium strategies and the social welfare maximization strategies if we consider the decisions on both sides. Okay, that's the unique feature of this study. Hopefully, our study can provide some useful information for queuing systems where the manager can like make their Can make their decisions and consider the customer choice. And this picture quickly shows the system we study. So you can see that the customer can either join or bulk based on Q length or long-term average waiting time. And service rate can be adjusted between mu naught and mu1. Mu naught is a low rate. And mu1 mu naught is a low rate, so we start with like the normal rate here, service rate mu1. And when the system becomes empty, the rate will be adjusted low to mu naught, just adjust it down to mu naught. And then this mu naught rate will be kept for the Q until the Q length exceeds N again. It sees n again. Okay. And then the service rate will be adjusted back to mu one. Okay, so that's the picture here. And here, the server's decision, we can use three variables of three parameters, mu naught, mu1, and n. And the customer's decision will be just the joining or bulking. Okay, so that's the picture we can illustrate. Can illustrate this situation. And the system state here, certainly we use the number of customers in the system at time t as the one variable for system state. The other state variable will be the server's status. Okay, like zero represents the low service rate or the working vacation period, and one represents the One represents the regular service rate. So we're going to have the two-dimensional continuous time Markov chain, and it's kind of queuing system we studied. Here I want to present two information scenarios. Okay, either the observable queue or the unobservable queue. Okay, the first we First, we start with the observable Q case where the Q lens and server status disclosed to customers. So they can make their decision based on the observed queue length and make their decision. And then the state space is pretty clear, and we are going to end up with a finite state CTMC. CTMC. Okay. We can actually obtain the closed form expression for the stationary Q lens distribution. Okay, that's quite lucky. So fully observable MM1Q setting with a two-service read. Actually, we can work out the formulas for the stationary probabilities. Okay, we use a Okay, we use P sub K1 and P sub K0 to represent the joint distribution of the Q lens and the server status. And I'm going to skip the details of the mathematical derivations and just present the distribution formulas. Okay, so here N sub E is the equilibrium, customer equilibrium threshold. equilibrium threshold. That means whenever the Q length is less than or equal to QE, sorry, NE, sorry, and the server will join the Q and otherwise the server will bulk. So this we assume that the equilibrium threshold or the we call the bulking threshold is more than the capital N, which is the policy threshold. The server's policy The server's policy, like the rate adjustment threshold. Okay, then we can get this expression. And also, we can get the probability of server status. P0 is the low rate probability, and P1 is high-rate probability, service rate. And certainly, we can work out the performance evaluation because the distribution of QLANs is Distribution of Q lens is obtained. So we can also get the closed form expression for the Q lens. Here, L sub O is the average Q lens for the observable case. Okay, so we can also develop some cost functions and social welfare functions. Okay, and here we consider the cost structure, waiting cost, servers. Waiting cost, serverless operating cost in the high service rate, serverless operating cost for the low service rate period, high service rate period, bulking customer cost or the switchover cost. So we can consider all those costs relevant to the system. And we can work out the expected cost rate by using the Using the expected queue lens and also the expected cycle time. And social welfare is defined as the total utilities for all customers joining the system because custom blocking will not have any positive utility. So there we are, if we define as the maximum Q lengths allowed, either by Allowed either by customers' equilibrium or the social welfare maximization. So we can actually work out the social welfare expression. And for the social welfare maximization threshold, there are two cases. The threshold at small n can be either smaller than the service rate adjustment threshold or it can be greater than that. Or it can be greater than that. Okay, for either case, we can work out the performance measures. Okay, so the social welfare can be in this case, where the maximum Q length allowed is less than the policy threshold, or it can be greater than. Okay, so the maximizer can be obtained. Okay, and for unobservable Q case, it's Case is more complex because here we assume that the customer cannot observe the queue lens. So the customer will join the queue based on the long-term statistics, like long-term waiting time. And so with the probability Q, the customer will join, and with one minus Q, the customer will balk. Okay, so this gives you the You the CTMC with the infinite state space. So again, we can work out the stationary distribution just like the observable case. We didn't use a matrix analytical method. Instead, we used the method of solving the set of difference equations. Okay, so we work out. Okay, so we work out the close form the expression for the major performance metrics. And then we can work out the individual utility for this case. And the Q can be determined by setting this individual utility to be zero. So we can determine the Q. So here we need to first work out the performance metrics with unknown parameter Q. With the unknown parameter q, and then we set this individual utility q to be zero to solve for the equilibrium joining probability. Okay, then we can again work out the major performance measures, like the total cost, social welfare, etc. An interesting thing I want to show here is that the equilibrium strategies for the unobservable QKs are very complex now. Complex now, we can observe some interesting Q phenomena, okay, which we cannot observe in the previous studies. First, in this case, so if we set the parameters in this way, like with the stable Q for the low service rate and also for the high service rate. Okay, if you look at this setting, lambda is total arrival rate. Setting lambda is total arrival rate, mu1 is the high service rate, mu0 is low service rate, c is the waiting cost parameter. And in this particular setting, and you find the most of time the system is in the low service rate status. So it's very like a classical MM1Q setting. So then the WQ, the waiting time, will change with the queue. Time will change with the Q as a linear function. This is very intuitive. That means in the queuing literature, queuing economics literature, we also call this is called kind of avoid claud. Okay, so it's increasing function. And you can see we have unique equilibrium joining rate or equilibrium, sorry, joining probability. And for And for another setting, so if we have like an unstable queue for the low service rate, okay, in this case, and the stable queue for the high service rate period, then you find the waiting time function is totally different now. So we have a decreasing part, an increasing part, and this is kind of the first part is called a followed. Part is called a followed cloud, and the second part is a void crowd. So, this is this queuing behavior has been observed in Gore and Hassan's study in 2011, published in Operations Research. So, in that paper, they observed that kind of behavior. But in our setting, because we allow the server to serve customers when the Q lens is When the Q lens is low or empty. So that's different from their model. Their model is like only one positive service rate. We have two service rates. Then we can actually observe even more interesting behavior. So for this parameter setting, you can see that we have even more possible equilibriums. Okay, because horizontal axis is the service reward. Okay, so that's equal to WQ to get the equal to WQ to get the equilibriums. So in this case, our low service rate period again is unstable. High service rate is stable, certainly. It must be stable here, okay, to make the stationary distribution exist. So now you can see there's a moderately change the service rates, the frequency is moderate. It's not very high, very low. Then you can see even more interesting behavior. More interesting behavior. And here we have two stable equilibriums, but the larger one is better because this one can maximize, can make the social welfare greater. But the middle one is unstable equilibrium. So now you can imagine that we have two surface rates, so we can observe even more interesting equilibrium behavior. So we make a conjecture. So, we make a conjecture. So, if we have like a multi-serving race with a kind of multi-threshold policy, then actually for this kind of unobservable queue case, if the customer can make their choice, then actually there's a possible like maximum of 2m minus 1 equilibrium points with the largest one instead. With the largest one being stable. This is for the multi-threshold policy. Okay, so that's for the more general case. So this we cannot get analytical proof at this point, but it's a very possible case. So that's why we make this as a conjecture. Finally, I want to present some numerical results. Okay, this picture shows you. This picture shows you the observable QKs. So we start with observable QKs, followed by unobservable QKs. So this shows the threshold policy changing with the customer joining threshold policy changing with the service read threshold policy here. N. Okay, you can see. Here, N. Okay, you can see N star is the social welfare maximization threshold, the 45-degree line here. Sorry, the horizontal line here. This is the customer equilibrium threshold. So you can see that as N increases, the policy threshold for server increases. The customers join threshold, the also. Threshold, the also for the social welfare maximization policy is increasing with that, but the customer equilibrium threshold remains the same. Okay, so that's this picture shows you how the optimal social welfare, optimal threshold change with the service reward. service reward because small v is equal to r times mu1 over c this is the service read r that's service reward sorry service service reward not service read service reward is between 0 to 15 you can see how the optimal threshold changes with the service reward okay under different traffic intensities and this one is And this one is the social welfare. This is not policy now. It's the social welfare changes, maximum social welfare changes with N. Okay, and under different service rewards. Okay, so you can see this. Those pictures actually also presented in Gore and Heisen's paper, but we actually compare our generalized model with their model because their model. With their model, because their model becomes a special case of our model. This is another case here, which shows how social welfare changes with my policy parameter under different low service rate, mu naught. Okay, and this is the observable case now. How the social welfare optimal joining probability changes with n. You can see that. Can see that. This is the unobservable case under different direct rates. And here, this is under different service rate. And this shows the social welfare for the unobservable Q case and optimal joining probability, how that optimal social welfare changes with the threshold policy parameter N under different low service rates. Different low service rates. Okay. And finally, we compare the two information scenarios. So the observable QKs are unobservable Qs in terms of the equilibrium social welfare and optimal social welfare. Okay, and so we compared them in terms of the policy parameter because here Policy parameter because here we consider n and the mu naught, the low service rate, as the server's policy parameters. Mu1, the normal service rate, we consider that as the given parameter because that's the total maximum service capacity. Usually, we cannot change the capacity in operations. But mu naught and n, they are like a policy operating decision parameters. Decision parameters. So you can change them. That's why we focus on these two parameters. Okay. And here it shows the optimal social welfare changes with these two parameters, the two cases. But you can see that in all those numerical examples, the observable case can improve the social welfare. Okay. And also, in terms of the operation. The operational efficiency. We can also look at the optimal policy parameter for minimizing the cost. Remember, I presented the expected total operating cost earlier. So we can minimize those parameters. We can minimize those costs by using the parameter n and the parameter mu naught. Okay, so for either case, we can get Either case, we can get the minimum expected total cost. Okay, and again, we can only do this numerically. Okay, and this is the overall social welfare. That's the social welfare minus operating cost. So here we actually consider both the server and the customer's utility or their benefits. Then you can actually find the you can actually find the optimal parameter n for mean for maximizing the overall social welfare. Okay, just this is just a sample of extensive numerical analysis we did. Finally, I make a conclusion. Okay, in this study, we have studied the equilibrium strategies on When both customers and servers can make their decisions. Okay, so the equipment strategies are much more complex in the unobservable Q case than the fully observable case due to the interaction between these two types of decisions. Okay, the deviation between the customer equilibrium strategy and socially optimal strategy can be numerically determined using the closed form solution. Using the closed form solutions, the effects of the system performance of policy, system cost parameters to gain better understanding of the system behavior. Some system behaviors were not observable in earlier studies. And the total expect cost can be minimized by policy parameter n or mu naught. Mu naught. And we can also use simulation to verify some interesting findings in this study. Okay. Future research, we can extend analysis to the congestion-based staffing policy in multi-server system with strategic customers on the different information scenarios. That's the conclusion of my talk. Thank you.
