Aggregation intense shear flow. Floor is all yours, Professor Kakar. Okay, so thank you very much, Mayang, for the introduction and, of course, inviting me to talk here. Today, I thought I'll talk a little bit about. Talk a little bit about some of the work that we've been doing over the years on segregation. And the outline of my talk is given here. I'll start with a brief introduction to the kinds of segregation one can see. And then I'll start talking about most of my time I'll spend on segregation of particles. Of particles due to density differences. And then I'll discuss some recent work that we've been doing on segregation in flows due to size differences. This work, you know, I've been working in this area for a long time and this is a list of some of my collaborators, Professor Otino, Jim McCarthy, Kimberly Hill, and various students. Anurag Tripathi, who's currently at Ayat Kanpur. Ayat Kanpur. I'm going to be talking a little bit about his work, and Subhashi Sarkar works in Mondelez now. And I also talk about Arun Miyanamadi's work, who's an undergraduate student, just graduated and will be going for higher studies. So just put up three rows of pictures. In the first row, just some examples of granular materials, which could be just gravel. Which could be just gravel, tablets, sugar crystals, and many others like that. And you know, these types of materials occur very widely both in nature and in industry. And here are a couple of natural processes: the formation of sand dunes, avalanches, which occur in nature. These are both granular processes. And in industry, there are a large number. In industry, there are a large number of processes which involve granular materials. And here I show a picture of a V-blender which is used to mix particles. This is a rotating cylinder, a rotary kiln for manufacturing cement. And this is a blast furnace, which looks inside looks something like this for manufacturing steel. And all of these processes. In all of these processes, you know, granular flows, granular segregation are quite important. So let me just jump directly into what is segregation. Segregation is essentially demixing. And what happens is that when particle mixtures are handled, that is, you know, they may be trans. Is you know, they may be transported or they may be you know processed in some equipment. If there are particles with different properties, there's a tendency to separate out spontaneously. Now, there's some separation processes in which such kinds of segregation are utilized to separate out the required product. For example, you know. For example, separating wheat from chaff is one example where segregation is used. But in many processes, such segregation is detrimental and usually not desired. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, they mix many different components to make a tablet. And if there's any kind of segregation, then There's any kind of segregation, then the concentration within the tablets can be greatly. So they would try very hard to make sure that such segregation doesn't occur. And if you look at segregation processes, the basic cause why segregation occurs during a flow is that there are different forces which act on different species in a mixture. And let me give some. And let me give some examples of segregation. So, here is one set of examples of segregation due to pouring. In this first example, material is poured between two closely spaced glass sheets, and it's a mixture of different materials. Different materials, and when it the material flows in, it you know forms a heap, and that heap grows. But as it's flowing, it has a tendency to segregate out, and you can get these kinds of layers forming. And here, this segregation occurs because of different differences in the angle of repose between the different materials. So, one is rough and one is So, one is rough and one is smooth. And as a result of that, the material separates into these driations. The second example that is shown here is what happens when you pour continuously. And here, the segregation is due to size. And this is sort of some experimental results from our group. From our group, where as the material flows down, the smaller particles deposit first and the larger particles deposit at a later stage. So, you know, you can get these kind of segregation patterns. And, you know, if you think about where these types of segregation are important, well, one example is in the feeding of raw materials to a blast furnace. So they are usually poured on top and then Poured on top, and then there is segregation on the surface. And of course, this material as it melts moves downward, so it can have a big impact on the processes. Second example is this rotating cylinder. This example I showed you in the earlier slide of a rotating. So, if you look at the cross-section, there's the particles. Uh, there's the particles fill only part of the cylinder, and then as you rotate it, there is a flowing layer, and then the rest of the bed simply rotates as a fixed bed. What you find is if you take small and large particles, then within three or four revolutions, the small particles and the large particles separate out like this. And this is generally called radial segregation. And then if you wait. Irrigation. And then, if you wait long enough, then you have a long cylinder, then they can actually separate out axially. So you have alternating bands of large and small particles. And of course, here the application is to systems like the rotary kiln and others, which involve these types of rotating cylinders. So, segregation has been observed quite long back, and there have been a large number of studies that have been carried out to try and understand why this happens. And here, I've just listed four modeling approaches that have been taken. The earliest model was by Savage and Lund, and they talked about how one layer of particle forms a seal through which the smaller particles fall. The smaller particles fall through. Then, kinetic theory has been extended by several people for the mixtures to try and predict segregation. Just like we have partial pressures in gases, Gray and his group have looked at partial stresses to try and explain segregation. And over a period of time, we've been looking at what happens to a single part. What happens to a single particle in a segregating system? And by looking at what forces act on it, can we predict what would happen to the system as a whole? And as I said, there's a lot of work in this area. And I have listed two review articles: one we had written about 20 years ago, and one more recent one by Gray. And both of these are in the annual reviews of fluid mechanics. From the annual reviews of fluid mechanics, if you are interested in looking at this further, so let me just talk a little bit about the fourth approach in which we want to study the motion of a single particle. And so here I'll start with describing the simplest possible system. You can imagine an inclined plane like this. The bottom is rough. The bottom is rough, so the particles, in a sense, don't slide on the bottom. And the material flows on this surface under gravity. I'm going to talk to you a lot about simulations. So in those simulations, we have periodic boundary conditions so that anything that comes out of here goes back in there. But I'll also talk a little bit about experiments. So in this system, So, in this system, we decided to look at a single particle. So, all the particles are identical, and only one has the same size, but has a higher density. And as a result, because of this higher density, has a tendency to sink as it is flowing down this inclined plane. And, you know, there are several forces that act on this. One is, of course, the weight. There's also a ball. There's also a buoyancy force, like you see in fluids, because in this flow, there's a pressure gradient. So the pressure on the top of the particle is less than the pressure at the bottom. So it has a tendency to move upward. And if the particle is moving, then it experiences a drag force analogous to a fluid. This is essentially the resistance to the motion of this particle because of all the surrounding particles. Of all the surrounding particles. So, you know, we looked at this problem. So it's as if we are looking at the settling of a single particle in a flowing stream of other particles which are identical, but the particle of this intruder, the density of this intruder, is higher. One can analyze this problem taking a continuum. Is this problem taking a continuum approach? So, you know, the particles are shown here, and this is the test particle with a higher density in a gravity field. This is Gy saying it's the Y component of the gravity field. And the volume of each particle is V, including this one. But we can smear out all the outside particles to treat it like a fluid. So then you have a single particle in a fluid. Have a single particle in a fluid which is moving down with a velocity vh, but its volume must be higher than its original volume. This is the effective volume is higher because each particle has a certain amount of empty space associated with it. And hence, because particles can't approach closer than one diameter. So, effectively, this So, effectively, this particle seems to be bigger when it is in a fluid. So, if we then want to calculate what is the net force on this particle, well, one is of course the weight, which is the mass of the particle times gravity. And then there's the upward force due to buoyancy. So, this is the weight of the fluid displaced. And note that we are using the effective volume here rather than the actual volume of the sphere. Volume of sphere. Now, how do we get the effective volume? That's very straightforward in this case because we know that this force must be equal to zero. That is, the weight and buoyancy must balance if the two densities are equal. And hence, we can easily find out that this effective volume must be the volume of the particle divided by the solid volume fraction, that this is the volume of solids over the. Volume of solids over the total volume. And this effective volume takes into account these excluded volume effects. So if we substitute for this here, then we get the net force is just the difference in masses times gravity. And then if this particle is moving, then it experiences a resistance, and we model that as a Stokes drag, which is Which is given by this. Now, these are very simple equations and they can be rigorously tested by doing simulations. And here, I just show some simulations, particle trajectories with different densities. And if you average over a large number of trajectories, then for every density, you get a nice straight line. And that gives us the mean velocity. We can also calculate. We can also calculate the mean square deviation, and from that, we can get the diffusivity of the particles in the direction normal to the flow. So, the velocity is just the mean displacement by time, and the diffusivity is the mean squared displacement divided by 2t. So, by doing these types of calculations, first we can get Can get this relationship, which essentially is what we derived: that at steady state, when the velocity of the particle is constant, that is at the terminal velocity. The net force is balanced by the drag force. That is, this is FH is equal to Fd. And if you put it in dimensionless form, we get something like this. Now, in the simulation. Now, in the simulations, we can easily find out the viscosity since we know the shear stress and the shear rate in the system. So, everything in this equation is known except for this constant C. And here I plot, I'm sorry, here I made a mistake. It's G y cos G y is G cos theta. There should be a cos theta term here, which I've left out. But if I plot the left-hand side of this. But if I plot the left-hand side of this equation with the right-hand side, we get a straight line, and the slope C times pi is 3.67. So C is 3.1, 3.28, 3.67 for different angles of inclination of the cylinder. So this essentially verifies this very simple model in which the motion of the particle is essentially determined by the weight minus buoyancy. Weight minus buoyancy being balanced by the drag force. So, this tells us how a single particle would sink in a flowing layer of identical sized particles. We can then extend the same approach to the case of mixtures. And so this looks exactly like what I had shown you in the previous slide. But now the test particle is not surrounded by just red particles, but there are some of them are. Red particles, but there are some of them are the gray particles which are heavier. So we follow the exact same approach, and instead of the density of the fluid, now we have an average density, which includes both the heavy and the light particles. And so we get an expression for the net force on the particle given by this. So it has this pre-factor. So it has this pre-factor 1 minus L. Once we have this, we can easily find out the velocity VH as we have done before. And so we can find out a continuum expression for the segregation flux as just the velocity times the concentration. Here, F is the fraction of heavy particles. Heavy particles, n is the number density, so this is the flux of particles, and then if we substitute for vh, then we get a nice simple expression like this. Now, where in addition to segregation, we also have diffusion, as we just saw, and this diffusivity has been estimated numerically. And the form of the diffusion flux is like this. Of course, here I have just introduced this parameter. Just introduced this parameter called the effective temperature, which is obtained from the Stokes-Einstein relation. This is just a convenient way of writing the diffusivity times C pi eta D. Just a short form way of writing it. So everything in this is known. We have estimated D, we have estimated C, eta, and D is, of course, the diameter of the particle. So everything. So, everything is known here. And so, we are interested in the case of equilibrium where the segregation flux is balanced by the diffusion flux. And in this case, you get a very simple expression where the gradient of the number fraction is just equal to this simple expression. And so, this tells us. And so, this tells us how a mixture would segregate. And here are some results for a mixture. So, these are some profiles for flowing particles on the inclined plane. These are the angles of the inclined plane. These profiles show the velocity of the particles, and you know, the symbols are for the heavy particles, and the lines are for the lighter. Are for the lighter particles, and you can see that there is no slip between these two particles, and they essentially flow at the same speed. And if you look at the number density profile, you see that the high density particles are all at the bottom and the low density particles at the top. And we so these are all simulation results, and we can compare. Results, and we can compare from this. We can essentially compare to the theory, and this shows the mean squared displacement to get the diffusivity. And then this is the calculation of the effective temperature that we need in the theory. And finally, this is a comparison of the theoretical predictions, which are the straight lines, to the simulation results. And you know, there is really. And you know, there is really very good agreement, and there are no parameters that are fitted in this analysis. We also tried to do some experimental studies of the same system, where we here we are using glass beads and steel balls, and we did these experiments in a rotating cylinder. So, as these go around, the material segregates in the flowing layer. We use two millimeter steel. We used two millimeter steel balls and two millimeter glass beads. And then we did video imaging, found out what the number of fractions and so forth. And so these are again the same type of profiles, mainly that the steel balls are all at the bottom and the glass beads are all at the top. And we could also get the diffusivity by seeing the mean square displacement of the particles through image analysis and so forth. Through image analysis and so forth. And we found a nice correlation between the diffusivity and the velocity gradient of the flow. And then again, this also shows good agreement between theory and experiment. And in this case, also, we have measured everything and there are no fitted parameters. And there are no fitted parameters. So, this is quite a robust theory for density segregation, but sizes are equal. So, what happens if you take different size particles? Now, this has been a subject of quite a lot of study, and recently there have been several works that have been published. Been published. The basic thing is that in the same system of particles flowing down an inclined plane, it's the large particles that rise, and that's really difficult to explain. And two explanations have been proposed. One is that there is an additional lift force, which is analogous to Saffman lift. This is work by Van der Waard and co-workers. And then And then there's another piece of work by Jing and co-workers who say that the buoyancy force is larger than the weight and they don't talk much about lift. Now, of course, when you want to calculate the buoyancy force, calculating the effective volume is not straightforward. In this work, they use the Verdunoi tessellation around the large particle. And you know, when you do Verdunoi particle tessellation, the planes come exactly in between the Planes come exactly in between the particles. So, whatever is within the Bournois tessellation is considered to be the effective volume. But it's not clear that this is a very rigorous way of doing things, but it's reasonable. And what they found is that if they use this effective volume and SAFM lift, they could predict the segregation. And here, they just simply gave an empirical expression for the segregation that takes place. Segregation that takes place. So we decided to look at again a single particle study. And we looked at two systems: one where there's a shear flow without any gravity. And the second is the system I've been talking about, which is the inclined plane flow in which there is gravity. So in this case, we have lift force and drag force. And then here we have buoyancy, lift force, and drag force. In both these cases, there is a spring force. There is a spring force Fs that acts on the particle that prevents the particle from rising beyond a certain height. And this spring force tries to keep the particle at a height Z star. And if there's an upward force, then the spring is extended. And based on the extension of the spring, we can calculate what is the total upward force or the lift force that is acting. And in this case, the buoyancy minus the lift force. Case the buoyancy minus the lift force. We also apply a force along the flow, the pulling force, so that we can generate sufficient slip to generate a large lift in the system. And here are some results that you know we actually find the same sort of behavior: the drag force is proportional. Is proportional to the slip velocity as we found for the equal size particles. And we also found a lift force which is proportional to the drag force. So that we found this best to sort of put this. And this is a very tiny lift force. It's about 10 times smaller than the drag force. Another thing which is interesting is that we found that the lift force is in fact opposite to what you Fact opposite to what you find, it acts in the opposite direction to salfman lift. So, you know, it doesn't really help to predict segregation because it acts in the opposite direction. In the inclined plane flow, also, we get similar results, and here in the drag force again increases linearly with the slip velocity and Velocity and at zero slip velocity that is the case where at that point the slip the lift force is zero and so the entire upward force is due to buoyancy so from these data we can calculate the buoyancy force as well so we've done large numbers of simulation and you know all of these data for many different systems and they all collapse to They all collapse to a single line. The drag force essentially goes as like the Stokes law, and it's shown here. The line is for Stokes law and the data for all different conditions. And again, the lift, we've got an empirical equation to predict the lift force, and that also all collapses to a single line. This third graph shows the buoyancy force. So, this is the buoyancy force normalized by the weight of the particle. And essentially, you know, when as we saw before, when the two are sizes are equal, on this axis is the size ratio. When the two sizes are equal, these two forces are exactly balanced, and you get one. And you get one, but what we find from our simulations, which is this red line, that in fact the buoyancy force sometimes is larger than the weight. And in these cases, the particles actually rise and then it falls below one when the particles sink. So it's only a range of sizes where the particles rise and otherwise they sink. We also tried to calculate the We also tried to calculate the effective volume for this system, and we did a very simple method. So, in the inclined plane flow, we first did simulations with only the small particles, that is the black line, and then we added one large particle, which is the red line. And what we found is that the height of the flowing layer increased by a tiny amount. So, by doing you So, by doing very careful sort of measurements of this height, we are able to calculate the effective volume. And from this, we can get this blue curve. And what we find is that, you know, if we just take the effective volume based on excluded volume effects, this always is below one. So, this cannot predict. This cannot predict this upward motion of the large particles that we see. So we decided to look a little bit more detail at what's going on around the particle. And here I show data for what is in a slice, a vertical slice through the intruder. Vertical slice through the intruder going through the diameter of the intruder and we bind all the other particles around and here you can see the solid volume fraction the red and yellow are where the solid volume fraction is high and so you can see that it's not a uniform distribution but because of the shear flow there are higher densities in these regions and both for the shear flow and incline plane flow this kind of And inclined plane flow, this kind of solid fraction variation is very similar. And so you can get some regions where you have very high solid fractions, which are marked by these yellow spots. And then in other regions, the solid fraction is very low. So this is because the particles are colliding from these two ends and there are no collisions over here. If we look at the velocity. If we look at the velocity profiles, we see that the disturbance is very, very in a small region around the intruder. And if you look at the pressure profiles for the shear flow, the pressure is essentially constant, but you do see this fluctuation near the intruder. This is because of the pileup of particles, as I showed you before. And here it's what is interesting is that for the inclined plane flow, you have a linear increase. Inclined plane flow: you have a linear increase in the pressure, but you see a very large difference between the pressure here and here because of these pressure fluctuations. So the pressure field is quite distorted in the neighborhood of the intruder because of this volume fraction distribution. So in this one, we've just looked at a strip that goes vertical sliced like this. Like this. And then the final thing is that we've actually calculated the radial velocity and the normal stress acting on the intruder at different points along the surface. And what we find is that in the shear flow, you have a much higher velocity impacting at the lower end compared to the top. This is because the particles are colliding here with a higher velocity. With a higher velocity than here, and this is because of the slip particles. This sphere is being pulled at the slip velocity relative to all the others. And as a result of that, we see a slightly higher force. So, this higher collisional velocity is, according to us, what causes the lift force and pushes the particle upward. In the case of the inclined plane, In the case of the inclined plane flow, you see that the velocities in both directions are nearly the same because there is no slip. But we see a significantly higher normal stress in this region compared to this region. And this is because of the distortions in the pressure field. If the pressure field was uniform and linear, then you would get the red line. So, you know, what we see is that enhanced buoyancy is simply because of this distortion in the pressure field. So, let me just conclude. Segregation is very important in granular processing and it's been studied quite a bit. For equal size and different density particles, we understand things very well. For equal density and different size particles, Equal density and different size particles things are more complicated. We have a non-Safman lift force and a buoyancy force which is higher than the Archimedean buoyancy. And from our small scale studies, what we find is that the lift force is essentially due to the higher collisional stress on the lower surface of the intruder due to the slip velocity, and the high buoyancy force is due to the distorted pressure field. Distorted pressure field. So, with that, I might end. And if there are any questions, I'll be happy to take them. Let's thank Professor Kakar for a very nice and stimulating talk. Questions from Zoom, I would expect quite a lot because I have colleagues that work on sedimentation, what type of problems, and keep asking similar questions, which I can't answer, but you can. You can and uh um professor ghosh, I think he works on the similar things with interparticle frictional forces. So, uh, Professor Ghosh, Professor Ozumir, if you have questions, post it in chat box. Otherwise, I'll start taking questions from the audience in the room. No, no, okay. Uh, well, uh, this is very exciting to see uh, how nice uh models are coming out for explaining these uh uh Explaining these segregation purely based on size. This is going to be a very important problem for when we are doing cuttings transport, especially for the drilling. Most of the rocks are of the similar densities, but their sizes are very varied. And it actually would be able to explain the settling bed velocities, bed heights, as well as moving bed velocity. So I'm looking forward to reading this paper. I'm looking forward to reading this paper very critically, Professor Kakars. Thank you for. Thank you. Thank you very much. How do we include? So, my question is about: are you seeing any interparticle frictional forces also accounted into it or they're explicitly resolved? Yes. So, you know, we do in the simulations, friction is explicitly taken into account. But in the model, since we're treating it like a fluid, Since we're treating it like a fluid, we lump it into the viscosity. So, you know, if you think in terms of the mu I model, then this viscosity is nothing but mu times the pressure divided by the shear rate. So, yeah, so in some sense, friction is taken into account, but right now, I mean, we are lumping it into something that looks like a viscosity. Okay, not like in a DEM collisional model with a Like in a DEM collisional model with a tangential simulations have the they are all DEM simulations based and they take friction into account. So friction is very much in there. But in that simple model that I was showing you to try and explain the DEM simulations, we lump the frictional effects into the viscosity. Understood. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I think we are slowly I think we are slightly over time, but your presentation has been recorded and archived on the birth. So, in the interest of time, I'll thank you again for your exciting presentation. And we are going to take a short coffee break over here and resume into the second session at 11 a.m. local time, which is US Central Time. Thank you, Professor. And our next talk will be at 11 a.m. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Bye-bye.
