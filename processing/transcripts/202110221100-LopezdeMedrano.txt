Thank you very much, Alicia, for the introduction. And thanks to all the organizers to be so patient and kind to organize it, even if it's online and everything. Thank you very much. As I was saying before, preparing this talk was like time travel for me because this is not Because this is not a new work. It's been a while I've been thinking in more communatorics and not real things. And it was really nice that you asked me to speak about this because I remember my love to real algebraic geometry. Okay, then it Once Upon a Time. It's not new. It's about a paper that was published in It was published in 2014, and it's a joint work with Erwan Brugale and Albina Royo. And it has a lot of personal history, and I'm sorry, I'm going to take sometimes moments to speak about it. Okay, then as the title says, the focus of this talk is study the study the distribution of real inflection points in the among the ovals of a non-singular real hyperbolic curve. And we're going to focus only in even degree to have something compact and then well I'm going to define Define inflection point, but I think all of you know that it's a point where the tangent has a multiplicity of intersection order with the curve at least three, or we have another kind of inflection points that are the singular points of the curve of the real curve. Everything is going to be real, real polynomial, almost everything, and then. And then before going to the reals, I'm going to recall you that if we start with a algebraic close to field, then by Besut's theorem, we know that in general, if the curve is reduced and it not contain any line, then it has exactly 3d times d minus 2. 3d times d minus 2 inflection points, all of them counted with multiplicity. It's only the multiplicity of the degree of the curve and the degree of the Hessian of the curve that is 3 times d minus 2. Then we're intersecting two curves, one of the degree t and the other one of the degree 3 times d minus 2. And in general, if we take a non-singular real, a non-singular Singular real non-singular curve over c over k, then we're going to have exactly this number of inflection points, all of them of multiplicity one. That's the general case. And obviously, when we go to the non-algebraic closed case, the situation is not longer constant. Then, in particular, Then in particular, the number of inflection points in the projective plane over k does not depend only in the degree. Obviously, we're going to have the upper bounds, the same upper bound as in the algebraically close case. But now we also depend on the coefficients of the polynomial. Okay, then if we go into the real case, then we it has been known for a long time that any cubic curve, that if we make the calculation, we know that we have nine inflection points in the complex case, but only three of them can be real. We cannot have all the inflection points of a compact. Of the complexification of a real curve, only three of them can be real. All of them are a pair of conjugated points, complex points. And this is a very nice theorem from Klein that only a third of the theorem. Only a third of the number I mentioned before can be real. There doesn't exist a curve with more than d times d minus two real inflection points. This is the term by hand. I don't know why this is here, but okay. I'm sorry, here is not. It's not it's eight, I'm sorry, it's not and then we have more than a century and a half having this beautiful theorem. And in fact, this theorem is like a reduction of the real theorem of Klein because what he says is relates the number of inflection points and the number of Points and the number of real bitangents of the curve. And then he proved that the sum of the inflection points close to time the number of a kind of tangents is less than d times d minus two. And I now prove that this is an operand, then there exists for every degree d real algebraic curves non-singular with exactly Curves non-singular with exactly d times d minus two inflection points, and we're going to call this kind of curves the they are they are maximally inflected and then we're going to focus on curves on real curves maximally inflected then we know that they have exactly d times d minus two inflection points okay everything is clear from here okay um Okay, and then we're going to speak a little bit about how to prove this, the sharpness of the bound, of the Klein's bounds. And it's an important observation that if we have a node, a nodal curve, and if we take a node such that both branches around the node are convex. The nodes are convex. I mean, the point is not an inflection point of the two branches, of any of the two branches. Then if we perturb a little bit this polynomial, we're going to obtain a curve having exactly two inflection points around this node. Then we here we have the picture, we have this node, both branches. Both branches are not inflected in the node. And then, if we perturb a little bit, we're going to find two inflection points, no matter what the choice of the perturbation. Then we can relate also the number of inflection points with the nodes. Then we can create maximally inflected curves using nodal. Inflected curves using novel curves. And then exactly applying this method of small. The hypothesis is about the curvature of the branches. Which is the hypothesis? What do you say? It's about what? It says strictly convex. How do you check strict convexity? I mean, this is not a I mean, this is not any of them are a line. I mean, you're not in the line case. Yeah. And the point is not an inflection point. They are generic points and is not contained in a line. Thank you. Then you can use this method, the Hilbert's method or the small perturbation method, to construct maximally inflected curves of any degree. At least two, obviously, because in degree one, for example, it takes a we can construct a curve of the degree four. We take the union of two conics, compact conics, and we're going to have four nodes. And if we perturb to have a non-singular Per curve to have a non-singular curve, we're going to have two inflection points for each note, and we're going to have the right number that we were looking for. Okay, but besides this observation, the inflection points of maximal inflected curves, there are many open questions even now. I think so. I haven't been in the field, and I think. And been in the field, and I think I don't know if there are new results about it. And the idea also is to study these distributions of the inflection points in the connected components of a real curve. We can use different methods of construction and study how the inflection point How the inflection points act with this method of construction. And for example, we have this question, if we have a topological type, a fixed topological class of real algebraic curve of a given degree, it always exists a curve in this class that is maximally inflected or not? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, we know that for any degree we have maximally inflected curves, but we don't know if every topological type or rigid isotopy class has an element maximally inflected. Or, for example, if we have a maximally, if we know that in this class there are maximally inflected curves. There are maximally inflected curves. How are the inflected points distributed in the connected components of the curve? I mean, I think these two questions are wide open in general. Okay, then we're going to, as I was saying, one method to study the distribution is have a method to construct and study. To construct and study how the inflection points are living in the curve. And one of the most powerful methods to construct curves is the Viro method. And using Viro patchworking techniques, and in particular, combinatorial patchworking techniques, you can construct maximally inflected real algebraic curves. Male-infected real algebraic curves. And I was saying that now we're going to forget all the possibilities of the different topologies and we're going to fix our attention to the maximal inflected hyperbolic curves of even degree. It's an example of the question I was saying before. And then what is What is a hyperbolic curve? I think everybody knows, but anyway, I'm going to recall. Hyperbolic curves is like the generalization to curves of the real polynomials. And we say that a curve C in R2 or in RP2 is a hyperbolic if there exists a point in the complement of the curve, such that any line through P intersects the curve only in real points. Points. And the topology of these curves are very simple, are always a nested set of ovals in the even case, and a nested set of ovals and a southern line in the odd degrees. Then if I make a compact A compact drawing, we're going to have that all the hyperbolic curves look like that in the even degree when we have exactly half of the degree of us. And the point P is here in this region, and then any line through P intersects the curve in C. Through P intersects the curve in six real points, then we don't have complex intersections with these curves. Okay, then as many of you also know, but I'm going to recall it anyway, we're going to call a novel of a real curve if it's the embedding of a circle in the space, in the plane, in the projected plane. Projected lane. And once we embed this circle, we're going to see if it's the number of connected components of the complement. And then we're going to call this complement, this embedding a novel if the complement has two components, it's not connects. And then if one of the complement, the connected components of the complement will be the complement will be uh it's some homeomorphic to a disk and the other one will this one is going to be called interior and the other one is going to be called exterior and for example this oval this part is is interior and this part is exterior okay and and we're going to say that an oval is contained in another oval if it's containing its interior Its interior. And then a non-singular hyperbolic curve of degree 2D is a set of d nested ovals. And this it means we have an inclusion relations among the ovals, as it's a total order. Then the draw is exactly the draw I was making before. Then we're going to fix in this kind of curves. To fix in this kind of curves, hyperbolic of degree, to even degree, then the degree will be 2D. And we're going to call the oval that contains all the other ovals. We're going to call it the outer oval of C. For example, what happened with the inflection points in this kind of curves? In this kind of curves. Besut theorem, the super powerful Besut theorem tells us directly that the smallest oval, the inner oval, is convex. We cannot have inflection points there. And the idea is very simple. If I have, for example, a curve of degree six, of whatever degree, even degree, and I Degree, even degree. And I have an inflection point here. I take the tangent line, and we're going to have the number of intersections is counting with multiplicity is more than the degree of the curve. The inner oval is always convex. The first restriction we have in the distribution of the inflection points is known of them is in the... None of them is in the inner oval. And then we're going to say that the exterior of the of the outer oval is going to be called the exterior of the curve and the interior of the curve will be the interior of the outer oval. And we're going to also look at the convex hull of the of a compact set, but in this case of the we're going to have to set up the compact. But in this case, we're going to take a chart of the curve that makes the curve compact, and we're going to look at its convex hull. And we're going to call a hole of S the convex hull of a compact set S. And if S is not convex, we're going to have that the convex hull of S has some line segments. Line segments, and we're going to denote by the number of line segments in the convex hole of s in the border of the convex hole of s and for example in our previous example if i have a hyperbolic curve of degree four of this type we can see that Can see that if I take the convex hole, we're going to see appear some segments of lines. In this case, in my draw is four. And then we can relate the number of inflection points in the outer oval with this number of segments, because for any of these line segments, we have at least two inflection points. Two inflection points. Then we can say that we have at least two inflection points, in fact, an even number of inflection points for each one of these line segments. Then by Klein inequality, we know that the number of line segments in the border of the convex hole of the curve is bounded by this number. Bounded by this number. Then a method to construct curves with a maximally inflected oval is to construct a hyperbolic curve such that in the border of its convex hole has exactly 2d times this minus one line segment. Okay, then with Erguan Burgale, we start looking at this problem of finding distributions of Distributions of inflection points in real curves. And then, in fact, we prove that every generic smooth tropical curve is maximally inflected. It means that if I have a classical curve that tropicalizes in a generic smooth tropical curve, then we know that the The curve, the classical curve, is maximally inflected. Then we start to playing with patchworking and tropical geometry to find distributions in real curves. And then that's when my personal story begins. And it was what's an inflection point of the tropical curve? of the tropical curve is the it's a limit of real frequent points no is the is the image is the is the image of the of the inflection for points of the curves i mean we are in curves we are in plane curves then every every tropical curve is realizable and if you take the the union of all the tropicalization of the tropicalizations of all the inflection points Tropicalizations of all the inflection points of all the curves tropicalizing in a tropical curve. This is the points that are called inflection points of a tropical curve. And in fact, they are very, they behave super well. It's like your work about the singular points. It's the same definition. Thank you. See, it's the same definition, right? See, it's the same definition, right? I think so, yeah. Yeah, then here, what is uh it was very surprising to us is to find that and here I put generic, but the genericity is very the condition of genericity is very very weak. It's something I can forget, you can forget about it. And then we were studying this. Studying this, and then we go back to 2011. I was traveling in Europe for the first time after being mother, traveling with my very small kids. And I was like kind of shocked to be in a conference after a while. I remember we were in the Guetz University in Frankfurt. In Frankfurt. I remember the auditorium. I was sit in the back with Erwin and it was the conferences of Bern. And suddenly he turned to the public and say, I have a question for you, Lucia. And everyone, I was like, ah! I was like, no, I was trying. No one sees me. I was like, look, thinking about my kids. Like, look, thinking about my kid outside the auditorium, not in the conference. And in fact, he was speaking about this joint work with Jesus de Loeira and Cynthia Vincent about the central curve of linear programming. And they were trying to bound the curvature of the central curve. And his questions was, what is the largest number of inflection points in a single? Inflection points in a single level of a hyperbolic curve of degree D in the real plane, in the real projected plane. And in particular, for example, is this number linear in G or not? And then we were like, all the rest of the talk, we took our paper and our pen and we were like drawing and drawing, drawing. And finally, we went to see him. We went to see him and told him that we can have all the points, all the inflection points in the outer wall. There exists a hyperbolic curve and maximally inflected for any even degree. You can have all the inflection points in the outer level. Then this question was solved. You can have all of them. There are no them there are no bounds other than the number of inflection points and this one also this was non-linear because the number of inflection point is non-linear only then in fact we i came back to mexico and i start working also in this question with wina royo from here from cunavaca and then we have this this uh theorem that if we have uh two That if we have two integer points, d and r, we can always construct a curve. If r is between 4 and 2d, d minus 1, there always exists a non-singular maximally inflected hyperbolic curve of degree 2d with s of c equal to r. I recall s of c is a number of line of line segments in the in the border of In the border of the convex hole. Then, once we can have this, we prove that we can have not only the maximal number of ovals, of inflection points in the outer oval, none of them, not always are related totally with the number of segments. But if we can create this one, we are creating a This one, we are creating a hyperbolic curve with a maximally inflected outer level. And here's a picture, for example, of our construction. It looks like singular, but it's not singular, so only the obals are very, very, very closed. And we can see here we have a degree six hyperbolic curve, and we can see that the gray parts are the The gray parts are the lines in the border of the convex hole, and we can see that we have 12 line segments. And then it means we have 24 inflection points in the outer bowel. And I like very much this picture, but it looks like an astronaut or a scuba diver or I don't know, something like that. I always see this picture. I imagine someone in size. Okay. someone in size. Okay, this is a very, very nice curve. But I mean, we can continue to study other distribution of these inflection points. And then we were a little bit farther. I'm sorry here, the text is kind of very and then we start looking at all the possible distributions of this of them of the of the inflection points in a in hyperbolic curves of degree six and what what what we found is that sorry my text is not very well Not very well. In fact, we can have if I take a maximally inflected hyperbolic curve of degree six, I mean, we have three nested ovals. And then the outer oval always at least six real inflection points. They're not is not possible. It doesn't exist a maximally inflected hyperbolic curve of degree six, having less than six real inflection points. Real inflection points in the outer role. Moreover, for any k between 0 and 9, we can have, I mean, the number of inflection points in a novel is even, then the outer oval has at least 6, and then we can have all the other possibilities always adding two. I mean, we have six, eight, ten, and whatever. I mean, we have six plus two k. We have six plus 2k real inflection points in the outer level, and this is the complete classification of the possible distribution of the inflection points in the hyperbolic maximally inflected curves of degree six. And we can go, I mean, for this proof, we make the constructions and for the obstructions to prove that we can have less than six real inflection. Less than six real inflection points, we used Orefkov Brave theoretical method. And this method we use strongly that we were in degree six. Then we couldn't, I mean, we didn't try to go further in this classification. We know that for any even degree, we can have all of the inflection points in the outer rubble. Inflection points in the outer rubble, but we don't know if for every even degree we have a lower bound, like in the degree six, of the number of inflection points in the outer oval. I think we don't have any answer since. Maybe you know. If you know, please tell me because I haven't thought about it in a while. Okay, this is why. Okay, this is what I was saying: that we use strongly the degree six, and for even degree greater than six, the problem remains open, at least at my knowledge. And here are the pictures of the constructions using tropical geometry. When we construct here, for example, we're going to call We're going to call C we're going to call C K the curve having six plus two K real inflection points in the outer eval. And here we have pictures of the construction of C0. I mean where it means we have exactly six inflection points in the Six inflection points in the outer oval, and all the other in the middle one, because as I was saying before, the smallest oval is always convex. Then, if we have six in the outer oval, it means all the others are in the middle one. And here is kind of the technique to see in which ovals are the inflection points. The inflection points. I was showing you before a picture of that we know where are the inflection points, and using patchworking, we can know where are these inflection points. We have here another picture of C8, and here is the real picture. And then I haven't thought about this in. I haven't thought about this since then. If you have any information of any comments, I think I'm always done with my time and I will be glad to hear your comments or your questions. Lucia, how do you... I understood the definition of inflection point of a tropical car, but how do you decide what the points are? You just how can you decide whether you how do how did you How did you draw the red points? In this case, we have this paper with Erwin Brugali that is called Inflection Points of Tropical Plane Curves and makes a very combinatorial way to know. We have like a dictionary of around every vertex. We prove that every A tree tangents of a tropical smod curve has a vertex in common with the curve. Then we studied using modifications, I think was the first applications of tropical modification in real algebraic geometry to see exactly where you can have this. It's a combinatorial definition. Thank you. Thank you. Nice lecture. I enjoyed it. Any other questions, comments? Please feel free to unmute your microphones and ask aloud.
