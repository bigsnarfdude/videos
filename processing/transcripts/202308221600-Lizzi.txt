And I have no objection in being recorded. Thanks. And you will present a talk about Wonden all the way. Okay. Yes. It is partly a citation of an article I wrote some years ago with Paolo Schieri and Patrizia Vitale. And I will discuss work and I want to thank first the I want to thank first my collaborators that are here. They were not all on the same paper. It looks like a Birgo paper. So Maria Dmitrievich, Zeppe Fabiano, Julia Gubitosi, Nikola Konjic, Max Kurkov, Matia Manfredonia, Flavia Mercati, Timothepulen, and Javier Valancio, Luca Scarlet, and Patricia Vitale. Okay, I will give a personal Give a personal and therefore will be partial account of some issues which are related to quantum space-time. And I will concentrate on symmetries and I will discuss something which hasn't been discussed in this conference, but it's something which is becoming very important. Well, partly Martin has mentioned something, which is the issue of observer quantum mechanics. Now, this is the something interesting is coming from there. There probably is a There. There probably is a byproduct of the interest for quantum computing, etc., but we are asking questions of this kind. And in order to be concrete, I will use a particular class of quantum space-times, so some non-computative geometries of the standard kind, the one you define with non-computative coordinates. They are not the only kind of things, but I will discuss them. I will discuss them. And I will use as symmetries the HOPF algebra, the quantum groups. And I will discuss, there are two ways of doing this, two standard ways. One is the by cross-croduct or a Drinfeld twist. Drinfeld twists were already introduced, but I will say something. I will use specific examples, but I think most of the issues that I will discuss are more general. And so. So, okay, I will skip the usual words of introduction: why it's necessary to quantize space-time. And I will use, as I said, this particular kind of non-commutativity. So I would say now in this spectral conference, the algebra is generated by coordinates that have this non-commutative which is non-trivial, and is a function, in general, a function of x. function in general a function of x a theta can be can be a constant and then this is called moial or doppler federal and roberts and or quantum mechanics and that's not the only form of thing of non-computing geometry now let me say just as a aside i think that the most interesting form of non-computing geometry is the one um the spectral one and uh which has also some Which has also some application to the standard model, and I think it's the most interesting. Not many people are talking of this in this talk, but in my case, I'll be guilty of also not talking about this. But the search for symmetries led me and my collaborators to go in this direction. Okay, so I will discuss two cases in particular. One is the fairly famous Kapaninkowski. Because Kappa-Minkowski. Kapa-Minkowski is, both of them are four-dimensional. Kapa-Minkowski has time, which doesn't compute with space with this sort of commutator. So x0, x1 is x1, and so on. And the spatial coordinates commuted among themselves. L is the inverse of kappa. Historically, they started, the people that introduced this, were using one over kappa. One over kappa, so that the classical limit was obtained in the limit of kappa going to infinity, like the speed of light. I prefer to have a length which is short because I come from quantum mechanics. So for me, a classical limit is something which becomes zero, not goes to infinity, doesn't change anything. And then another kind of non-commutative space called angular non-commutativity, and I call it Rominkowski, and it's this kind, x0, x1 is minus. x1 is minus x2 and x0 x2 is x1 so you will recognize this is a generator of rotations and there is some principle a third case which is discussed in the paper but not in this talk in which the commutator is this one the the the the the x0 central here and the x3 central here and i i will be i will not be euclidean of course I will not be Euclidean, of course. The signature of space-time will be the Minkowski and one. This one has X, sorry. This one as no, no, no, I should be able to no, Jose. No, my advice is two sentences for no two. I can go to Neapolitan as well. By the way, everything. By the way, everything goes on YouTube, but this can become viral. Okay. This one has X0, X1, and this one has X3, X1. So somebody was asking the difference between these two cases. So I cannot really name these three things. No, because there is a signature. I mean, Minkowski. So in one case, so time is different from. So, time is different from space. Okay. And of course, I break Poincaré invariance. And the point is that if I am having a quantum space-time, it's very likely that I will need quantum symmetries. And in fact, historically, it went the other way around. First, Kappa Poincaré was produced, and then Kappa Minkowski was found. But I will start from space-time and Will start from space-time and then find the symmetries because there are some differences. So let me introduce a symmetry which is a Hopfalgebra. I think that it should be probably redundant with this audience. And a Hopf algebra is an algebra and a co-algebra. So it's an algebra that has a product that all the structures of an algebra and it has also a co-algebra. Of an algebra, and it has also a co-product, which is a sort of inverse map from one element to the tensor, tensor product of two elements. Then I have a co-unit and an antipode, which I will not use too much. And there are some compatibility conditions. And I will use this Swedler notation. A Lie algebra is a good example. And the coproduct is in this case is trivial. So it's Trivial, so it's the product of A is this, and you recognize here the Leibniz rule if this is a vector field with their derivatives. So, this is the case of a Lie algebra. And another example is a group. And a group has a natural structure. And you see, before was something cross one plus one cross something, said the RATA. One cross something, said the I take a product of these two things, and this is basically something that is typical of functions on a group. So, this is the structures of OP algebra very briefly, and I will use some of these characteristics. Okay, there is there are of algebra, of course, live with their own life, their active field of study, but there are two standard ways. There are two standard ways of obtaining algebra. One is via the bicross product. And now, this is a generalization of the cross product that you introduced to find the Poincaré algebra, because Poincaré algebra is the product between Lorentz transformation and translations, but in a way in which when you just don't take the You just don't take the tensor product, the translation, the Lorentz translation act on translations in a non-trivial way. And the construction goes this way. You have two algebras, chi and A, and they act on each other. So there is a right action of chi on A and a left co-action of A on chi. This is the things. This is the things, and you have this kind of structure. Now, I have several formulae. I don't expect you, unless you are familiar with them, to learn in this talk. But the point that I want to come across is that you have two algebras, one act, one on the other, in a coordinated way, because you have to have structure and keep this structure. Then the off-algebra structure. And then the off-algebra structure in this case is this one. See, there is a product and there is a coproduct. And the product is you have X, an element of the X belongs to chi, A belongs to A, you have something. And when you take the product, you do it in a possibly non-trivial way. Then you have identity, co-identity, and a number of steps. entity and a number of structures that you have and so there is this co-product and actions so the again i don't want to go into too much detail but the idea is that you have the space time and the symmetries and they act on each other and you have you want some structures like having a group structure or Lie algebra structure or something so you are not free Or something. So you are not free to have any sort of action. You have to have something. In fact, in some books, there are some diagrams that have to be commutative and something of this kind. So this is a co-product. And the paradigm for this is the Poincareli algebra, which is promoted to a co-algebra and off-algebra with additional structures. So I have the Lorentz part and the translation part. Part and quantum symmetries enables me to deform this. But since it's a Hopf algebra, I have to do it in a controlled way. So in fact, there is a full theory of Gersten Aberdeen deformations which you deform these things. So you have to do it in a clever way. And so non-commutative spaces and non-commutative symmetries are not that many. You cannot, you can. You cannot, you can imagine any sort of non-commutative space, but if you have a crazy one, you have no guarantee that there will be a quantum symmetry in it. Okay. Okay, this works for Kapaminkowski. Kapa-Minkowski is of this kind. In fact, as I said, come from the other side. The deformation is that of translation, which is reproduces the Kappa-Minkowski relations. Kappa-Minkowski relations, and then the application is sort of straightforward. And I need a duality between position and momenta, x mu, p mu, which is usually this one. See, this has a Minkowski signature. I usually use minus plus plus plus plus, but it's not really relevant for what I say. And this is the co-product. You see, there is a deformation. You see, there is a deformation here, this P0. And if you want, you can close the circle. So you start with the commutator of X0 and X1. It has to be dual to PK. Then you use the coproducts all around, and you find that X0, XI must be to IL XI. So the structure is compatible in this way. And again, historically, it went the other way around, but. Historically, it went the other way around, but it doesn't matter. And you can start either from the symmetry and find that space-time or go the other way around. There is an alternative way to construct a non-commutative space-time, and this is with the Drinfelt twist. So now the Drinfelt twist is really a deformation of the tensor product, because you have a twist which goes from the tensor product of two. Of two things, they will be later. I will be more precise, but uh, there is something which I act on the test of roto or two spaces, algebras. They can be algebra algebra. I'm generic because I'm generic because I want to be general. And this twist has to be a cocycle, so I must have something which ensures, for example, associativity of the product or this kind of thing. Or this kind of thing. And I avoided to tell you which sort of functions I'm using. So for the moment, I take tensor product of functions. So I haven't said which sort of functions there are. Okay, now there is an intrinsic duality when I talk of symmetries. This we learn in undergraduate. Either I talk of Lie algebra, which I Of Lie algebra, which are the infinitesimal transformations, or I talk of groups. And we, in normally, we know to go from one to the other without much problems. There are some nuances which I will ignore, the fact that Lie algebra, here I'll go to the covering group, but I will be local in most of my considerations. Now, if I take one. Now, if I take quantization symmetries, I can go in two paths: the equivalent. Either I deform the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra, or I deform the non-commutativity functions of the group. The two things have the same duality between Lie algebra and groups. So either I deform the commutator of the Lie algebra, and therefore, if I take And therefore, if I take arbitrary combinations of the generators of the Lie algebra, they are deformed. Or I deform the parameters of the group, which we come non-commutative. See, even if the group is non-commutative, the parameters of the groups are numbers. They commute. Rotations at three angles, and the three angles are numbers. So the numbers don't commute. In a quantum group, they will not commute. Group, they will not commute. Okay, and the paradigmatic example of a Drinfeld twist is the Grenvold-Moyal product, in which I take the algebra functions over Rn, and the Drienfeld twist is this theta mu nu d mu d nu. Theta mu nu is an anti-symmetric object, and if I And if I call mu the product between functions, just a way of saying that if I take the function, product of two functions, I just basically have to calculate the calculator point is the product of the value of the two functions calculated that points. And if I use this twist, I end up with the Moyal product. And I think you are familiar with this because. With this because it became very important because I beg with them. So, to a great extent, working with the twist is a change of the tensor product. So, it goes, it's a profound change because tensor product is ever present in actions. Whenever you have something which acts on something or something which acts on itself, there is a tensor product there. So, the twist changes. The twist changes lots of things. And if I now represent the twist as an action on the of algebra, you see before I was taking the twist to have this d mu, but this is actually p mu. And if I take this written, this acts as generators of the Lie algebra, and I can define the formation of the I can define a deformation of the coproduct, and I have this is the deformation of the coproduct. You see, there is a part which is basically the Leibniz rule, and then there is a deformation of this. So, this is a fairly well-known way of thinking, and I have two ways of this algebra historically. They are not the only ones, but But there is an interesting bit. The twist deformation, the one that I just showed, is not a bicross product involving the Pokere algebra. So the one that I used, not I, that historically was used for creating Kappa Minkowski is a bicross product. And the one used for the mojal is Moyal is instead that the infer twist. And the two of them, I cannot use, there is not a construction which involves quark, I mean something. And Kapalinkowski does not have a natural twist construction. There are some, but they are sometimes contrived, and they usually you have to introduce the point to enlarge upon Carré algebra. To enlarge upon Carré algebra, for example, going to the Weyl group. Interesting, for a light-like version of the Kapavinkovsky, so instead of X0, you have the Nolcan coordinate, then for this one, there is a twist. But historically, the two, one comes from one way, one comes from the other. So, why is that? What's the idea? This talk is. This talk is very ideological. There are, but believe me, there are, if pressed, I can give you all the calculations in between. Why they are different and why should I was interested in finding something which were putting the two things together? Because in one case, you start from the symmetries, you deform the symmetries, and then you find the homogeneous space. Space. So the stress is on the symmetry. In the other case, the stress is on the space-time. I deform much more a la non-commutative geometry, in fact. I deform the algebra of functions on the space-time, and then I look for the symmetries. So the two have some sort of attention. And I wanted to look at something which could put the two things together and Things together. And we found this in this Rominkovsky space for, and I will discuss this Rominkovsky, which has some interesting features, and I think it's interesting to study it. Okay, it's good to, it's simpler to describe this Rominkovsky in cylindrical coordinates. In cylindrical coordinates, this x0, x1 is minus x2, etc. X2, etc. I can write it as T with phi equals I rho. And there is a phi here, which I it has become a double probably because I was using wrong phones. No, no, no, because no, no, I forgot. I forgot to put five. So there is a five here, T5 equals to five. T phi equals to phi and the rest is zero. Now, of course, I put the inverted comma because phi is a horrible object. It's not a single valid function. So in reality, I should write something like, is there some joke? The correct way would be to write. I need a corner. I need a very small corner. I need a very small corner here. Psi e to the i phi equals rho e to the i phi. This is a well-defined, but this is just to have you understand what I mean. And then the twist is very simple because I can write. Because I can write the twist as generators of the time translations, time rotations in the one, two, or d over dt times d phi, where this is the anti-symmetric, the anti-symmetrization of the tensor product. So this defines a good start product, and we did some work on this. We found field theory, and we calculated some. And we calculate some decay rates or something. I have not time to discuss the work with Maria Dmitrievich and Nikola Konyik. Okay, there is helpful structure. This is to show you that I don't do also ideology. Actually, this was calculated by the Serbian before our paper. But so you have structures that have complete. The complete co-product. But that's the interesting bit. I can produce a bicross product for this. And I will skip the construction. And this is completely similar to the Kappa-Minkowski. And but the important thing is that I have to do a change of coordinates. But if I do the change of coordinates, I have a Of coordinates, I have a by cross product structure, and this by cross product is the same as the one in the page before with a change of coordinates. So, this is an example in which I have, this is both a deformation of the symmetry and the deformation of space-time on the same equal footing. And there is no need to enlarge the symmetry or to do something strange. So, it's an interesting. It's an interesting object. So I can reproduce everything, the structures, the commuter among coordinates, and things. Yes. Because with during the piece, we always have a sort of problem understanding the synergy part. So are you saying it's possible? Maybe just file? Yes, this is the hope. So this is an example in which cream felt twist and micros product come together. Okay, so it is an example. And we were looking, but we are not finished. These papers are fairly recent to understand. To understand why it works this way, because the two of them work perfectly well on their own. Now they converge in this space. I should say that you can write Drinfel twists also for just for everything, but they are not made with the generators of the Poincaré group in such a clean way. So that's why I'm pulling, I'm advertising this. I'm advertising this sort of space because it has some theoretical interest. I will go to the physics in more physical things in a get all the way to physics, it probably is too much, but to more physical things in a little while. And there are various products, but Products, but this construction suggests a way to put together the star product. Now, in general, for Kapaminkovsky, the star product is generated by the combination of plane waves in Fourier mode. It's much simpler. So, what happens is that when you combine exponential with this non-commutativity, you have You have a sum of the momenta of the two plane waves, which is summed in a non-trivial and non-commutative way. So we can and you see that what happens is that the momenta sum, but with a rotation, which is rotated with rho, mediated by rho. So this is, see, a rotation in the one, two plane. So you sum the plane waves. So, you sum the plane waves, but when you sum the two momenta in the one, two plane, you sum and you rotate them, because here you can recognize a rotation matrix cosine minus sine cosine sine. Well, if you put right k1 underneath here, this is clearly, and so everything is compatible with. So now let me go to the really the second part of the, so I say quantum all the way. The first was space-time symmetries, and then I want to go to the observer and I will discuss Kapaminkowski in this example. Now, quantum symmetries are important, but why do we need symmetries, really? We need symmetries because we need to transform things, transform reference frames or observers. Calls reference frames or observer. Now, in what I will say, for me, reference frame and observer are the same thing. So, because an observer is somebody that has set some coordinates and something. For people that do foundations of quantum mechanics, they are not exactly the same thing, but at the level on which I'm discussing, for me, an observer is some body. Some body, Alice and Bob, that has decided that this is X, this is Y, and this is Z, and this is time, meaning that I'm in a reference frame. So I will use the two terms in an interchangeable way. I'm not at the level of sophistication. So I will study these spaces and I look at the observers, but first, let me Let me do a well-known case study, which is quantum mechanics. So it's like Moyal. So remember, well, several of us teach this. Phase space in ordinary quantum mechanics is six, or can be any number, dimensional space spanned by Qi and Pi. And I have this non-trivial commutation. Have this non-trivial commutation relation. Now, what do I do? I represent this as an operator on an Hilbert space, which is L2 of position. So I have six operators, which I represent as functions of three variables. Why three? Because a complete set of communicative observables is given by three quant three quantities. So Q is the multiplication operator and P is the derivative operator. P is the derivative operator. Now, Q and P are unbounded self-adjoint operators. They have a dense domain. And the spectrum is the real line for each of the eye. There are no eigenvectors. There are improper eigenfunctions, distributions. We know how to deal with this. We have learned it in quantum mechanics classes. So, since the Q's commute themselves, it's possible to have a simultaneous. Cells is possible to have a simultaneous improper eigenfunctions of the tree, and they are the delta functions for a particular vector. So they have an eigenvector for each position. And instead, for the three piece, the eigenfunctions are the plane waves. I have this is the eigen function, the eigenvalue. The eigenvalue equation of momentum, an ih bar is not relevant, this is just a constant. And this would be solved by an arbitrary exponential. But remember that I have to have a tempered distribution, and therefore the eigenfunctions are not any exponential, but imaginary exponential. Now, imaginary exponential. An imaginary exponential is something which an exponential with an imaginary exponent, pure imaginary, is not a vector of L2, but just about. In fact, it's a distribution. If I have a real part, if it's a positive one, then it will diverge badly at plus infinity, or if it's negative, it will diverge badly at minus infinity. But if it Infinity, but if it's zero, the real part, the function is just in the boundary between the two. Keep this in mind, it's well known, but you will see what happens now for Kapaminkovsky. So this is the situation. And now the eigenfunctions of momentum are infinite plane waves, and they are not very. And they are not vectors, but we know how to deal with it. We make wave packets, and let me go through this. You can do it with the level of sophistication that you prefer. What I want to stress is that I decided that Q was a complete set of observables. So I have a wave function which is whose square normalized square is the probability to find the. The probability to find the particle at some position, and that we know that psi is a complex function, and so it contains the information for the momentum as well in the phase. And I know that I could have chosen P as a complete set, and then everything is very similar. And I go back and forth between the two with a Fourier transform, and it's important. And it's important. Fourier transform is an isometry. You have to put the two pi's in the proper way, symmetric one over two pi, but then it's an isometry. So it maps normalized functions of position into normalized functions of momentum. And I could have chosen other complete sets like number operators, angular momentum, and the third component of angular momentum, and everything. Now, I want to do this for capital. I want to do this for Kappa-Minkowski. So, Kappa-Minkowski is generated by four operators. They have to be operators because they commute, like x0, x1, x2, and x3. So I will leave h-bar alone. So, my quantum space-time is quantized, but I don't quantize momentum. So, I'm only considering. Momentum. So I'm only considering space-time. I have to say this because I will use time operator, and we know that in quantum mechanics, time operator has lots of problems because Pauli noticed long ago. So I want to look for a representation of this X mu on L2 of R3. Why is it L2 of R3? Because a complete set of observables of commuting operators are X1, X2, and X3. Are x1, x2, and x3. Well, I could choose other ones, but this is the natural one. So I have four operators, but I have to represent them of L2 of R3. The other case, I had six, but the three is the total number of commuting operators. So obviously, if they are the commuting part, I say that xi are multiplicative operators and the x0. Operators and the x0 operator is really a dilation. These three alphs is here to make it symmetric, but this is the time acting on this is a dilation operator, which I can write as r dr acting of psi of x. So I can go into polar coordinates. And I said the three halves is because x and d over dx don't commute. X and D over dx don't commute. So if I want them to be, if I want over it to be at least symmetric, then I like to look for self-adjointness. But if it's not symmetric, I don't go anywhere. But three halves will disappear in the commutator. So since I have dilations, the polar basis is the right one, and here I write the commutation relation of Kappa-Ninkowski in this way. So here I don't write theta m phi, I've written I don't write three times five, I wrote basis. So the angular part commutes with x0. And the commutator is really x0 times r equals il times r. So I have reduced the problem to one dimension because the non-commutativity is only one dimension. However, I have to be careful because r means that whenever I integrate, the measure is not the r. R is only positive, but the measure is r squared dr. So if I look for Squared the R. So if I look for self-adjointness, the origin, I have to remember this R squared, obviously, is very important. I have an Eisenbergian determination, which I can write in this way. Delta x is 0, delta r equals l, it must be larger than equal to l over 2 times the average value of r. Now there is something which is strange. The farther I am from the origin, the more. Origin, the more I have an uncertainty. So this is strange. We'll see that that's not a problem. That's actually the feature of Kappa-Ninkowski. Okay. So what is the spectrum of this time operator? Well, I look at it and this is dilation and the spectrum are monomials, but then I want these to be distributions. Distributions and they have to be monomials with an exponent which is uh there is an I missing here. Well, here it's written better. The monomials which have to have a real part which is three halves. This is because I'm in four dimensions. And then something which is i tau. So those are the equivalent of the plane waves. Plane waves, so the eigenfunctions improper. And if you remember that there is an R squared in the measure, those are the monomials which with the R squared, what is left is one upon R. Okay? And this is the monomial which is the border between badly diverging at the origin or badly diverging at infinity. Or badly diverging at infinity. Okay? So integral of one upon r in dr, that is r squared, which r to the minus three alpha, is like the plane wave. In fact, the distribution has the correct dimensions, everything works. And here I have to put a scale to make it to have the wave function, to have the correct dimension. To have the direct dimension, and I have a natural scale. In principle, it could be another one, but the natural scale that I have is the non-conductivity one. So, what happens now is that what was in our beloved quantum mechanics, a Fourier transform, has now become a Mellin transform. Melling transform with a slightly different measure. measure and so I can have a function of r theta and phi and this will be the Melly transform of a function psi tilde of tau theta m phi tau is the eigenvalue of the x zeros of time and I can go back and forth and they are with this proper normalization they are isometries namely this is normalized with the Normalized with the measure r squared dr, of course. And so if this is a normalized function, this one is a normalized as well, but with the measure dt, from minus infinity to infinity. You see that the limits of integration are different. So those two are the probability to find the particle in position r or time. In position r or time t, tau, respectively. They don't commute. Therefore, I cannot localize exactly one. I have an indetermination. So if I know where something is, I don't know when something happened. Okay, before we worry too much, the idea of the dimensional quantity. Of the dimensional quantity, so let me be a physicist. If I call t diagonal of the time operator, which is x0 divided by c, so tau is t c divided by l, which is lambda. c over l is a dimensional quantity. c, we know it the speed of light. L, if I put the Planck length, this is the dimension is the inverse of a time, so it's two times ten to the forty-three. times 10 to the 43 hertz. So if t equals one, tau is two to the 43, which is an extremely large number. If t is a time of the Planck time, so tau is near to one. So this is the first time in this conference probably that numbers of physics have appeared now. Now, as I say, this is different from the usual Eisenberg one, so because it grows with distance. So, is it this a problem? No, it's the same. This is the equivalent of something that I was doing when I was doing quantum mechanics class, the Eisenberg Christian for a grain of dust. I don't know if you do it, that you don't have to really worry about, and even in this case, because the most precise click. The most precise click is 10 to the minus 19 seconds, Wikipedia. I looked at it. And the most precise distance is the add-on collider, which is 10 to the minus 18 meter. So if delta x0, delta r is 10 to the minus 19, again, if l is the order of Planck length, average r is a thousand kilometers. So it means that I would have. That I would have a problem if I localize something at the scale of LHC, at the scale of the best time measurement, which is at a thousand kilometers. So I don't really have to worry about for macroscopic objects. Okay, now I will an important thing is I'm aware I have 15 minutes. When did I start? When did I start at the sharp at three? No, we started at three or then. Oh, three or five. Anyways, I will finish on time. So let me give you some examples of localized states. Now, because of the integrals are different integrals, the easy way to do the integral is not with Gaussians, but with this. So I localize in a pillbox. In a pillbox, which is a conical section with an angle which depends on a length A, and lambda is what I called L, the Kapaminkovsky constant, and it's at 8A. So if I take A to zero, this becomes localized into a point. And the Melling transform of this function is something of this kind. Is something of this kind. There is an expression in terms of some special functions, but it's not particularly illuminating. The Taylor expansion is this one. And when A, this goes to a constant when A equals zero. So the integral of my function is like the Gaussian becomes large. So if I localize in a space, my function becomes the identity, my function in time. My function in time. So, localizing in space implies localizing on time, and I can also see the expansions of this. So, this is sharp localization. Now, let me go a little bit fast in this. Okay, I can also localize in a log Gaussian, but this is, let me skip this. Let me, well, no, let me not skip this. There is one thing: I can localize a state if it's near the origin, because the uncertainty has to do with the R. So if I am near the origin, then I can localize this very much. This very much. And I will, I can call, I can have this function, and I call this state O for origin tau. So near the origin, actually at any time, I can localize a state. I can localize in space and time as long as it's near the origin. Now, again, looks like I have a. That's exactly the content of this slide. Okay, so I'm saying that the origin is a special point. This means that somewhere in the universe there is the origin and the Kappa God is sitting in the origin. Not any place can be an origin. Any place is a... There is only one origin for one observer. There is the observer implicit in this case. Observer implicit in this game. So any point can be an origin for some observer. So if I'm an observer, I have a localized space near me. Now, what happens if the observer is far away from me? Then he will have his own origin. And this state localized at the origin will not be localizable for me. But in order to compare me with the other observer, I have Meet the other observer, I have to make a transformation. And this transformation is not part of the Poincare group, but it's part of the Kappa Poincare group. So this is the essence. This was something that had been bothering me for a long time. When you write Kappa Minkowski, there is an origin. Because you write x0, xi, that is not translationally invariant. Now, the solution of this is that implicitly, Is that implicitly I'm talking of an origin. So, what happens to, so a different observer will be general transformed, translated, rotated, and boosted. These operations have to be made with an element of the kappa Poincare group, not the Poincare group. And let me just spoil because there isn't much time. There is a There is a metaphor or something very simple. Now, everybody that is watching me knows where I am with some uncertainty. Well, some of them know that I'm in Mexico. Those that know more about the conference know that I am in Oaxacao, but they don't really know where I am. They know roughly where I am. They know that I'm somewhere, and they know that also this. Also, this pointer is somewhere, so they cannot localize this pointer very well because they know that they are in Oasaja, but they don't know exactly where it is. But they know that it's near me. They know that I know where it is. Now, classically, of course, I send them the GPS and they know with the total, but it's the same thing. So the state is not well. Is not well localized, but also the observer for me is not well localized. But there is no problem for me in realizing that the translated observer can localize the space very well. So it's exactly the same thing in formulae. But what I'm going to say quickly, because then I wanted to say something about raw, is exactly this. So you localize by So you localize, but you localize things which are near you, and you don't localize the other observers. They are fuzzy. They are... And why is that? Because the translations are not commuting among themselves. And they actually reproduce the Kapaminkovsky translation. And if I put rotations. And if I put rotations in the game, things become also more complicated. So, translation, rotations, everything. And, but this is the important bit. So, even delta A0 is delta, I have a delta A zero, delta R, delta A R, delta A I, which have uncertainty. Uncertainty. So, what should I do? Then, well, what should I do? I should enlarge the set of operators and the set of states. So, I should consider the observer, and this is really the message of this talk. I may finish here and skip Rominkowski because I want to leave some room for discussion. The observers have to be quantum objects in this game, so they are. So they are described by non-commuting operators. Now, this is philosophically an important thing because we are used to have the observer, which is a classical object. But here, the observer cannot be a classical object. It's true, the number are such that I would have to have a click, but conceptually, the observer is something that has to have its own ill versus. That has to have its own Hilbert space, its own non-commuting operators. And I can represent on this enlarged space Kappa Poincaré transformation faithfully as an object which involves also rotation. So even if the object is rotated, I don't really know how it is rotated and these things. The observer has to be a quantum object. Object and yes. Are you talking about class observers, or are you distinguishing between classical and quantum observers? For me, observers are quantum. Now quantum in the sense that they are described by a quantum state with an algebra which is not commuting. Or a quantum reference. Now, I have a slide later. I don't know if I get. The issue of quantum reference frames is. Quantum reference frames is becoming fairly. I will comment on it a little bit later and then we can discuss. So the space is also non-commutative. It's described by these things, by this non-commuting, by an Hilbert space. So I have the states, just as I do quantum mechanics, because they don't commute. If the parameters that If the parameters that make a transformation don't commute, the object is quantum, cannot be classical. And so I have to have states, etc. Fortunately, and it's not completely trivial, has to do with the co-unit. Two observers sitting in the same place will agree. So there is no schizophrenia. I cannot have two different things. So if two. Have two different things. So, if two observers are, even if they are rotated with respect to each other, they will agree that they are in the same place. Okay, so I have to make some changes. I will basically finish. Let me see. There was a slide. Ah, by the way, this is compatible, although the frame. Although the framework is different with the relative locality, relative locality is something which has to do with the curvature of space, of momentum space, but even in relative locality, they didn't express this as I did being spectral as operators. And to be honest, there are some issues in that paper that papers which I don't completely control. Why in what I wrote, Control why in what I wrote, not in what I said, but in our paper, every operator is self-adjoint and everything is done more in the spectral way. And okay, well, I want to say, okay, I will not discuss Rominkowski. Something similar happens in Rominkowski. I want to just make I want to just make this comment in answer to what he was saying. Quantum observers are now appearing as called quantum reference frames for the people that do quantum information. In particular, Bruckner, Jacomini, Castro Ruiz, so on. And they are using a different aspect of quantum mechanics, which is entanglement, which I could do, I can do because I. I could do, I can do because I have operators, so I can entangle two observers and do all these things. They start from this, and I have absolutely no time of discussing their work, but they find something interesting. By taking this quantum, they call quantum reference frames. By taking these quantum reference frames, they find a quantization of space-time. So they start from the other end, start from quantum. And start from quantum reference frames, and they start from the other end of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has two characteristics: one is the scale H-bar, and one is entanglement. If I were to say philosophically what are the important aspects, they are the two important aspects of quantum mechanics. There are others, of course, but to me, they are the important ones. So they start from entanglement and they find that space-time cannot be described in the usual way. Be described in the usual way. So that's an interesting convergence of arriving from the completely different point of view and asking completely different questions. Okay, I skipped the Rominkowski. Romykovsky, similar things happen. There, the uncertainty is between angles and time. And you have a funny thing which happens that time becomes discrete because time is the generator. Because time is the generator of rotations, and we know that time is discrete. And then Steve may say, but surely there isn't an origin of time, a discretized origin of time. But then there, the important bit is that the self-adjointness domain of the time operator is like an Aronov-Baum effect. So every observer. So, every observer has his own discrete, but because he has chosen his domain of several jointness, a different observer will have a different domain, self-adjointness. So, he will have his own starting, his own lattice, but there is nothing special in, it's just a choice of self-adjointness. But this one, I have no time to discuss, and more or less I finished on time. Okay. The second professional time was the first involvement. Now we have time for I was prepared to do some culling along the way. So that we can use the time for the copy paste for the discussion. Okay, this might be related to Alejandro's question, but also here to make maybe more contact with what quantum information people are doing. I think you would need at least two observers, so you would need two sets of four coordinates each, and then find a different. And then find a deformation which has in which one coordinate of the first observer is not commuting with the coordinate of the second observer. And that would correspond to maybe at least correlations, maybe entanglement between the two. One thing I would like to do, and to probably if somebody does it, just quote me, is something like Bell's theorem. When you go to three observers, then things become spherotechnic. And yes, I agree. So you. I agree. So you need for the moment I'm having Alice and two observers, but I need two more. So I need an observer and two more observers, and they don't compute with each other. So that's an analysis which I haven't done. But the Giacomini crowd as the, I say Giacomini because I know Flaminia better than the other ones. The important things start with three observers. Things start with three observers, so which are at the same time states and observer. But yes, it's something which is in the to-do list. More questions? So, my question may not make sense at all, but I will have to talk. We are theoretical physicists. It was a very interesting talk. So, okay, so now you have. So, okay, so now you have an algebra where x and p is standard xp computer is equal to ih cross, and then also the xx is kappa deform. Can one take the xp part to be zero? So you are in classical mechanics. That's what I do. I basically h-bar in this sometimes it's called a cubo cube. Okay. Oh no, it's a couple. No, no, it's not a cubo. No, no, it's not a cubo, it's uh occupan cube, okay, uh, in which you have uh gravitational constant. So I am in an unphysical corner where h-bar is zero, okay. But in this extreme case, I have a paper called double quantization. With this, when the non-commutativity is with the z part, then we have a paper in which we Then we have a paper in which we managed to do a double quantization. So we have a trimfel twist which quantizes both as H bar and the non-commutative of space-time. And things happen. It's not completely, I shouldn't say, but it's not completely clean. It's a bit contrived, but there is a twist which has H-bar and something at the same time. H-bar and something at the same time. And actually, it's a published paper. We also discovered a couple of mistakes in one equation. So if you look at it, look at the errata as well. They're not completely, they don't change completely the paper, but it's my first errata. So I feel I should say there was an equation in which we have made a small mistake. So you call it quantum, even though H-Borr is. Yes, yes. For me, quantum is. Yes, for me, quantum is not a universally accepted nomenclature, but for me, quantum is whenever it's non-classical and whenever I do. So it's quantum, but there is no H-bar. So anybody, has anybody looked at the like the analog of general relativity-based construct of the local version of this Poincare? Something is there, but curving things I do remember, but I'm not too somebody. That would be the natural thing to do, isn't it? I mean, you start with Poincaré, you associate classical quantum gravity, in a sense, by calling quantum quantum gravity when I have that I have seen things doing. I have seen things doing in basically what problem is that instead of having Minkowski here, you will have something curved. And something in Kappa Minkowski curved, I vaguely remember somebody doing it, but I don't remember. Thanks. More questions? I have a question. Do you have a time operator, but the problem is a time operator in quantum mechanics? Operator in quantum mechanics for the positivity of Hamiltonian. That's the connected to what you will say. I don't have H-bar. I said it. Okay, so I have a time operator, but it's an operator in a space in which there isn't an Hamiltonian. So I can talk. I'm well aware. I already said because I have seen people ignoring this detail and using time operators. So I can use a time operator because. So I can use a time operator because I don't have h bar. So I don't have the fact that t commuted with the Hamiltonian is h bar. That's what be, but I don't have h bar. So t commutes with Hamiltonian. If I put an Hamiltonian here, it would be a classical one. And so that's why I can use a time operator. In the other double quantization, time is central with community. Is central, commutes with the coordinates. And therefore, I don't need a time operator. Time is a multiplicative quantity which is dual to them. So it's not an operator. But you have the momentum. You can take a free Hamiltonian with your momentum squared. Yes, but since I don't have H bar, the problem of the see the problem is that time commuting with H with Hamiltonian is I times. With Hamiltonian is i times h bar. Then, since the time as a spectrum which goes from minus infinity to infinity from Neumann, would tell me that the Hamiltonian as a spectrum would go from minus infinity to infinity. And this cannot be because I would have a terrible analog. But since I don't have H bar, I don't have this problem. I know I'm cheating. I know this is not the last. So one would have to do something more complicated and. More complicated than putting h-bar and the curvature of space-time inside. So, but everything is here, it's consistent. More questions from soon? So, we thank Tedel again. Thanks for the nice talk.
