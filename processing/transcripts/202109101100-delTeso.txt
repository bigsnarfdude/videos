Adrid. And yeah, he will talk about the real theorem and linear operators satisfying the maximum principle. Thank you very much, Felix. Okay, so thank you, Bruno, for the introduction. And thank the organizers for such a nice invitation and also for the conference. So the topic I will talk about today started while we were discussing with We were discussing with Nataiel Adibo, which is one of the collaborators of the project, on a theoretical and numerical project regarding a class of non-local porous medium type equations. And he made by that time a question that seemed a little naive, but it turned out to be more interesting than expected and even forced us to dig in some branches of mathematics where we are not so experts. Not so experts. And like, for example, number theory or group theory. So this was a fun work. So I will talk about the Lyubille theorem, the classical Lyubille theorem, but in a context close to the non-local world. Okay, so let me first recall what the classical Yubil theorem is. Even everyone knows very well. It states that the harmonic function that is bounded, then That is bounded, then it has to be constant. Okay, and of course, this theorem is very famous and it has been studied in many different contexts. And you can relax some of the assumptions, but this is the assumption that we will have for our talk. So, okay. Let me just recall a very easy proof of this theorem and classical and short of proof. And classical and short of proof. I will not show all the details, but let me show this proof based on the propagation of maximums. Okay, so if you have a harmonic function in Rd, then you know that it satisfies the classical mean value property. Okay, and okay, yes, for simplicity, assume that your solution reaches a global maximum at some point in the space, so the supremum is not reached at infinity. Okay, so you have that the function at some point is equal to the supremum. Point is equal to the supremum of the value of the function in the whole space. And then, if you use directly the mean value property here, you have this equation here downstairs. And of course, you have that the value of the function at some point coincides with the value or the average of values of the functions in a neighborhood. And of course, since this point is a maximum, then it means that all this point has also to be a maximum. All these points has also to be a maximum, right? So somehow you can think that you have started with a maximum point and you have propagated to the whole ball, to the whole support of this measure here, or this integral here. But now if you repeat this argument in every new maximum point, then you essentially propagate the support again to balls. And if you keep doing this, then of course you propagate the maximum to the whole RN. And essentially, you show that your function. Essentially, you show that your function is constant, or your function has the value of the maximum point at every point in space. Okay, so you have shown that the solution is constant, right? So how far can we exploit this propagation of maximum points, this argument? Okay, so let me just show what are the key points or the key steps on this proof. Okay, so we are essentially considering this operator. Essentially, considering this operator, right? This operator that is comparing the value of the function at a point with the value of the function at some neighboring points and the neighboring points in the ball. And we are essentially using only two properties of this operator. The first one is that at the global maximum point, the operator applied to the function has a sign. And the second one is that we have the same operator everywhere in space. Operator everywhere in space, so the operator is not depending on x itself. So, just to give two names to these properties, the first one we will call it the maximum principle, or it's classically called the maximum principle. And the second one, okay, in the local cases is typically called, or you say that the operator is it has constant coefficients. Let me call it here the operator to be translationally invariant. Okay, so. Okay, so essentially we only need these two properties and we wonder what are the class of operators or what kind of operators satisfy these properties. Okay, and then there is a classical result by Courage in the 64 that states the following, that a linear operator with these two properties has a precise form, it has a precise characterization, and the operator has a non-local part and a local part. The local part is essentially Part. The local part is essentially, I will tell you a little bit better later what is this operator, but it's essentially a second-order diffusion operator in certain directions of the space. And it also has a drift term of this form. And the non-local part is essentially the same. You have non-local diffusion. You can think of this as the fractional Laplacian if you choose the correct measure. And it also has a non-local drift term. Okay, so. So, what do you need? You need a special assumption on the mu, but this technical assumption is only needed to make this integral to have point-wise sense. The ultimate goal of my talk is to show the Leewille theorem for this full class of operators, but I will first start just with the non-local symmetric part, which is the Symmetric part, which is the key of the story, which essentially encodes all the difficulties that we will face. Okay, so we will work in the QRX class, but assuming additionally that the operator is self-adjoint and it's non-local. Okay, so we will work in this class of operators and think of the Lybill theorem within this class. Of course, this class is very well known for almost everyone, but let me just recall a couple of examples that are included. A couple of examples that are included here. So, for example, the classical fractional Laplacian is here, you just have to choose the right measure. Also, the generic versions of non-local operators. So, for example, you can have powers of second-order derivatives in certain directions of space, which might not, I mean, if you have d greater than two, this might be a degenerate operator in the x2 direction. And also some other operators in the literature. Also, some other operators in the literature that are like these convolution operators, but mostly on very important, the operators that made a lot of troubles to us, it was that this class includes discrete operators. Okay, so for example, if you choose as your measures some D-duct delta supported somewhere in the space, for example, h minus h, and you divide by the correct weight, this operator becomes a discretization of the Laplace. A discretization of the Laplacian. And this is very problematic. And of course, once you have realized about this, you can think of any finite difference operator that has positive weights, it's included in the class. Okay, and also mean value properties, as we have shown before. Okay, so how does it look or what we would like to prove? Okay, and this was the original question that Nathael asked. That Nathael asked to us, right? So, if you are in this general class of operator that was important to us for some numerical reasons, he wondered or he asked us if the following statement was true, right? Given this radon measure with this technical condition, do you have the Liou-Ville property? Do you have that harmonic functions with respect to this measure that are bounded? Then they are constant. Okay. Okay, and before going to or trying to give an answer, let me just go to the local case to put some context. So, recall that in the local case, the kind of operators that were considered are these second-order diffusion operators in certain directions of the space. So, the operator precisely says, okay, these sigma are some matrices that encodes in the columns directions in a space where you have diffusion. In a space where you have diffusion, okay, so it's precisely this operator, the statement in this local case will say, okay, harmonic operators bounded are constant with respect to this operator. And the answer is trivially no, right? If you are, for example, in R2 and you consider a degenerate operator, like this second-order derivative in one of the directions of the space, of course, you can take any non-constant function in the y-direction and And it will satisfy the equation for sure. You derivate it two times this function in x, and this is zero, but then it will not be constant in every direction of the space. So, of course, the will doesn't hold in general in this class. At least, okay, at least good news. If you are in 1D, it's trivial. No, the only operator that you really have, the only second-order diffusion operator you have is the second-order derivative, and the only bounded. Derivative, and the only bounded solution of this equation is a constant. Okay, and this is basic ODE. So, how does it look? The general U-Bill theorem from local operators. This is classical. If you have, I mean, the following two statements are equivalent. You have the Lubil property with respect to this class of operators, if and only if the directions where you have diffusion, they generate the whole R D. So the span of these directions is the whole R D. Of these directions is the whole RD, which essentially means you need to have someone working in every direction of space. Otherwise, you can find these kinds of counter examples. Right? So back to the non-local world. The question was, okay, what happens in this non-local class? Well, contrary to the local case, even in dimension one, the statement is false. Well, right? In dimension one, in the local case, it was true. Here it's false. Here it's false, and it's uh, and the diva here is the discrete operators. So, if you consider this discrete operator that is included in our class, it is very easy to find a counter-example to Louville. You just need to take any one periodic function. Okay, so any one periodic function will have this term to be zero, for example, the cosine of two pi x. It will be bounded and okay, it will be harmonic. So, this is a non-constant function that is. Non-constant function that is harmonic and bounded. So, okay, so the first answer is no, the statement is not true. Okay, so then the next question, the next natural question is, okay, if the whole class doesn't have the Lubille property, can you characterize at least for which measures you will have it? And even more, can you say something interesting when this new wheel property does not hold? Can you say something about the solutions? Okay. About the solutions. Okay, so this is where we start. Okay, so let me first talk about the 1D characterization. How do you do this? So as I said in our example, in the previous example, if you take a measure that has just one point in the support, and I say one, because, okay, they are two, right? Because you have a symmetric measure, but there is only one important playing a role. The other one is deduced immediately. So if you have one of these operators. Have one of these operators, then, for example, in general, you have this counterexample, right? You have any a periodic function will be a counterexample to Lubil. What if you have two points in the support? Let's keep playing. Well, if you choose two random or two points not very well chosen, you might lie in these kinds of operators, right? Where the support of your measure is in one and two, and then the operator becomes. And then the operator becomes this finite difference operator, and again, the cosine of 2πx is a counterexample. But this is a very special situation because the cosine of 2πx is both one periodic, so it cancels this term, and two periodic, so it will cancel this second term. So what about in general? No? What if you have two general points, A and B, in your support? What is it happening? Okay, what happens is that you play the same game. Is that you play the same game I played at the beginning of propagating maximum. So you have a harmonic, you have a solution of the harmonic equation with respect to this operator. You start with a maximum point, let's say zero, and you propagate maximums, right? So at the first time, you propagate the maximums to A and to B. And then you keep propagating and you propagate to plus to A, plus minus to A, plus minus to B, and the combinations of them. And if you And the combinations of them, and if you keep playing this game, essentially you have propagated the maximum to this set, to the set A set plus B set. Okay, so then the question is pretty natural afterwards. So is this set dense in R? Because if the set is dense, then of course the solution or the harmonic function must be constant. Okay, so when when do you have that the closure of this set is the whole R? Closure of this set is the whole R. Right? And then, okay, the first time we were a little naive and we tried to prove, or we proved ourselves, but then we realized that this was a very classical result in number theory. This is based on the Besut identity and tells you that this set is dense if and only if the quotient between A and B is an irrational number. Okay, so then we have the first attempt to value Bill resolve for a simplified class of problems. For a simplified class of problems, so if you have one of these discrete operators, the Liouville theorem holds, right? You have the Liouville property if and only if the two points of the support has an irrational rating. And this is a full characterization in this class. So how does it look in general? Well, the story is not much more complicated once you have understood this. Okay, so if you have a general operator with a general measure, the Liouville theorem will hold. Either, I mean, Either, I mean, if the following, if this property that I will show holds, right? And the property says, okay, you either have two points in the support that has irrational ratio. If you find two points in the support with an irrational ratio, the Liu property will hold. Or if you have a sequence of points, so if you have a sequence of point BN and a point A, such that the ratios, okay, they might all be irrational, but they become irrational asymptotic. They become irrational asymptotically. Okay? And then this gives us the first complete characterization in 1D in this class that tells you that the Liuville property holds if and only if mu have this property, the measure generating the operator have this property, okay, has this property. And this is super easy to check. Once you have a measure, it's very easy to find if you have this property. You have this property. Okay, the first one is trivial, and the second one, okay, it might seem not so nice, but in the paper, we give you or we give an algorithmical way to check this property. Okay, so once you have the 1D characterization done, how does it work in multi-D? Okay, so I can play precisely the same game, right? So imagine you have a harmonic function with respect to this measure, and the measure has two. This measure, and the measure has two points in the support, like I'm showing here: A and B. You have a maximum point, and then at the first step of propagation of maximum, you propagate the maximum to A and B, and then you keep going and you keep going and you keep going, and you end up in the same place, right? The maximum point is propagated to this, now to D set. It's a set in two dimensions, right? But it is very easy to observe that the set where the maximum is propagated, it's Maximum is propagated, it's contained in a sequence of parallel hyperplanes, right? You take this hyperplane and you give some parallel hyperplanes there, and then this set is propagated or the set where the maximum is propagated is contained in this larger set. And once you have found this, it's pretty easy to find a counterexample, right? You just need to have a cosine function in this direction, right? And constant in this order. Constant in this other direction. So again, it seems that two points is not enough. One point was not enough in 1D, two points are not enough in 2D. Okay, what about three points? And then you play the same game and you propagate the maximum to this set A, Z, B, Z, C, Z. And the question is whether this is dense. And we started wondering about our irrationality condition that we have in 2D, but in 2D, that we have in 1D. In 2D, that we had in 1D, but in 2D, the concept of irrational ratio is not so clear. And we were a little bit struck until we found this very famous theorem in a very famous theorem in number theory. Okay, just to show the theorem the way it's typically proposed. So imagine that you have in Rd D plus one points, okay, D plus one points, and such that Such that, of course, you need the span of all these points to be Rd, you need to have the diffusion in every direction in space. And up to a change of coordinates, once you have this condition, you can think that your measure is essentially, okay, it has support in coordinate axis plus an extra point that is living somewhere. Okay, so the set where we propagate maximum is this Cz plus Cz. This set here. And the question is whether this set, the question that will solve you will is whether this set is dense or not. And this is a classical theorem, the classical Kronecker approximation theorem that tells you that this set is dense if and only if the coordinates of the extra point, of the C point, are linearly independent over Q. Okay, this is not so easy to check, but okay. So the theorem. Okay, so the theorem says the Leville theorem in this class of operators, in this reduced class, as we did in the 1D case, is precisely characterized by the Kronecker approximation theorem. But what about a general measure? The problem, you remember, in the 1D case, we have this asymptotical assumption or this asymptotical condition that also gives Lyubille property. And it is not so clear what. And it is not so clear what this asymptotically condition, asymptotical condition will mean with respect this linearly independent over Q. It will mean something that you are asymptotically linearly independent or something like this, which is not so nice. So we move to a different point of view after some time, we realize. Okay, so let me think again of the proof. So if you have a maximum point, at the first stage of your propagation of maximum, First stage of your propagation of maximum, you propagate the X0 maximum point to the support of the measure. And then the second stage, to the support plus the support. And essentially, the way the thing you are doing is propagating the maximum in a way that you generate the structure of an additive group, an additive group. Okay, so let me just recall the meaning of a group, and now this is very clear. No, you have that a set is a subgroup of R D if and only if. group of Rd if and only if given two points X and Y the sum remains in the group and minus the minus each point also remains in the group right so essentially okay the proof is a little bit more complicated but not much more essentially what you are telling or what the proof is telling is that the subgroup the the the the maximum point is propagated to the whole group generated by the support. Generated by the support. Okay, so just let me recall: the group generated by a set is simply the smallest group containing the set. And this is precisely what you're doing. You start with a maximum point and you propagate the maximum to the whole group generated by the support. Okay, just let me give you two definitions that will allow me to present the main theorem. And is that a function is periodic in a set. A function is periodic in a set if the translation of the function by any point in the set remains in the same value. Okay, so what we essentially proved with this very naive proof is the following. You will have the Liu property, you will have that harmonic functions or, well, let me first start with a pre-proof or a pre- A pre-proof or a pre-theorem. The following are equivalent. You have a harmonic function, then this is equivalent to say that your solution is periodic in the group generated by the support of the measure. And this is a full characterization. And this is even stronger than you will. We are not saying that the function must be constant. Okay, it might not be constant, the harmonic functions, but you fully characterize that the solution. That the solution must be periodic, and you characterize the precise set where the function is periodic, and it's the group generated by the support. And now Lubil will be a consequence of this theorem if we are lucky, because now we passed from having or having to prove or having to check whether the set A set plus B set is dense to check whether a group generated by a set is dense in RP. Is dense in Rt. Because if the set, if this group is dense, then U must be R T periodic. Okay. And then, of course, we had to dig in the algebra or group theory basic works, and we found out this theorem. And the theorem or the lemma essentially states that there are only two kinds of subgroups in R D, and these are the groups that are either a Are the groups that are either a sequence of parallel hyperplanes, or it's containing a sequence of parallel hyperplanes, or they are essentially the whole Rv. Okay, so there are no more groups than this. And this gives us a very easy characterization of the Liouville property. And the characterization is the following. So the following statements are equivalent. First, the Liouville property. The Levil property. So harmonic bounded functions are constant. Second, the group, which we already have, is dense, the group generated by the support is dense in Rd. And third, which is very easy to check, what you will have to check is that the support of your measure is not contained in a sequence of parallel hyperplanes. And now I go back. Planes and now I go back to my picture because if it's containing a sequence of parallel hyperplanes, okay, then we will find a counterexample that was essentially what I show at the beginning of this 2D characterization. But if you are not contained, if your support is not contained in a sequence of parallel hyperplanes, then you essentially are the whole RD if you close the group. Okay, so this is very easy to check practically. Easy to check practically, right? If you give a measure that has supporting two balls, clearly you will not have a sequence of parallel hyperplanes containing this ball, or if you have a degenerate measure, okay, this is very easy to check that this is containing a sequence of parallel hyperplanes. And also for degenerate measures like this one, it's pretty simple to check that you don't have a sequence of parallel hyperplanes living here, right? So the property or the characterization that we give here is pretty, pretty, pretty simple. And it truly characterizes. Pretty simple. And it fully characterizes the structure of solutions having this property. So I don't know, Bruno, how much time you have left. I can stop here or... Actually, it's over, so you have just to give the conclusions. Okay, thank you, Bruno. So the conclusion is that once you have the property for the non-local part of the operator, the rest is pretty simple. The rest is use the equation and the property that you have. Is use the equation and the property that you just showed and add the let's say the diffusion or the people or the local people working in the rest of the directions of space and essentially okay you have the space where you have all the diffusion the local diffusion which is given by this set and the Lubill property holds if the group generated by the support of the measure and this vector space This vector space generated by the local diffusion part, it's included or is not included in a sequence of parallel hyperplanes. And again, this is super simple to check. Okay, just let me pose two open questions to anyone that wants to work on this. Possible extensions of these that we haven't been able to overcome is what happens with X-dependent operators because the group structure that we have shown is instantaneously broken. Is instantaneously broken, right? Because you don't have the same operator acting in every point of the space. And what happens to non-linear operators of this form? Because essentially our proof will work, but there are some technicalities that we haven't been able to overcome. Like, for example, okay, we cannot work with distributional solutions, so we will have to choose the right framework. It will be viscosity solutions, most likely. But okay, I will be very happy to discuss any of these questions with anyone. And thank you very much. Anyone, and thank you very much.
