Well, tell us about monov homology and the search for exotic forspheres. Thank you very much for the invitation. So I will basically be talking about this famous conjecture, the smooth one correct conjecture in dimension 4, abbreviated SPC4, which says that if a smooth four manifold is homotopy equivalent to S4, then it is this. To S4, then it is diffeomorphic to S4. It was known since the work of Friedman in the 80s that if you have something homotopy equivalent to S4, if you have a closed four manifold homotopy equivalent to S4, then it is homeomorphic to S4. So the conjecture is equivalent to saying that there are no exotic smooth structures on S4. And And opinions are split on whether this should be true or not. We really have no idea. There are people who believe yes and people who believe no, and most people just don't have an opinion. I am not sure myself. Over time, there have been various potential counterexamples that were proposed. So these are manifolds that are homeomorphic to S4. In fact, you just check that they're homotopy equivalent and then follows that they're homeomorphic. And then it follows that they're homeomorphic to S4, but were not known to be diffeomorphic to S4. I will talk later about some such examples. But what happens typically is that many of them are later shown to be, in fact, diffeomorphic to S4 by other people. And then, you know, other people come up with: okay, but you can do this other thing and get some other counterexamples. And other people prove that some of them are standard and so on. But at any given moment, there's usually. But at any given moment, there's usually some supply of potential counterexamples that could work. Yeah. All right. So there are some people trying to prove it using maybe geometric analysis, but what I'll talk about today is this strategy for this proof. By the way, the conjecture is still open, but I'll just talk about what we can say about this strategy. So the strategy is about So the strategy is about, I mean, it's an old strategy. I think it first was suggested in the 80s by various people, including Gumpf, is to find a knot, K in S3, such that K is not slice, so it does not bound a smooth disk in P4, but such that K bounds a smooth disk in a homotopy ball. And then the homotopy ball would not be standard. And from there, you can easily see that if you there you can easily see that if you add a standard before to it you would get a non-trivial homotopy four sphere all right so if you want to implement this strategy you need first of all a good source of examples of homotopy four balls and you need nuts that bound disks in these homotopy four balls so some construction and by the way having a homotopy four ball is the same as having a homotopy four sphere Ball is the same as having a homotopy four-sphere. You just add a standard one, or you delete a standard one from a four-sphere, and you get a homotopy four-ball. And then you also need a knot invariant that obstructs slice-ness, but does not necessarily obstruct bounding disks in homotopy balls. So you want to prove that the knot is not slice, so you need some maybe concordance invariance, but it should. But it shouldn't work for homotopic balls. And well, it's unclear if we have such an invariant, but there's one proposal which was suggested by Friedman, Gomp, Morrison, and Walker in 2009, namely Rasmussen's S-invariant from Hovanophomology. And there are, of course, other topological invariants like signature, the Fox-Milner condition on the Alexander. The Fox-Milner condition on the Alexander polynomial and so on, and also gauge-theoretic invariance or Hagard-Fleur invariance like tau and so on. But it's known that none of them can distinguish between sliceness in B4 or in a homotopy four-ball. So they also vanish when the knot bounces disk in homotopy four-ball. So you cannot use them for this strategy. But for S, we don't know the answer. So there's still some hope. Okay, so here is the outline of the talk. I will start with some review of one ophthalmology, Rasmussen invariant, and its applications to four dimensions. Then I'll talk about some results about this strategy. There's three of them. One of them is that it fails for Glock twists. This is joint work with Marin Gawne, Sharkar, and Willis from 2019. Another result is that the strategy works. Is that the strategy works to detect exotic smooth structures on other four manifolds, so not S4? This is work with Marengon and Piccirillo from 2020. And finally, I'll talk about an attempt with Piccirillo to pursue this strategy by using zero surgery homeomorphisms and try to get some examples. And I'll give some updates on that. All right, so Covanophomology. Well, this is a conference on pategorification, so I assume many of you know the definition. Let me just briefly say. So its construction starts from a planar diagram. You take all the resolutions and you put some vector space for each circle. You take some tensor products and you get a chain complex. The point is, it's algebraically defined. So, unlike gauge theory or Hegel homology, there are computer programs to calculate it. Its Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. And what's important for four dimensions is that it has something to do with cobordisms in at least in the cylinder. So, in S3 times 0, 1, if you have a surface with boundaries K0 and K1, you get. With boundaries k0 and k1, you get the map from the Kovano homology of the first node to that of the second, at least up to sine. And there are ways of fixing the sine, but I'm not going to talk about that. So Li constructed the deformation of one of homology, which gives the spectral sequence to a simpler theory that just depends on the number of components of the link, basically. And when it's a NAT, And when it's a knot, the Lie homology is just q plus q. And if you run the spectral sequence, you end up with the two q's in some degrees, and the average of those two degrees is the Ras-Mussen's invariant S. All right, so now you can use these cobordism maps that I mentioned on the previous slide, but also how they behave on these spectral sequences to leave homologue. On the spectral sequences to Lie homology. And using that, you get the Rasmussen proved that S gives a lower bound for the slice genus. The slice genus of a naught is the minimal genus of a surface, of an orientable surface in B4 whose boundary is the knot. And if K slies, so like this knot here, that bounds a smooth disk in P4, that means that Gs is zero and therefore S is zero. S is zero and therefore S is zero. So S, S non-zero would prevent the knot from being sliced, but we don't know if it prevents the knot from bounding a disk in a homotopy four ball. Okay, so what is ovano homology good for in topology? Well, it's been used to some extent as a replacement for gauge theory or Haggard flower homology. So here are some results. Out fluor homology. So here are some results that were given new proofs with homano homology. The first example was the Milner conjecture, which calculates the slice genus of torus knots. So for torus knots, it tells you that the slice genus is P minus 1 times Q minus 1 over 2. This was proved originally by Kronheimer and Rufka using Yang-Mills theory and Theory, and Rasmussen gave a new proof using his invariant in 2004. Also, from Rasmussen's work, one thing that follows is the existence of topologically sliced knots that are not smoothly sliced. So, knots that bound a disk, a topological disk with a nice color neighborhood, but don't bound a smooth disk. There are such examples, and you compute the S-invariant, and you get that it's non-trivial. And it was known by topologists that this can be used to show the existence of exotic smooth structures on R4. So this was known using gauge theory, and it has a newer proof based on the S invariant. Okay, so this is about R4. R4. A more interesting four-manifold is Cp2, and there's the famous Thumb conjecture, which tells you the minimal genus of a surface in a given homology class in Cp2. So of degree D, that would be D minus one times D minus two over two. This was proved by Kronheimer and Brofka using cyber-aguium theory. And a few years ago, Lambert Cole gave a new proof using. Using ovanophomology and some contact geometry. More recently, also Lambert Cole gave a new proof of the adjunction inequality in symplectic manifolds, which had a number of applications, like the symplectic term conjecture that says that symplectic surfaces have genus minimizing in their homology class in symplectic manifolds. And another consequence of this is the existence of Consequence of this is the existence of exotic smooth structures on some closed four manifolds. I think the example in his paper is K3 plus Cp2 bar. So these were things that were known with cage theory, and it's quite remarkable that they can be reproved using ovano homology, which is just an invariant for knots in R3. And you know something about how it behaves with forcobordisms in the cylinder, but somehow you reduce these four manifolds using trisections to just. Using trisections to just cylinders. And you have to use some contact geometry as well. Okay, these were all old results that were proved before, but Hobano Homology also has some new results. For example, Lisa Picherillo proved that the zero-shaped genus of a knot can be different from its slice genus. The zero-shake genus is, okay, well, it's some invariant that's defined to. It's some invariant that's defined topologically. It's the minimal genus of a surface that represents the generator in the zero surgery on the knot. And there's an inequality between that and the slice genus. And she proved that it doesn't have to be always an equality. And she also proved that Conway's knot is not slice. I will get back to this. So this was some knot that people didn't know it's slice. That people didn't know it's sliced if it's sliced or not, and she proved that it's not again using Havano homology. All right, so we have all these applications. Now, Havano homology has not completely supplanted gauge theory. For example, Donaldson's diagonalizability theorem for four manifolds is something that, for which we only have, well, we have proofs based on Young-Mills or Cyber-Guiden or Haggard-Flohr, but not yet on provincial ophthalmology. Etymology. But really, what we're interested in is: can this theory say something new about four manifolds per se? Like we had some great results, like that there are exotic smooth structures, but those were known before. And then we have results about knots and surfaces that they bound, like in the work of Pikirillo. But ideally, we would like it to say some. But ideally, we would like it to say something new. And as far as I know, there are no definite results in this direction. But that's kind of the motivating question. So what could you possibly do? Well, on the one hand, you could try to use Hobano homology to construct invariants of four manifolds. Maybe similar to Cyber Gwyn or Hagard Flur. And there's one proposal, at least one proposal in this situation. At least one proposal in this direction by Morrison, Walker, and Wedrick. So in 2009, they constructed some invariants of knots in the boundaries of four manifolds. The simplest one is the Skane-Lasagna algebra. With my student Natha Lott, we started computing it for some simple examples like CP2. And that's great. Yeah, it's a little hard to compute in general. So, for example, it might be true, but it's unclear if this. Might be true, but it's unclear if the scale-Lasani algebra can detect exotic smooth structures on four manifolds. All right, so Powell will talk about this in his talk, presumably, about the construction of this invariant. What I'll discuss today is a different direction, which was this FGMW strategy from the beginning. So the hope is to find a knot. Hope is to find a knot that bounds a disk in a homotopy four ball, but is not sliced. And the way we want to show that it's not slice is to have the Rasmussen invariant S be non-zero. Okay, so there's one remark here: is that this fails for tau and things from Haggard-Flohr or gauge theory. And the reason it fails is that, well, Is that, well, Haggard floor homology is functorial with respect to all cobordisms, like surfaces in any four-manifold, not just in cylinders. And furthermore, it really has the same properties for homotopy four-bolts and usual B-fours. You have the same grading shift, you have exactly the same properties, and therefore you cannot tell them apart. Like, if you also show that. Like, if you also show that the respective invariant, the analogs of S in these theories are also zero when they bound disks, when the nuts bound disks in homotopy formals. So, if Uvanov homology is like too close to gauge theory, like if it's like really similar, then I mean, that would be interesting. And maybe it could lead to constructing four-manifold invariants. But then this strategy is not going to work. So, on the other hand, if it's quite different from gauge theory, then maybe this strategy has some. Then maybe this strategy has some way of working. So maybe either way, you have some hope of winning, but we should figure out which one is true. All right, so let me talk about the three results now. Okay, so the first one has to do with the construction of homotopy four spheres. That's well known. It's maybe the That's well known. It's maybe the first thing that people suggest if you ask them for a homotopy force sphere, and that's Glock twists. So, this was invented by Gluck in 1962. If you have a two-naught, so an embedded sphere S2 in S4, you look at a neighborhood of it, which is an S2 times D2. You take it out and then you put it back in, but you'd put it back in. Put it back in, but you'd put it back in with a twist, with a Dane twist. So the gluing homeomorphism should be this self-homeomorphism of S1 times S2. And this gives you a four manifold. You can show that it's homotopy equivalent to S4. And the question if it's diffeomorphic to S4. And you can prove that it is, in fact, a standard S4 for spun two knots and twist spun two knots and value. And twist spontaneous and various other classes, but it's still not known in general if you can get a homotopy force or an exotic smooth structure on S4 by this construction. All right, so can the strategy work to detect Glock twists from S4? The answer is no, so that's a negative result, but it's still good to know what can be true or not, so that we know to focus on different examples. So, this is a theorem. So, this is a theorem that I proved with Marin Gonshark, Karin Willis. It says that if K bounds a disk in a homotopy four ball that's obtained from the standard ball by a Glock twist, then S is zero, and therefore the FGMW strategy cannot work. All right, so let me sketch the proof just in a few slides. So So the proof is based on studying null homologous disks in CP2 minus a ball, or which is the same as CP2 plus a ball. And we show that if it bounds such a thing, then S is greater or equal than zero. I will say in a moment like how we show that. And similarly, if it bounds a non-homologous disk in Cp2 bar, in the one with the opposite orientation minus before, then S is less or equal than C. Then s is less or equal than zero. And then it is known, it's not hard to show, that if Z is obtained from B4 by a Glack twist, you can do some Kirby calculus or some other arguments and you can show that Glag twists become standard when you connect some with either Cp2 or CP2 bar. So C plus CP2 is B4 plus CP2. Plus Cp2. And similarly for CP2 bar. So if you had a knot, as in the hypothesis, bounding a disk in Z, well, you just add a CP2, and it follows that it bounds a no-homologous disk in CP2 minus B4. And you get that S is greater or equal than zero. And symmetrically, you also get S less or equal than zero, and therefore S equals zero. All right, so the key thing is to. All right, so the key thing is to prove something about these surfaces in CP2. And let me state this for CP2 bar. So this is the theorem we use. It's an inequality for the S-invariant when the mat bounds on the homologous disk in here. So the idea is to reduce it to what we know about cylinders. We know that Hovano homology is cofactorial for surfaces in cylinder. So, how do we get to a cylinder? So, how do we get to a cylinder? Well, in CP2 bar, we have a core, we have a sphere, the CP1 bar. And if you had any surface, so the surface is this, I don't know, is drawn here as an arc, and the boundary is the nut. And if it's not homologous, it intersects the core in p positive and p negative points. So you look at what's outside of S2. And outside of S2, you just S2 and outside of S2, you just have a cylinder. You have S3 times 0, 1, because the boundary of a neighborhood of S2 is just S3, and then you have a cylinder. And what you get is a cobordism from the NAT to something standard that just depends on P, and this turns out to be the torus link, TPP, but with P arcs in one way and P arcs in the other way. So the S invariant does depend on the orientation and. Depend on the orientation and it's important to fix it. Okay, so we have this cobordism from K and some torus link, and then we use the cobordism inequalities for the S invariant that were proved by Rasmussen for NOTs. And then here we need the version for links proved by Belyakova and Verling. And we get some inequality between S of the NUT and S of this torus link, plus something about the genus. Something about the genus. I guess what we care about is when we have a disk. So the genus is zero. And okay, the heart of the paper is to compute what S of F P is. This is 1 minus 2p. The calculation involves some Haxchild homology and Rosansky's interpretation of Hovanov homology in S1 times S2. So there's some story there. But in the end, you use this inequality and you get that S is less or equal than zero. Is less or equal than zero. Okay, so that was the sketch of the proof of this. Just some remarks. Let's introduce this definition. If you have a closed four manifold and you take out a ball, you get X circ. And we say that a knot is H slice in X if it bounds a null homologous disk in here. So what we showed is that if K is H slice in Cp2 bar, is H slice in Cp2 bar, then S is less or equal than zero. You can do the same theorem for the mirror of K, and you get, by changing orientation, if it's H slice in Cp2, then S is greater or equal than zero. And then for Glock twists, by using these results, you get that S equals zero. Maybe I should mention, yeah, so this is going to be used late. I'm going to say something about this later, but our argument also works for connection. But our argument also works for connected sums. So we can show that if k is h lies in the connected sum of n CP2s, then we still have s greater or equal than zero. And in NCP2 bars, s less or equal than zero. Okay, so that was the first result I wanted to mention that, you know, for Glock twists, it doesn't work. On the other hand, we have these things of this in a These things of these inequalities about NOTS being H-slice in connected sums of CP2, and I'll come back to this later. All right, now let's move on to the second result. Okay, so on the more positive note, the strategy does work in other four manifolds. So, what we want, yeah, so the next theorem says that the set of H-slice knots can detect exotic smooth structures in some cases. Cases. So, what I showed with Maringon and Piccirillo is that there exist smooth, closed, homeomorphic four manifolds, x and x prime, and a knot that is H sliced in one of them, but not in the other. So, therefore, the set of H slice knots detects that these things are not diffeomorphic, which is what we wanted to do for homotopy four spheres, to detect them from S4. So, we don't know if it works for S4. From S4. So we don't know if it works for S4, but at least it works in this one example. Our example, I'm sure there are more examples, but the one that we gave in the paper was: X is some connect sum of CP2s and CP2 bars, and X prime is K3 blown up once. So the K3 surface plus the CP2 bar. And K is the trephoid, is the right-handed trephoid. Okay. Okay, the proof doesn't use the S-invariant. That's not what we use. We use gauge theory, namely the Seibel-Witten equations. I will say a few words about that. So first of all, let me say that these two manifolds, they're simply connected and they have the same intersection form. So we know that they are homeomorphic by Friedman's theorem. Oh, I should, yeah, I should mention one thing. So it was known that they are not ifeomorphic. So this is not a new result that these are. Not a new result that these are not diffeomorphic, but the point of the theorem is that the fact that they're not diffeomorphic can be detected by which knots are H-slice in them. All right, so to prove the thing about H-sliceness, we need some explicit constructions. So we can find a disk, a non-homologous disk in CP2, with boundary detrephoid. That's you can. Trephoid. That's you can find one explicitly. And since X, X is this connect sum of CP2s and CP2 bars. Well, if you have a disk in CP2, then just add, make a connected sum and you get that, you get a disk with boundary, the trefoil in X minus B4. So it's, so K is H slice in the trefoil. Sorry, the trefoil is H slice in X in the first manifold. And then for the second manifold, okay, one thing that Manifold. Okay, one thing that we need is that disk in K3 that's not null homologous. Its boundary is the left-handed trifold, and the self-intersection of the disk is zero. And then what we do is we want to show that K is not H slice in the second manifold in X prime. Well, if it were, then if you had this H slice, this delta prime. Disk delta prime, a non-homologous disk, then you would add it to the one that you already know it exists, and you would get an embedded sphere in this manifold k3 plus k3 plus ep2 bar. And the sphere would satisfy some properties. It would be not null homologous, but s squared equals zero. And some adjunction inequality from the cyber-Widene equations tells you that this is impossible because this manifold, K3 plus K. in this manifold k3 plus k3 plus cp2 bar is symplectic basically and it yeah and it has some other properties uh but um yeah so we use some inequalities that um come from cybergraduate theory okay all right so i think that's all for this uh second theorem that um okay some analog of the strategy works in other four manifolds all right All right, now for the next okay, so the second half of the talk will be about just this third attempt, a new attempt to pursue this strategy for homotopy four-spheres, and which is based on zero-surgery homeomorphisms. And this is joint work. And this is joint work with Lisa Picarillo. Okay, so first of all, before I talk about that, let's get two definitions going. So these are manifolds that are constructed from NOT. The first one is the trace of the NOT. This is the four manifold that's obtained by attaching a two handle to B4, a longer knot. So the NOT lives in S3, which is the boundary of B4, and you attach a neighborhood of a disk to it, and you get. And you get some four-manifold. It's a four-manifold with a boundary. And the boundary is some standard three-manifold. It's called the zero surgery on a knot. It can also be obtained by taking out a neighborhood of the knot and then adding a solid torus back where the gluing reverses the meridian and the longitude of the boundary torus. So these are two constructions that you can do from a nut. You can get a three-manifold called zero circle. A three-manifold called zero surgery, and the four-manifold called the trace, whose boundary is the zero surgery. Okay, so this gives us a way in principle to construct homotopy four spheres. I mean, this was known before, but I think people just didn't pursue it all the way. So, the idea is: let's say you have two knots that have Have two knots that have the same zero surgery. So, and in fact, you specify a homeomorphism, or if you want a diffeomorphism, because we're in dimension three, between the zero surgeries of the two knots. So, typically, different knots have different zero surgeries, but sometimes it happens that they have the same one. And let's suppose that one of the knots is slice, so it bounces a disk in P4. Then, what you do is you look at Then, what you do is you look at B4 minus the neighborhood of this disk. This has boundary to zero surgery on K. Why does it have the boundary to zero surgery on K? The best thing is to look at this. Let's say we have, let's say the exterior of the ball is, let's look at B4 being the exterior here. If I drill some, if this is a disc, if the knot is slicing B4, then this pink disc exists and the rest of the X. And the rest of the exterior is going to have the same boundary as the trace, namely, it's the zero surgery. So, if you have the exterior of a slice disk, and if you put back the trace, then you get before. But what if you have the exterior of a slice disk and you put back the trace on the different knot? So not on the same knot. They both have boundary, the zero surgery. And you can show that what you get is homotopy. You get is homotopy equivalent to S4. And so, okay, so that gives us an example of homotopy four-spheres. And furthermore, this kind of construction already comes with a knot that bounces a disk in this homotopy four-sphere minus a ball, namely k prime, right? So xk prime is the trace. Here's a picture of the trace. If you take out a ball from the trace, The ball from the trace, then just by construction, the knot bounds a disk. So, in our case, this is K prime. Okay, so K prime bounds the disks, and that's kind of what we wanted for the strategy. We wanted some homotopy forcepheres and knots that bound disks, and we wanted to see if we can show that K prime is not slice. So, if we could find an example such that K prime is not slice, but K is slice. Slice, but K is sliced, so they have the same zero surgery: one is slice, and the other is not sliced. And maybe the way to show that it's not slice is to compute the Rasmussen invariant, then SPC4 would be false. We would find an homotopy, an exotic structure on S4. Now, there's a caveat: we want the nuts to have the same zero surgery, but we don't want them to have the same trace. So, there are So there are also pairs of knots that have the same trace. And if they have the same trace, well, then xk prime is the same as xk. And when you make this homotopy Ford sphere, it's actually standard. You didn't do anything. You just did the construction we had before. But yeah, it's just the complement of the disk, and then you put back the trace and you get the standard S4. So we want the same zero surgery, but not the same trace. Trace in the literature, there's quite a bit about knots with the same traces. They were used, well, basically because of this trace embedding lemma, which is not hard to show. You can say when a knot is sliced in terms of the trace. Not being sliced is equivalent to the trace smoothly embedding in B4. That's not hard to prove. That's not hard to prove. And this was used, for example, by Lisa Piccirillo, who showed that the Conway knot is not slice. So this was some knot. The S invariant for this was zero. So you couldn't, and all the other invariants were zero. You couldn't tell if it's sliced. But she constructed another NAT with the same trace and C prime and S of C prime, she just put it in a computer and she got that it's non-zero. And that implies that C prime is not slice. But since the not slice but since the knots have the same trace and since the sliceness is in terms of yeah is in terms of traces then you get that c is also not is also not slice so that's a new way of proving that some knots are not slice okay so again for our strategy this is no good if the knots have the same trace then this force this homotopy force here that we get is just S4. Get is just S4, and that doesn't help us. We won't get anything exotic. Okay, all right, so what are some constructions of knots with the same zero surgeries? There were already many in the literature. Already in the 70s, licorice had some construction, then dualizable patterns came out. Also, in AC, Also, INAC had a nice construction. Annulus twisting that we started looking at, and then Yasui has another construction. In some cases, although not all, they produce knots with the same traces, which is not what we want. So, we started looking at examples from these constructions, but in the end, we gave a general construction of all zero-surgery homeomorphisms. So, this is in terms of some three-component links that we Some three component links that we called RBG links. So I will explain how this works. So every zero surgery homeomorphism is going to come from an RBG link. An RBG link is a three-component link with some framings, I mean, basically rational numbers associated to each component, R, B, and G, such that Such that you have this homeomorphism. So, S3RG means surgery on this link with these coefficients, with R and G coefficients. So, if you do surgery on red and green, then you should get S3. And if you do surgery on red and blue, you should also get S3. And then you have some homological condition on doing surgery on all three. You should get something with homology Z. I will say in a moment how to construct such links. To construct such links, but let me state the theorem. So, any RBG link has a pair of associated NUTs, Kb and Kg, and that are related by such that the zero surgeries are homeomorphic. And the homeomorphism is induced by the link. And conversely, if you have any homeomorphism between zero surgeries, then there's an RPG link that produces it. That produces it. In fact, there are several RBG links. So this is a many-to-one correspondence. Many RBG links give you the same homeomorphism. The proof is not hard. This is basically just a rephrasing of the existence of the homeomorphism, but it's very helpful to think of it in terms of these links, as you will see. So, all right, so if I have the link, then, okay, what are the knots with the same zero surgery? So, one of them is. Zeto surgery. So one of them is going to be the image of B of the blue under doing surgery on R and G. We said that if you do surgery on R and G, then you get S3. So see what happens to B when you do that. And similarly, see what happens to G when you do surgery on R and B. You get two nuts. And their zero surgeries are the same as doing surgery on R and B and G together. So that's all. That's all. And conversely, well, there are many constructions, but one that you can do is if you have two knots with the same zero surgery, you can take the blue knot to be one of them, K prime. You let, okay, you look at the meridian for K. So a little knot wrapping around K, like an R knot wrapping around K, and you look at Around k, and you look at the image under this homeomorphism phi from the to the zero surgery of k prime. And what the image is, it's going to be, you take that to be the red knot, and then you let the green knot be a zero frame meridian for r. Anyway, there's some explicit construction. We don't have to get into the details, but it's yeah, you can get an RBG link starting from the homeomorphism. Okay, so then you just want to get some good source of RBG links. So, for example, one thing you can do, I'm just going to show the picture. Here's a picture of an RBG link. RD special RBG link. So this is a particular case. So the framings are R can be anything. The one on the red, it's some integer. B and G are zero. And G are zero. And then what you want is B to be the meridian for R. R, by the way, R could be a trefoil or something like that, but in our examples, we just took it to be the unknown. And then B is some little unknown happening with, you know, meridian for red. And then the same for green. So green is also a meridian for red once you ignore blue. So if you ignore blue, then you can get rid of this. Blue, then you can get rid of these parts of the green curve, and you're left with a meridian full green. And then you have some condition on the linking number versus the framing on R, L equals zero or R L equals two. Okay, but you can construct many such examples. So either B, so both B and G have to be meridians, but they can be linked together. Okay, and how. Okay, and how do you get the knots? So, I said from why we care about these links is that we're going to get pairs of knots with the same zero surgeries. The way to do it is you slide green, so to get the, there's going to be a green knot and a blue knot. To get the green knot, you slide the original green knot over the red one to get rid of its linking, of the geometric linking with B. Linking with B. So sliding means doing what's in the picture, and it depends a little bit on the framing on red. So you may have to introduce some full twists here. Okay, so I'll give an example in a moment. What you want to make sure is that like B and G are going to look completely apart from each other after you do the slides. And once you do this for G, you get a not KG, and you similarly can do one for. And you similarly can do one for B, and you get a not KB. And our theorem says that they have the same zero surgeries. Okay, so here's an example. Let's look at this. This is my RBG link from before. Okay, now the green knot intersects the disk for the blue knot in these purple dots. So what I want Purple dots. So, what I want to do is slide green over red to get rid of these intersections. And once I do that, I get some more complicated knot Kg. Or I can isotope this so that the green knot looks more like an on-knot. It has a disk. Now the blue intersects it also in two points. I'm going to slide blue over red, and I end up with another knot. And these two knots are different, but now we know that they have. And but now we know that they have the same zero surgery. So we can use them. I mean, if one of them were sliced, in this case, neither of them is sliced, but if one of them were sliced, we could construct a homotopy force here. All right, so let's review the goal. Ideally, we would like to find some example where one knot, let's say Kb, is slice and the other one is not slice. So by computing the S invariant. By computing the S invariant. So S of Kg should be non-zero, or vice versa. And then we would get this homotopy force field, V union, the trace on Kg. And we would know that, well, by construction, Kg bounds a disk in this V, in this W, but Kg is not slice. So this would be ideal. Then we would disprove the smooth one-correct conjecture in dimension four. We didn't find this, but. We didn't find this, but that's but you know, yeah, you can try. So we tried. What we did, we studied a six-parameter family consisting of over 3,000 special RBG links, which is shown here. So these are some links. The boxes represent some full twists. So if I have the box labeled E, that means I have E full twists. E, that means I have E full twists. And that's okay. I mean, if you can, if you ignore the green knot, then you can see that this is going to be a meridian for red. And also, if you ignore the blue, then green is a meridian for red. So by varying A, B, C, D, E F, you get, I mean, you can get infinitely many examples, but to compute a Rasmussen invariant, we just focused, I don't know, the values are because. Just focused, I don't know. The values are between minus two and two, or minus one and one, something like that for these six parameters. And yeah, I don't know, we just chose this family because it includes a lot of the small knots in the table by varying the number of twists. But you can look at other families. So let me just tell you what we found. First of all, these are pictures of the nuts of Kb and Kg that came out of the construction. Okay, we didn't find any examples when one of the knot is slice and the other has S non-zero. I mean, you can put them in snappy and in many cases, I mean, some of these knots have sufficiently small number of crossings that they can be found in the knot tables. And then you can see if they're known to be slice. So that was our really our. Our hope that we would find something where one of them would just know it's slice, and the calculation gives us that S is non-zero. Okay, this didn't happen. We did find some things. We found some examples where both of them are slice and they're different from each other. Okay, so, and in fact, they don't have the same trace. And when you do that, then you can do the construction we had before, and you get some homotopy. We had before, and you get some homotopy force here, which is potentially exotic, but it cannot be detected by the S invariant, at least not using Kg, because we know that the knots are slice. So S is zero for both of them. But this is a new construction of homotopy for spheres. And secondly, we found 21 examples where one of the nuts has S non-zero and the other has S equals zero, which is more like in the direction of what. Which is more like in the direction of what we wanted. And for the one with s equals zero, I mean, ideally, we would have liked it to be slice. We couldn't tell if it's slice, but as I'll explain in a few slides, in the end, it was turned out not to be slice. Other people showed that it's not slice. Okay, so we looked at this family of 3,000 knots. We also looked at some infinite family of knots obtained by annulus twisting. So, annulus twisting is a procedure for finding knots. Twisting is a procedure for finding knots with the same zero surgeries in the literature. Of course, any knots with the same zero surgeries can be done in terms of RBG links. But this was before we figured the RBG links. We looked at some annulus twisting, and this produced infinitely many homotopy four spheres, as in one. So when both knots are slice. And then, yeah, we didn't have examples of the type two, like when not when one of them has s equals zero and the other s. them as s equals zero and the other as non-zero all right so let me just show you some pictures uh this these were the homotopy four spheres that we found from uh from annulus twisting there's infinitely many of them these are kirby diagrams they depend on an integer n is obtained by you twist some knot j0 which is known to be slice eight eight and you get some other knots j n and you use And you use J0 and Jn, you get these ones. Okay, when you use the same knot, of course, you get something standard. J0 and J0 gives us something standard. But then after we made public our construction, so almost immediately Kyle Hayden gave us a proof that X1 was standard, was actually S4. And then a month later, Kainakamura, who's a grad student at UT Austin, showed that all of The Duty Austin shows that all of them are standard RS4. Okay, but that still doesn't show quite everything. So, our pictures were when we used J0 and Jn, but annulus twisting gives you actually infinitely many knots all with the same zero surgery. So, you could also look at Jm and Jn for M not different than N. And I don't have pictures of those, but I think it's still open if those are standard or not. Standard or not? I mean, probably their standard. I don't know. That's the history of this attempt to find exotic force heres. You construct homotopy force fields, and then other people tell you that they're standard. But you still hope. Okay, oh yeah, and this one from hohanirus twisting. Now, two of them, x1 and x minus one, are two of the ten examples we found from RBG. And then we still have the other eight examples. And then we still have the other eight examples, which remain as potential counterexamples to SPC4. All right, now what about the other ones? So the non-slice nuts. So we found those 21 examples where one nut has s equals minus two and hence is not slice. And then the other one had s equals zero. And we couldn't determine if the companion was slice. The companion was sliced. So, yeah, so in the first version of the paper, we had all these 21 knots, and we said if any of them were sliced, then SPC4 would be false. And these are the knots. We had 21 knots like this. Great. So, I mean, we try to show that we try to see if there's slice or not, and they passed a lot of the obstructions. So they satisfy the Alexander polynomial, Fox. Alexander polynomial, Fox-Milner condition, a lot of the invariants S, S with different coefficients, SQ1, Lipschitz, Sharkar invariants were zero. The not floor homology concordance invariants were zero. And then you want to make sure they don't have the same trace. And we could show that at least 12 of them didn't have the same trace. Okay, so we wrote a paper. Then, of course, you cannot compete with the hive mind. So soon after, other people show. After other people show that they are, in fact, NAP slice. So, Nathan Dunfield and Sherry Gunn have a program for computing twisted Alexander polynomials. And they showed that 16 of them of the knots were not even topologically sliced. So these invariants were non-zero. Right, so this, so they're not slice. And then there were five left. Those were topologically sliced. They had Alexander polynomial one. Alexander polynomial one. And very recently, namely last week, Kainakamura showed that there are not slice using trace embeddings. So they usually don't have the same trace, but he showed, here something, well, okay, here's something about trace embeddings in connected sums of CP2. And he relied on my work with Marengon, Shankara, and Willis about the S invariant in CP, like what it says about control. In CP, like what it says about connected sum of CP2. Now, his proof uses the fact that the five examples that were left, the framing of red was positive and the S invariant of the companion was negative. But in principle, I mean, I don't know. There's no reason why there aren't examples where this doesn't happen. So maybe this, I just want to say that the strategy still stands. I mean, it didn't come out of the family that we looked at, such examples, but it might, I mean, okay, we might find other examples from other families. We are currently trying to generate other families and compute the S invariants. Okay, so the last thing I wanted to say was that if, okay, if disproving SPC4 sounds too crazy, you could do something. You could do something just slightly less crazy. You could try to find exotic structures on the connected sum of n copies of CB2. So that's also unknown by work of Friedman and Donaldson. It's known that if you have a smooth, simply connected four manifold with positive definite intersection form, then this is homeomorphic to NCP2 for some n. But okay, but it's not known if this. But okay, but it's not known if this has exotic smooth structures. So, all the exotic structures on four manifolds are on, at least on simply connected four manifolds, are for indefinite intersection forms. So, for definite, we don't know. And so, our first result was that if k is h slice in NCP2, then s is greater or equal than zero. And this tells you that you could adapt the strategy also. You that you could adapt the strategy also to find exotic structures on NCP2 if you could only find a pair of knots with the same zero surgeries, such that one is H slice in NCP2 and the other one has K S less than zero. Then you could do something very similar to what we did before. And you'll get that K prime is not H slice in N CP2. But is H slices in a homotopy NCP2, and then you would get an exotic smooth structure on NCP2. So we didn't find examples like this as well, but at least this is just slightly more hopeful in the sense that there are a lot more knots that are age-slice in NCP2 than just slice. Slice knots are quite rare, but if you had some sequence of crossing changes from positive to negative that turn k. To negative, that turned K into the R nut, then you know that K is H slice in NCP2. That's one thing you can show. So, in particular, all positive NOTs have this property, or the figure eight knot has this property, and there's just a lot more of them. But there's no, I guess people don't have a table of such knots. Like, it's a new concept, or I don't know, people haven't looked at it so much, so we cannot really tell from Snappy which ones are a. Snappy, which ones are H slice in NCP2. So yeah, so yeah, so in principle, you can try to run a computer program and see if you find examples like this. So yeah, so the search is still ongoing. And one thing is that it's very easy to draw a lot of RBG things. But I don't know if we'll find any interesting examples. I mean, chances are not, but you know. But you know, what do I want to say? Let me just end with a few weeks ago, I read in the New Yorker this article about how the Pentagon now has a program for looking at UFOs and I investigating what, I don't know if there's anything to them. And, you know, in 95% of the cases, they have a, you know, a prosaic explanation. But then the other ones, you don't know, but still probably it wouldn't be aliens, it would be something more normal. Be aliens, it would be something more normal, but still, you want to try. I don't know, there's this thing, so it's the same with looking for homotopy force here. Like, you in most of the time, people show to you that they're standard, but then there's still some hope. And then you still try. And who knows, maybe it would work. But then in the back of your mind, you have this idea that, okay, maybe just intelligent alien life doesn't exist, or SPC4 is just true. And that's what you have to look. And that's what you have to live with. But I don't know, we decided to still try, and we're trying a little bit more, and we'll see what happens. So I'll end here. Okay, thanks to Chiprian. So, oh, okay, sorry. I thought those were like six people raising their hand, and I was like, oh, there's a lot of questions, but there's at least one question. So say, okay, go ahead. One question. So, Sergei, go ahead. Thank you, Prien. I have a quick, very, very simple question just to clarify. So, there was this six parameter family with ABCD where if I understood correctly, ABCDs were unbounded, right? So, they're just integers, full twists. So, where did the number 3300 came from? Is it part of the family? Or no, no, I mean, you could you have infinitely many examples. It's just at some point they get too big and. It's just at some point they get too big and it's hard to compute the S invariant by computer. So, what was the number 3300? Oh, yeah. So, that's so for the ones that the twists that are on two strands, we'll look at five numbers, like between minus two and two. And for the ones that for B, which is on three strands, we just look between minus one and one. I see. So, it's coming from your specific restriction on. Yeah, yeah, we just look at some range. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just wanted to clarify. Yeah, thank you. I have a quick question. As you mentioned, Chiprian, there is all this technology to show that knots are not slice. How would you go about trying to show that some interesting knots are slice? Yeah, we tried to do this actually with these knots. I mean, in retrospect, it was hopeless, but there's a program by Sherry Gunn. Program by Sherry Gong that looks for ribbons, ribbon bands. She looks at all the edges in the diagram and looks at the smallest path connecting the edges by faces and puts twists on them. And it's very good. It detects almost all of the slice nuts up to like 14 crossings. So you would be assuming a ribbon slice conjecture? Yes, yes, yes. I don't know how to find slice otherwise. Yeah. So find, yeah, so we try to find ribbon bands. Find ribbon bands, but of course, it didn't work. So, there's an analogous genus, kind of Rasmussen-type genus bound for lynx, you know, a bound on the Euler characteristic of the four-ball genus. Do you think these types of approaches, you know, is there anything to be gained by considering links rather than just knots? Okay, that's a good question. I mean, well, our, I mean, in general, yes, if you care about zero surgeries, I mean, I let's see. No, that's a good, that's a good point. Like, if you have a link that's strongly sliced in a homotopy ball, but not in before, then Kevin, I saw that you in your original paper with Mike and discuss. Paper with Mike and Scott. You move. Yeah, that's what we're doing. You move from legs to not. Is it for the ease of computing the SN variants? Yes, that's what Kevin and his collaborators tried. I thought the question was more about things with the same zero surgery. And I think you could try to do it for links, too. We haven't tried that. I guess we wouldn't have to do that. But I think also you wouldn't have to just consider. Wouldn't have to just consider size. I mean, maybe this is even less useful, but it could just, you know, link my bound as a surprisingly simple surface, maybe an annulus or something like that in the four-ball. You know, so it wouldn't have to be, you know. Oh, yes, yes. Actually, that's that's another thing you could do even with knots. I mean, you can try. Wait, no, no, no. What am I talking about? Sorry. So, constructing this homotopy, at least by zero surgeries, I think this relies on one of the nodes being sliced. And I think it would similarly rely on the link being strongly sliced. But of course, there may be other constructions of homotopy for spheres where you can try to do that. All right, so people don't run away because we're going to do the conference photo. Are there any more questions for Chicken? So I don't know, is the birth staff here? Yeah, I am here. There are about
