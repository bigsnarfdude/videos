By algebraic therapy. Oh, sorry, let me repeat the title for the recording. Our next speaker is Grigory Garkusha from Swansea University, and he will tell us about complex cobordism spectra via algebraic varieties. Thank you, Grigory. Go ahead. Okay, many thanks indeed for the opportunity to give a talk here. And as an algebraist, I'll try to convince the audience of topology. To convince the audience of topologists how complex algebraic varieties can be for computing some important stable homotopy type. This talk is a joint work with Alexander Nishatov and the results, in fact, first appeared four years ago in April 2018 about explicit computations of multiplic fibrants. Vibrant resolutions for motivic spectra. And one of the applications set out to compute topological spectra, some topological spectra, like means of algebraic varieties. So, this is an application which I'm going to tell about. I would start first with a brief introduction of material homotopy theory. Theory, not getting in many details. So, let me start first with what mativic homotopy theory is. So, it is a mix of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. And materialic sets are Nisnevich sheaves of sets, where we consider We consider the Nisnevich topology on smooth algebraic varieties. There are other, there are plenty of topologies on smooth algebraic varieties like Zariski or et al., but in mativic homotopy theory, we mostly consider the Nisnevich topology, which is between the Zariski topology and et al. topology. And materialic space. And mativic spaces, similarly to simplicial sets, we then define mativic spaces as simplicial shifts of Nishnieric shifts of sets. And also we define the local model structure on such matrix spaces. These are errors which induce weak equivalencies stockwise between simplicial sets and to define the The category of mativic spaces with together with the model structure or mativic model structure, we need to localize the category of the local model structure with respect to this family of errors. In other words, we make affine line contractible in Line contractible in mativic homotopy. Okay, this is how we define the mativic model structure of mativic spaces, and then we invert the weak equivalences in this model category structure are called motivic equivalences. And then as usual, we invert motivic equivalences to get the homotopy category of motivic spaces. Category of motiv spaces. Similarly to homotopy category of topological spaces, where we invert weak equivalences and equivalently weak equivalences of simplicial sets. And likewise, we define points at mativic spaces. And then we speak about point also we consider model mativic model structure on material pointed material space. Mativic, pointed mativic spaces. Then, in order to construct, there are again various approaches, but all of them are equivalent. There are various ways to construct the stable mativic homotopy theory. We deal with, in contrast with the classical topology, we deal with two circles here. One circle is the usual one, the simplest. Is the usual one, the simplest circle, which is regarded as a constant Nisnyerich shift. And another one is another one is given by the algebraic circle, namely it is defined as follows. We take the spectrum of Laurent polynomials and we And we take its spectrum, and this spectrum is pointed at identity. So, this is another circle we deal with in mativic homotopy theory. And then there is a standards procedure to stabilize in both directions, to stabilize mativic model structure with respect to these two circles. In the end, In the end, we arrive at the category of bispectra written here. As you can see, we have two subscripts here for two circles. And there is a standard stable model structure, say, due to following many people, Rardine, Macrovy, many people. But it was first defined by Marel Wojki, of course. I'm telling that there are various equivalent approaches to construct the homotopy category of material bias spectra. And that is denote SH of K. K refers to the base fields we start with. And we in this talk we shall mostly be interested in the field of complex numbers, the field where topological applications occur. What is an advantage of stable material homotopy theory here is over, say, compared with the classical stable homotopy theory of classical topological spectra. topological spectra. Following Worivotsky, who invented various correspondences in mativic homotopy theory, one of which will be discussed later, the frame correspondences. So in mativic homotopy theory, we deal with Homotopy theory, we deal with not only with stable homotopy groups, but sheaves of stable homotopy groups, or prior sheaves of stable homotopy groups. And prior sheaves of sheaves may have various correspondences. Not only they are all factorial in smooth algebraic varieties, but we may add further maps to smooth algebraic varieties depending on. algebraic varieties depending on particular homotopy co-homology theory we want to investigate but we can often attach a category of correspondences then our pressures will have such correspondences and it is one of the major computational tools in practice that That pressures of stable homotopy groups have correspondences. Okay, as I have said, we shall mostly discuss the category of mativic spectra over the complex numbers. And there is a standard realization functor from mativic homotopy theory, stable mativic homotopy theory to the classical one. Homotopy theory to the classical one, it is induced by the following function. We take smooth algebraic varieties and then we send each algebraic variety to the analytic space of complex points. And this analytic space is endowed with the classical topology. So we then extend We then extend, we can then extend this function further to all bispectra. And it turns out, by a theorem of Levine, that the classical stable homotopy theory of classical spectra is fully faithfully embedded into motivic homotopy category, stable motivic homotopy category over the field of complex numbers. Numbers. Therefore, if we are able using this embedding and also this realization function, if by chance we are able to compute something inside SH of C, we may compute classical stable homotopy types. And this is the main idea how An idea how apply, for example, computations to mativic homotopy theory to the classical topology. Okay, and in this talk, I'll be dealing with frame correspondences of Oywovsky, who invented them more than 20 years ago, I think in 2001. And then using the machinery. Using the machinery of framed motifs. But before discussing frame correspondences, I would illustrate them by the well-known implicit function theorem from complex analysis. By this theorem, I want to stress that, for example, the information For example, the information produced by the implicit function theorem is a small part of Wyvoski's frame correspondences. So, this is, so frame correspondences is a larger, is a bigger information containing, for example, the information of implicit function theorem over the field of complex numbers. More precisely, I use the implicit function theorem starting with Starting with polynomials F capital into variables Z and W and we have variables and variables in Z and M variables in W and what does it say this theory? We assume that F evaluated at this point equals zero. At this point, equals zero. And furthermore, we assume that the partial derivative of my polynomials of capital with respect to w evaluated at this point is non-zero. Then the equations, polynomial equations, uniquely produce a bunch of functions, which are called implicit functions. Which are called implicit functions. Namely, we have a solution like this with a further property that my functions, implicit functions, evaluated at zero, at z-naughts equals zero. Okay, and what does it give me? The implicit function theorem produces a triple. First of all, it produces It produces that capital, where that capital is singleton that not, and such that capital will be referred later to as the support of the correspondence. Next, we have neighborhoods of Z small enough, and we have a collection of implicit functions on U. Functions on U with this such that f evaluated at Z equals U. If by chance we have a further condition that, sorry, I should have written here that it's an imprint, that here. If by chance the support is the preimage of the zero of zero. image of the zero of zero then i call such a triple i call such a triple a holomorphic frame correspondence i use on purpose framed correspondence because i'll illustrate how to extend this information further to algebraic varieties by using wivorsky correspondences well um a triple the triple above vi capital above phi capital in fact produces a particular map between important motivic spheres namely this motivic this mativic sphere and this mativic sphere where the first mativic sphere is the wedge product the nth power of the projective line pointed at infinity every scheme can be Every scheme can be identified with its representable niche neuronship, its material space. Moreover, it is a pointed material space at infinity. Another sphere, typical material sphere in material homotopy theory is given by these quotients. We take the affine space and then model out in the Nisnevich topology with respect to Topology with respect to affine space without the origin. So, I have not, I want to stress that the information of implicit functions produced by the implicit function theorem produces me something in motivic homotopy theory, produces a map of motivic space, of motivic spheres. Spheres okay, and um, again, uh, we can further, yeah, as I have said, we as I have said, the theorem yields such triples, yeah, the supports, neighborhood of supports, and the implicit functions on the neighborhood such that f and this, and I also require uh the following property that. The following property that f inverse of zero is my support z. Okay, next I identify two such triples by saying that one triple is equivalent to another triple if their supports are the same and there is a smaller neighborhood, u double prime, such that there is the restriction of The restriction of one collection of implicit functions to U equals the restriction of another collection of implicit functions to U prime. Okay, and the set of equivalence classes of such triples produce, give me, give me morphisms of between mativic spheres. Again, Again, only holomorphic functions produce, some holomorphic functions produce explicit morphisms between material spheres. If I take in the implicit function theorem n to be equal to m, then let me denote the collection of such triples by frame n point. By frame and point points, this is just notation. And it turns out that I may compose such triples in this fashion. I may compose them and in the end I get a graded monoid in, in fact, in pointed simplicial sets. Next, I can... Next, I can stabilize. There is a canonical frame correspondence denoted by sigma. It is given, it sends a triple Z UF. So the triple with supports, we attach zero to Z on the right, we attach the complex line on the right, and the implicit, the collection of implicit functions like this. Functions like this. And then taking the coordinate over sigma, I get a pointed set denoted by framed point points. Okay, and this is a brief introduction to frame correspondences by using the implicit function theorem over complex numbers. But more generally, we can define. generally we can define frame correspondences as follows of any field namely i start with smooth algebraic varieties here and my uh i i i start with supports namely i take a closed subset in this algebraic variety and require that z is finite over x in the In the examples above for holomorphic functions, X is the point, spectrum of the field of complex numbers. Also, the role of the neighborhoods of Z is played by an atal neighborhoods of Z in here. The role of implicit functions from the implicit Implicit functions from the implicit function theorem is played by a collection of morphisms from the et al. neighborhoods and with the property that the pre-image of zero must be my support z. Similarly to holomorphic functions triples. And further, I have a morphism from the et alumni hose to To the scheme, small scheme y. So, this is an extension of the information above. And as above, I can consider, instead of, I can consider quadruples because I have added a morphism from u to y, the second argument has appeared. And also, this information can be Information can be depicted by this diagram. A frame correspondence from x to y is this picture. I've got an etal neighborhood of z in this, and I've got a collection of morphisms which play the role of the implicit functions above, such that the pre-image of zero is my z. And a further. Yeah, and a further arrow to y. Okay, and as above, I can identify some frame correspondences by means of if I have smaller et al. neighborhoods such that my functions restricted to the smaller neighborhoods coincide. And of course, if supports coincide. the insight so uh an important uh an important lemma due to wyewotsky says that this uh collection of geometric data namely frame correspondences precisely precisely are in bijective correspondence with morphisms of mativic spaces pointed mativic spaces it's It's an important computation. In computation above, for implicit holomorphic functions, take x to be points, y to be points, and then I can replace frame correspondences of the left-hand side by the information coming from the implicit function theory. But more generally, we deal with smooth algebraic varieties. Deal with smooth algebraic varieties and frame correspondences of Oyevovsky. To produce a category, a category of on smooth algebraic varieties, which is depicted by this diagram. So I start with X, map to Y, and given another frame correspondences from Y to W, I can compose frame correspondences by taking pullbacks of Taking pullbacks of etal neighborhoods and supports, respectively. Okay, then I can consider such a set. I take all the all-frame correspondences of each level, and it turns out that I can produce a category, namely the category of framework. Namely, the category of frame correspondences here, whose objects are smooth algebraic varieties and whose morphisms are given by these graded sets. Okay, and what is next? As above, there is a distinguished morphism I can sigma. I can stabilize with respect to sigma to get stable frame correspondences as a buff. As above. And an important cosimplicial scheme, which plays the same role as in topology standard cosimplicial, cosimplicial, simplicial sets, delta square bracket. But in algebra, one considers polynomial rings in n plus one variable, mod out this ideal, and take the spectrum of the. And take the spectrum of the quotients ring. Every such ring is isomorphic, isomorphic to polynomial rings and n-variables, but non-canonically. So then all together, I get a cosimplicial scheme, and then I put it into the first variable. The first variable and construct such a simplicial set. Okay, this set is, in fact, this set is very important in practice. In the second variable, I may also put simplicial sets. I can identify every pointed set with a scheme. With a scheme, just taking the spectrum of the fields finitely many times. So, and one of the computations in this language, I want to stress one compute, to show one computation, namely it gives me over the field of complex numbers, an explicit spectrum. Explicit spectrum entirely given by frame correspondences, which are entirely determined, defined in terms of complex algebraic varieties. And it turns out that such a spectrum, such a spectrum, S1 spectrum, is equivalent to the classical sphere spectrum, and moreover it is quasi-vibrant, namely it is vibrant in positive. Positive in positive degrees. And this computation also gives me, for example, such infinite loop spaces in terms of frame correspondences here. So the left-hand side is entirely topological. The right-hand side is combinatorial, is given by algebraic complex varieties. And this result. This result, in fact, requires all the machinery of frame motifs, and it depends on a series of papers on frame motifs. Even over complex numbers, we can't get rid of any step required for general Bayes field K. So, in order to get such a topological computation, we need all the results for Result for frame motives of arbitrary fields. And yeah, it took a while to get such a computation. Yeah, it took many years. Next, let me pass this talk about Tom's spectra. And mativity Tom spectra are defined as a collimit. As co-limits of such material spaces. In material homotopy theory, in material homotopy theory, we don't deal with matrix spaces like in topology and how to define material spaces in material homotopy theory. And they are defined by such quotients, for example, when we deal with. When we deal with a vector bundle E to X, then we can take the set of, then sorry, we can take zero sections in E and form such equations in mativic spaces. And by definition, this is the term space of the vector bundle E. This is how we define some material term spaces in material homotopy. Spaces in material homotopy. And in fact, many mativia, the realization of many mativic Tom spectra, like MGL, recover reconstructs, for example, the complex cobodism spectrum Mu. So therefore, if you compute the algebraic cobodism spectrum somehow, Spectrum, somehow there is a chance to get a computation of the complex cobodism spectrum Mu. And this is the idea. Okay, and the algebraic cobodism spectrum is defined absolutely in the same fashion as in topology as soon as we define material term. Material term spaces of vector bundles. So we take Grassmannions, then we take universal bundles over Grassmannians, and then we form mativic tom spaces, stabilize, and similarly to topology. It turns out that realization, the complex realization of complex cobodism functor is isomorphic in essence to the is isomorphic in a s to the realization of algebraic hobodism is isomorphic in a s to the complex to the complex hobodism okay and what is next given a reasonable mativic term space mativic term spectrum here one can form uh framed uh e-framed correspondences uh with respect to this mativic term spectrum we can Material spectrum. We can define them by this, by the right-hand side. But similarly to Wywowski's description, we have an explicit description of the right-hand side by geometric data, absolutely the same as frame correspondences above. So we can similarly define E-frame correspondences associated to a reasonable material term spectrum E. Spectrum E. The algebraic material spectrum is one of such reasonable spectra. And as above, you can again stabilize it in sigma to get stabilized frame corresponding E-frame correspondences. And then we define the motive of an algebraic variety y capital similarly to frame motive. Similarly, to frame motif of algebraic varieties. Namely, we take such spectra. This is a, in fact, this is the Siegel spectrum associated to spatial gamma space in this direction. Okay, it is symmetric and in fact it is vibrant in positive degrees. Very nice spectrum. Okay, what is next? I should stress that, for example, in most cases, the case of the sphere spectrum, I showed you a computation of the topological sphere spectrum in terms of frame correspondences. But if you want to compute further, if you want to produce similar computations for For other spectrum, almost always one has to take finite coefficients. This depends on a theorem of, on the celebrated theorem of Suslin Wywowski, comparing singular homology of spaces and Suslin homology of algebraic varieties, but the Ethereum. But this theorem only says that both homology theories coincide only with finite coefficients. What do I mean by a spectrum with, for example, with finite, say, if I take with a material spectrum and if I have any integer positive integer. any integer, positive integer, and capital say, then I may form such a triangle. So then I have a mativic spectrum E modula N. So this is by the very definition. Okay, and the first theorem in this direction says that for reasonable material spectrum, E capital E capital we can take like MGL, like MGL, we take its E-frame motive of the points, evaluate it at the points, modular and take modular and spectrum. In fact, I can describe, since I've got two variables in different motifs, I can define it explicitly what's Explicitly, what this spectrum module looks like. Okay, and the theorem says that this S1 spectrum is isomorphic in SH to its realization module M. So, this computation, in fact, is reminiscent of Sufin Wyvotsky's Uh, Wyvotsky's uh computer theorem on singular homology. Yeah, an analog of this theorem, an analog for Mativik Tom Spietra over the field of complex numbers. Next, another computation says that this topological space, if I take the complex core bodies and modulus. Take the complex pop bodies of modulo n spectrum, then I can take omega infinity to omega to infinity minus one. And the theorem says that this space can be computed by the right-hand side in terms of MGL frames correspondences. Next, since MGL is a Since MGL is isomorphic, the complex realization of MGL is isomorphic to Mu in SH, by equivalence theorem I know that pi star of Mu is isomorphic to the Lazar ring in infinitely many variables xi's, where each xi is placed in 2i degree. And the last theorem implies the following. Theorem implies the following corollary here. Namely, that homotopy groups of framed motifs evaluate MGL framed motif evaluated at points with finite coefficients is given by this group. This is a material application. No, this is a computation. Thanks to Quemian's theory. Okay, next. It turns out that if you deal with algebraic comboism spectrum, this S1 spectrum can considerably be simplified. So I can, in fact, I can throw away. In fact, I can throw away lots of information from Wyvotsky's frame correspondences associated with MGL and only leave supports in the end. So no Italian neighborhood, no framings, only support is left. More precisely, let me give the following definition. I consider instead of frame N MGL, I consider Well, I consider such sets between X and Y, which are given by local complete intersections. So, namely, I consider couples Z and F, where Z in fact plays the role of the support, which is closed L T I subscribe local completeness intersections, intersection in here. And further, I have a map amorphism. I have a map a morphism from z to y. So I've got couples z and f and no etal neighborhoods, nothing. Only z is left in the case of MGL. And this is really nice that we can get rid of plenty of redundant information for MGL frame correspondences. Okay, and as above, you can stabilize in we can stabilize such sets to get this set, this shift, excuse me. And then I get the following theory, namely the MGL frame motif as defined above. As defined above, is equivalent to such material S1 spectrum. So, this S1 spectrum requires all the data from Voivosky's frame correspondences. This S1 spectrum is based only on supports, which are local complete intersections finite and subjective for X. Finite and subjective over X. So this material S1 spectrum is much simpler than MGL frame, than this S1 spectrum. And then applying results above, I can tell that in particular, the spectrum complex cobodism modular N is then isomorphic in SH to this. NSH to this S1 spectrum. Furthermore, I've got this computation, omega to the power of infinity minus one is computed as this simplicial set. Next, what is nice with this approach is that Is that we can explicitly compute not only vibrant resolutions of S1 spectra, but also homology of S1 spectra. More precisely, if I take E-frame motive of Y, then the homology spectrum is given by this spectrum. And it turns out that It turns out that the homology spectrum can be explicitly computed. Namely, it is entirely recovered from such a complex. Namely, I take in E-framed correspondences only those supports which are connected and freely generates abelian groups. I don't say arbitrary. My generators are given by connected supports only. And then I can form the such a simplificial abelian group, which by Doltcan is identified with a I can produce chain complex out of it. So I Out of its so I implicitly use the dotted correspondence. So such a complex is given, it consists of three abelian groups in each degree with bases given by E-frame correspondences with connected supports. And it turns out that the homology is entirely computed by this complex. Okay, um, what is next? If E is the algebraic cobordism spectrum, then I can fall, I have said about that for algebraic cobaltisms, we can significantly simplify MGL frame correspondences and leave supports only. So, if I take the complex with chains being three abelian groups of connected LCIs, local complete intersections, then the homology of this S1 spectrum is entirely recovered from this complex. And as a consequence, I can As a consequence, I can compute this spectrum, the homology of MU module N as this complex. In fact, I should have written here points, points, points, and the field is that of complex numbers. The homology of complex cobodism with finite coefficients is Coefficients is computed as this complex, which is fully, which is entirely defined in terms of complex algebraic varieties only. Okay, this is essentially all I was going to tell you about today. Many things and any questions or comments. Thank you. Are there any questions? Are there any questions here in CMO in Oaxaca? Looks like maybe not. Are there any questions from the Zoom audience? If so, just. Audience. If so, just unmute yourself and ask. I have a question. Okay. So, I mean, I don't really know much about mativic things, but does this spectrum represent cobordism in some visibly geometric sense of, you know, things? For example, what can be done further? What can be done further? A reasonable question is whether such computations can be done by means of analytic spaces only. And the answer is hopefully yes. It's a big job to do, but the answer is hopefully yes. And I must admit, I must admit, I started with the implicit function theorem to illustrate how it can be done. I used only analytic spaces, used holomorphic functions, but hopefully, yes, such computations can be done in terms of complex varieties only. But for Only. But for this, you have to rewrite all the machinery of frame correspondences for complex varieties and establish various theorems which were proven for frame motives, blah, blah, blah. But yes, hopefully, yes. And what what about, I mean, the Brown-Peterson spectrum is it can you split this? Can you split this? Uh, yeah, uh, Brian. I know people should be, it should be, yes, it should. Uh, honestly, I have not thought about BPS spectrum in terms of algebraic varieties, but I'm pretty sure that the same computation should be valid here. But again, with fine, I'm afraid, with finite coefficients, because there is a fundamental theorem of. The fundamental theorem of Suslin where realization behaves very well with finite coefficients. The complex realization with finite coefficients only. I showed you one theorem. Wait, wait, wait. Let me jump above just a second. Just a second. Yeah. Say this theorem does not require any finite coefficients. But this is only for one reason. The material space S naught is zero dimensional. As soon as you deal with suspension spectrum, for example, of For example, of algebraic varieties of positive dimension, you have to pass through finite coefficients. This is the only case when we can get rid of finite coefficients and therefore to compute, for example, topological spectrum in terms of frame correspondences and without finite coefficients. Finite coefficients. But say, if you pass to MGL or other material spaces where you deal with Gross Manions, for example, these are algebraic varieties of positive degree finite coefficients. On the other hand, on the other hand, if you redo all this machinery in terms of complex varieties, Varieties, hopefully, then no finite difference would be necessary, I think. But again, it should be doable, yes. Just a small Just a small question to make sure I understood something. On the following slide, I think it's the following slide where you have this equivalence for. No, sorry, then it's not. Maybe it's the next one. Loops infinity of mu mod n. Loops infinity minus one, sorry. Ah, of mu. Ah, I see. Here. Yes. There at the bottom, the right-hand side. Sorry, more modern. Sorry, more modern. It's amazing. Okay, excuse me, yes, absolutely. More than. Yeah. All right. Okay. Good. And this theorem definitely needs the mod n. Yes, unfortunately. Okay. So again, because algebraic varieties of positive dimension are involved there, you can't get rid of that at all. Yeah. Grossmanians, yeah, the grossman, exactly, exactly. Okay, yeah, thank you. Um, are there any other questions for Grigory? No, either here or on Zoom. Well, if there are no further questions, uh, let's thank him again. Thank you, thank you.
