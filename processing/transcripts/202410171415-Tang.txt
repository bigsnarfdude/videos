What I'm going to talk about is the cohomology of some unimodular Poisson polynomial algebra in three variables. Since my talk is up to Xinjing's talk, so I don't have any obligation to give some new jokes. I can also pretty much skip the motivation part as well. Thanks to Xinjiang. By the way, this is joint work with Hong Di, Xinji, and Jens. And James, okay. I learned a lot from them in the process. So I want to take this opportunity to thank them for the collaboration and friendship. All right. First, just for my own sake, just to give a brief review of the definitions, you probably know much better than me. So for me, the K is a base field of characteristic zero. So a Poisson algebra is a commutative algebra. Poisson algebra is a commutative algebra with Li algebra structure, and they're compatible in the following sense. That means it's a derivation in each component. Of course, it satisfies Jacobian conjecture because Jacobi identity because it's the algebra. All right, again, maybe some examples. So since we're focused on the polynomial algebras, let me start with the two variable situation. Variable situation. So you can take any polynomial f xy, you can define the bracket equal to this f. Well, it's trivial to check if the Jacobian identity is true, so we're safe here. All right. Go down to three variables. So if you have a polynomial algebra in three variables, x, y, z, you can still do that. You take any omega, and you can define the x, y to be the partial derivative. xy to be the partial derivative with respect to z and then the rest is just similar defined of course here just a technical reminder we mean the potential the omega is said to be have isolated singularity at the origin if you model a by the ideal generated by the partial derivative of the omega with respect to x y and z and Respect to x, y, and z, and the dimension of the field k is finite. All right, of course, again, a review for myself of the definition of the cohomology. So basically, you take the multi-derivations whose symmetric, and you can put them together as a complex. And then you can define a They boundary operators in such a way, which is kind of not very illuminating. But again, I don't remember anyway. So I think it just mentioned defined in such a way. And then, of course, you can take the Poisson co-homology as the kernel of this delta module, the image of the priest one. Of course, it has a component of the homology, so which is the So, which is defined through the Keller differentials, you get another complex, and this time, of course, you're going down from the k to k minus one. So, like you take the forms, and then you just go each time you just go down by one. Again, you can define the homology to be the kernel marked image. The reason we The image. The reason we mentioned this is because when the A is unimodular, you have a duality between the homology and the cohomology. This is a result due to Professor Wu and his students. All right. Of course, what has been computed? So back in the 1990s, Vandenberg actually calculated this, the cohomology for A on. The cohomology for A omega when the omega is equal to x cubed plus y cubed plus z cubed plus lambda x y z, when the lambda cubed is not equal to negative 27. He did this because he wants to calculate the Hawkshield homology for the non-commutative algebras associated to this Poisson algebra. Later on, in 2006, Pichora actually computed for the weighted homogeneous omega with an isolated. Homogeneous omega with an isolated singularity at the origin. Of course, this is a generalization because the omega, the first, the omega is actually has isolated singularity. Of course, in that case, you take the degree with the weights of the x, y, z, they all equal one, but you can take any different non-negative and positive weights for the x and y, z. And then recently we actually did for some other examples for omega equal to x cubed plus y squared z and x cubed plus x square z plus y squared z we computed. The reason why we focus on this because this will have some similarity. Of course, the example we calculated does not have isolated singularity. The reason actually we want to look at this because the rest of them we can consider because they're all irreducible in the first place. That's the similarity with the common properties in them. How did we get? Of course, we used brute force computation and we did work a little bit very hard to get the computation down. Okay, it took some time and efforts. All right. So based on this, of course, Based on this, of course, it's just for the irreducible ones in the weight degree of x, y, z, the all equal one. The all irreducible ones are these ones, actually. You don't have any other ones. All right. Of course, a natural question is, well, can we actually look at the weight of the case? Not necessarily have isolated singularity at the origin. But in order to do that, of course, you. But in order to do that, of course, you need to know what you have in the weighted case. So we first worked out the classification. So if you can assign any degree to X, Y, and Z, call them A, B, C, A less than equal B, less than equal C. And then you can take omega to be the sum of the A plus B plus C, right? And then up to a graded automorphism of the A. Of the A, we actually can list all the potential omega. The table won't be very interesting because it looks a little bit complicated, actually has probably four or five tables anyway. There's one thing we noticed that actually, if omega is irreducible, then this, if you try to twist it in certain sense, I won't define here, it's called RGT equals zero called. called RGT equals they call this twist rigid okay it's basically you look at the dimension of the grade Poisson derivations which is find the dimensional so you can define the dimension so it's a finite number so when it's equal to zero called the twist rigid and if and only if omega is irreducible and also we notice that the potential with isolated singularity only exists in these three cases for the widths ABC Uh, cases for the width ABC either equal one or one or one one two, of course, one, two, three. Of course, if they have a common divisor, you can just divide it out. That's why. Of course, the classification is well known when the A equals B equals C due to the work of many people listed here. All right. But of course, if you wanted the computation, you need to actually. You need to actually go to the algebra A or its modules in a way. So you can actually identify them in such a way. So the X0A basically is isomorphic to A. You take it. And the X1 is isomorphic to the direct sum of three cups, the A, and the X2 is also this. What you can do is, of course, the X1 is a X1 is a derivation, right? In a way, you can just take the derivation or maybe the vector field, just act on the component functions x and y and z. So that's how you get a three components, right? All right. So based on that, we can actually write the differentials through these classical operators. There's a W just in case, because the N may not equal. Case because the n may not equal to a plus b plus c that's why there's a twist here when you look at the Poisson cohomology complex. So there's a shift here enough to make sure the boundary operators are greater zero. That's why. But of course, if you move to the other side, actually, you have to do a certain shift in order when you use these classical operators, right? And the degree won't match unless you do a shift. Match unless you do a shift. So I won't get into the details over there. But this is basically you can write down there: zero, one, and two through these curl operators, divergence, and also the gradient operators. I don't remember them most of the times when I tried to understand that, try to remember it, then I forgot it again. All right. All right. So now I have to introduce actually what we compute is not actually the detailed module structure, we actually check the Hilbert series. So if you have a graded module, Z graded, and each piece is finite dimensional or local definite, then you can define the Hilbert series, the dimension of the Mi times T to the I's power, right? Get Hilbert series. But of course, since the XYZ are weighted of the ABC, right? Of the ABC, right? And then here the series of the A is actually 1 over 1 minus T A times 1 minus T to the B and 1 minus T to the C. You can always maybe think of the ABC as 1. But then since you have a complex, right, so you use the additivity of the Hebrew series, and then you can have such identity. So basically, the Hebrew series of Identity. So basically, the Hebrew series of the cohomology is equal to these things. Because overall, the rest of them are the cohomology. So we get this one. Now, here's the result we have. There's some technical assumption here. So the degree ABC for XYZ and the omega is of degree N. N may not. Of degree n, n may not necessarily equal to a plus b plus c could be bigger. We want to make sure the center, what is the Poisson center, that means should be the set of all the cache elements. That means when you do the priority that you commute with any other elements. And we want to make sure the Poisson center is the polynomial algebra in the potential omega. There is also a technical Technical concept here, HO is, I guess, that was talked about by Jason a couple of days ago, but here we just add H to it. I'll talk about that later. And you also want to make sure it has degree zero Poisson derivations. So which is not ozone. So what it means the ozone? It means what? It does not kill every element centered. To be ozone, that means you kill. Center to be ozone, that means you kill every element in the center, okay? So, A is H ozone, that means once you have a derivation, Poisson derivations kills the center element-wise, then it has to be given by the bracket of certain element. It's like a Hamiltonian. All right, it does not have a non-zero Poisson derivation of degree negative n. Then a striking similarity. A striking similarity is what? The Hebrew series of the Poisson core knowledge groups for A omega actually given by the same formula for all the weights. So no difference. So for the pH 0, you get 1 over T to the minus T to the N, and so it's the P H of the pH 1. And H2 and H3 looks a little bit complicated. Of course, I guess we don't have H4, right? We don't have H4, right? So that's why we stop there. All right, of course, if you specialize to the special case when the N is equal A plus B and plus C, right? And then since we have a classification, right? So we can look at all the irreducible ones, except those X K. Those xk plus yl, maybe you can also change the variables, right? You can also have xk with zl, yk with zl, and the heavier series of the Poisson cohomology of the a omega are given by these formulas. Since this time the n is equal to a plus b plus c, so that's why the third one and fourth one look slightly different here, right? One looks slight different here, right? You don't use that ABC anymore. Okay. All right, then you see, okay, how do we get these formulas, right? So here's some idea. So first of all, the pH 0, basically, you just have to look at the Poisson center, right? You get that. So then for the pH 1, so that's related to That's related to the H ozon. Okay. So basically, if it's the A is H ozone, then you can actually have a very nice description of all the Poisson derivations. Okay. So therefore, you can describe the Hibbert series for the pH one. Now, the rest, of course, you need to know either pH two or pH three. pH 2 or pH 3 in order to calculate the rest of because we have identity overall they added up to certain expression right since if you know three of them you can calculate the fourth one previously actually what we did is actually to calculate the homology of the zero homology so that it can be used the the duality so you can get information on the pH 3 but the calculation was But the calculation was really complicated. So we need some maybe new idea or method. So actually, we come up with many equivalent conditions. So if you read this through these couple pages, right? But one thing important to us with critical, they're all equivalent, of course, is this. So every derivation of the A. So every derivation of the A, Poisson derivations of A vanishes on the center is actually a Hamiltonian. That means it's given by a bracket with respect to the element. So that's the key for us to tell the information on the pH one. Like I promised you, there's many things coming up. So I guess 12 is the last one. And along the way, of course, if you only know the If you only know the HOs on this, right? So we have an issue to tell either the two or the second or further cohomology groups. So what you need an equivalent condition, which tells us something about the pH 2, which is given by this technical condition called the UPH2 vacant. So if it's O So, if it's ozone, then it's equivalent to UPH2 ligand. But the reason we want to have this one is because we can actually prove the pH 2, the Hibi series has a special form. So therefore, we can get pH 3 as well. All right. But then, okay, how do you prove the A omega is either H ozone or the UPH2 vacant, right? pH to vacant, right? Well, the idea is floating in the works of the picture and also Lord's Flashes as well and many other people like the palette is actually to use the causal complex. The advantage of being having isolated singularity is the causal complex is exact. Is exact. But since we're looking at the cases which are not having isolated singularity, of course, that's not available. But fortunately, something is still good enough for us to get the computation done. So we introduced the technical concept called K1 sale. It's actually, even though the causal complex is not exactly here, Right, but so if you have an element in the kernel of this k1 here, so basically this is your k3, and you can also write down your causal complex using the classical operators here. So if it's like in the kernel of the k1 here, and also when you pass down, so like you also look at the drummer. Look at the derivative complex, okay. Then it can also be transformed into the divergence, okay. So, if you take the divergence of this vector f bar, and also you consider as not just the in A here, but of course, it's landing in A here, right? But you further affect F by the ideal, it will be zero. Then, this F was here. This F was here, right? And you can actually go back to here, which is also another A3, and write down this. So basically, you can find a G here. All right. So this is called a, if you can do this for all such F, it's called K1 sale. All right, another one is also. Another one is also was the UPH2 weaken, right? So, if you look at these elements in such a way, so basically, what is the pi omega, of course? That's a two vector, right? It's the Poisson bracket. So, basically, what you do is like as a two vector, you take any two elements, maybe A and B, right? I use data, you just put them into the bracket. That's how you calculate it. And for the G. Later. And for the G, of course, you can also do the Jacobian of the A, B, and G with respect to partial derivative X, Y, Z. That's how you define these things. So this set actually is contained in the kernel of the D2. And also, it contains the image of the D1. You want to make sure actually, what means that you, I'm sorry, maybe that's your He, I'm sorry, maybe that should be you. I tapped as I, but my computer died, so I still have time to check. My apology for that. Uh, it just tells you what you don't have anything else other than here. That means the kernel actually is equal to this. That means you don't have anything in between these two. It's actually not a proper subset here. All right, again, just. All right, again, just they called ozone with a Poisson derivation, right? Pd means Poisson derivation, ozone means you kill the center, every element of them. And we called is H ozone. It just tells you every derivation kills the center is given by a Hamiltonian. The good news is what? Why do you want to be Hamiltonian? Because it gives you a nice description of the pH one. Description of the pH one. Just mentioned by Pairs and what does pH one minimal? Of course, pH one is equal to the Poisson derivation modular of the Hamiltonian derivations, right? And what is this E? E is actually a very special Poisson derivation is the Euler derivation. Basically, you take the derivative and then you multiply by the X for each component, then you add them up. Them up. Okay. So E is the Euler derivation. The relationship between these guys is what? The K1 sealed is the strongest. It implies the UVH2 vacant. And UVH2 vacant is equivalent to H ozone. And also, when you know A omega is H, When you know A omega is H o, that means the omega is irreducible. And then, what is balanced? Binance is basically: so when you take the partial derivatives of the omega, you multiply them together, it's non-zero. You want to make sure this, you do this for any generators you choose. So, it's not easy to verify straightforward why it's balanced. But non-biased, that means you can find certain generators of decay A, then when you The K A, then when you do the partial derivative, you multiply them together, you get a zero. So, of course, why the K1 zero implies the A omega is UPH2 vacant and A omega is H ozone equivalently, is actually to put three complexes together. One is the drum complex, which is exact in first place, and also you have the Cozo complex. And also, you have the Cozot complex, which is not exact anymore. And then you also have the Poisson complex, right? Cohomology complex. So you basically, they're all identified with the A and the A direct sum to third endos. So that's why you can put them together to get information. So that's how you prove the K1 seal implies A omega is weakened. Yeah. All right. So basically, that's how we did the verification. Of course, I have to mention one thing is how do you verify the omega is K1 sealed, right? Except those, actually none of them are K1 sealed, most of them. And of course, for the XL. And of course, for the XL plus the YK, right, it's not ozone, then it cannot be K1 sealed. So, what we do that we look at the classification and we can verify most of them are K1 sealed, so therefore they're H ozone and also UPH2 vacant. And for the rest of them, what we can do is we use a new filtration, that means we assign the different degrees so that we can. Degrees so that we can reduce to those K1 single case. But the good thing is, what through the spectral sequence argument is what the H ozone is preserved. So that's how we solve for all the cases except this XK plus the YL situation. All right, so finally, let me just move down to the reference we used for this talk. It's just based on these papers and also some preprints we had. Thank you.
