Yeah, today I will talk about some recent joint work with Jia Ping-Ing and Xinjian Zhou on this some monotonicity for the peak capacitory functions in three manifolds of non-active scalar culture. Okay, so in this conference, in this workshop, we have experienced a lot about A lot about the positive mass theorem, the remaining version. So, here I just make a brief overview of this. So, if you have three manifolds, complete asymptotic flat of decay at some order and non-negative scalar curvature, then the ADM mass is non-negative with rigidity part. That if the mass is zero, then it must be the Then it must be the clean space. And Shunyao used this minimal service method. So, this method holds, as Jin Tianju told us, when you have this, you can handle the singularities in GMT theory. And so, Shungya first did in the dimension 327, and it now is true. uh it now is true at least at least uh for n no more no more than 10. yeah and we can give the spino spinal proof and also recently and which also related to our to my talk is this um re Casaras Curie stand proof and also Virginia Lorenzo and this Oron Sears proof by using harmonic functions. By using harmonic functions. But this proof only for three dimensions. And also another version is remaining panels inequality. If you have manifolds with boundary, here you assume the boundary is the outmost minimal boundary, or we call it Or we call it horizon, then the ADM mass has a sharp lower bound bounded below by some square root of the area over 16 pi. And here the equality holds when the manifold is thrust. And the first proof is due to Huskin-Yamannen in three dimension when the boundary is connected and also you have this second homology, the relative second homology. If second homology is vanishing. And in fact, in their proof, if he has this the following, the ADM mass is bounded below by the Hawking mass if you assume the boundary is outward minimizing. And the Hawking mass is defined in this way. Yeah, and their approach is, as we see in previous talks, so it's about the Hawking mass, the montane of Hawking mass. mass the montonicity of Hawking mass along the weak reformulation of inverse link flow and in three dimensions Bri also gives this proof by the conform metric flow and he proved that the EDM mass is monotonous along this conformal metric flow and his proof has been generalized to higher dimension by Bri and D. And recently And recently, Virginia and Lorenzo and their collaborators reprove, give a new proof of remaining Penrose inequality in three dimensions when still for connected boundary and also this simple topology assumption. And still, the technique is on some monotonicity, but here Some monotonicity, but here it's about monotonicity of quantities about peak Hammond functions. However, I think their proof, in their proof, the rigidity now is still lack of rigidity. Yeah. And let's come back to Brace proof. So, in Brace proof of the monotonicity of ADM mass along conformal metric flow, there Formal metric flow, there is a crucial ingredient in its proof: is this mass to capacity inequality? That is, if you have this asymptotic flag non-negative scalar curvature manifold with horizon boundary, then the ADM mass has the lower bound bounded by below by its capacity. And also, here the rigidity holds when the manifold is rusher, and in fact. And in fact, Ray used this conformal magical flow to convert this inequality to Poisson mass theorem. That is, he used the conclusion of Poisson mass theorem to get this inequality. And here the capacity is just as the information of the difficult energy where you assume when your function is taken to be a Lipschitz function with compressed support and also. compass support and also equals to one on the on the boundary of the mantle okay and later when the boundary is not necessarily a minimum or horizon then and meow improves this brace mass tool capacity inequality in the following way so but here in they need to assume simple topology They need to assume simple topology that the boundary is connected and H2 is zero. And if you assume the Hawking mass is non-negative, then the ratio of mass to capacity is bounded below by this quantity, one minus this Wilmot energy to the power one-half. And here, the equality or the rigidity. The equality or the rigidity holds when this manifold is Schwarz-Schütz outside a sphere. That means if you are given a Schwarz, because in Schwarzman, the boundary of Schwarz is Schwarz-Schüd is the horizon, the minimum. And if you want to find something to control the lower bound of the mass, and if you want to model on this structure outside. This was outside arbitrary runs field, then this is the case. Let's review the proof of Bray Meow. So they use the inverse Minker flow to establish the following upper bound for capacity. That is, the capacity is bounded above by the square root of area. Square root of area and then some quantity involving the h square integral. And then combined with the inequality that the ADM mass is bounded below by the Hawking mass for the outward minimizing hole of sigma. And then combine these two, you will lead to this mass to capacity. To capacity, but with this with this term here. Okay. So this is the strategy of Ray and Meow. And also this is Bennett, Luca and Matthias and Lorenzo. They did this mass to capacity in terms of whiskey as a parametric mass. And also if you And also, if you replace this to be peak capacity, then the similar work, similar approach by using immersion flow was by Shell. Okay, now we look at the recently there are huge amounts of works. Amounts of works on this harmonic monotonicity about harmonic functions and the relation with the mathematical general relativity or scalar curvature problem. So let's make a review. And the first, I think it should be a stance result in clear the I list the year as the year on archive so that we know the real procedure. The real procedure. So Sten in 2019, he gave this Shung Yao's rearrangement argument for 3D harmonic functions. And he reproved this conjecture. And later, BKKS, they reproved this 3D positive mass theorem via harmonic functions. And they use these harmonic functions asymptotic tool. Harmonic functions are sympathetic to a fine function. And AMO, they have they proved the 3D positive mass theorem with Green's function. And also AMMO, sorry, I just briefed this, your name. Yeah, in 3D remaining panels inequality, we are P capacity function. And at the end, they need to let this P goes to one. P e goes to one. As we see in, I think, in Luca's talk, when p equals to one, there is the relation between this p capacitory function with the level set of p capacitory function is looks like or tends to somehow the inverse micro flow. And there is another group, Montana. And there is another group, Montano one, they study this for monotonicity for green about green function. And then they using their monotonicity to prove Gromov's constructor on volume growth of non-native scale coverage three manifolds. And later, their monotonicity has been generalized by Chan Chu Li. Chan to Li Chan but to P green function. And also Chodosh Li has the famous proof of stable Bernstein theorem, the first proof of this stable Bernstein theorem in R4 by using this monotonicity of harmonic functions in three manifolds. And Meow and Orenzo, they use So they using this two capacitor function and to approve mass to capacity inequality. And here is Sven Meow Hem. They studied the similar thing for p capacitory function and they reproved this ADM to Hawking mass inequality by using P capacitor function. By using a p-capacitory function. Yeah, this is somehow an overview of the role of harmonic or p-harmonic functions in this scalar curvature problem. But all of this proof, I think, now works in three-dimensional manifolds. Yeah, this is now we turn to this Maus monotonous. Maus monotonously about two capacitory functions. So, if still you have this AF and sorry, it's non-active scalar curvature, and you have simple topology, the boundary is connected. And then, if you assume if you have this capacitor function u, then you have the following inequality. Inequality. So it's the inequality involved the integral over the boundary of the function mean curvature times the gradient, the norm of gradient, and also the integration over boundary of the gradient u square. And the first one involves no mass, and the second one involves this mass. Involves this mass to capacity ratio. And this two inequality has rigidity when the manifold is asked in the acclaimed space over round sphere or round ball. And later, Meow promoted this tool inequality to be in the following way. So if you have any So, if you have any positive L, and then you have this very similar inequality as before. So here you see, in fact, the rigidity is somehow different. So, here, manifold can be schwa, can hold the equality holds when M is Schwarzschild manifold over. Manifold over outside round sphere. Okay, here there's the parameter L in fact reflects the radius of the round sphere. Okay, here you see the R0 is just given by M over 2 times L minus 1. Okay, this is where why you have this pyramid. That means for each That means for each structured manifold over a round sphere with some particular radius, then you have one kind of two kinds of inequality with particular parameter L, okay, particular number L, which depends on this radius R0. Yeah, the Schwarzschild manifold is in this way. I just write it as the topology is just R. The topology is just R3 over a ball with reduced R0, and this is the Schwarzschild metric GM. So you can, by just using a very simple holder skin equality, you will get from these two inequalities the following, which is the Raymeus mass to capacity ratio is bounded. To capacity ratio is bounded below by this quantity. Okay, this is just a simple holder inequality. But here, you see, in fact, in this approach, there is no assumption, which is emphasized by Meo's paper. You do not need to assume Hawking mass is non-negative. But by using the inverse mink flow, as we see, Inverse mink flow, as we see in the pre-mails proof, then he needs to use the mass to hook mass. The ADM mass is bounded below by the Hawking mass, which needs this assumption, Hawking mass non-negative. Okay, so how this monotony works? In fact, how does this in fact this inequality holds? Inequality holds follows from monotonicity. Yeah, so along the level set of this capacitory function, then in fact you can derive this quantity is monotone. Yeah, so this one somehow, this one is called local monotonicity quantity. So this one. So, is this one? And this will decrease to zero. That's when you're using the asymptotical behavior, then you will get zero. And this will give you the first inequality. And then by using this monotonicity and also by using the asymptotic behavior, then you will get the second one. That is this quantity and also this quantity. quantity and also this quantity will increase and when you compute its asymptotic behavior then you will see the mass to capacity ratio so this one is called non-local in mel's paper yeah and here we always meow always assume this simple topology simple topology because in the technically you by using this model by we need to use the Gaussian Bonnet for this three-dimensional problem and for this you need the the all level set is connected for and and also by the by buying this you know the the polar characteristic is bounded Is bounded above by two. Yeah. Okay. So, how this is you can get from this the first two inequality here. Okay. And how to get this two inequality, which has rigidity on the threshold? In fact, In fact, this is given by brace observation. So that is, if we think the Schwarzschild method, we know that it is conformal flat to Euclid by this factor. And in fact, this factor has the property that if you do the inverse of this one plus m over two r, then this. R, then this one, this function is in fact harmonic with respect to the Schwashian metric. And Brie has the following observation. So if you have three manifolds and you have a capacitor function, and if you have another positive function v, and v tends to zero one at infinity, then you make a conformal change of the previous. Conformal change of the previous metric origin metric by weight power 4, you get g bar. This g bar, again, it is asymptotic flat and non-negative scale curvature. And also, by this capacity function, you multiply this u by v to the power minus one, then again you will get a new harmonic function, but here with respect to the new metric here. To the new metric here. And now, this new function will again tends to one. And also, if you have a boundary, then this on boundaries vanishes. And that means you will get by this conformal change, then you will get a new harmonic function on this new metric. So the previous inequality can be applied to this new metric and. This new metric and also this new function, harmonic function. And then we transform to the origin metric and original harmonic capacity function. Then you just choosing some V here. So just choosing a new harmonic function V here, then you will see that the original two inequality, these two inequalities. Uh, these two inequalities will transfer to this one, yeah, by this conformal change. Okay, so then how about P capacity? So the P capacity, of course, the definition is you just replace the direct energy to this P diricular energy. And the informal is achieved by Ajax. Achieved by I just write as one minus u, where you to to let to ensure that the on the boundary it is when it vanishes and it tends to one at infinity and it relates to this p-harmonic function. And note that the p capacity will as limit as the area of the boundary when p goes to one when the boundary is uh when the boundary is uh when the boundary is out minimizing this is a factor given by uh mattier and lorenzo yeah so as i uh mentioned before the new proof of remaining parasitine equality by uh ammo and also this new proof of the admin bounded below by faulking mass by hirch Piers Miao Tem. And in fact, their idea is to find a monotone quantity along level set flow of p capacitory function. And this is the quantity they found. And here there's some because now he they reparametrized this level set of. This level set of u. I mean, the value of the value t of the level set of u, so that t belongs to this some bound tp to infinity. And here, this alpha p or c p some functions are just omit this, and they have found some one monotone quantity, which this one is monotone increasing. Is more increasing, and when you connect it, can connect the boundary of M and the infinity, you will see that at one end, at the boundary, you see the capacity, P capacity. And at the end, you see the ADM mass. And this gives you this. Of course, when P goes to one, providing the outward minimizing, then you will get the remaining penals. The remaining panels, the mass will be bounded below by the square root of the area. Of course, here there is a dedicated issue is that because the lack of regularity for p-harmonic function, one need to it's not really just a derivative, you need to approximation argument to say that this one is regular along each level, a regular level set of. level a regular level set of p-harmonic functions okay yeah and uh here's Meow Tem generates Meow's monotonicity to p capacitor function but in this works this kind of monotonicity are all modeled on R3 over minus a ball okay so for general So, for general p. And as I mentioned in p equals to two case, there is a conformal correspondence of this to the inequality modeled on Euclidian space or modeled on Shua Shu. But for general P, there's no such conformal correspondence. So now we cannot directly transfer this inequality model. This inequality model on Euclidean space to that on this on this Swashian method. So the question is how we get the monotonicity for p-harmonic function or p-capacitor function model or Shua Shu. So the previous work of Miao and Orenso is for P equals to 2. So here is our result. So the P Up so the p the for we first make a quick review of this p capacitive function is a p harmonic function which goes to one at infinity and vanishes on the boundary. And previous work shows that you has the following asymptotic expansion. So here you have this at the first order is r to the power minus is r to the power minus a where a is this special uh special exponent uh related to p and also here is the the the coefficient is uh is given by the p capacity function with some power okay and we first look at the peak capacity function in schwash model so because it's So, because it's rotation is metric, so we can solve it directly by ODE, right? So, this peak capacitor function is given by a radial function f. And by solving the ODE, you will see that f is in fact given in this way. So it's just the integral of this one variable function. So, when p equals to 2, and now p equals to 2 and now a equals to 1. So, okay, so here I can I can reformulate this integral as this function ia. So this ia when yeah when for example when k is infinity and this one is in fact the peso function. Okay, it's a peso function. In general in general for general For general k and general a, it is just you cannot have an explicit form for this integral. But when p equals to 2, yeah, you can see a is 1 and then this is just 1 plus s to the power minus 2. So this one can be integration to get explicit way. So that because here the Here, the peak capacity and also here, this modified peak capacity. This is just some power. Yeah, all of this is in P n equals to three. Yeah. So this parameter M and the let me just say this is P capacity. This see this is p capacity, and they are related in this way by this somehow implicit in an implicit way. And when p equals to two, yeah, since becomes simple, the two capacity is given by r0 plus m over two. And also the function f is also just this one minus c two over r plus m over two. M over 2. It's quite simple. And in another way, in another direction, so when m is zero, that is in you model the in Euclidian space over a ball. Then you can also solve this out that F R is just one minus some constant R to the power minus A. That is for okay, in case you. So, okay, then case you can solve for NAP to be this way. In general, it should be in this way. Okay, you have no idea. You cannot so integrate into algebraic function. Okay, and we compute the level set, the mean curvature of the level set. So this can be. Set. So this can be computed in this way. So it has a good formula. And the importance here is this mean curvature over grading U norm. And if you compute it, you have this quantity here, this one variable function here. So we denote this one as beta r. Eta R, okay, as eta R. And this will play an important role in the monotonicity. This eta R. Okay, and this is our result. So if you again you have three manifolds complete, asymptotical flat and a non-negative scalar curvature. Non-negative scalar curvature. And the boundary is connected, and the simple second relative homology vanishes. And U is a p-capacity function. And we have here we have an ODE, and we have a parameter K lies in minus one to one. And we have we denote M to be this one. M to be this one. Here, here Cp is just the peak capacity of M to the power one minus P minus one. This is our CP, this one. Okay. And for any for any K, given parameter K, we denote M in this way, and we denote R zero to be M over 2k. zero to be m over 2k okay when k equals to zero yeah this this is n standard in limit way but in fact when k is zero m is zero and all things reduce to the eucalyptian case so we just write this way and uh we found we we want to solve uh uh ode system in this way so we have In this way, so we have three one variable functions, alpha, beta, gamma. So here, f is f is the one variable function given by the capacity, key capacity function here. Okay, this is this one variable function, and also eta is this one variable function on r. Okay, this is the function. This is the function eta and f, and that means the coefficient here are all null. Okay. And we so this the first ODE is alpha prime minus something alpha minus something beta equal to zero. And the second is beta prime plus something alpha equals zero. So combine these two, you know you have a second order ODE on alpha, right? And in fact, this is. And in fact, this is just you we need to solve this second order ODE on alpha. And this the third one is just the ODE on gamma. So when you have alpha, of course, you can solve out gamma. And we assume this alpha t is always non-negative. And then you will have this quantity, which is we prove, which is montal non-. We prove which is monton now increasing for regular values. That is here, sigma t, the level set we're choosing is the level set on the level at level ft for regular value f. And you look at this ft is just you modify the coefficient of this three term which appears. Term which appears in no matter AMMO's quantity or MOOC quantity. Yeah, Huge Meow Temps quantity. Then we just arbitrarily written as alpha beta gamma t. And then we, when alpha beta gamma satisfies this ODE, This ODE. Small f. Small f is just the one-volume function, which represents the p-capacity function in Schwarzhun manifold outside a given ball. Okay, then, yeah. Okay, then yeah, under this uh assumption here and also the non-native of alpha, we will see that f is mono-non-creasing. And also the rigidity holds that when f is a constant, if and only if the manifold is what we want, that is Schwarzschild manifold over minus a round ball. Okay, and the round ball. Okay, and the round ball has radius r0, and this one was pre given a priori that is depending on this parameter k. And there's a similar work, simultaneously with us is given by Batsuroviski and Yao, but in their work they only consider k equals to one. I will explain what is k equals to one case. Yeah. Yeah, when k equals to zero, as I said, m is zero. That will reduce to Euclidean space, Euclidean case. Then this, because now, let's see here, the F is in fact just a power function. Okay, some power function. So then you can solve this. Can you solve this the solution to be this so alpha t will give in by t to the power a plus one so here is just the two constant because you have a second order ODE of course you have two arbitrary constants here and also you can solve beta out gamma which is all power functions combination of power functions Power functions. This is for k equals to zero case. Okay, now let's see what's the relation between our quantity with the previous one. So here, just the k equal to zero case. Of course, for general k, we have this quantity. Okay. For general k, I just because the formula is too complicated. Too complicated, I did not write it down, but we still will have this FT, and then we choose when we choose C2 equals to, yeah, okay, let me see. So this is just we choose this from this here, we choose this C2 and C1 because for no matter EMMO's quantity, monotone quantity or HML terms. Or HML terms quantity, this two based is modeled on the Aquinas space. So that is the k equals to zero case. Yeah, so when we choose the c2 is some constant given by the inverse of peak density and c1 is zero, then the function will reduce to ammo mount quality. And also when we choose It and also when we choose C2 vanishes and C1 is this one, then it reduces to huge meow temps monitor quality. And also these two monitor quality are constant if and only if the manifold is based on the model on the R3 over a minus a ball. And for P And for p equals to 2, yeah, for p equals to 2, then you can also have this alpha beta gamma being explicitly given and so that this quantity reduced to Maus quantity, monitoring quantity. Here we use a more direct method. We're just zooming out all the possibility of. The possibility of quantity, uh, Montana quantity. Let's see, oh, this is, yeah, this is the complete, the most complicated form of alpha beta gamma. In fact, here, when k is in this interval, and we still denote m in this way, then alpha beta gamma can be given by some. Some explicit power of t fun power function, and also here you have this eta. Eta is quantity given by here, this one. Okay. That means although it's complicated, we can solve the second. We can solve the second order ODE on alpha out as in this way. And also beta, gamma. When you have alpha, of course, beta and gamma can be given. So this is the most the most complicated formula for these three functions. And you have two parameters, C1, C2. And notice that we have. Notes that we have a crucial condition that alpha is non-negative. And this one holds if and only if we can characterize when alpha t is non-negative. The answer is that when it is equivalent to the non-negative of C2 and also this one. And in particular, when you are in the case R0, you want to be. R0, you want to be m over two. That is, you like you have a horizon boundary. Then this is simple. That is non-negative of alpha is equivalent to non-negative of C2 and non-positive of C1. Yeah, okay. So we just write down the k equals to one case. Okay, so uh Okay, so in this case, when you using our monotonicity and you connect the boundary of M and the infinity, and you will have these two inequalities. So the first one involving some IA1. In fact, this IA1 is just can be rewritten as BESA function. You have these two inequalities. So this inequality. Inequality. So, this inequality this two equality when p equals two is just a Mel's result. Okay, and for general k minus one to one, yeah, we have more complicated inequality for which equality holds when the manifold is equal, is isometric to the Schwarzschild manifold outside a round ball with given. A round ball with a given radius. Okay, so as I said before, in Maus paper, so these two inequality will lead to the mass to mass to capacity in quote bree and mouse mass to bree sorry mass to capacity inequalities. Inequalities with this with the help of these two inequalities. Similarly, with the help of these two, we have the following mass to p capacity inequality in this way. So assume we still have a parameter lying minus one to one, and this k is determined by the one minus one. The one minus one over 16π of the integral of h squared. Okay, so this when the forking mass is non-negative, then that means k is positive. Okay, so now k can be negative because this quantity can be negative. And when I will choose this k to be depending. be depending on the h square integral in this way. And then we will have the following inequality. The ADM mass will bound it below by the p capacity, the quantity related to pea capacity. And also the square root of the area is bounded below by the quantity related to p capacity. Quantity related to p capacity. And moreover, equality holds if and only if when k is non-zero, then this gives you the gives you the Schwarzschild over minus a given radius ball. And when k equals to zero, then you will have this Euclidean space over minus any given ball. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let me make a few comments. When p equals two, it reduces to three mel and meows mass to capacity and also this quantity, the mean curvature integral square integral quantity. And yeah, for as I mentioned, for other p Shall previously obtained these two inequalities by using Meus, a brain meal approach on inverse linked flow. But for that approach, they need to assume the Hockey Mass non-negative. And here we get this without the the the assumption on non-negative forking. Assumption on non-negative forking mass by using this P capacitor, the montonicity about the P capacitory function. Yeah, but in the last few slides, I just show you how this monotonicity comes. Yeah, let's think in the simplest way. In the simplest way, case that all the levels that are regular, that is, green you is vanishing. And we just giving a form of F and then we take derivative, you will have this, this is derivative on the parameter alpha, beta, gamma. And this, this one, this two line is just you take, you have the variational formula for this term. Formula for this term for this quantity and this quantity. This is previously all this paper I list above on using the montonicity for harmonic functions will have. Okay, so you will have this by this stance. In fact, it's backs dating back to showing also the arrange argument for Bochner technique. For Bochner technique for non-negative scale curvature problem. Okay, so you have this variational formula for this one. And then we need to square out one term here. So in previous work, usually this term is all in no matter AMMO's work or Huge Meow Tem's work, this part. temps work this part this this uh red part is uh in uh here they use not eta but some but some particular quantity which works which is equal which is zero when it is uh Euclidean space okay so here we just using we can square this thing by some each By some eta, and eta. What is eta here? Let's review eta. ETA is exactly exactly the quantity or the one variable function of h over two how two times gradient u squared. Okay, when it is really a Schwarzschild metric. Okay, this tells us. Okay, this tells us that if you can square this in this way, if you can square in this way, then at least for Schwarzschild manifold, this one vanishes. Now, of course, when you square in this way, then you have so many remaining terms. Then we write down the remaining term in this way. So then it will evolve this eta. Eta okay, any case we have these two terms, so but this for these two terms, of course, you have no information, so we're just letting the coefficient to be zero, and this gives you the ODE, okay. And from this ODE, you have these two line vanishes, and also this one, of course, is when you assume f prime is when you assume. f prime is positive is non-negative and also when you assume alpha is non-negative this one is non-negative okay and also the other term you can you can yeah you can you can have the sign what you want so another thing is that you want to the the last The last two lines vanishes, and you want to sum up the first three things because here you have another thing is that you need to take care of the integral of the Gaussian curvature, which you will use the Gaussian. So you need to have the same coefficient here. So that's the reason we have this other one, which relates to gamma and alpha. And alpha. Okay. So then when you have ODE, then you will have the derivative of F given, you can write in this way. Now, of course, when you have non-negative scale curvature, then the first one is positive and non-negative. And the second one, sorry, it is integral here. And also the second one is positive. And the third one, because you have connected. third one because you have connect for each level that you have connected uh level set so then this one will be less or equal to four pi so this one is also positive non-negative and because gamma prime is given in this way so when you assume alpha is non-negative then you have this gamma prime is not non-positive so then this f is uh non-positive. Non-positive. So F is non-inclusive in this. So the idea is just we keep this thing and we add some, we keep this either here and we leave the other thing to be zero. And then we will get ODE. Okay. Now, of course, to overcome the lack of regularity for. The lack of regularity for p-capacity function, we need to use the approximation argument by AMMO and also ish-meow 10. And when we have the monotonicity, we need to care about the asymptotic behavior. And this is also when, in fact, this for each because here. For each, because here you see the for the quantity F yeah, in fact, the sympathetic flare behavior of this geometric quantity has been already done by AMMO and also HTML. And we only need to care about the asymptotic behavior of this coefficient alphabet. This coefficient alpha beta gamma. And by this explicit expression, then we need to compute the asymptotic behavior. And at last, we have the following thing. That is, when p goes to infinity or to the boundary, to the infinity, then we connect with the ADM. With the ADMS. And this is another, when we assume C2 is positive, then we have some non-trivial thing that is or some ADM mass. And when we choose C2 is zero, then the limit is just zero. This, in fact, when we're choosing one family, we have two kinds of choice. Two kinds of choice. Yeah. So then we have this two inequality. Yeah. This is the way how we get the inequality at the end. Yeah. Okay. I think I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention.
