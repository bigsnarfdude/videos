Okay, so the title is as stated, the generalized Resengro-Switten tau function and supervolumes and this is joint with With Sasha Alexandra. Okay, so what I will start listing the usual suspects like the Savage-Witten tau function that are related to the moduli space of curves is I want to set up a new Because I want to set up a new one. That's the aim of today. And I will describe in order to set up such a relation, I'll need to define first the moduli space of stable spin curves. And part of this idea, so what I'll be showing is that a spin structure has different behavior at punctures, two types of behaviors, a Raman. Punctures, two types of behaviors, Ramond and Neva-Schwartz. And so one of the ideas we'll be using here is a gas of Ramond points. And what that will simply mean is we'll allow any number of Ramond points and we'll keep track of our never-Schwartz points with labels. And then I'll describe consequences of a KDV tau function related to. function related to the moduli space and recursions between, I'll call them super volumes, but what I mean by this is volumes of the moduli space of super curves, which I'll hardly define, but I'll define a little bit. Okay, so quarter degrees tau functions. Okay, so the Okay, so we've had this equation written up. I'm using D used and S squared, where I'm using an H bar, and I'm using a T0 instead of X, and with some initial condition. This is the KDV equation, and then the hierarchy will have. The hierarchy will have a further set of equations greater than 1. And this initial condition, as D described more generally, and these equations will uniquely determine our solution. So, an example of a solution. Is the Kensevich-Witten tau function, and this is famously related to the moduli space of intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable curves over all n2. N tuples of non-negative integers so these size live in the second cohomology their first churn classes of tautological bundle line bundles I won't be using Bundle line bundles. I won't be using them enough to do more of a definition than that. Yes. Okay. And so then the KDV hierarchy gives recursive relations between these intersection numbers. So this here is something. Is something that we might want to know about. In fact, they weren't known about before Witten conjectured this. They weren't known completely. And so these equations here will give recursions that allow you to uniquely determine all of these from an initial condition, which is M03 bar of, well, nothing, just the size to zero power. The size to zero power equaling one. This and this will uniquely determine those. Okay, so the next Yes, and I didn't say that. Thanks. And so thank you. So and U is d squared, dt zero squared of z of log of z, yeah. And so then these PDEs applied to this will give us these recursion. Thanks. So the next is Judah Alexandrov. I'm going to give it the same name as Resengross Witten. It's the generalized, so there's a parameter. So this has an infinite set of Infinite set of times and an h bar. This now has an extra parameterized. So this is the, let me give it the name, the generalized Resengross-Witten tau function. And the aim today is to define it in this way, but I can't yet. So I'll give it a definition because that's what I'm aiming to prove. And so it's the unique tau form. Tau function that satisfies also this equation where this right-hand side is giving a genus zero and genus one initial condition. So. So the aim today is to give some type of intersection theoretic version of this. And so let me give a result that's due to Jinambaram Yarsia Falder. And Jacqueto, the chair of today of this talk now. And so in the s equals zero case, when s is equal to zero, there's a relation between these and intersection numbers. G N K again, and so it looks much like I wrote there, say psi ki T chi T K I and now there are some cohomology classes which I'll define later in the lecture. Later in the lecture. And so, again, today I want to describe what happens when S is switched on. And my motivation for this is to understand something about volumes of the modulized space of super Riemann surfaces, which I will get to later. So one motivation could be just coming up with a geometric interpretation. Be just coming up with a geometric interpretation of this generalized Bresn-Gross-Witten, but my motivation went further. And so the theorem, this is now let me before I rise. Let me, before I write it, say that g equals zero is written and g greater than zero writing. So we're confident nothing will go wrong, but it's actually that's the facts. It's rock solid for genes zero. So I won't be saying much. I won't be saying much so far because I won't have defined the terms yet. The cohomology class, but let me just write it out at least. Okay, so there's this is a one to the n, zero to the m. So these are these classes live in the again cohomology rational cohomology of the moduli space of stable curves. Space of stable curves, and they'll be defined using spin structures. And the one and the zero is going to be talking about the two different types of behavior of spin structure. Ramond is the zero, and one is the Neva-Schwartz. And one of the ideas here, I still need to define this, but one of the ideas here is that we're only making insertions at the Ramond points. We're not making insertions at the, sorry, the never Schwartz points, not at the Sorry, they have a Schwartz points, not at the Ramond points. And then this in factorial is really saying that we're not even labeling the Ramond points. And so this is what this notion of gas of Ramons is. And then a corollary, which will be given in proper detail later, so there's hardly any detail here. Is that the volumes The volumes of the moduli spaces of super Raymond surfaces satisfy an explicit recursion. I'll write much of that recursion later. Later, that recursion is due to Stanford and Witten, and for the S equals zero case, and it ends up we'll see that the same recursion works for the when we switch on Ramont. So I had seen lectures by such Alexander for some years where he had this generalized resingross width and he wanted some geometry that goes behind it. And I thought, well, yeah, sure, he does. Behind it, and I thought, well, yeah, sure, he does, and that's interesting, but I never really paid attention to it. And then I was giving a lecture saying that I need some integrable structure behind this in order to do something about volumes. And he approached and he said he thinks it's the answer to his question and my question is the case, and indeed it is. Okay, so the moduli space of spin curves. So I'm giving an algebra geometric description today only. One thing that's rather pretty about this story is that there's the Simpson Hitchen systems related here, so that we can look at this from a differential geometric perspective and via the character. And it's via the character variety and representations into SL2R for spin structures or OSP12 for super Riemann surfaces. But we can also handle it with algebraic geometry, and that's what I'll be doing today. But it's rather beautiful that it has these dual stories. Okay, so the moduli space of spin curves is given by this information. Given by this information, where I'll say what each of these is. So this is a twisted, actually I'll use the word orbifold, it's probably more famous, but it's also known as a twisted curve, an orbifold curve where all of the labeled points in the nodes have this. Points in the nodes have the Z2 isotropy. This is these two, theta and omega C log, these are line bundles, all before fold line bundles. So they're sheaves, but they're locally free. So this is the spin structure is this isomorphism phi and theta, or the isomorphism phi with the square of theta with omega c log, and we have these labeled points. And we have these labeled points. So, orbifold stable. So, it's a nodal curve, and it has some orbifold structure. Okay, the degree of theta is equal to g minus 1 plus half n, which is a half integer. Since we're working on an orbifold, We're working on an orbifold, you can have half-integer points and half-integer degree. And since, again, we're working on an orbifold, this Lyme bundle theta defines a representation from Z2 to, well, let's say sigma i from z2 to z2 at each pi. An orbifold bundle is you think of it on the double cover. It's locally, the isotropy is Z2. So now you go to the double cover and you have an equivariant trivialization. An equivariant trivialization at the fixed point will give you a representation. And so when the representation is trivial, Is trivial. We say that it's a Ramond point and we write sigma i equals zero giving the image of the generator. So we just denote the trivial representation by zero and it's non-trivial. Corresponds to Never Schwartz, and then we write sigma i is equal to one. Oops. Yes, that's what I mean. Sigma i is equal to one, the image of the generator. Okay, and another way to think about these spin structures is on the moduli space of curves, you have a forgetful map where you can forget the point Pn plus. forget the point Pn plus one and it's a map from Mgn plus one Mgn plus one bar to Mgn bar for spin structures you don't have this forgetful map except at never Schwartz points so the point is you've got something that you call a spin structure the square root and now you forget this point does it extend or not and so the never Schwartz you can forget And the remond, it doesn't make sense to forget. So, soon I will describe the idea of Chinambaram, Garcia Falda, and Jaketo, where they forgot the Ramond points. So, this is something that one can't do. And for me, this was a big idea. But for the moment, what does this give for us? This gives components. Gives components of the moduli space of stable spin curves. So we now have, I could say connected components. They're all connected except for one of them. This is equal to the union sigma and 0, 1 to the n of m. Of mg. We'll label it with a sigma. And we also have the number of Ramons is even. So this can be proven in a number of ways. If somebody wants to know, I'll say it. Otherwise, I'll just say it's a fact. So that means that we're looking at not 2 to the n. Here, we're looking at 2 to the n minus 1, only half. At 2 to the n minus 1, only half of our tuples here. Okay, so now using the moduli space of spin curves, the idea is to now get a natural cohomology collection of cohomology classes that will be top term classes of natural bundle and to push this forward to the moduli space. So let me describe a bundle. So over each curve, I want to Over each curve, I want to take the dual of the square root of the. Sorry, I didn't say more about this. Let me just come back to this. This is the log canonical bundle. So the log canonical bundle is omega C twisted by this divisor. This divisor is living on a spin, on an orbifold curve, but one can always push forward to the curve, the For some reason, I'm just blanked on the when I forget my orbifold structure, and the log canonical pushes to the log canonical. So it is much like the log canonical we know. Okay, and so we take the square root of this log canonical, and that of course contributed to the degree, and take the first cohomology, and this defines a bundle. This is the more pedestrian way of describing it. It's a derived push forward, but this will do. It's a vector bundle because one can show that H0 vanishes. So this defines a bundle of, I'll give the rank in a moment. Let me just, well, let me define. Um, well, let me define EG sigma is the restriction of EGN to a connected component. And then I have that the rank of EG sigma is equal to 2g minus 2 plus 2. 2g minus 2 plus half n plus sigma modula, the size of sigma. So it's counting the number of Nebraska points here. And I've said the number of Ramons is even, so this will show that this rank is an integer. Okay, just one comment. This bundle here is, again, I'm not going to be doing too much. I will do a little bit on the moduli space. Much, I will do a little bit on the moduli space of super RIM and surfaces. But given a super manifold, it has its reduced space. And the moduli space of, I guess I need to put in a moduli space of super stable curves, say. It has the reduced space of the moduli space of, so first of all, I'll be defining a little. So, first of all, I'll be defining a little bit a super Riemann surface. Its moduli space is a super manifold itself. It has a reduced space. Its reduced space is this space. And then the normal bundle of this embedding is given by this bundle here. So what that tells us is perhaps from physics that using this bundle here for some geometric construction might have some consequences, some good consequences. Some good consequences, and it ends up that it will, for example, recursions between the modules, the volumes. Right, so So the way we can think of an orbifold point is that this is where we're living. This lives inside our orbifold curve. And now I'm thinking of this local cover. And so then now when I think about a bundle, usually a bundle, I think it's locally trivial over a disk. In this case, instead of it being locally trivial, it's locally trivial upstairs. Trivial, it's locally trivial upstairs on this disk, and then I have an equivariant trivialization. By that, I mean I have a Z2 action upstairs, and my trivialization is going to, it's going to map from, for example, this point here. The Z2 action will map to this point here, but because I have a trivialization, I can ask for this to commute with the Z2 action. Yes, punch. Yes. Punches and nodes correspond to all before points. Okay, so then you're okay with. So then at this point here, I've got a representation. Okay. And the word I was missing before was coarse, the map to the coarse curve. You can forget the orbifold structure. Can help you with things like proving the number of Ramons is even. Oh, so the dimension of this, I haven't defined what this means, is 3g minus 3 plus n, 2g minus 2 plus n. So one way we can think of a supermanifold is via a bundle over that manifold. Really, a supermanifold is a sheaf, local ring of a function. So we're going to actually take sections of the wedge product of the bundle. Wedge product of the bundle, but in any case, at least the 3G minus 3 plus n is that dimension, and the 2g minus what I've just said is not correct. I just gave you the Never Schwartz one. There are different components. So given that there are different dimensions, yeah. So this is that dimension, this is that. Okay, and so. Okay, and so over here, I have some class that I'm wanting to introduce. So here it is now, the definition. So this sigma lives in 0, 1 to then. And this is just a number that I'll write down in a moment. Let me see, where have I got this? Where can I write this? There's a map from this space. This space here to the moduli space of curves, we'll call it P, which forgets the spin structure. So I want to push forward under this map of the top Euler class of this bundle, which I'm calling Eg sigma, where this is just a convenient normalization. It goes all the way back to underlying the volumes that I will get to, the usual volumes. Mr. Carney has dealt with those, and Walport has, and this normalization is going to make this compare favorably. And so, this is an element of this cohomology plus n plus sigma of mg n bar. Mg N bar rational. And so it's this here that is this term circled in orange there, where that sigma is this tuple in that case of ones followed by zeros. And the Never-Schwartz case, that's where sigma is equal to. Sigma is equal to only n's. This is the definition of these classes, which appeared. These are the classes in this theorem due to Chirumbara, Garcia-Folder, Jacqueto. And in that case, we don't need spin structures. These are characterized by The following properties that the pullback under, so gamma is a stable curve. If I have inside the moduli space of stable curves, I have, for example, just a single node will be a graph corresponding to a graph with two vertices. With two vertices and one edge, under this, the pullback of these classes, the tensor product of the classes there, and one other relation under the pullback map. And so given just these two properties and the fact that they're non-trivial. And the fact that they're non-trivial. So the zero class also satisfies this. So if it's not zero, then this uniquely characterizes these without speaking of spin structures. And so in particular, it characterizes all of these intersection numbers. And that was not the way through to that proof, but it does build the Bresngross-Witten tau function. Just from this data. Okay, so I'd like to now prove this theorem or describe the ingredients in the proof. So what I need is I need an intermediate tau function again. And so let me So, maybe I'll describe what I'm about to do to make it clear. So, what we have so far is we have this theorem. We have omega g n plus. So, this is geometry. And we have this Z B G W, and this is some. And this is some integrable. Well, it's a tau function, but it's from integrable systems. This is from geometry. And we're trying to relate these. And so in between, we're going to take some, I think I'll use the terminologies. Okay, yes, I do. So where these Where these cohomology classes, so I'm about to, rational cohomology classes, I'm about to describe this part, this intermediate tau function that's going to help to get us towards the proof of the theorem. Okay, so define these polynomials, K M. K M that they live in this cohomology and they're polynomials in kappa classes. So they're rational cohomology classes, polynomials in kappa i. So kappa classes are another collection of tautological classes in the moduli space. The moduli space of curves and define these as follows. So this polynomial, which has as its coefficients these classes, is given by the exponential of Sigma i kappa i t to the i. So this lives in the cohomology where the sigma i's are defined are rational numbers defined as follows. Where so sigma i. Oh, am I using some sigmas? I'm already using sigmas. So let me just change what I just said there. I already changed them from SIs because I didn't like it. So PI, where these PIs are rational numbers defined by the By the pi t to the i, this for i greater than zero, is equal to this explicit expression. So, this uniquely determines the PI, and this gives the definition of these. Definition of these kappa polynomials. Am I bending the boards? Okay, and so the theorem, A theorem, Trudeau Kazaria and me in 2021 is that this object. Object, which is a tau function of the case, so I probably should write that in the statement of this. It's not in my notes, but let me just define it. The exponential of g n k, well, I shouldn't have to copy this is the same story in all of these. S to the 4g minus 4 plus 2n. 4 plus 2n, I guess I'll put the k here integral of these k polynomials. I want to put in a set t to be s to the negative 2 product i equals 1, the same that'll be. I equals one, the same that I've been doing. So the theorem is that this is regular in S and it's a KDV tail function. That sounds, I mean, this is significant, it relies on. Significant, it relies on say Mannon's Ograph that's existed for a while. Being regular in S is what I want to use. So this, to be regular in S, what this says is that these polynomials here, eventually they're going to be this power here. The power here is giving the degree of the term. I've got the coefficient of t to the i is maybe this. Is maybe this isn't clear, but the degree of Km is equal to M and so when I have a degree m term, I've made it so that it has a negative 2m power. Eventually, that will give me negative powers of s. And what this theorem is stating is that these These vanish next to psi classes. A consequence of the work of Chittembaram, Gassia Felda, and Chakero is the classes themselves vanish. So it gives relations, polynomial relations amongst kappa classes. This is a numerical result. And so now I'm about to write up a theorem of those three authors. Three authors I've written their names already, I'll spare myself. This is Chinambara, Garcia Falder, and Jacqueto. In 2022, I guess I didn't date, they did early. They did earlier, and that is that the push forward m times of this class, 1 to the n, 0 to the m, there are n, never schwarts, m Ramon, so we're going to forget those points, is equal to this class here. Here plus n minus half m. This is a polynomial in the kappa classes. So in particular, when m is equal to zero, we get that the push forward, this is, so when m is equal to zero, this is how we defined these theta classes. And so the push forward of these classes gives these. So this, for example, gives what I just said, some relations, polynomial relations amongst the kappa class. I want to put a light bulb. For me, this was quite an idea to what's happening here is you're forgetting the Ramond points. And this is, I think, a non-obvious idea because you can't forget Ramond points. Only Nevo Schwartz. Points. Only Never Schwartz spin structures can be forgotten. So, the way they did this is that you push forward to the moduli space of curves and then you can forget any point. This might sound significant, but the reason it's significant is let's just forget never Schwartz points. Or just for the modulized space of curves, just start taking a cloud of extra points where you don't put psi-class assertions and start forgetting them. It ends up you won't get something new because we have structure. We have things like string and dilettant equations. We have things like string and dilettant equations. In this case, we have structure in the presence of never-Schwarz points. So, forgetting never Schwartz points will give you nothing new. Forgetting Ramon points, well, who knows what happens? And what happened here that's significant is the relationship between these classes coming from this spin structure and these classes with nothing to do with spin structure, but also kappa polynomials in kappa classes are well understood. Classes are well understood. So this helps us to be on the way, on our way. And so now let me this theorem here. Right, so you can't, well, actually, let me answer you with this theorem, okay? So good question, but Again, this is g equals zero, and then the g greater than zero, it's just not written, but it's understood. The g equals zero is written down. That this same object here, oh, oops. No, I'm writing a different result than I thought. I'm writing a different result than I thought I was writing. So, let me answer your question. So, you try to push forward these classes when the psi classes are there, and that's merely the challenge. So, they know how to push forward these classes without psi classes. So, now you can push forward these classes next to any pullbacks, but now push forward these classes next to some just general classes. So, that's the statement that I might be, indeed, I. Indeed, I will say. So let me just do this in yellow. So this is Alexandra and me, that if we put the product of psi i to the mi there, then this is going to equal something where what I'm going to put here is the product of the cheat. Let me cheat. Yeah, so I need to put next to this the product: what is it? I equals one to mi psi i to the mi where this polynomial is defined to be the sum. The sum j equals 0 to the m x to the m minus j on 2 to the j factorial. So pushing forward next to some classes, one needs just to work out how to do that. Oh, and I've still written it incorrectly, so don't put that there. I'll do this theorem later, it seems. No, this is. Theorem later, it seems. No, this is next to the class K. So you take K times this. There's lots of different degrees here now, so there's lots of different degrees here. So this push forward involves a single polynomial in the kappa classes. This involves every one of those polynomials in the kappa classes and a whole lot of psi classes. Okay, so, but look, maybe that's a detail. The point is, you need to know how to push. The point is, you need to know how to push this forward. Okay, and so now this is the theorem that. Yes, and that's crucial. So putting the psi classes at the other punctures, there's a lot of numbers we can calculate, but we can't get something like this relation, and we don't get something like this recursion as well. I mean, I've tried it with the As well. I mean, I've tried it with the volumes. I actually started with putting the insertions everywhere. And these calculations, there was no structure until that occurred. But this tells you, it looks like you've got a fighting chance to use your result and understand how this push forward, because at least there's nothing in these slots. And so then still. Still need this plea to Sasha that there needs to be some structure and integrability, and this is his definitely, you'll see his influence in a lot, but this bit here is I wouldn't be doing this solo. So, where d is equal to e to the e to the h bar inverse some linear operator which I'll define e to the half s squared I'm not talking about Virasoro today Virasoro is behind this but let me just define what this operator L to the negative one is it's some Tk plus one D to the K plus H bar inverse T0 squared T0 squared on 2, and this linear operator L is equal to 3, okay, that's a detail again. This is easier to consume. This, we want some geometry. This, we want some geometry related to this. So far, this generalized Reson-Gross-Witten had no relation to the moduli space of curves. This gives a relation via some intersection numbers of some well-behaved objects, some kappa polynomials, with this operator here. So that's not the one that I'm advertising here, the relation to the omegas, but it's partway there. And that's what this is. This is that's what the role of this is. Okay, so I seem to be claiming that I have given us enough of the proof because I'm saying something about super next. Okay, so what I've said here is that, yeah, that's right, just because I did it out of order, that given this is related to this. Is related to this, and given this relation of this to these k's, this is enough to prove. So, let me call this, say, one, and this awkward one. I'll put it in a yellow just to say there was something written there. And so then one and two imply the theorem. No, no, we need to do more than initial, but let me I will say something about the proof. So it ends up what algebraic geometry is bad at is the Virasauro structure, this quadratic structure that changes genus. What it's good at is if your genus remains the same, and it ends up that this isn't quite like that. Isn't quite like that. This D has some change in genus, but using, I could say Baker House, Dorf Campbell, or say using Sasha Alexandro, one can now just remove most of these terms. They're taking care of the unstable parts and just have this term here. And so it ends up that this statement here in the stable stably is equivalent to a relation holds onto. Relation holds onto the, that keeps the genus the same. And so then now algebraic geometry is good at that. And that's what this result too is doing. It's giving you a relationship between these classes and these classes where the genus isn't changing. So the integrable structure came in because of the well, I didn't actually, maybe I now need to say something about the integrability here. So the integrability uses the fact that Uses the fact that this is a tau function that satisfies the, let me call it a string equation, that equation that uniquely determined the, sorry, this, the equation that uniquely determines this is satisfied by this. How about I say that? Yeah. Okay, so I won't define super, it seems, so that I can go on to talk about the super volume. So, look, what is a super Riemann surface? A super Riemann surface is just think what a Riemann surface is, it's a topological surface. A Riemann surface is a topological surface, just a topological object, and on each of these open sets, we have a sheaf of functions we call the holomorphic functions. So, we need some way under our restriction maps to maintain this special set of functions. And so we have these transition functions, which are called conformal functions. And so a super rim and surface is exactly the same object, except these sheaves have some non-commutative or super commutative rings in place. And the justification for moduli space of super Riemann surfaces is there's an isomorphism between the first Hodge class, lambda 1 to the 13, and the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of curves. And so there's something like this. If you take the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of curves and you Of curves, and you there's an isomorphism between this line bundle and another known line bundle. And in the supercase, there's a similar story where that 13 gets replaced by 5. And so this 13 doubled is the 26 dimensions famous in string theory. This 5 doubled is the 10 dimensions famous for why we look at Kalabi Yows. So super string. Lubby yows. So super string theory. So the moduli space of super rim and surfaces is really the important object. Whether or not the volumes are important, well, they're at least giving us some understanding of the moduli space of super rim and surfaces. So let me cut to a recursion because I want to get here. So we have this Stanford-Witten recursion. Recursion. I have well, I better define some volumes. So these are, well, this is either a definition or using the Supervay-Peterson form, this is a theorem. We can define this using differential geometry or algebraic geometry. So, this is the object that I've got up on the board there. And now I'm going to take what would have defined the Vay-Peterson volumes. If I didn't have this term here, then. Then, if this was replaced by one, then this is our moduli space of this is our Vay-Peterson volumes, where m would be zero, because this term doesn't exist. But now we've collected many of these, and these are the moduli, the volumes of the moduli space of super-Riemann surfaces with n never-Schwartz points, and we've deformed the Vay-Petersen volume. And volume with in the never Schwartz points, and the Ramond points are there contributing to the volume, but they are not being deformed. Okay, and so then when s is equal to zero, this is the Never-Schwartz case, Stanford and Witten wrote down this. Well, this is not so explicit because it's some recursion. Some recursion linear, this L is some linear function where this is over many, there's many terms here. And this linear function looks of this form. B G minus one X Y L two to L n plus more, where this here is just a kernel, an integral kernel that sends polynomials to polynomials. When s equals zero, this is just a polynomial, and this Polynomial, and this will take as input a polynomial and spit out a polynomial. And this kernel is different to but similar to a kernel that Mizukani came up with. And this recursion is exactly the same as Mizucani's recursion, except for the difference in the kernels. And so Stanford and Witten used. Stanford and Witten used a heuristic argument using supergeometry to prove this heuristically, and it was proven rigorously by me using algebraic geometry. And the theorem with Alexandrov, and that's sorry, I don't need to write it, it's this one here. So, this corollary. So, it ends up the moduli space of super Riemann services. That's this. Of super Riemann services, that's this volume here where we've put all the Ramons in this generating function satisfies exactly this recursion. So the D the kernel here has no S dependence. So this recursion has no S dependence. It's a recursion satisfied by the S equals zero case. And now when we switch S on, the same recursion is satisfied. And the proof used And the proof uses. I won't, I should at least put down some mechanism, I guess. And topological recursion is lurking, but doesn't come into it explicitly. So, what we get from this theorem here: the theorem that the The theorem that the Bresengross-Witten is the same as the theorem that I've got up at the top there. What we get from that is we get KDV and that gives us Virasura. And Virasura gives us definitely in the S equals zero case topological recursion. And topological recursion is equivalent to this. This recursion here. This is the Laplace transform. So, this is an idea of Eynard-Arenton in the Musicani-Vay-Peterson case. It goes through. And so, then it ends up when S is switched on, it's something that looks like topological recursion on the same curve where something has been adjusted in the 0-1 that I don't understand, but it's not topological recursion, but it's the same. But it's the same, I mean, the proof goes through, so the same technique. So, maybe what I'll show you is an example to show you what this does, and it will say something topological recursion like. So, let me now take it, see what this can do for us. So, if I take this function that's a series in S and Z inverse. And Z inverse. So let's recall what this does here. This allows any number of Ramons and a single never Schwartz with this insertion, you could say of length L. And then the recursion gives, this is the recursion that I've written up there. Oh, this is one difference, of course, to Mizukani's as well. Mizakani doesn't have a 0-1 case of her recursion. This gives us. This gives us this. So, this is what should remind many people of topological recursion. This is exactly topological recursion. It's just there's no spectral curve here. So, this is the principal part. So, you take this f of z, so just to make it clear what's happening here, f of z starts with s squared on 2z squared. s squared on 2z squared and then maybe I'll just do the next term and explain it 2 pi squared on z squared plus got many more terms in my notes but not for today and so you put this into this this contributes negative terms this contributes positive terms the the taylor series of this and uh together you now just chop off the positive terms you're left with the negative terms and this Terms you're left with the negative terms, and this will now produce these terms here. And then we put this in here and will produce the next terms. And this is an example of topological recursion, except the spur is not there. And so then you can go backwards and get these volumes, which for me, from an algebraic geometric perspective, this is non-trivial. The fact that it's calculating Calculating these types of. So, what does this say here? This says that there are Okay, sorry, this one here says that I have one never Schwartz and four Ramons. It's a calculation on M05 bar of some cohomology class, and it calculated it with the knowledge simply of this. So, algebraic geometry doesn't know how to do that. Well, somehow indirectly, this proof. Well, somehow indirectly, this proof did it, but there's a natural proof using differential geometry, Mizikani's proof adapted using supergeometry. It's just non-rigorous. And it's interesting in this story, now that this recursion exists, there is a heuristic supergeometry proof that will produce the same recursion more naturally. And I'd like to fill in those details. Okay, I'll finish now.
