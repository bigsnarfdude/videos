To the organizers for organizing this great conference. All the talks have been really fantastic so far. So, I want to talk about recent work, recently finished work with my PhD student, Curtis Grant. And a lot of this talk will be on metastability in general, and then we'll get to spin glasses, and then eventually we'll get to more detailed spin glasses where we can do something. But it'll be a lot of It'll be a lot of overview, I guess. So, I guess let me say what I mean by metastability, because a lot of people probably have different definitions of it in their mind and of different degrees of power, I guess, in terms of what that means. So, okay, let me just overarching setup is we have some kind of complicated probability distribution. Altibodle is going to be the setting that we're interested in. It's going to be the setting that we're interested in in some high-dimensional, so it will be the dimension of the state space in an n-dimensional state space. And actually, for everything I'm going to talk about, it's going to be the hypercube. But my pictures will not like the hypercube. So this is some, let's say, the probability function, or maybe negative of it, so that you go downhill when you try and do dynamics. Do dynamics. And the dynamics we'll think about will be some kind of reversible Markov chain. So, for concreteness, it'll always be, or almost always, be global dynamics, which I think most of us have seen at some point in this week at least. So, pick a coordinate 1 through n uniformly at random, and then flip the state on that coordinate. So, that's what I mean by sigma with the parentheses i here. So, just flip the state on that coordinate. So just flip the state on that coordinate with probability proportional to the probability of that. There should be a conditional on the rest of the configurations in all of these probabilities. I guess you guys all know this. Sorry for the technology. So resample that coordinate conditional on the remaining coordinates of the distribution. And more or less, this will move around in the probability landscape and look like some random. Landscape and look like some random process. And it'll get stuck in deep parts of the landscape. So, one, maybe, most elementary notion of metastability is there is slow mixing of the Markov chain purely because there are multiple phases that can trap the dynamics for holotics. Okay, so let's move a little beyond just slow mixing. So So, metastability means many things to different communities, but I guess a lot of the literature around metastability is focused on like there should be some way to decompose the state space into a set of wells such that the time to move out of a well is larger than the time to move into a well from the complement of the wells. Okay, so you spend more time inside any of the wells that I decomposed here. Of the wells that I decompose your state space into, then it takes if I start you over here to fall into one of the wells. And so this, let's take escape times from the wells is much larger than the entry times from the complement. Let's take this as like, you know, broad definition of metastability. But now, if I want to maybe probe more refined aspects of this, like what are these times, things like that. What are these times? Things like that. We can get more and more precise understandings of metastability depending on what the dynamics is, what the probability distribution is, things like that. So this obviously has a long, long history. Metastability is core to physics and chemistry. If you go back to like Arrhenius' law from chemistry, for how long it takes to do some kind of activated transit of chemical dynamics. And so a lot of the maybe A lot of the maybe earlier work focused on a kind of pathwise theory, which is if I pick two points or two wells, what's the easiest way to transit between them? And so this, I guess people in this room probably know is like large deviations theory, a la like Freidland-Bensel in low dimensions and in fixed-dimensional dynamical systems or stochastic systems. And so there's been a lot of work, and that's what this dot dot dot is for. That's what this dot dot dot is for 50, 60 years developing very precise large deviations theories where if I have some kind of general landscape and I do some kind of diffusion on it, what does the typical unlikely transit in this landscape look like? And so it's like, well, if I'm moving from here to here, I'm probably stuck in this purple envelope. That's the easiest path between these two. If you understand the easiest path between wells, you can kind of understand how long it typical transit takes. How long a typical transit takes. So, this is like how long and what's the shape of a typical transit between clouds. And then there's kind of been in the last 20 years a more maybe modern approach to metastability, which you can find a very nice description of in this book by Beaubier and Dan Hollander, which is called Metastability. And this is a more potential theoretic approach, and it's really about understanding capacities for these sets. Capacities for these sets with respect to the underlying dynamics. So, specifically, if I start in this well, what's the like harmonic measure or something? So, what's the hitting probabilities along the boundary of this other well, or maybe on this well as compared to that well? And so, this will tell me when I leave this well, what's the kind of probability distribution I put on the next well that I fall into. Okay, so this is this is like how long. This is like how long does it take, and what are the paths between wells, and this is what are the probabilities I put on the next well I transit to when I make these rare transits. Okay, so if you combine these two, maybe some kind of like ideal theorem you would prove or ideal statement of a metastability that you could say is if I just track which well I'm in for this high-dimensional state space. This is the high-dimensional state space, and I just view the skeleton, which is like which well I'm in at a given time. And let's just ignore the times it's in between wells because those are kind of short times. Then this actually behaves like a Markov chain on this like lower dimensional state space with which is just the second wells. Okay, so all of the time, the important things here is all of the times in between the wells is completely dumped. So you don't see that on the right. So for these people, you do the same thing. On the right, so if it needs to be the same, it has to be the same. But also, it doesn't care where in the well you are. So it needs to be the case that, like, no matter where in the well I start, the transit rates I put to the next well are kind of independent of where I started. Which, for this community, is a kind of statement that you're equilibriating quite fast in this well so that you can treat it as stationary inside the well before you need to consider the next transit to the next one. Okay. Okay, so this is all abstract blah blah, I guess, up to this point. So let me go to a concrete example where one can see this pretty straightforwardly. And it'll be a concrete high-dimensional example, which Roman said is trivial yesterday, obviously. So we'll go to the Curie-Weiss model. So the example of the Curie-Weiss model. So the Curie-Weiss model is the easing model on the complete graph, ferromagnetic. Complete graph, they're all magnetic. All vertices interact with all other vertices, and this has a phase transition at beta equals to one, two, depending on what I wrote. There will be a multimodality of the free energy landscape. And you can see this because this is the square of the magnetization. So, all right, this is the sum of the spins squared. And so, when I plot this together with the entropy. This together with the entropy term for the set of all sigmas that have a specific magnetization, then this is the free energy landscape I am covering. Okay, so typical configurations are either dominated by plus or dominated by minus. And in this case, the high-dimensional problem really reduces to a low-dimensional problem. And it's kind of obvious what the wells should be. There should be a right-hand side where plus dominates and a left-hand side where minus dominates. And the left-hand side where minus dominates. So let's set some threshold. Let's say that's going to little over 1. So in this picture, it's going to the boundary. And this will be the left well, and that'll be the right well. And when I decompose my state space into these two wells, then we have a skeleton process which tracks which of these two wells the Markov chain, which is blobber dynamics for the Curie-Wise model, is in. The Curie-Weiss model is in. And then I guess you would probably guess what the low-dimensional Markov chain that's going to approximate it is. It's a two-state Markov chain that's just basically telling you which majority you have. And so there's a plus state and a minus state, and you just have half transit rates in each direction. Okay? So I guess there's like a self-loop here with probability one and half. self-loop here with probability one-half and a self-loop there with probability one half. Okay, so then what would be the statement of metastability in the form that I wrote? It would be there's some sequence of times which should kind of capture the typical time it takes to transit from the left side of this picture to the right side of this picture. These will be exponential in n with some constant in front, that's like the free energy barrier between the two. Energy barrier between the two, such that when I only look at resolutions of time that are that much or larger, then the skeleton process behaves like the Markov chain on the left. So I can't probe time scales that are less than this because on time scales that are less than this, maybe you're like stuck at the saddle. And so it's not showing up in the picture on the right. But when I look on time scales that are the time of the transit, yes. I'm just wondering why the silk hoops are inhabited. I'm just wondering why the self-loops are a half. So you're thinking just over a time period that is beyond the mixing. I don't understand that. Like you said that there are probably. So if I start here and I make it up to here, that's the free energy barrier. Then once I'm at equal balanced configuration, I'm equally likely to fall to the left as to fall back into this side by the symmetry. So I can't probe time scales that are like really. Time scales that are like really small because then I might hit the rare event that I'm like right around the boundary and I can't assign a state to the thing, or maybe like I oscillate inside and outside the boundary of this thing. But if I look on the resolution of the transits between the wells or larger, then I should behave completely like this two-dimensional object. Okay? So let me give a slightly more precise version of that. So let's set Tn to be Let's set Tn to be exponential of this free energy barrier. So that's like the free energy restricted to the well minus the free energy of this boundary set in between the two. And then take any set of times such that the difference, so not too many, k can be maybe sub-exponentially growing, because if you take too many, you might hit some unlikely rare event. And I need their separations to be order one so that I'm never looking. Order one, so that I'm never looking at a resolution that's finer than this transit time scale. Okay, so those are kind of the things that I would need to assume. Then I have that, you know, in this sense of finite dimensional distributions, this skeleton process is just this two-dimensional non-function. And I say I cannot hold for exponentially many SIs because there will be some times when you catch it at this boundary, and so obviously there's not going to be this equality of those times. There's not going to be this equality of those types. Are there any questions about the mean field ferromagnetic using example? So really what were the two core things about this? And then this will kind of be like what are the things you need to prove to prove this type of metastability statement in more generality. So one is I need the mixing within a phase to be fast. So if I'm starting inside of If I'm starting inside of the well, then, or maybe for most points on the boundary of the well, if I start there, I need to mix quickly into the Gibbs measure restricted to that well. So this is so that I can treat the transit time just as if I started stationary here. I don't need to be concerned that maybe I'm on the boundary and it's actually pretty easy to transit over to the other side. So that's this kind of mixing within a phase being class. In the mean field, these In the mean field model, this kind of result was proved by Ding that's for the Global Dynamics, like restricted to the plus side. Okay, so by this reasoning, when we're in a well, we can treat it as kind of quasi-stationary, so just a stationary chain inside of that well. And then I need to understand the transit rates between wells. Here, there's only two wells, so it's just this one-half, and that comes from symmetry. So, like, that's not so bad. But if there were more wells, I need to understand. But if there were more wells, I need to understand the transit rates between them. And I need to approximate it by an exponential random variable. Because the limiting low-dimensional Markov chain, its transit rate between two wells is going to be an exponential random variable, whereas this is some kind of inhomogeneous thing depending on where I am in the well. So you need some kind of nice concentration between these, which again might come from this mixing of it of these. Okay, so this is the kind of overall. The kind of overarching story on a very simple example. Now let's go from Curie Weiss easing to easing with some geometry. And I won't be able to prove any theorem like this for that, so don't get excited. But so ferromagnetic easing on other geometries, let's say easing on the torus or on a random deregular graph. Deregular graph. So one could hope for a similar type of picture. But the problem is that this kind of mixing within a phase becomes significantly more complicated. In particular, there's a much more complicated landscape on the due due to the probability distribution. So if I consider, for instance, the easing model on the Taurus, you know, the two minimizers of the free energy we all know are like mostly plus with little islands of minus. Little islands of minus and mostly minus with little islands of plus. But there can be like local minimizing configurations, even here, that are exponentially slow to leave that come because of some geometrical structure, like a whole blocking strip of minuses and sine of c of pluses, things like that. And in dimension three, for instance, this is exponentially metastable itself. So then, do you want that to be a metastable well and you have a lot more wells, or do I want it just Have a lot more wells, or do I want to just consider the cut? In which case, mixing within a phase is not true, unless if I do say something like only from nice initializations or something. And even then, it's very hard to prove. Yeah. When you talk about proving a metastability statement, do you get to choose this value of Tn or do you really want the exponent to be given in terms of sort of free passion block? I guess you get to choose, but to see the transits, it will be the. Yeah, so it should be exponentially large. Yeah, so it should be exponentially large and like the most interesting regime where there's more than a couple wells, it will be like pre-relaxation but exponentially large. And so you want to and these transits, the typical time they take will or should be exponential in the free energy area. So that'll dictate what you choose. So like for instance for a statement like this, you could plausibly have Tn big enough to get you out of that weird one you're looking at. Yeah, so you could choose to just split it in these two, but that would require showing some separation. But that would require showing some separation between the mixing time, escape time from this and the move from here to here. And that separation might be microscopic on the exponential scale. And so things like that can be done. Okay, so these kind of geometrical obstructions make this kind of picture quite hard, I think, to establish for ferromagnetic easing on the lattice. The random regular graph doesn't have cuts like this, but still I think it's a very hard problem. It would be exciting to make progress on. Okay, so what's known for ferromagnetic easing? There actually has been a line of literature that's been focused on zero temperature metastability. So this is essentially the characterization of just the landscape geometry. What is the shortest? Geometry. What is the shortest path at zero temperature between the bottom of one well and the bottom of the other? Now, when we're at zero temperature, the bottoms of the wells are just the fully blue and fully red configurations. There's no like thermal effects and there's no size to these wells. And so this kind of transit picture has been shown where the way you move from like all blue to all red is you slowly grow a droplet and you kind of just wrap around this thing. You kind of just wrap around this thing like a snake until you get to here. And with the understanding of this, you can characterize: like, if the temperature is going to zero with the system size, what is the typical time to transit from the ground state, from one ground state to the other? So there's been a nice line of work that studied this, and then more recently there's been some progress in like POTS model as zero temperature metastability and Widem-Rulings and Potsdam. Wittenham-Ruhlinson model, zero temperature maximum. Okay, but going from this to positive temperature, you need to argue that all of the little fluctuations around this and things like that, you know, that's going to have a big effect on the dynamics and becomes quite challenging. So, let me end the section on the classical ferromagnetic easing model with a small theorem that we can. So, here, that we can show on this model in terms of mixing within a phase, so to speak. So, for positive temperature metastability, like I was saying, it's hard to show that there's fast mixing within a phase because there might not be uniformly over the phase, or maybe like the distinction between the exponentials for like the transit time and the time to escape this configuration. And the time to escape this configuration might be very small. But maybe you could hope that for nice initializations, like when you come from this side, you'll hit a reasonable looking state, and so you will still mix with interface. And so for one very simple initialization, we can prove that you have fast mixing with interface. So this was joint work with Alistair Sinclair. We showed that if you start from the all-plus configuration, then you kind of avoid all of these potential. Of avoid all of these potential exponential bottlenecks that were these little mini geometric obstructions, and you do equilibriate quickly to this to the plus phase of the model. Okay, so this is obviously very far from these kinds of ideal metastability statements I was saying, but just saying like, okay, maybe like then you can try and probe what if it's like a random ninety percent plus configuration. Can I say that I mix quickly from that and start to work towards a better better understanding? Work towards a better understanding of existing. Okay. Any questions? Yeah. So if I start from a sample from the Gibbs measure. From the Gibbs measure conditioned on that side. Yeah, so any the measure and anything that dominates it can be handled, but we're really using monotonicity, so the dominations are So the dominations are done. Okay. So let me move away from things with geometry. Yes. Somewhere I got lost on exactly what model to send about. So this is GlobberDynamics for the, sorry, it doesn't say, so that's it. Very valid. This is glober dynamics for the easing model on the torus in any dimension d at least 2 for all low temperatures. 2 for all low temperatures theta larger than beta critical. You can get quasi-polynomial and in dimension 2, it's n to the 1 plus the low of 1. So do you really like it would mix at every configuration in a phase, but it cannot? It will not mix quickly in from a from every configuration. In dimension three and higher, in dimension two it's probably polynomial for every configuration, but that's hard. Configuration, but that's hard. But like, probably like high entropy initializations, like Bernoulli coin flips with a bias, should mix fast. You know, if you want an ambitious problem. Okay, so let's leave geometry and go back to trivial things, but make them non-trivial now by having non-ferromagnetic. So now we'll go to skin glasses. Now we'll wear the stained glasses. So these were kind of structured, you know, the easing model, the ferromagnetic easing model, it has complications due to the geometry, but like the two deepest wells are kind of obvious. They're the one where the plus dominates and the minus dominates, and there's only a finite two of them. So when we move to spin glasses, that's what changes. You'll have exponentially many very deep wells, and so but there's no geometry, so that works. So that works. Okay, so let me start with not heavy tail of distinct glass models. So the P-Spin models on the hypercube, just to remind you, these are Gaussian processes on the hypercube. I guess I wrote RSN or the sphere. These are Gaussian processes where the covariance is given by the inner product between two points and raised to the pth power for the V-Smith model. And also, you can alternatively think about it like the Easing description as a Gibbs measure, except with P-way interactions and with Gaussian weights on those P-way interactions. So the fact that it's a random disordered landscape and the interactions between vertices are not ferromagnetic means that there isn't this kind of structure at all plus, all minus dominating, and you have frustration and complications that come up. The problem. So, in particular, it's been shown in different settings, and depending on if I'm looking at the energy landscape or the low-temperature-free energy landscape, that there's exponentially many near-orthogonal critical points. And so, when you probe the kind of deep parts of this landscape, there's a whole bunch of wells at different heights. There's, in particular, if I look like around a slice at this energy level, there's exponentially many of these guys. There's exponentially many of these guys in the dimension. And so this gives us a very rich playground for metastability. And it's given physicists for the last 30 years a very rich playground to make predictions about metastability and things like that. So what we expect is that at time scale, so all of these lie on the, you know, this height is n, so to speak, that's the scaling I'm using. To speak, that's the scaling I'm using. So, when I rescale by, so when I look at exponential in some constant times n time scales, then the Markov chain, those are the time scales on which it will transit from like this well to this well. Okay, and this blue ring is where the Gibbs measure is inside of this well. So, when it's equilibriated inside this well, it's kind of spinning around here, and then rarely on some exponential CN time, it makes a choice to go along the short. Makes a choice to go along the shortest saddle over to the next well that's of a similar depth or something. Okay, so that's the picture you should expect. Yes. Is C the same for every well? No. Yeah, so C will be like the free energy from this ring to the nearest saddle or a couple. Okay. So yeah, so when I pick a time scale, this T sub n to be exponential some Cn, then I'm picking essentially a slice. Then I'm picking essentially a slice of these wells to be looking at the metastability along. Okay, so other aspects of spin blast dynamics I should mention, which are somewhat related. So on these long time scales, so the first, so the mixing times, I guess as you would predict from this picture, there's many, many phases that coexist. So the mixing time is exponential in n, and this is throughout the low temperature rich. Throughout the low temperature regime. In fact, whenever you have replicosymmetry breaking for these models, you have, for generic models, I guess, you have exponential mixing time. And so, and then another thing that's very deeply intertwined with metastability in the stained glass literature is this concept of aging, which is that the older, I mean, it's a, let's say, this isn't a mathematical definition, but the adage is that the older a system it gets, then the A system it gets, then the longer it takes to forget its past. Okay, so it kind of gets more and more stuck. And from this metastability picture, just for those who aren't familiar with aging, to give you a flavor of why that's true, if you believe that you're kind of hopping around these wells going on and on, then at some time when I look in the future, I'm getting a size-biased sample of which well I'm in because I spend more time in deeper wells. Because I spend more time in deeper wells. So if I pick a time to look at, it's size biased. And this size biasing means that as I look longer and longer in time, I'm more likely to find it in a deeper and deeper well, which takes longer and longer to escape its well. So that's the concept of aging in the context of these kind of pictures and skein-lasting notes. And so you see if you have a good understanding, if you have a really good understanding, let's say, of the medicine. Good understanding of the metastability picture, and you can understand the transit rates between the wells, then you could get, as a consequence, this type of aging picture for this big cost of things. Yes? So in this compliance, how do you determine the topology of the rough? How do you know which wells you can meet? Yeah, that's a no, that's a very hard question. I'm saying if I were kind of randomly hopping, then I would have this size-biased picture, and those are the kind of simplified and more simplified. And those are the kind of simplifying, more simplified models for which aging has been proved. I'll say something about that. Obviously, in the actual P-Spin model, the ones with shallower saddles are easier to get to than the ones maybe that have, and this is related to the connections between the saddles and things, which is hard to understand. Other questions? Okay, so I want to say this is all long-time dynamics, and all of metastability is about long-time dynamics. About long-time dynamics, but some people who have seen aging might also know of some things related to short-time skin glass dynamics at low temperature. So, I feel like I have to say something about that also. So, short-time dynamics is I'm still in this low-temperature regime where there are these many wells and you get trapped by them. But there's questions that I can ask about if I start, let's say, at random, the dynamics will kind of fall down this land. Dynamics will kind of fall down this landscape, and then near where it gets to the first local minima in the picture I drew, it'll get stuck or slow down for a long time. So, this has been the physics prediction for a while, and there's been a type of aging associated to this slowdown as you reach the first local minima, which is different from the one that's induced by transiting between parallels. So, this is related to these, maybe if you hear them, the Kubliand-the LaCourchon equations are like basically. Equations are like basically getting equations for an autocorrelation function, like two-time autocorrelation of the dynamics. And then this is also related to like what energy level does the dynamics actually get stuck at in these stained glass models, which is related to some of the other talks that we've heard this week. And so there's some hardness results that I think have been mentioned earlier. And Mark had a very nice work identifying exactly that the energy level in UK. That the energy level you get to as time goes to infinity, but on order one time scales, is exactly this level where the first local minima appear in this picture. Okay, and so from that, you kind of expect that you're getting stuck on flatter and flatter saddles maybe, and that's where this aging evaluation comes from. But everything I'm interested in this talk is about, and kind of this picture of metastability that I've given you. picture of metastability that I've given you is about exponential time scales model time metastability. Okay, so I think now no, not yet. Okay, so let me say in what context is this kind of metastability and aging picture known on long times in the sphing glass literature? So one context in which it's known is for the P-sphinglass models that I described. Glass models that I described, but with the important distinction that it's not blobber dynamics. It's what's called a random Hawking time dynamics, which you can think of as simple random walk that's just held at each point by exponential of the energy of that point. Okay, so when it makes jumps, it just picks a uniform at random neighbor. There's no, it's not like it moves along flatter directions, easier downhill directions or anything. It just picks a uniform at random neighborhood. Directions or anything. It just picks a uniform and random neighbor. But the holding times at each vertex of the hypercube are exponential in the energy. And so this makes it stuck at deep points in the landscape, but it simplifies several things about the metastability picture. Namely, the wells are just single points in the hypercube, because a single deep state keeps you stuck. And when you leave it, you go to a uniform at random one of your neighbors, which will have a much higher emergency. Neighbors which will have a much higher allergy. So there is no concept of fast mixing within a well that needs to be proven in this picture. It's just a single point for wells. And the other is that the potential theory, so the law on the next well that you fall into, is given by the transit rates for the random law, okay, to a random selection of points in the hypercube, which are the deep points. So that makes it hard. These are serious deep theorems, but it's not governed by sh. But it's not governed by the low saddles of landscape. It's just given by run a simple random walk and see which D point it fits. The next kind of, so this was the kind of state of the art and understood for these P-Spin models, I think, in these works by Beaubier, Gérard, and Speshta. And then in 2019, Gérard proved for the Wabber dynamics itself, but for the random energy model. So the model where Model. So the model where the energy landscape is just IID. There's no like smoothness to the landscape like there is, or correlatedness in the landscape like there is for the P-Spin models. But here she was able to analyze the global dynamics itself. So upshot is the potential theory is now actually governed by these easy paths between wells. But the mixing within a phase concept is still not there because. Phase concept is still not there because there's just singleton sites which I mean, well, so this is a highly oscillatory landscape because it's just IIDU normal zero ends at each point in the hypercube. So you just have very deep points and then as soon as you leave them now you're like trying to find the nearest next button to drop it. So the state of the art still leaves a lot to be explored for spin glass dynamics. And so you note that mixing in a well is not a factor in this either, but the actual transit rates are. And so the upshot of our work is we're able to show a sharp metastability picture for the Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glass models. And so these will have this kind of the wells have large size, you need to understand the mixing properties inside of the well, and there are many wells that you need to transit between. But the heavy-tailed structure. But the heavy-tailed structure is going to give us a very nice description of what the wells are. So it's not like this kind of complicated, I don't know how to describe the wells. I can describe them in terms of the heavy or the strong bonds of the Kuiper cube, or in the complete graph, I guess. And that also makes this question of what are the easy transits versus the hard transits between, well, all right, so let me talk a little about heavy-tailed sting blocks. Talk a little about heavy-tailed spin glasses and give the formal statement of our result. So the heavy-tailed spin glass models are just the same two-way interaction SK model that you're all familiar with, except the couplings instead of being Gaussian are now heavy-tailed. And so let's say they're in the domain of attraction of an alpha stable law, and this is the regime where it's like there's not even an expectation. Like, there's not even an expectation. So, alpha and 0, 1. And these are symmetric, so the tail just depends on the, it's like the absolute value of x raised to the right power for it to be alpha stable. Okay, and so Cizot and Pouchot studied this model, and because it has a kind of sparser structure than the mean field models, and in some sense, like there was some hope that if you sparsify the complete graph. If you sparsify the complete graph, now you're giving it some geometry and it's approaching the harder problems which have geometry for spin glass models. But the heavy-tailed, on the other hand, makes a lot of things easier. So there's trade-offs between the two. And it's related to a model of Vianna Bray, which is basically taking a spin glass model on a random glass. And the thermodynamics of this model, so the limiting free energy, things like that, were studied by Jagannatha Loki. were studied by Jagannath and Lepato and Wei Ku Chen, Arnaud-sen and Kim in 2023. And so in particular, I guess the thing you should take away from this is that the free energy scales like exponential n to the 1 over alpha, so more than exponential n, and that means the deepest or the longest transits are more than exponential n. They're exponential n to the 1 over alpha. And they're governed by like the biggest bonds that you end up with. Fonts that you end up with by the extreme value statistics of the Bento model. So, to describe the metastability theorem, I have to give you the well decomposition and then the approximating Markov chain, which is finite dimensional. So, to give the well decomposition, this was where I was saying the heavy-tailed structure simplifies things. Order your top bonds, J1 is bigger than J2, bigger than up to J sub K, let's say, and K is any number. Let's say, and k is any number that's not too large and less than square root n. So let's look at the biggest bonds. And for each of these heavy bonds, so there's only square root n of them, so they don't even overlap. They're kind of just distinct bonds in the complete graph. They don't have any vertices in common. And for each of these, there's two satisfying assignments. It depends on the orientation of the coupling value, but basically you can think either there's a minus, minus, or a plus, plus, plus. minus minus or a plus plus on that bond that satisfied it. If the bond is negative then it's minus plus and plus minus that are satisfying it. And so the wells will be the satisfying assignments to these top k bonds. So if I can associate the vet well with a vector in plus minus 1 to the k, where I just tell you which of the two satisfying assignments you're taking on each of the k bonds. Okay? So I'm only telling Okay, so I'm only telling you the configuration on those k bonds. So these each have exponential size as well. And they're kind of breaking the there's the in-betweens because that's where these bonds are not satisfied. And that breaks up your state space into two to the capital K and bonds. Those are the wells. And then the Markov chain that is just on this loader dimensional hypercube plus minus one to the k. plus minus 1 to the k is going to be the one which for each coordinate, its jump time is an exponential clock whose rate is what you would get from the Gibbs average restricted to that one. So it's exactly like this free energy barrier being the expected time to transit. Okay, so this is you take the Gibbs expectation under a sample restricted to that well of exponential of like the field on the vertices. Like the field on the vertices you need to flip in that to change that coordinate. Okay, so this is like you can pretend that things are mixed inside of the well. And then when the clock on the coordinate rings, you're thinking about it becoming unsatisfied. And then there's two options of where to resatisfy. So you just flip a coin as to whether you move that coordinate or not. And the theorem is that with probability 1 minus little o of 1, the j's, The J's, the couplings are such that if I look at any resolution time scale which is bigger than exponential n to the gamma, this is less than 1 over alpha. So this is pre-equilibriation. So I can probe like a window of times that are exponential and pre-equilibriation. If I look at any resolution scale like that or larger, then the skeleton of the Markov chain, which is just tracking which well it's in, is well approximated. Is well approximated by this low-dimensional object Y, which just lives on the K hypercube. Are there any questions about the picture of the theorem? So there's this lower, I guess this should have four to match this, but there's this lower dimensional hypercube, and this is the high dimensional state space partitioned into its wells. Partitioned into its wells, and you know, the transits here are governed by taking an expected value inside here of the transit time over the free energy barrier to changing one of the two bonds that are one of the two vertices that are keeping that edge satisfied in that direction. So, as a result of this, so like I said earlier, with a sharp metastability picture, you can kind of deduce consequences like auto-producing. Consequences like autocorrelation functions and things like that. Yeah. Is this also what you would get if you were to just ignore all of the mocks other than the first k large ones? Like, is that a way to think about sort of the behavior of this? Well, but then, so this quantity will be different. There is an actual non-negligible mean field effect from the other coordinates on the time it takes to flip that coordinate. Okay, so as a consequence, we can deduce things like the two-time autocorrelation, which is the type of thing that you want to look at when studying aging. And for instance, what we can say is if you look at this kind of exponential n to the gamma time scale and you initialize your Markov chain uniformly, then the two-time autocorrelation, so this is this x sub tn, and if I multiply that tn. Sub Tn, and if I multiply that Tn by some parameter, by some x, then this thing converges. So this is, if s is fixed, then it converges to like take two replicas from the same well and look at their overlap function. Now this might be replica symmetric in the well, it might not be, and I'll say a little about that then. But the point is, I could also take this Sn to be growing with N, and that's when you would actually see some dependence on S here, where like you might see the transits and things like that. See the transits and things like that. So, the point is that once you have this, then you can ask questions like: what energy level will I be? What are the two-time water correlations? Things like that. Okay, so let me say a little about the proof in the five-ish minutes. I'll take from now. So, like I said earlier, there's two steps to what I view as this kind of perspective on instability, and this is like show fast mixing within wealth. Show fast mixing within wells and then estimate the transits between the wells and what probabilities you get to the next well you fall into. And so the first statement is this kind of fast mixing within a well. And this is kind of essential to being able to show this kind of theorem. And so what we show is that if I fix any metastable well, which is given by fixing the orientations of the top L bonds, then the time it takes to mix is The time it takes to mix is governed by exponential 2 beta of the next bond, so the L plus 1. So 1 smaller up to a 1 plus little O of 1. And in particular, I guess I should say, this is much, much less than exponential to beta J L. So it's much less than the time it could possibly take to transit out from the well you're in. So that's the sense in which you have fast mixing. You can kind of disregard these times when you're looking at the resonance. Times when you're looking at the resolution scales that we're looking at. And this is sharpens inequality, essentially. I think the little O of one captures the errors. And so to show something like this, what you need is the fact that this is, let's say, these are the frozen ones. The next bunch of bonds, maybe up to some threshold, actually form a sparse structure in the complete graph. In the complete graph. And so because these blue bonds, which are this is like the L plus one through maybe, I don't know, square root nth one or something, or nth one, this nth one, this will be some kind of like 4SD thing. And so its mixing time is really governed by the heaviest bond because there are interior cycles in this. Okay? And then there's a mean field effect, which is coming from the low bond, which can kind of accumulate, but its accumulation is also negligible. Its accumulation is also negligible compared to this highest one. And then you do some kind of block dynamics to stitch these two together. You do an update on the sparse structure and an update on the mean field structure and stitch them together. But what's important here is this sparsity of the larger bonds of the model. The second kind of step that you need, which I said, is to get a good estimate for the transit times between the wells once you have Times between the wells once you have this fast mixing in a well. So once I know the fast mixing in a well, I know that I can treat it as like basically a stationary chain inside of that well and then ask for how long it takes to transit. And I need to be able to replace that kind of stationary chain's transit time with an exponential random variable with the rate that I told you, which is this free energy barrier. And this kind of thing requires understanding. You have this kind of heterogeneous process where this is a stationary change. This process where this is a stationary chain. And this is like the time to flip a coordinate V is given by exponential, maybe the field on V, but the field is changing almost instantaneously because a lot of stuff is happening in the Markov chain within the well. And you want to be able to replace this essentially with its average or some kind of state, you know, expectation of some stationary thing. And so that kind of averaging, you use again the fast. You use again the fast mixing to say, let's decompose our time into, you know, let me start independent stationary chains here and allow it to mix in between. And the concentration ends up being good enough so that you can treat this as basically the free energy area once you've qualified. So again, it's the fast mixing within the well that's important. And then which well you choose, you can basically get a precise kind of concentration you can do for every coordinate split amongst. For every coordinate split amongst the top k ones simultaneously, and there's some separation between their time scales. So that means I can really tell you: okay, this is the one we'll do next, and then this is the one we'll do next, et cetera. Okay, and to conclude, I'll just say a little about, you asked this question about can I disregard all of the other edges, essentially. And so in a high-temperature regime where like beta is less than some beta naught, let's say, where the interactions do Where the interactions do become kind of decoupled, we can say it's replica symmetric inside of each of these wells. And so you can essentially disregard all other edges and replace the transit time by just exponential 2 beta, the edge that you're trying to flip split. But there's a low temperature regime where it's probably not replica symmetric inside of the well, and that's where you should see the kind of Q function I was telling you earlier, this like two. Telling you earlier, this like two overlap be non-trivial. This time transit will be like some different thing which is governed by the whole free energy difference. And that's where you should see some kind of agent inside of the dynamics when you look at the two-time autocorrelation as we speak. Well, I'll stop there. Thank you. Questions? Okay. So, this model that your main theorem applies to, reminds me a bit of random XML set to site, like a special case of your model. Not sure I see the connection. It has the well pictures, but I don't know. I see in that sense. I see in that sense. I guess, I mean, these satisfaction models are closely related to spin glass models, and they have this kind of many wells picture inherent to them. The model that we're able to prove things for has also a further heavy-tailed structure, which makes the wells kind of live on completely very separated scales that's very helpful to us, that probably would prevent us from, or does prevent us. From or does prevent us from showing something like this for the light-tailed spin glasses and, therefore, also probably for satisfying satisfaction problems and things like that. I don't know if that really. The X-Order is like a really simple one. It's much simpler than the others. Yeah. You may have already said this, but do you have an example of a model where you get this weaker version of metastability, but you actually can prove you don't get this sort of stronger version where you have fast fixing within all of the wells. So what is the weaker version? I guess the sort of more vague notion of metastability where maybe you have wells but you don't know how things fix within those ones. So, I mean. So, I mean, for instance, if you think about the easing model with just on the 3D lattice and you just do the decomposition, that's like the most naive one, which is majority plus, majority minus. There are, yeah, I mean, I think that there can be big, you know, you won't be able to say that the transit. Able to say that the transit time is governed by this exponential of the free energy barrier because there will be a chance that it falls into like this extra, you know, like there will be extra levels of instability that are essentially on the same order. But I think if you start randomly, then you should still have the same picture. So and or if you add those to your set of wells, now you can come up with a more complicated low-dimensional structure that probably should capture everything. Should capture everything. So I guess there's probably counterexamples to the most naive decomposition into wells, but there's probably a richer decomposition that still would have some kind of ministability. Might say this, but in these more continuous models where you have walls that take time to chunk between, are the transit times literally a function of the height of the wall, or is it? So it should be the, like in the P-SPIN model, on the sphere, it should be essentially the free energy barrier between the ring and maybe the boundary of the ring or the top of the well. But then once I've reached the top of the well, now it should be quite fast to move until it falls into the next well. Thanks.
