Online conference. I was so excited when I was invited to go to Banff because every friends who have been there told me that's amazing place. But unfortunately, we couldn't go there. But I'm still very happy to see you online. And today I would like to share with you our recent work. This work is This work is a joint work with Professor Zhang Sheng Guo. Okay, so today we are going to focus on the very standard fundamental model, which is two species competition models. Here, U and V means the two strong competitors. Here, strong competitors means Here, strong competitors means here the competition rate is bigger than one, as I will show you later. And after suitable rescaling, we can only have four parameter D, R, K, and H. And the D, R is positive, HK is bigger than one. So here, if we drop the diffusion term, then we have we use Then we have we use the phase plane analysis and we have four equilibrium solutions: zero origin, EU means one, zero, and EV means zero, one and the coexistent state is a U star, V star. So here it's unstable, it's actually a saddle point. So there are two incoming trajectories. To incoming trajectory and to outgoing trajectory. And the green curve means most O trajectory tends to either EU or EV. So to capture the propagation phenomena, probably the troubling wave solution is very basic and very fundamental patterns. So the troubling wave is a very important So the traveling wave solution is a spatial solution, mover with a constant without changing its shape. And here we use the moving coordinate c equals to x plus 1t and put the system lov. Then we get the following second order ODE system. And we put the boundary condition at the negative infinity. negative infinity we put Ev and at infinity we put the Eu. Then consider the monotone wave profile then it's classical there is a there are some classical results regarding the existence and uniqueness and stability for the system so more precisely there is a unique There is a unique C speed C1, so that the system has a string monotone wave profile. So we call such a front EVEU front at the left-hand side EV and the right-hand side EU. And the C speed C, if the C1 is positive, then the wave move to the left. Move to the left. Otherwise, if it's negative, then the wave move to the right. It's biologically, we say you win the competition if C1 is positive. So it's quite important to study the speed sign C1 because due to the criterion on the sign of speed, we can The sign of speed, we are able to construct more new types of entire solution, as I will show you later. So, let me mention some works. The first one is Kong Ang in 1995. He considered the dependence, the size speed, how the size speed depends on parameter, especially in HK. He showed the monotonicity of. Of the size B on H and K. So it's well known that there exists a standing wave for a certain parameter region. So combine the result of monotonicity, we can get some criteria on the speed sign. And then Rodrigo and Mimuroa, they use the They use the solution. They actually use the hyperbolic tangent function put into the system and they can find some precise speed for some spatial parameter region. Then Guo and Lin, they used fundamental analysis to get some criteria on the speed sign. And recently, Recently, and Leo, who is probably here, and Nadang, they hello, yeah, they consider the very large competition rate case, so they use the singular limiting process to get the criterion for the dependence on diffusion rate. And then I also refer the work. The work of Liu is a nice survey about the size B. And also, Ma Huang O they used the refined super sub solution to get some new criteria, determine the science B. So I will show you why we need this. So our goal is actually to study the entire solutions for the low cover Terra strong competition. Strong competition model. And probably Morita and Tachibana, they consider, oh sorry, so here entire solution means classical solution defined for all space and the time variables. So they show the existence of entire solution that behave as a two monotone wave propagating from both sides of x-oxy. On both sides of x-axis. So let's take a look at this picture. So, roughly speaking, they show that when t is very close to negative infinity, then at the left side, the wave, the solution, entire solution looks like this wave, the troubling wave, move to the right. And at the right side, the entire solution behave like this troubling wave move to the left. Move to the left. So they actually show more. They consider not only the bistable case, but also the monostable case. If we consider, if we impose this condition, the ratio of u and 1 minus v take inf over the negative c, this guy is positive, then when they can construct. Then when they can construct a super subsolution. So it's kind of a technique assumption. So they basically show the results. It's just like this picture. And we can imagine when peace goes on, then the two front, they annihilate each other and then the U will occupy the whole space as they show that the long-term behavior like this. Long-term behavior like this. So, this is the first work about the two-front entire solution. We call it two-front entire solution for system to my best knowledge. So, the natural question is, can we have more complicated entire solution for the system LOV with strong with H case bigger than one, that that is a strong competition case. A strong competition case. So the answer is yes. We actually modified by the work of Yan Yu Cheng, Zhongsheng Guo, and the Ninomia Sensei, and Zhuhong Yao two years ago, they considered a scale equation with f is a bistable nonlinearity. So for example, the famous example is the Ellen Khan equation with this form, cubic function, and there are And there are three roots for the function: 0 and 1 is stable, and a is unstable. Okay, so they put the integral here is positive to determine the sign of speed. So they actually defined the entire solution originating from k fronts. So we have a k franc with different speed. So the speed should need to Needs to satisfy this order, become bigger and bigger. And so that when t tends to, sorry, this is a typo, it should be a negative infinity. Then the entire solution looks like several multiple waves growing with each other. And for convenience, we just call such. We just call such entire solution a k-front entire solution. So we actually care about the negative time behavior, very negative time behavior for the entire solution. So of course, if we want to understand the long time behavior when time tends to infinity, that probably we need to study the Cauchy problem. We put the initial at the It at the time equals to zero and started time behavior. I will show you some reference later. So, okay, so in this work, it can be this system supports three types of traveling waves. The first one is classical work done by Pfeiffer and McLaw. They show that the bistable wave connects zero and one, so it's a zero-one-way front. Zero one way front. And the sine speed is positive because this condition. So, more precisely, if f is this precise form, then the speed v naught can be calculated explicitly. So we can control the speed for scale equation. And then because the zero is stable, is unstable, so it's like. Unstable, so it's like KPP condition. It's like a KPP feature KPP equation. So we can have these two types of fronts because it's stable. So the stable states invades the unstable one. So the speed is negative and there is a minimal speed, sorry, maximum speed, negative speed. It's a critical value. So that's if the Value so that if the speed is below this one, then we have this form. And also, we have a minimum speed for another type of traveling wave. One is stable, so it invades the unstable one. So we have a minimum speed because the wave is moved to the left, so the V2 should be positive. It makes sense. Okay, so they, okay, so before I show their result, let me put some, I want to highlight some references. Uh, I want to highlight some references, and that's all because the related work is huge. I'm sorry, I couldn't provide more of them. So I just mentioned some earlier works. So the pilinear works should be from Amel and then Nadi Rosh Vadi, two papers, consider Fischer-KPP equation, the entire some entire solutions for the Solutions for the feature KPP equation. And yeah, G star, he considered the bistable equation. So he used the invariant manifold method. And then the Carl, Morita, and the Ninomia, they provide a simple way to consider this bi-stable wave. Consider this bi-stable wave, they consider the superstar solution method based on the comparison principle. And then, such kind of method was developed by Guo and Morita and Chen Gu. And also, Morita and the Ninomia, they provide a systematic way to find the super sub-solution. Roughly speaking, they provide a way to find the sub-solution. They provide a way to find some grouping functions to help us connect different states front. So, yeah. Okay. So this is results for them. They have under some condition I did not mention very precise, but anyway, there are three front entire solution, four front entire solution. Four front entire solution, but no k from entire solution if k is bigger than or equals to five. So we got the solution like that. And because time is limited, I need to move on. So let me show you our main result. So motivated by the Elenkan equation, we consider local battery type systems. So we system so we okay we draw the picture and it's very natural to find the u eu e v wave front and connect e v e star front and then connect e star eu front so it's very important to to to see the direction of the wave of the propagation wave because uh if to adjust Two adjacent front, one is moved this way and the one is moved this way, then it's not what we want because this means the two front will collide when T move in the negative direction. So the two front would collide with each other at finite time. So it's not what we want. So just keep in mind. So, so just keep in mind for construct the k front entire solution, we cannot have two fronts, two adjacent front, one is moved this, one is moved that. That way, so so from this, we have like this is a three-front entire solution for the system, and we can construct another type, and this type is forefront. Forefront entire solution for the local botter system. But here we did not connect because for this system we have one more equilibrium solution compared to Elenkan equation. We have four. So maybe this equilibrium solution may produce some more new type entire solution, but we did not construct successfully before. I will show you later. Successfully before. I will show you later about the ongoing work. Okay, so the first one, so the first result is EUEV E star EU front. So we can construct this front if H1 holds and H2. H2 is something like the similar condition as in the Morita and the Tachibana's paper. In the Tachibana's paper, it's a technical assumption to help us estimate our supersub solution, our differential inequality. But this one is quite important because we need to find out some parameter that satisfy this condition. This condition means this wave must be faster than this one. If not, then these two functions. Then these two fronts will collide with each other when time goes to the negative direction. So it's again a contradiction with our, let's say, definition of K-front. Okay, so after we construct suitable super-sub-solution defined only very negative time, we can show the behavior. Time, we can show the behavior, and then we also can show the long-time behavior because we can imagine eventually the U after some annihilation, you dominates the whole space. So this case is okay. Another case is different. This case is EU EV E star EV from. So this case also we can construct the super sub solution to Construct a super sub solution to produce this behavior when time is very negative. But after t becomes very big, we cannot give very precise information. In this paper, we cannot give a very precise information because the precise information should be after these two fonts collide each other, and then eventually we have one. We have one front move to the right. So, the question is: Can we show that the solution eventually converges to such kind of front? So, in this work, we did not succeed to prove it successfully. And the final, okay, so the third result is about the forefront. It's a symmetric case. Symmetric case, just use the refraction method to show this pattern. And we can show that when n is bigger or equal to 7, there is no n from entire series. So that means it's open for n equals to 5 and 6. And let me show you the so I skipped the idea of proof. It's basically modified the idea of the Morita. The idea of the Morita and the Nomia to find some suitable grouping functions to construct a super sub-solution and combine some estimates. And then undergoing work is about is there five franc or six franc entire solution? We probably can expect that they should have the zero state. Not that the E star is set up point, but that's But that means a trajectory. In all these sense, there is a trajectory to get into E star. So it's probably possible for large speed there is a wave connecting E star and zero. So if zero is included in the, let's say, the sequence, then it's my possible to get this. And this is actually our ongoing work. And finally, I will. Going work. And finally, I would like to say something about long-term behavior. So if we consider not the entire solution, we consider the initial value problem or coach problem, then there are some interesting work recently for bicep case. Korea consider the it's like a system version of traveling terraces. And we recently And we recently also showed that in bi-stable case, the solution can converges to one part converges to traveling bi-stable traveling wave, and the other part, the faster species, converges to the single KPP traveling wave with a Brownson correction. And for the strong weak competition, recently Lio and Lan. Recently, Lio and Len did a good job to extend the previous work of Louis Lee and Weinbergers. They found that in the strong, weak competition, the behavior can be very complicated. And also weak competition, we have some reference. If you are interested in this, you can check this paper. Okay, so thank you for your attention. So, thank you for your attention. I should stop here. Thank you. Thank you. So, it's time for discussion or other questions. So, I have questions. So, first of all, hi and thank you for a very nice talk with very nice results. And obviously, it's also a very nice introduction for my talk tomorrow. So, thank you. Did you? Did you so I have many questions, but maybe I'm going to choose one. Did you give any more thoughts to the E star zero fonts that you have here? E star zero? Yeah, I'm just because if the system is completely symmetric and if the diffusion coefficients are the same, then you can construct the trivial traveling wave connecting zero to E star. But what if the diffusion coefficients differ? What if, do you know? Efficiency differ. What if do you know if these fonts always exist? What's your conjecture on this? Yeah, I it's just conjecture. We haven't proved it successfully, but we expect that for the speed is very large, it should have. If the speed is large enough, you think these fonts always exist? Yeah, okay, conjecture. But not yet, maximum. Okay, and maybe another. And maybe another question, if that's okay with the chairman. Okay. Did you give any thoughts about the spatially periodic case where we know that it's much more difficult to discard the existence of intermediate stable steady states? Do you think that you can say anything about the special epidemic, or are it too much complicated? Sorry, pardon? Sorry, pardon? I didn't catch your question. Do you think that the specially periodic case is too complicated because of the possibility of stable intermediate states that we don't know how to discard properly? Or do you think that you can say some things even despite these stable states in the music? Yeah, I don't think it's a complicated. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. You're right. Who is next? I had one question. Hello? Go ahead. Yeah, Sikhut. Go ahead. Yeah. Thank you for a nice talk. In the beginning, I thought I heard you say that the diffusion coefficient D was going to be much larger than one, but then afterwards I didn't hear you talk about D any more, so did you make any assumptions about D? Did you make any assumptions about D? You mean the big D? Yes, yes. Oh, sorry. We did not impose any for any positive D. Okay, so this, whatever you said was valid for all positive D. Yeah, interesting. Yes, sorry. Yeah, thanks. Any other question? Yeah, I have one also. So you talked about the entire solutions of this problem, then you mentioned the Cauchy problem. So there is a very natural question. Now, if you take a bounded solution of the Cauchy problem, it approaches a set of entire solutions. But it's not clear whether all or some of these. All or some of the entire solutions you have constructed can actually occur in the as the limit solution solutions of a bounded solution of the Cauchy problem. Okay, so do you have any idea about say which of your solutions are actually limits in some sense of a solution? Of a solution of the causal problem? Yeah, that's a good question. Sometimes it's very natural. Yeah, sometimes it's very natural. But not always. Yeah. Yeah, that's a very good question. Yeah, so far, I didn't know how to answer this question. Yeah. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, nice question. Thank you. I should think about it. Thank you. I should think about it. Yeah. All right. So there are no other questions for Cheng Hong. We'll have a break of, let's see, we start at 8.
