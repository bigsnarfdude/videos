Together, because I think that's how we really get solid. So, thank you very much. And I think, as the last speaker, it's my privilege to ask you all to join me. Well, we have one in person, but hopefully, that's named standard. Yeah, but we demolished our organizers. Okay, so the goal of the talk, I have two goals because I feel like the perspective of my talk, the audience, is in roughly two parts. So the first part is I'm going to introduce another way that matroids show up at the interface grape geometry, tropical geometry. So another way matroids occur. At the algebraic geometry triangle interface. And this is particularly for people who, the part of the audience that has not seen the historical thoughts on this audio, on this topic. And for this, I have to thank my robot and Nick for the excellent introduction. For people who have For people who have seen multiple versions of this, there'll be a bit some update on its progress. And I'm hoping that I will get some problems that I want to try to sell to this community. But I think I might do the cheeky thing of if the clock runs out, I'll push one of the toilet to the 11 o'clock session. So that's the plan. I also want before the port buckle. What a philosophy difference. What a philosophy difference that comes out of this approach is that one of the themes I think of this week has been, well, we all love matroids, but that we're treating matroids all, I was about to say the word uniformly, which doesn't quite make sense, but as all equal in their own right. And I think in in this story, maybe not all eight twins are equal. Maybe not for 823. Okay, so that's the more bump introduction. Let me now start to, on this goal, start to tell you what am I talking about. So if I start with X in projective space, so projective variety, then we get a tropical variety. We get a tropical variety contained in tropical objective space. If you haven't seen this before, I'm not going to completely tell you what it is, but we'll say a definition would be that the closure of the valuation of x. So what do we mean by this? X is a projective space. I want to work over a field with a valuation, which means I have a way for every coordinate, I can turn it into a real number, and I just take the collection of all of those real numbers, take the closure. Real life is take the picture. So, again, if you've seen any talk of this before, you know that in this sense we get pictures like this. Okay, so what is this and is it a good thing? But I want to start with the good side of tropical drug treating in this sense is that there's, well, we've done a lot of things in the last 20 years. So the good side is I'm going to say last 20 years Last 20 years, and we have in the room some of the people who've made some of the biggest advances in this set. So that's the good. The less good is that this is a shadow that sometimes loses too much information. Loses too much information. Loses a lot of information. So to give you an example of what I'm thinking about for this, if I show you that this is the tropicalization of a curve in P2, so that's trop X. And the question would be: is X? And the question would be: is X smooth? So in tropical geology, we have the notion of tropically smooth. So there are sub-tropical varieties that you can look at and say, yes, this is smooth. But there are some like this that you look at and you're not sure. So we know that x is the variety of a z squared plus b x z plus c. C YZ plus DXY contained P2 and you do the calculation and you decide it's smooth unless AD minus BC B0. So the answer is maybe. For some values of the curve, it's smooth, for some it isn't. And just looking at this picture, we don't remember. So this is one of the issues with trouble. So this is one of the issues with tront for geometry. In some sense, we're throwing away too much, at least in this formulation, we're throwing away too much information. Okay, so what's the solution that I want to pitch in this talk, this is an approach that Felipe and I have been working on for many years, based after work with Jeff and Jericho Hughes. Is I'm going to replace I'm going to replace varieties to schemes. So, for the non-algebraic geometers in the OS, the cheat sheet is, if I have an affine scheme, this is changing, when you rephrase it in algebra, this would be changing radical ideals in the column over your end variables, just ideals. In variables. So sometimes, for people who are not hard to break geometers, say schemes sound scarier, but from the perspective of this thing, we're really removing a hypothesis that you're likely to scarier. And what I will try and convince you is that this is a useful thing for some of the topics. So we'd like to do this in tropical geometry though. And in principle, it sounds straightforward. Principle, it sounds straightforward. We know, we saw already in Nick's talk yesterday, we know how to tropicalize this. We're just going to replace K by the tropical suburb. And we know what to do with ideals. So in principle, we can say, and I'll switch back to kind of to projective world. So if I'm given J an ideal in homonym in variables, then I get truck J. I get Trop J contained in the semi-ring of tropical polynomials. So here we have R bar is by tropical semi-ring. So this is R unit infinity with operations tropical plus, which is minimum, and tropical times, which is addition. So this is the tropical. Okay, so the idea here, and we saw this already. Okay, so the idea here, and we saw this already yesterday, we're just forming a semi-rig, flick of polynomials with coefficients in the trot-mausing ring. And what is trop J? Trop J is I just take every polynomial of my original ideal and I tropicalize it. And tropicalization, by the left, is if F is the sum of monomials with coefficients, tropicalize. monomials with coefficients, trop F is the tropical sum of the valuation of Cp times XP. So the idea is the banquet tropical geometry is returning multiplication into addition, addition into minimum. And so we take our polynomial, we turn multiplication into addition, addition into minimum, and take the valuation coefficients. So we turn a usual polynomial into a username. Turn a usual polynomial into a tropical polynomial. And then the tropicalization of the ideal is just the tropicalization of every polynomial in the ideal. And I don't think you want it to write in J. Okay, yeah. Thank you. Maybe you should pause for a moment to any other typos or questions. Okay, so a naive definition would say I want to look at my homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring, I should just look at homogeneous ideals in the tropical semi-ring, in the semi-ring of tropical polynomials. So the naive definition, we would say a sub-scheme of tropical projective space corresponds to a homogeneous ideal in our bar adjoining exposure to XM. A usual sub-scheme with projective A usual sub-scheme of projective space corresponds to a homogeneous ideal in the usual polynomial ring. And so it's natural to just think, okay, we're just going to drop a colon star store. I put the word naive there, though, so you already appride to realize that there's a problem. From my perspective, the problem is that varieties could be arbitrary. So, what do I mean by that? So, first, what's the variety of a tropical ideal? I think we saw it maybe in a few talks separately, index again. But if I have i cut in r bar adjoint x0 up to xn, then the variety of i will be just the set of the slogans normally, so I want to be a tropical projective space, so I'll write in after the n plus 1 takeaway. 1 take away any infinities with plus 1 mod R1. So this is just tropical projective space, such that the minimum in trop F, sorry, in F of W is infinity or achieved at least twice for all F U R. Okay, so that's our variety. This is just, if you've seen the definition of tropical variety before, this is it. And what's the problem? We could get things like we could get a disk. So this is not what you're used to seeing in pictures of tropical geometry. So we should contrast that with the case that the ideal is the tropicalization of an actual ideal. Of an actual idea. So we get things that are round, for example. And we should contrast this with if i is truck j, then the variety of i is the support of a r rational. Find out our rational polyhedral complex of dimension the dimension of I. So here, this is Joe, we'll draw pictures like this. Okay, so we want to contrast the disk, which is what can happen if I start with an arbitrary ideal, with the pictures that, if you've seen any pictures of tropical geometry, you're used to seeing. So the finite polyhedral places. So r rational means facets, so each of the polyhedron, the facets are rational, but the vertices might be in the real numbers. So that's the problem. We're not happy with this as a main definition. Okay. So getting before adapted to the solution from our perspective, questions or comments? Okay. So the solution is matroids to the rescue. Matroids to the rescue. Okay, so this is why I'm talking about this at a matroid theory. So the solution, and this is the program provided for me pay after Jenser Cuses, who is the square, so that's Jeff and his brother Jenserus Cuser, who had one of the first papers in this direction. Papers in this direction. And maybe the slogan would be Matroids to the miscube. But here's the key fact. We're talking over here, if I have an ideal of a usual polynomial ring, a homogeneous ideal, the key fact is that the graded pieces are subspaces of all polynomials of degree D. So So J an ideal control x1 up to xn, which I call s. Then I have jd is contained in s d, so this is the graded piece. So this is a subspace, and this is a vector space with a distinguished basis, with basis monobials of degree. Monovials of degree. So, this is the story we've been talking about all week for the realizable point of view. I just gave you a subspace of a vector space with a distinguished basis. Okay, so what does that mean? That means that Jd, so we've got to say J D is a more determined A parentheses evaluated matroid of the ground set Mon D, where MON D is these monomials are treated. So I get naively, it's a subspace, I get a Betroid. Bitroid, for those of you who are new to value-rated Bitroids, valuable Bitroids are a generalization where I just remember the valuation of all of the elements of the subspace as well. So you take my subspace, instead of just remembering the support of elements or the dependencies, what I'm going to do is I will remember just take the valuation of every vector, that gets to be a bunch of vectors in R to the N, which are called the vectors across the value of vectors. Which are called the vectors across the R8 vector. But I think for the purposes of this talk, you could listen along just hearing the words the vector and the organ vector. Okay. So that lets us turn it around and make this the definition. So the definition is a homogeneous ideal. I contain that the semi-ring of tropical polar mobiles is a tropical ideal. FID is the set of vectors of evaluated vector, set of vectors. Of vectors of the evaluated matroid, I'm going to repeat this in just the matroid language in a moment, on 1d. So on monomials of 3d. And equivalently, I could start with an ideal where my coefficients are now in the Boolean semi-ring. This is the semi-ring version of the cluster hyperfield. Version of the Classroom field, so just zero and infinity. This corresponds to taking the trivial valuation. And then we're saying that the support of F for F in ID is the set of cycles, the set of cycles, that's unions of circuits, of a metro. So, this is not always the case. Start with a non-example and then do it through an example. But the idea is we're putting, instead of taking an arbitrary ideal in the semi-irregular tropical polyvales, which we don't like because it gives us an arbitrary, it gives us varieties that just don't look like they belong in the tropical geometry world. We're going to have a we're going to impose this matroidal condition. We're going to impose this matroidal condition on each grade of piece, and from that is what we're going to call the tropical idea. And then I won't go into the details here, but then we're going to use that to define sub-schemes of tropical projective space. Medians of circuits, not just that is not the word circuit. Oh, that's that's that is exactly what circuits are. Cycles and you do circuits. Yeah, cycle is an ego so it's pretty much why I love it. So evaluated matroid land we talk about circuits and vectors and those are the generalization in usual matroids of circuits and cycles being the bits of circuits. Question. So, is there any compatibility market? So, they have to be an ideal. So, this is cooked into the requirement that they be an ideal. So, what does it mean to be an ideal? It means these xi times id is contained in this fi d itself. And so this is. And so this is. So I presented this to you over a semi-ring, which I think is easier. The front row here would like to replace this by tracks and bends. Then you do have to put slightly more or different compatibility requirements because it's not automatic from the root ideally. You don't know. You have to artificially describe an ideal. So what is the relation between our metropolitan condition? How do you translate that? So it it be it becomes a condition. One way of saying it is that every vector here, and so I think Nick said this one way yesterday, every vector, when you move it up, it translates it. So if you have a vector on one over degree d, that gives you a vector on x i times. Moderns of degree d plus one divisible by xr. Of degree d plus 1 divisible by xi, and every vector here has to be a vector here. And that's why it's important that we say cycles, because you could start with circuits here, but they might turn into cycles here. Your circuit, when you move up, might work into a unique circuits. Other questions? Perhaps we'll just do a non-EG, non-example first, just to maybe make it clear. If I look at x plus y contained in R or R and look at xy, then you look in degree 2, so this is I. In degree 2, well what do we have? We have x squared plus xy, so it's a tropical operation, we have xy We have xy plus uy squared, and then we have combinations of them. So I guess we could say these are combinations of this. And the problem here is that this is not a matroid y, because you look at these, if you look at just the supports, you want to eliminate x times y, and we can't do that because there's no subtraction in the topical segment. So this is the non-example that we're examining. So this is the non-example that would exactly try to hold out. So a tropical ideal that involved x plus y would also, in this case, the elimination is unique, it would also have to contain x squared plus y squared. And I think we saw an example very similar to this also at Nick's Trot when he was explaining that these ideals are almost always infinitely generated. Okay, so that's the nod example. The example is, as we want to say, whenever I is troped. To say whatever i is trot j for j contained in the usual quality. So that was the whole point. We said graded pieces here are vector space, subspaces of the vector space that's the graded piece here. That exactly tropicalizes to a latroid or a parameter electrode. So this is the key example. So the point of this definition is it's giving us a synthetic inside. That's a synthetic inside tropical geometry definition of things that include this, but what I'll try and play now is behave a bit more like what we expect from our third job. Okay. So any more questions, comments about the definition before I go on? We absolutely do not because these are never finally generated, basically. It doesn't translate to anything about elevation movements. They're basically never finally generated. The only almost the only finally generated ones are whatever ideal. So it's just finite generation. Finite generation is just the wrong thing to talk about. I wasn't planning to say there is an Ethereum-like property in this world, but it's not a literal finite generation. Let me tell you what we do know about it. Do not. My handwriting on this ball is quite matchy here. So we have, so this is with William Bay. So if I is a tropical ideal, well, I set it up so that this was meant to be the solution to my problem. So you won't be shocked to learn that tropical ideals solve the problem I told you. If I take the variety, then the variety of I is the support of a balanced finite R rational on a huge complex. So Ami told us about balancing in his talk. This is this condition that we have, you know, that we're not, it's not just, not only is it a polyhedral complex, it's not an arbitrary polyhedral complex, but we have this zero tension condition around every vertex in the case of this picture. So that was, for those who have seen me keep talk about this before, but after a while, this. Before, but for a while, this was something that we didn't have in our first version. It turned out to be significantly harder than we expected. Can you recall how you define the weights? So the weights are defined in exactly the same way as usual. So in the usual case, one way to define the weights is to take the initial degeneration and count the multiplicity of the initial degeneration. And you can do all of that in this world. So from a computational perspective, So from a computational point of view, initial degenerations are passed to an initial ideal in the current sense, and there is a grove of theory here. So you take the initial degeneration of the tropical ideal. Take the initial degeneration of the tropical ideal. That is again the tropical ideal. And it makes sense to, from the variety point of view, I mean to think of this as a union of torus orbits, the tropical z, but you could define a multiplicity of that. But I can can think of it as kind of the minimum slopes of functions that are that's it probably. Well, but in some sense in the embedded case, I mean in this sort of embedded case, that's what I mean the multiplicity is the multiplicity you expect is measuring multiplicities for the shorter generations. I mean, I'm not just in trouble, but It is not related. I mean, finite generation, we will discuss that. Why do you emphasize R bar rational? R bar, also, should be bar. Yeah, our rational. Sorry, second. Well, what's not rational? What's not rational over the reals? The rational are rational means that the facet normals are rational. So it's a polyhedron of the sort x to the ax is less than or equal to b, where this has rational entries and this can be equal. So the idea is that the facet normals are rational, but the vertices are far. Rational media and q. So I okay. I don't I mean it's a really passive both. Okay. Other codes? We should go. Unfortunately the definition definition unfortunately has to go. So definition again was each graded piece is electrode. So second part is we have a notion of dimension. This is something that also This is something that McChick also said yesterday. So the Hilbert function, H of D being the rank of the matroid of I D is eventually polynomial. So that means H of the H is the H. So that means H of B is P of D for D is sufficiently large. And this gives us a definition of dimension and degree in arithmetic genus, for example. If I start with you, I'm having So, if I start with here, if I have a usual sub-scheme of projective space or projective variety, you look at the Hilbert polynomial, the degree of the polynomial gives you the dimension, the leading coefficient tells you what the degree is, and the constant term tells you determines the alphabetic genus. So that means we can define all of these for sub schemes of alpha vector space. Okay, so and that means actually. And that means actually, I've already changed this, now that I've told you there is a definition of dimension, I can say of dimension the dimension of. And that's also something that we didn't know at our first one. So we cannot say, I mean, Forabin asks this question: we cannot say pure yet because we don't yet have a notion of irrelevant. I think there's naive notions that saying that talking about prime ideals here is not the correct notion of vertices. Okay, so we saw already that there are tropical ideals not of the form Trop J, the J in Top J for J in a polynomial, an ideal in the usual polynomial. Okay, so there's some small ideals we saw some more in this talk. And so the question might be which matroids have what we'll call a tropical skin structure? And so by that, what do I mean? I mean, for which matroids is there an ideal or for which the degree one piece of the ideal is the circuit is the span of the circuits of the matroid, so it consists of the cycles of the matroid, and the variety of the ideal should be the vertical span. should be the vertical fire of electrode. So i will want i1 to be the cycles of everyone. So that tells us a little bit about this. In particular, the answer is yes for M. For M realizable, you just take your subspace realizing it, you take the ideal of the polynomial's banish, you got it, and you tropicalize. And it's known in general. So this is the work of Jan Dreisberg and Friedrich Ricon, and this was the BAMOS plus that was U2. That's the huge thing. Direct sun choose for me. So there's no tropical ideal with this variety and directly. Doesn't the second condition imply the first one about the cyclists? If I read it with weights, at least? Yes. So, right, so but we don't have an example of a non-realized An example of a non-realizable matroid with a tropical skewed structure. So the question is: are there non-realizable matroids that have tropical skewed structures, or is this somehow a realizable matroid thing? And in any case, this is where I come and go, well, you know, maybe not every matrix is quite equal from this perspective. Okay. The next theorem, so this is the update part, is tropical ideals. Tropical ideals set by the British articles. So let me give it to you in two ways. The first is the weak Nushtalzatz. So the usual first course was the weak Nushtalzatz. A variety is empty, if it only one is the ideal. If it only is the ideal of the variety. So we say if the variety of I, so here again, I is a trophic ideal, is empty, then, well, I'm stating this projectively, so I is contained in the irrelevant ideal variables. So that's the weak Lustralzats. That's what we've done for a while. I think we're finishing at the moment is the strong Lustalzatz. Is the stronger stalesats. And I'm going to, for convenience, I'm going to switch to neuron polynomials because that's going to make it easier for me to state it. But the story is morally the same. And I should have said, I think I said this earlier, I'm telling the story as if it's about subschemes of tropical projective space, but there are versions for subschemes of any tropical drug variety. So there's nothing the land point generality versus that thing was. Getter altar here, which is that we look in the historical varieties. Do you want to have the toggle the other way? Yeah. There you have a multi-grade toggle function, which is how it's related to the step-upology of the game button. That was another question. Just that the containment probably goes the other way in the leaf in stores. This is saying it's empty, right? I'll tell you, am I screwing up? Anti, am I screwing up? Oh, sorry, no, I'm screwing up. Sorry, yes, thank you. Thank you, sorry. I haven't, yeah, bored blankets. But like a radical or a lie or something like that? If I isn't in, what's what we have to do? But it shouldn't be like i contains a power of the Yeah. I can see where the right. Yes, okay. That was true. Well, yes, thank you. Cannot do that. Yeah, one of those borderline misstatements. Let's hope the next one I've actually do. Because that's actually. Okay, so I'm going to despite what do we expect astronomical sense to say? We expect it to say in. To say the ideals of polynomials vanished, the ideal is the variable of the ideal I started with. Or let me translate that. If the hypersurface of F contains the variety, then some power of F is contained in the ideal. That's the usual structure. I'm going to give you two versions now, depending on a property of the ideal that I don't completely understand, but maybe this is something. Again, this is something that I'll throw out to if anyone has any insight into it. I'm going to say I has the sub-lattice property. If for all L contained in Z to the N, so all sublattices, the variety of I intersect R bar to the L is the variety of L L L L L L L L L Is the variety part. So, what do I need by that? So, for example, if L was 2z to the n, then we would be asking the variety of i intercept r bar to the x plus or minus 2, xn plus or minus 2 plus the value of n. Okay, so we're just passing to a subgroup. We're just passing to a subwritten, but it's a, sorry, and this should be for all finite index lattices. So I want to pass just to finite index lattices, and my hope is that this does not change the variety. So we're sort of asking, one occlusion is straightforward, but there is the danger that this variety a priori would be larger. That you might somehow find that something that determines the variety never shows up with the lattice. That's at least a priori. Up with the buttons. That's at least a priori. I keep asking these questions, but this is about just the sets, not about weights. This is just about the, yeah, yeah, and this one is honestly just about the sets, not about weights. Because we will definitely, if the polynomial, well I haven't written it left out, but the polynomial we're going to compare to I yeah, yeah, this this one you might change the weight. Yeah, you would expect to change the weight you would expect to change the weights by the index of the lattice. To change the way it's finding the index of the lattice in this case. Or depending on how you define what I mean by this variety. Okay. If I have a matroid and I know that it has symmetric powers in the sense of one of the talks from earlier this week, that's not enough to construct a. It is enough? That is exactly. So this symmetric power story was exactly the common. The combinatorialization of is the answer yes to this question. Ah, okay. But yeah, that's exactly the problem with how do you do this, right? We know what it is, yeah, maybe I should say one more sequence. We know what the degree one part of the ideal is, and the question is what's the degree two part, what's the degree three part, and so on. And the danger is, well, you know what the matrix are on x1 times on monomials of degree two divided by x1, and monomials are between two divided by one. And one of the meals are between two divided by x2. But doing the eliminations between these, this is half determined. And you don't know if it's possible without missing out the variety afterward. Okay, so I want to say it has the sublattice property if this, and so now here's the strawberry source. So suppose F is my tropical polynomial and the variety of F. And the variety of f contains the variety of i. So this is the one where, so this is just saying classically, f is of the ideal, in the classical world this is f is of the ideal of the variety. And so classically, we would expect to say some power of f is of the ideal. So if f, so if i r has the sub-lattice property, Sublattice property that we know that f to the n is an i for some i and otherwise in general we'll find a power of the convexification of m is an i. So what's the convexification of n? This is the Of f. This is the polynomial that has the same function as f, but as small coefficients as possible. So it's complexification somehow. If you figure out its extended Newton polytope, all the vertices are all the Newton polytope. So column F has the same function as F, but it's as small. Coefficients as possible. And so the example would be: if I gave you start at x squared plus 0, so as a function, it's the minimum of 2x and 0, then the capacification would be x squared plus x plus 0. Okay, because the minimum of 2x, x, and 0 is the same as a function. Is the same as a function as the minimum of 2x at 0, but this has a smaller coefficient. Here, the coefficient in x is infinity, here it's 0. And then so the claim is, if we don't have this subditus property, at the moment all we can prove is that the convexification of F, a power of the convexification of F, lies in the idea. So let me maybe tell you, give it to you a tiny bit, but this. Tell me a bit you're a tiny bit, but this is not a completely crazy condition to be asking for because it's true for realizable activity. Okay, so this is true. So is true. So if I has drop J then J satisfies sorry I sat I has the subtitles fly and the idea is sorry I have to I was about to screw this up but I've managed to go with to not copy this piece of class into it like that. The okay, so why is that? The idea is that R bar adjoint L is the troponization of k x1 plus or minus 1 up to xn plus or minus 1, the g invariance where g is z n mod L. In my example, in this example, my quotient would My quotient would be a product of z mod 2's. And so, how does that act on the polynomial ring? It just acts on the polynomial ring by setting xi to minus xi. The invariant ring will just be even generated by even variables. And so we're getting an invariant ring. And what's the content? The content here is: this is an action by roots of unity, so it doesn't change the variety. So if I pass. The variety. So if I pass, we'll change, we'll basically replace. So if I go to so the variety of, so the tropicalization of the variety of I intersect K1 plus minus 1 up to XK plus 1 to 1 G variance is the topicalization. So that should be J. The topicalization of the high ID of J. And why? Because what we've just done. Why? Because what we've just done is we've multiplied, we've taken our variety and we've taken the orbit under a group that's acted by roots of unity. Roots of unity always have triggered evaluation. So we know what this is saying is it's always true for realizable ideals. And we know it's also true, you can almost reduce it to polynomials of one variable. And there we know it's true if the polynomials have distinct roots. Polynomials have distinct roots, and we can show it's true for polynomials of bounded degree. We tried to look for a counterexample and we failed. So I kind of expect the question maybe is do all ideals, all topic ideals have this property? I kind of suspect the answer might be yes. Suspect the answer might be yes. And what we're seeing is this is somehow seeing that the tropical ideal is remembering something about this group action, even though the group action tropicalizes trivially. So this seems to be true in subsequence at least. Okay, so I have a few minutes where I'll try and put in some of the problems that I think before I erase the city. Maybe before I still see any questions there. I suppose this operation of taking the radical or the convex radical of an idea is not closed in the world. So this is precisely why I did not phrase it as the radical. Because the radical, actually, right now I'm forgetting. Right now I'm forgetting whether we actually have a counter example or just a couple examples. I think we do have a counter example. That's a couple things. I think we do have a couple of examples. I think the radical would not be a tropical ideal, which is why we've rephrased it in in this way as a power isn't that. No, this is one of the things, one of the major things that we have to rephrase and focus on which bit we actually care about when we pass to from ideals, from the usual world to the semi-read world. Okay. So here's some problems. There's no action of G. There's one as module N, and then there will be an action and then defining. No, no, no, no, no. So classically, the actions of the whole polymer, and the invariant ring is the intersection. Variant ring is the intersection with health. So by example, my group action was xi goes to minus xi. The invariant ring is generated by xi squared. And that's what I was asking. I was asking the ideal intersect thus the evenomies where every exponential is even, but that should have to say variety. Same problem with variety. Okay, so the first question is how is the geometry, this is sort of the meta question. So how is the geometry of X encoded in the tropicalization of the ideal X? If I start with, I've been phrasing it as project subschemes of. Phrasing it has subschemes of projective space. If I look at the ideal defining them, so the question was: I could tropicalize that, and the question is: how is the geometry encoded there? Dimension, degree, arithmetic genus, those are all things that are encoded in the Hilbert polynomial, so we're okay with. So degree genus or a good. So So, one question I would raise is: what about smoothness? So, consider the polynomial you get. Yeah, so the polynomial you get is the same polynomial. The dimension, the rate of the matroid is the degree of the gradient. Okay, so what about smoothness? So, I asked you this question at the start. I said, look, one of the problems is this, we don't know when I see this picture, is it smooth or not? It turns out. Is it smooth a lot? It turns out in this particular example that the tropical ideal determines smoothness. So the degree 3 matroid of trop J or trop I of X determines if X is If X is straight. This was the conic, in the plane. I said there's one locus where it's for most choices of parameters, it's smooth. There's one locus where it's singular. And if you look at the degree 3 matroid, it's easiest to look at the Plooker coordinate version. There is one Plocker coordinate that vanishes exactly if this curve is set. If this curve is secure. Otherwise, it is not zero. So that means that the tropical ideal in this case does know whether or not this curve is secure. So we are adding a little bit of extra information. I've done a few more experiments, but I don't know the story in general. And I think this would be... It's a hint that there is more, more of the geometry is being encoded. And so a couple more votes. Does this work in example or does this work in general? This example and inspired examples, but I do not yet have a theorem. No, I'm sorry. I do not have any theorems about this yet. I just have some intriguing examples of those. Okay. Other questions? Other question is what can we say about the mental of ID for being very large. So Vick gave us some examples yesterday where these matrix were paid in, but those are very, very, very, very, very, very, very special. These matroids were. Special. These matroids are essentially devopaic. So that tells us, given that most matroids are paving, this is telling us that these are special atroids that show up. And the reason why they're not paving is if you have a polynomial in your ideal in degree D, then x to the enormous power times that polynomial will still be in degree D, but Will still be in degree D, but unless you're zero-dimensional, the rate of the matrix will be large, so this will be a surface or a vector, a dependence that's of too small size to be paying. So if one believes that conjecture that almost all matroids are paying, doesn't that sort of almost give a proof that most matroids are not realizable by topical ideas? Oh no, no, this is a statement about large degree. No, no, this is a statement about large degree. Not small degree. I mean, if it were true that almost all neutroids can be extended to tropical ideas, like there's symmetric powers out of it, then if you believe that almost all matroids are paving matroids, then that would be true for almost all. Paving matroids, you just said it's not true. No, no. This D large is very important here. Large is very important here. Putting a skip structure on a matroid is a statement about the degree one part of the ideal, and this is a statement about the degree a thousand part of the ideal. Oh, you see, yeah, and the fact that it's not paving only becomes true for non-zero-dimensional things in large degree. Okay, and maybe do I have one more minute? So the variety. The V of I is determined by the valuated matroid of I D again for D sufficiently large. And you have to go, there's a few subtleties, you have to go beyond the degrees you might expect, but for every If we go to a large enough degree, larger than the degree of the tropical basis, for tropical experts, then we just need to know one matroid to know the variety. And so the question now becomes, okay, we know that the varieties look, they have pictures like this, or maybe like this. And so the question becomes, what matroid of variants deterbit the properties of these pictures? And this pleasing people, geometry/slash/combinatorics of these pictures. So, for example, there's a notion that, which both of these pictures satisfy, of a tropical variety being tropically smooth. Tropical variety being tropically smooth, that means that the star of everything should be like a burning fad of a natroid. Can we detect that the picture, that the variety is going to have this tropical smooth property, this locally matroidal property, from just this one big degree D matroid. Talk about variety, tropical varieties being tropically irreducible, which implies the original thing is irreducible, so that's saying that I can't write it as a union of. Lighted as a union of two other balanced polyhedral complexes. Can we detect that from the spectroid? So the idea being, I just go up to, you know, I go up to degree 1,000, that gives me one matroid, it's a matroid unfortunately on an enormous round set, but it's one matroid. That matroid knows these pictures, so somewhere encoded inside the matroid is the questions I just asked. Is this combinatorics? But my question is what? And then the last question. So if you need a miss network, it's very easy to see. Okay, well, I'll say one last question. And then I'll just keep it up a little bit. So the last question is, more generally okay, we've heard about a lot of Make Twitter variants. I mean, for example, everyone's favourite Make Twitter variant in this room. Everyone's favourite matrix invariant of this room, tuck polynobial and its friends. What do those invariants tell you about the geometry max? The fact that these matroids for a large degree are somehow are saying something, what do those matroids, they must have geometric, well they either have geometric content that we already know about, or they have geometric content that we shouldn't try to exploit just inside underwear geometry. So what is the meaning of other matriarchs? For this, personally, I'm particularly interested in the case here where my tropical ideal is realizable. So I start with an actual variety, I tropicalize it, an actual sub-scheme of projective space or your favourite toroid variety. Space or your fingertips work right, and I tropicalize it, and now I want to find something about my original classical subsequent projective space from looking at one of these big matrix of high degree and computing some matrix invariance. That's telling us something about the geometry, what is it? That I have we have no ideas yet, but I think it's a question I will not be able to answer to. So it's a good place to start. Thank you. Thank you. Two questions. So, first, do you have a candidate for what a smooth tropical ideal should be, could be? So, as a definition, no. But the experiments I've been doing is basically essentially stratify a hill scheme. You could take the Hilbert scheme with stratify according to plant for tropical ideal.
