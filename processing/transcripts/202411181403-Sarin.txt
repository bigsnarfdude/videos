So, but when you really read this title, what I want you to read is actually this. So, trying to leverage indirect observations of merging neutron star binaries, because we haven't had any more direct ones. And this talk was actually written in collaboration with ChatGPT, so that's my link to machine learning. So, I'm going to start straight away because I think most people are familiar with obviously GW70 and X17 and multi-message RAS as a form of the gravitational wave concept. But really, you know. Wave context. But really, you know, we're interested in these things because it's a way to understand really big fundamental questions in astrophysics. So, in particular, for example, and this is not exhaustive in any way, you know, the chemical enrichment of the universe. We can make elements up to sort of iron in a supernova, but where do the R-process elements come from? Where did the coal come from? And then, similarly, in the same way, and if you look at the top panel plot over there, which is what we call the phase diagram of the unit. Which is what we call the phase diagram of the universe. Neutron stars exist in this really exotic regime, which are really high density, but in terms of their Fermi energy, they're basically zero temperature. So they give you a probe into really high density nuclear matter in conditions that are basically inaccessible in terrestrial experiments. And especially when you get to sort of the post-merger environment, they go right into this phase, which is hot, but then it's also still extremely dense. So it gives you a chance to potentially pro at things like. To potentially probe that things like the clock can only be compliant transition, etc. So 1708-17 happened, and we did all this. You know, we tried to make our first constraints, and then 2017, we were really optimistic about we're going to see each of these all the time, no problem. Except we didn't. And so, really, what I want to sort of emphasize is that, yeah, that's kind of depressing in a way, but it's also not too bad because there's a lot of different observations, windows that we have into these emerging systems that are not actually just, you know. That are not actually just gravitational wave observations or binary neutron star systems. So, in particular, the things that I want to focus on here are sort of neutron star observations in radio, the pulsar observations we have, or the pulsed star with an unknown compact object. We have obviously got other gravitational wave observations, which not only tell us about binary evolution that gets us there, but also have neutron star observations of potentially at least one neutron star system in the merger itself. You have recently. Merger itself. You have recently started getting these putative coherent radio emissions from short GRBs. So short GRB happens, and then minutes later or hours later, people have been detecting these coherent radio emission that seems to be very analogous to an FIB. So if this is linked to the short GIB phenomena, to the merging neutron star phenomena, how is it related? What can we extract about physics from that? And then you obviously have short GRB C cells, which we sort of talked about, how we can use that. About how we can use that. You have ultra-strip supernovae, so surveys like ZTF, and in the near future, Arubin, etc., we're seeing a lot of these things: ultra-strip supernovae, the progenitor systems of at least double neutron star systems. And then, of course, potentially, you know, in the near future, we'll have Gaia observations of progenitor systems of neutron star Gaia. So, really, you know, what I want to sort of emphasize is what the combinations of these observations tell us, and what can we actually extract from. And what can we actually extract from the observations we already have and hope to have in the near future from all these different channels? So, thinking about a binary neutron star merger, here's a little schematic that we, from a review paper we wrote with Paul Vaski in 2020, showing essentially what happens with a binary neutron star merger schematic. So in panel A, you've got two neutron star mergers, the gravitational waves are bringing them closer and closer. In panel B, you have the actual merger itself. And there's a whole heap of pathways that can happen. Heap of pathways that can happen. And these pathways depend essentially on the mass of the binary, so the total mass of the binary, and something known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Walkoff mass, which is the maximum allowed non-rotating mass of the general state. So immediately, if you're above sort of 1.5 times this MTOV number, what we think happens, and we can see this in numerical simulations as well, is that you immediately promptly collapse into a black hole. So this is shown in panel A, B, and C. So within A, B, and C. So within 100 milliseconds or even shorter time scales, you immediately form a black hole. And this is above sort of 1.5 times MTOV. Now, the non-rotating limit, MTOV, that's the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star. But because the neutron star that is born in these systems immediately afterwards, this proto-neutron star in a sense, is really rapidly rotating and differentially rotating and has, you know, it's really hot. Has you know it's really hot, it can actually support itself against gravitational collapse for some amount of time. So, this is shown in panel B. This is known as this hypermassive neutron star. So, if you sort of looked at neutron star simulations, so if you looked at supernova simulations, it's a very analogous sort of system to that, obviously just much more confined. And this thing is supported by differential rotation and this thermal gradients. And so, when that differential rotation and thermal gradience go away, we expect on a time scale of one second or so. If you're still One second or so. If you're still above the MPOV threshold, then you're going to actually collapse into a black hole on a much more delayed time scale relative to the chrome collapse, but still that time scale is about one second. In that one second, all the multi-messenger signals change completely. So we want to know what's happening, but until we know the mass of the binary and until we know the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Walkoff mass, which is a property of the equation state, we don't know exactly what part of each particular equation is. If you're below sort of another threshold known as the super massive threshold, which is this threshold where rigid body rotation can support yourself against gravitational collapse, then you're actually going to make something called a super massive neutron star, which is shown in this panel of head. And now this neutron star is going to survive for about 10 to the 4, 10 to the 5, 10 to the 6 seconds. And it's going to have a completely different electromagnetic gravitational wave signature. And again, all of these things are going to change depending on time. All of these things are going to change depending on the time scale. And then, that you know, once it loses that support because of gravitational wave radiation or electromagnetic torques, etc., it's going to have a delayed collapse on time scales of 10 to the 6th, 10 to the 5 seconds into a black hole, and that's shown in the panel. Now, if you happen to have a merger that, for whatever reason, is below the M2AV, the total mass, then you're actually going to have a neutron star merger that ends up making another neutron star, a really heavy neutron star. Whether that happens in nature, of course, we don't know. Happens in nature, of course, we don't know for how often. So, zooming in onto the electromagnetic part explicitly, you have, you know, in this sort of just going back for a second, if I take this particular snapshot of time and zoom in on the electromagnetic side of things, you have this little central engine, which could be a black hole or it could be a hypermassive neutron star. Around it is a thick accretion disk of probably 0.3, 0.4 solar mass, or potentially up to 0.1 solar mass. 2.1 solar mass. Some process, we don't know exactly what, launches an ultra-relativistic jet. We know that there was an ultra-relativistic jet in 1708-17, and we expect that to happen for quite a lot of neutron-star mergers. And that ultra-relativistic jet sort of makes its way through the merger line. During the course of the merger, there's also some other ejecta that's launched. So during the course of the merger, the two neutron stars touch, and there's shock heat ejector, basically. Shock heat ejector, basically ejection from the heating of the material as it becomes contact. And then you also have these tidal tails. Basically, when the two neutron stars are spiraling in together, you basically bulge the neutron star in the tidal direction, so there's tidal ejecta. The properties of these ejecta are different, so they look different in electromagnetic telescopes. So, for the case of 170817, we had the first bit of the kilonova which looked blue, and then it turned red, and that potentially is linked. Red, and that potentially is linked to the type of ejector that made this gravitational wave killer. So, all of these things are telling us about what's happening at the heart of the system, but they're really messy because there's a lot of astrophysics goes on. And nature really likes to try and mess with us even more. So, one of the things that we were really happy about in 2017 was that it was definitive proof that spinal neutron star mergers are linked to short GLVs. We're really happy because we've been saying this. We're really happy because we've been saying this for a very, very long time. And, you know, if you haven't seen this plot before, I'm sure most of you have. This is the gravitational wave inspiral signature in gravitational waves. And then 1.7 seconds later, we had the GRB detected in multiple telescopes. And this GRB was short. It was slightly peculiar in some ways, but not too peculiar in other ways. And we were really happy that it made the connection that binary transmissions are linked to Shopia. Everyone is really happy. Everyone is really happy because this confirmed that a little short DRBs, binary neutron stars, long DRBs, collapse stars, because we've seen them supernova in the path. And the universe decides you're having too much of a lifetime, so here's a little spanner. So we have these two amazing observations of long GRVs, and so I'll show a plot of this 211211A that Michael hinted at this morning, essentially showing the normalized counts. So the key number to keep in mind. The key number to keep in mind is essentially how long this goes on for. 1708 17 GRV, this was like two seconds and it's done. There's nothing going on after that. But for this particular GRV, 211211A, it went on for 80 seconds and it was producing gamma rays for a long time. So it's a bona fide long GRB. If you look at sort of its properties in terms of how GRB people like to split these GRBs up together, it lies smack bang in the middle of the long GRB population. Okay. Population. Okay, alright. Except if you look at the plot on the right-hand side, it's got an afterglow. The afterglow's got nothing special going on, so I shouldn't cross this. But if you look at the bottom plot, the bottom panel, it's essentially a fit to the excess that you're seeing in infrared bands. So, this little bump that starts emerging 68 days after. And that's actually really similar to the kilonova that we saw in 1797. 17070. So now all of a sudden there's this long GRP that's ended up making a kilonova very similar to 17070. What's going on? Is this a binary neutron star merger? Is this something else? Don't know. That was one event and people were arguing, okay, maybe it's not a kilonova, maybe it's something else. We just haven't done the modeling right, et cetera, et cetera. Then we got another one, 230307, and this time we actually got JWST spectrum. So I'll throw UST spectrum. So I'll throw this plot up, which is, I think, like the most beautiful plot in recent memory for me. Essentially, what it's showing you is the spectrum of, I want to first draw attention to the orange lines, which is the spectrum of AT2017 GFOs, the kilonova that was associated with 170817, at 10 days. And notice that there's a little big bump at sort of 2.1 microns. And then you've got in black the JWST spectrum of this long JWT. JWST spectrum of this long GRB. Again, it's really long, it's nothing like the GRB that accompanied 17017. And it's making the exact same feature. Properties of the Kilonova look very identical to 170817 in the broad sense of the word. And for whatever reason, this system has made a GRB that's 100 seconds longer, but it's ended up making the same element. We think in this particular case that element is tellurium, but don't. That element is tellurium, but your guess is honestly as good as mine. It could be helium, could be platinum, could be gold. But we want to know. And we want to know why is the same merger, if this is a merger, just making a longer GRB, but essentially making the same sort of field goal. And what that's also telling us is, you know, in an indirect way, it's telling us that whatever it is about the GRB duration doesn't seem to be linked to what the kilonova element production is, or at least whatever this element is. Is, or at least whatever this element is in particular, seems to be made in any type of GLB of merger-origin GLP. And so, really, the question that I sort of spend a lot of time trying to understand is how do the function of EM counterparts, how do the gravitational wave figure signatures, et cetera, change as a function of mass, viewing angle, et cetera, et cetera? You know, we could just wait for future mergers, but there's not that many going on. We could use numerical simulations, and we could use indirect observations. Simulations, and we could use indirect observations from various things. Now, I'll caution on the use of numerical simulations, and I will also say that I'm a very cynical theorist, so you know, filter whatever I say. But there's a lot of limitations with numerical simulations, and a lot of the limitations are not portrayed unless you're really familiar with them. So, for example, most, all, I would say, numerical kilonova-like curves that you see are based on physics that is completely. Are based on physics that is completely unreliable post six or seven days. They're based on physics, which is local thermodynamic equilibrium, essentially that you can forget about most atomic transitions. And that conditions are completely lost post six to seven days. So if you see a kilo Neva light curve from your best radiated transfer code out there, most people haven't done, almost all people haven't done non-local thermodynamic calibrations. We don't even have the atomic data to do. We don't even have the atomic data to do it, to be honest. So we're limited there. At the same time, I think most people are familiar with this fact, we haven't been able to launch a jet in a numerical simulation, a relativistic jet, since GRBs were a thing. I mean, it's only like maybe a decade since we could actually explode a star in a supernova simulation. Jay? Do you want to? So, you know, there's limitations. So, and then I can go on, and one of the other things I will say, and this is really just And one of the other things I will say, and this is really just the beginning in a way, is that the thermal effects of the equation of state, neutrino transport, et cetera, are not really dealt well with most simulations. So you lose a lot of these things. And so, you know, relying on quantitative numbers from any one numerical simulation, you're just setting yourself a failure in marketing. This is meant to be provocative. So if you want to have a fight with me, you have to do that one. So what that means, if you're looking at this sort of schematic here of this overview of a binary neutron star matter. Overview of a binary neutron style measure. In my opinion, this whole black box, you can't rely on any numerical simulations to get quantitative things right. It becomes really hard. And you can look at the qualitative things, you know, what features show up, what things are right, but things like this is the amount of ejecta I expect, this is the amount of things, I think you have to take that with a grain of salt. And then if you want to use any other type of model, one of the big problems. Any other type of model, one of the big problems is this unknown that sort of rules them all, in my opinion, which is the Bayern neutron star mass distribution. So this is a plot from a paper we wrote in 2020, right when JW190425 happened, which is showing basically the double neutron star mass distribution in radio and the neutron star mass distribution across all neutron star binaries in our galaxy. Now, the reason this used to be a really good idea, and Be a really good idea, and maybe it still is, is because people expect metallicity to play no role in binary neutron star mass distributions. So the galactic double neutron star neutron star distribution should be what we expect throughout the universe. So when 1708-17 happened, we were incredibly happy because 1708-17 lies smack bang in the middle of the galactic double neutron star distribution. But then 1904-25 is a phi sigma. 190425 is a phi sigma outlier. What's happening? So immediately there was a bunch of papers trying to understand: okay, maybe it's selection effects, maybe it's something else. So one of the ideas was that 90 to 425 lakh systems are basically the systems that don't show up in radio because they merge through a formation channel that just essentially the merger happens way too quickly. So you don't select them in the radio population because they just merge really quickly. Within a 50 million years, sort of after they form. Billion years, sort of, after their formation, they just merge. If that's right, then the indirect channel that should be able to test this is the Schott GRB offsets. So Schott GRBs trace how far away from the galaxy they are, trace exactly what the delay time distribution is in some ways. It's slightly problematic, but broad strokes we can do that. There's no real evidence of a short GRP offset that is consistent. Offset that is consistent with this idea that you have 50 million really fast merging channels. It could happen at a 10% level, but it certainly can't happen at the 50, 60, 70% level that our current mass distribution might predict, supposedly. Again, is it actually metallicity effects? We don't expect that from binary evolution, but maybe binary evolution is wrong. So this was a problem until very recently. So earlier this year, there was this massive paper. There was this massive paper published in Science, which is this pulsar observation with a compact object whose nature we don't know. So it's a millisecond pulsar, but its secondary object is anywhere from 2.1 to 2.7, one sigma credible interval. And the mass you don't know precisely because it's degenerate with the inclination angle. So this plot shows the companion mass as a function of the orbital inclination angle. So essentially, this is a system that is either very consistent with 1904. Either very consistent with 190425-like parameters, so one sort of 1.4-ish and 2.1 solar mass neutron star, or it's potentially a system that is a 2305, 29-like companion. But what we know for certain, or relatively certain, is that this system probably formed through an exchanging counter. So, this system has been kicked out of the globular cluster. So, we believe that it formed from a binary exchange within the globular cluster. Exchange within the globular cluster and then got kicked out. So at some point, it was a double neutron star system. Sorry, it was a double neutron star system that had one component that was bonafide, much like the galactic distribution, but then it exchanged itself with another system, with another black hole or a neutron star, depending on its mass, in a globular cluster with a slightly heavier system. So if that's right, then it turns out that we could potentially actually. Turns out that we could potentially actually still use this distribution, this combination of distributions, as a sort of proxy for the global distribution. So if we do that and we say, all right, for example, the local distribution is a good proxy, and we have lots of local binaries, and suppose that the maximum Tolman-Oppen-Heimel-Walkhault mass is 2.3, which is consistent with current numerical estimates, and you propagate that through and calculate what fraction of mergers should. Calculate what fraction of mergers should produce a long-lived neutron star, something lasting longer than 10 seconds or so, then you actually get basically more than 50% of mergers should be producing a long-lived neutron star. That's exactly the type of system that we're not even remotely close to being able to simulate in any detail. That is probably not what happened with 170817, but you know, we can argue about that as well, potentially. So, one of the signs that one of the signatures that has That one of the signatures that has been talked about for a long time for bio-neutrons dimensions and this long-lived channel is these things called the X-ray internal and external plateaus. And in particular, I'm going to focus on this one, which is the X-ray afterglow and this sharp drop in luminosity, which people believe is related to that time that the neutron star collapses on a delayed constant. So, about 100 seconds or so in this data compilation from Antonio Rowlandson. So, in 2020, So, in 2020, we wrote a paper saying essentially: if you have all those systems that Swift has observed, and you go out and measure that time of collapse, what does that tell you about the neutron star population? So, we went and did this, and we did some hierarchical inference in some funny ways, and you can actually get sort of two really cool constraints. Whether they're right or not, I don't know. I'm a cynical theorist, so no. But one of the cool things you can do is you can actually try and constrain the equation of state in a bit. Equation of state in a basically a hot environment. So, this is essentially probing what the thermal effect of the equation of state is immediately after the merger. And the details are not too important, but essentially, this parameterization encodes how much the thermal effect of the equation of state is. The red crosses are equation of states that are hadronic, sorry, that are deconfined clarks. And the blue crosses are equation of states that are hadronic, so equation of states that we're already familiar with. And essentially, what we find is that. And essentially, what we find is that there's tentative evidence that these neutron star systems, these proto-neutron stars, in a sense, are composed of deconfined quarks. Similarly, we can go and try to understand how these neutron stars spin down. And so this plot shows basically a posterior predictive distribution on the breaking index, basically encoding how neutron stars spin down. And we find that there's strong evidence for a breaking index of five at the population level, implying that these neutron stars are spinning down significantly through gravitation. Down significantly through gravitational dimension. And that has important consequences for various things. So, with that, I want to switch a little bit to talking about if these are all the sort of physics ingredients that are going into a modeling, what can we actually robustly infer? So, a lot of people have sort of already sort of mentioned frameworks, et cetera. So, in particular, I've been involved in sort of developing this code called Redback, which is sort of out now and it's been used in various things. I've also been involved in developing Bilby for a long time. Developing Bilby for a long time. And, you know, I think most people are familiar with Bilby, but Redback is essentially the same sort of thing, but for electromagnetic transients in a way. And, you know, we started to sort of see, okay, if this is the projected model uncertainty, this is the projected realistic observation, for example, with Rubin, how well can we actually extract various parameters? And so then it then comes down to: all right. It then comes down to all right, the machine learning part of this talk. And so I did the natural thing, and this joke hasn't been made yet, so I can make it. I went and asked ChatGPT what puzzles are there in gravitational wave astronomy, and how will he solve them? And the answer is not bad. I think it's pretty good. But then, as ChatGPT naturally does, it doesn't answer the second part of the question, just decides to answer the first part. So then I had to ask it again. And funnily enough, And funnily enough, it said something. So I highlighted a few things. So it said information and education, that it can assist us in that, apparently. Discussion of current research, maybe. Connecting to multi-messenger astronomy. So I read those things and here's a meme for the millennials. I really doubt whether it can do that. But here's my opinion of how machine learning can actually come in, and at least some of the applications that I'm familiar with. Applications that I'm familiar with and that I've used myself. So, a lot of people have already mentioned this idea about surrogate modeling, essentially using machine learning to make a fast sort of emulator for these numerical simulations that are too expensive. And I think that's a really cool way to go, provided that you actually know how accurate your underlying physical model is. You know, there's no reason to go to the precision of 10 to the negative 3 in your emulator, and your underlying model, in my opinion, is. And your underlying model, in my opinion, is off by an order of magnitude. Does it matter? I don't know. There's a lot of similar things going on. And then Ben talked about this early this morning about this idea of data-driven class theory sort of modeling. So we've seen these things where you have a combination of a ML model plus some underlying theoretical model that is driving it. And then you use this to actually sort of fit what's going on underlying in terms of what the physics is telling us, but then let the ML model sort of catch up. The ML model sort of catch up and fill in the gaps, kind of thing. And that works really well in some cases, maybe not so much in others. And I realized, no, we talked about, yeah, we talked about simulation-based inference this morning. And so again, obviously, we've seen great adoption of the GW community. But really, I think it then boils down to how well does the simulator do itself? How well can we actually simulate the data to be able to do simulation-based inference? And at least I have some. And at least I have some doubts, at least, in the electromagnetic transfer space. And then, of course, there's these normalizing flow algorithms that you talked about this morning, earlier today, to basically speed up traditional algorithms by using clever techniques for jump proposals and various other things. And I think those are, again, really cool things. But again, sort of the concern I have with some of these things, and really I want to sort of spark some discussion, is can those things scale up in 05 or Rubin and 11? Up in 05 or room and alert screen level. What do we need to do that? And with that, I'll end the talk here. I'll put up my slides. But really, the last thing I'll just emphasize is I think, you know, I think I really want to sort of move away from multi-messenger astronomy just being what we observe jointly with electromagnetic, gravitational waves, folded neutrinos, if you want to. You know, hopefully, the Google finds up. Two, basically, being able to leverage what we're getting indirectly. Being able to leverage what we're getting indirectly at a population level, and so on and so forth. And then, you know, supernovae, Gaia, all these things are sort of channels you can do it. Thank you so much. Questions? Yeah, so first when you say short GRB, I think you refer to short GRB in the GRB domain because you can have long GRB with the short and extraordinary. It's a short and expanding emission, but quick long TRB, whereas it is for a gas receiver. So, for the kilonova, so you present the long TRB, but I'm sorry for me, I am more on the other side. I disagree that you can put 17 and 17 and 21, 11, 12, 8. I think, because in this paper, they modeled that it should be a merger, right? And they derive the kinova from Derive the king of A from the assumption that there is a merger. So, I would like to understand your point of view since you say that also we have numbers, we don't understand the hard process efficiency, etc. So, how you can say that is true, whereas, okay, there is no, there is something better that you have to do, but on the other side, say quantitatively. So, just a question to you. Yeah, it's a quick question. So, with the case of 2111-12A, what I will say is that I think. What I will say is that I think if someone, and people have made this claim, that it's actually a dust echo, et cetera. So Early Vaxman wrote a paper and he almost immediately said it's just an intra-ready dust echo. I think for 21.12.11.8, because it's just photometry, I think it's still easy to actually find different ways to make the same sort of system. You could do it with a white dwarf merger as well if you wanted to. But with 2307, I think it's really hard. I think it's really hard because of the fact that the set spectrum looks so similar. It's the spectrum that really gives me good confidence. Yeah, but before you didn't have gems, well, sorry, you didn't have all the ground proteins. But I say that GWT is a signature of the progenitor, which is why I say you cannot put on the same, exactly the same age. There are many things in the program, but I just. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, so I mean, I think for me, 23 or 307 is not. Me, 23 or 30 or 7 is now evidence that long DRPs can be from mergers. What do you think? Yeah, but it's nature and many other things. Like, so, for example, the other things that seem to work for 23 or 307 is a white-hoff merger. There's no calcium lines. Why do you hide the calcium bonds? Why is it so broad? You can produce a process. It doesn't mean that it is a key remover from NS on BNS merger. Oh, yeah, sure. This is what you send your price for your spectral. This is what you see in your place, or your spectrum. You see, F process, you don't see the thing that you call human mobile that you play from the best. But this is another. No, no, that's definitely true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can discuss a web coffee. I have a this is a question about, again, like the Gillian's GRB and the Levant 12 paper. Does it make sense from an energetics point of view that a GRB engine A GRB engine in short GRBs, we seem to shut off on the order of like a second or two that it can power a jet three times longer. Does the energetics make sense there? So from an energetics point of view, it is a bit of a problem, but not too much. Essentially, the problem with time scales and why people initially believed this idea about long and short for that reason is essentially related to what you believe the accretion. Related to what you believe the accretion disk, what you believe the jet launching mechanism is related to, and it's related to the accretion disk, let's say, for example. Then, if you believe there's a long GRB sort of time scale, you shouldn't have an accretion disk last that long, kind of thing, to be able to sustain a jet for that long. That's one of the ideas. And so, this was what came up, gave away the initial divide, long-in-chart divide. But there's ways. So, people have talked about accretion disk going. Have talked about accretion disk going mad, basically, magnetically arrested accretion disk, and then you have no problem with this time scale. Basically, the energy keeps dropping, but it's still being able to power. So people find the way. So our seminar section was then expected to speak to this.
