I never remember, but from Paris. And he'll talk about asymptotic quasi-periodic solutions for time-dependent current petrofields. So, thank you, Bernato. Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. So, I would like to begin with a very brief introduction about KAN theory, where KAN stands for Where KAN stands for Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser, three mathematicians who are at the origin of this theory. So we consider an Hamiltonian, H0. In this talk, I'm working with real analytic or C sigma Hamiltonian. So H0 is the sum of a particular Hamiltonian small h plus Small h plus a more complicated perturbations. Small h has this form for a suitable vector omega and a suitable matrix Q, the capital Q. The associated Hamiltonian system has this form. So if epsilon is equal to zero, the Hamiltonian system takes this easier form, and it is obvious that for all p equals zero. P equal to zero, three is our quasi-periodic solution associated to two. This is equivalent to to say that the trivial embedding fit zero is an invariant torus for the Hamiltonian small h, supporting quasi-periodic solution with frequency vector omega. So the question is the invariant torus The invariant torus V0 persists under suitable small perturbations. So, what happens when epsilon is different from zero? The K-M theorem has to this question. There are many developments of the K-M theory over the years. Today I will give you a statement in the real analytical C sigma case. So, we consider capital H0 real analytic or C sigma with sigma. Analytic or C sigma with sigma large enough, we assume the amperturbed Hamiltonian to be non-degenerate, the frequency vector omega to be diophantine and epsilon small enough. And then there exists an analytical C1 plus M embedding phi epsilon in such a way that phi epsilon is an invariant torus for the Hamiltonian capital H0 supporting quasi-biodic solution with frequency vector. quasi-periodic solution with frequency vector omega and this invariant torus is epsilon small epsilon close to the the invariant torus feed zero associated to the unperturbed system so ruggedly speaking the invariant torus feed zero persist be just likely deformed so now one of the main motivation for for studying Hamiltonian system is for the application to System is for the application to celestial mechanics. So, I'd like to give you a brief introduction to the planar tribe problem. So, we consider the Sun with a very large mass and two planets turning around the Sun. On first approximation, we consider that the planets are mainly attracted by the Sun. And then on this level of approximation, the trajectory. approximation the trajectory are keplarian of the two decoupled two body problems and then elliptic the amingtonian which describes this system at this level of proximation is small h in the next level of approximation we consider the mutual attraction between the planets and the hamiltonian who plays this role is small f don't so we can write the hamiltonian capital h0 as the sum between small h As the sum between small h and f. So we cannot directly apply the kind theorem to find quasibradic solutions for the Hamiltonian of the planetary body problem because the Hamiltonian small H is degenerate. So we have to go through a process of averaging process in order to get rid of the degeneracy and then apply the Kern theorem. So for example, So, for example, one of the references, the work of Jacques Fejaux in his thesis advisor, in his thesis, he proved the existence of quasi-periodic solution for the Hamiltonian of the planetary body problem with four frequencies in the phase space after the sympathetic reduction by the symmetry of translations. So, the problem that I would like to The problem that I would like to propose you today is the example of a planetary system, in this case the planar three-body problem, perturbed by a given comet coming from a going back to infinity asymptotically along an hyperbolic Keplerian orbit. So the motion of the curve is a given function, and the Hamiltonian which describes this system. This system is a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and it is the sum between the Hamiltonian of the planetary body problem plus a time-dependent perturbation, capital Hc, which plays the role of the interaction of the planet with the comets. On a suitable norm, we can see that the gradient of this perturbation decays polynomially fast in time as 1 over t square. So now we are. Square. So now we have a time-dependent Hamiltonian which converge on a suitable norm asymptotically. There's a question, if you don't mind. Ah, there is a question. Okay, I can see. It's a small question. The comet is on the same plane of the planet. Yes, yes, in the same plane, and it is given. But the motion of the... But the emotion of the committee is given. Anyway, this is just a presentation. I will speak later about this problem more in deep, but just in the same plane, yes. Okay, thank you. So we have a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which converge on a suitable norm asymptotically fast in time when t when t tends to plus infinity to an autonomous Hamiltonian having quasi-periodic solutions. So what we expect? We expect to find orbits associated to this Hamiltonian capital H, which converge asymptotically in time to the quasi-periodic solution associated to the Hamiltonian H0 of the parent three-body problem. So to do that, we have to ensure To do that, we have to introduce the definition of asymptotic KAM torus. So, sorry, okay. So, we consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian, capital H, real etiquette sigma over Tn times Rn, which converge asymptotically in time to the autonomous Hamiltonian H0, real etiquette sigma over the same phase space. Sigma over the same phase space, and we assume that the autonomous Hamiltonian capital H0 has an invariant torus, phi zero, supporting quasi-biodic dynamics with frequency vector omega. So we are in the same situation as in the previous slide. So we now to give you the definition of asynthotic aim torus. This definition is due to This definition is due to Marta Canadell and Rafael de La Yave in 2015. So, a family of real analytic embeddings, phi T, is an analytic or C sigma asymptotic KAM torus associated to H phi0 if for all QAT we have the following relations. So, for the moment, roughly speaking, an asymptotic and Generally speaking, an asymptotic torus is a family of embeddings converging in time to the invariant torus phi zero associated to the autonomous system. And concerning the dynamics, the dynamics, if we consider the projection, the phase space Tn times Rn converge to the quasi-periodic dynamic associated to the the autonomous system H zero over the invariant torus phi zero. Over the invariant torus phi zero. Anyway, the following slides are full of remarks and clarification, also always due to Canada della Liave, concerning this definition. So the first remark, if we let CH be the flow of capital H, we have that 4 is equivalent to this relation, where 4 is Where four is given, is defined on this slide. So, in other words, we can rewrite four in terms of the flow of H. Another remark. For is trivial. So, it is always possible to find a family of embedding satisfying for. It suffices to It suffices to consider an embedding at phi and taking the right-hand side of one as a definition of this family of embedding, which obviously satisfying four. So the five plays a very important role on this definition. The third remark, if C T phi t is an asymptotic chemtrail defined for all t large enough. For example, then we can extend the set of definitions for all t. This is important. I will use this remark in the proof of one of the theorem that I will propose you today. Indeed, the family of embedding that I write at the end of this slide. Of this slide. It's a family of embeddings satisfying the hypothesis for F5 of the definition of asymptotic emptors. And then it is an asymptotic chemters defined for all T in error. But unfortunately, we cannot deduce any asymptotic condition, any asymptotic properties for negative time when t tends to minus infinity. Feel here. So, concerning the dynamics, I'd like to state the definition of asymptotic quasi-periodic solution. So, we consider we let HH0 phi0 as in the previous definition. G is an asymptotic quasi-periodic solution associated to H phi0. If G is obviously an orbit associated to H. Associated to H and G converge to a asymptotically in time to a quasi-periodic solution associated to the autonomous system on the invariant torus phase zero. In the next slide, we have a proposition which give us obvious link between the definition of asymptotic M torus and asymptotic quasi-periodic solutions. Solutions. So if Ct is an asymptotic enters associated to H phi0, then if this G is an asymptotic quasi-periodic solution associated to H. So if we have an asymptotic quasi-periodic solution, we associated to a suitable Hiltonium H, then we have a series of quasi-periodic solutions associated with this Hamiltonian. The proof is easy, it depends on It's easy, it depends on this equivalence and to the fact that this family of embedding converges asymptotically in time to the invariant torus phi zero. So what is so to conclude this part of remarks, an asymptotic and torus is a family of embeddings which converge asymptotically in time to the invaluant torus. In time to the invaluable phi zero associated to the autonomous Hamiltonian. And concerning the dynamics, dynamically, if we consider the projection, the phase space Tm times Ln, the dynamics converge to the quasi-periodic dynamics associated to the Hamiltonian H0, to the autonomous Hamiltonian on the invariant torus phase zero. So now I would like to give Now I would like to give you some results. The first is due to Fortunati Wiggins in 2014. So they consider a time-dependent real analytic Hamiltonian of this form. This is the sum of an integrable Hamiltonian plus time-dependent perturbations. It is obvious that the trivial embedding that I defined. trivial embedding that I defined at the end of this slide is an invariant torus for H0 supporting quasi-biodic solutions. And they assume that the perturbation decay exponentially fast in time. Moreover, they assume that the unperturbed Hamiltonian to be non-degenerate, the frequency vector omega to be diophantine, epsilon small, a lambda just greater than zero. Greater than zero. And then, therefore, the existence of an analytic asymptotic M torus phi T associated to the Hamiltonian H and the invariant torus phi zero. So actually, they thought that this proof is the existence of an invariant torus for capital H rather than an asymptotic torus. Because the definition is due to Canada, the definition of asymptotic and torus. To Canada, the future of synthetic and tourists due to Canada de la Liabe, it is about one year later. So, about one year one year later, Canada de la Liave proved a result which improved the one of fortunate wiggins. So, actually, this result is more general than the one that I wrote on this slide because they work with they work with a vector field on smooth manifolds. And indeed, they need to assume a sort of control over the normal dynamics to the invariant torus V0, that it is always verified for Hamiltonian systems. Anyway, I state this result in the particular case of Hamiltonian system. So there is two versions. So there is two versions of this result, one for C sigma Hamiltonian, but it's always true for reality Hamiltonian. So they consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian to be sufficiently smooth in such a way that the vector field, the successive vector Hamiltonian vector field is of class E sigma plus plus one or just H3 analytic. H is the sum H is the sum of an autonomous Hamiltonian H0, which has an invariant torus phi zero supporting quasi-periodic solution of frequency vector omega, plus a time-dependent perturbation. They assume that the perturbation decays exponentially fast in time, and they don't need any non-degeneracy condition. The general condition of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, any alternative condition of the frequency vector omega, they assume just that just at n to be small, lambda greater than zero, and they prove the existence of a C sigma or analytic asymptotic antorus associated to this Hamiltonian. So the question that I wondered after this result, I retired. This result with a view to the application in celestial mechanics. If it is possible to relax the process of the exponential decay of the perturbation, so the answer is yes. So I proved this result, this theorem. I'd like to call it good decay for this talk. There is two versions, one for sigma, Newtonian, and the other. C sigma Hamiltonian and the other for reanalytic Hamiltonian. So I consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian with the same regularity as the one of Canada della Liave. This is the sum of an autonomous Hamiltonian having an invariant supporting quasi-parabic solution plus a time-dependent perturbation. I assume that the perturbation decays polynomially fast in time with exponent With exponent L strictly greater than two. This would be a problem in the application of cell cell mechanics. And I don't assume any smallness condition about the perturbation. So this result is a generalization of the one of Candel de Lalia in the particular case of Hamiltonian system. System because under this hypothesis, I proved the existence of a C-sigma analytic asymptotic chemist for this Hamiltonian. So concerning the proof, this is an application of the implicit function theorem. So we begin by the solution of the associated neuralized problem, which consists in solving the following equation for the unknown key, where G is actually. where g is a given function of class c sigma and g decays polynomially fast in time with exponent l greater than one we can solve this equation by a simple integration thanks to a suitable change of coordinates in order to which rectify the the dynamic on the torus and the solution exists and it's unique and it satisfies And it satisfies the following estimation for a suitable constant C. So, in the case of Canada della Liave, G is of class C sigma and the k exponential fast in time with exponent lambda and the solution is of class C sigma and the k with exponential fast in time with the same exponent. In this case, this of class C sigma and the k polynomially fast in time with exponent L. time with exponent l and the solution is of class c sigma and decay polynomial fast in time with exponent l minus one this is because the solution is by by integration so integrating we lost a sort of regularity for for the decay in time so uh We are able to, I'm able to solve this problem in the non-linear part by the definition of suitable function over suitable Banach space. I'm able to gain back what we lose in terms of decay in the solution of the homological equation. So I can prove this theorem using the implicit function theorem. Using the implicit function theorem. Concerning the fact that the theorem is not perturbative, we introduce a suitable parameter capital T in such a way that the perturbation is small. This time-dependent norm is small for all till large enough. And then we studied the Hamiltonian for all till large enough. And the solution of them were. And the solution of the homological equation does not depend on capital T. And then we find the existence of C asymptotic antoros associated to this Hamiltonian, defined for all T large enough. And if you remind one of the remarks that I did concerning the asymptotic aim torus, then we can extend the set of definitions for all T. So this concludes the sketch of the is the sketch of the proof. But as I mentioned before, this theorem can't help us in the application to celestial mechanics. So we need to prove another abstract theorem and introduce another definition, the definition of weak asymptotic cylinder. So first of all, if we consider m equal of zero, we have the equal to zero, we have the same setting of the definition of asymptotic KM torus. The reason why I'm working with cylinder is linked for with the application to celestial mechanics because I need to work with cylinder not with invariant sorry that if I have enough time we will we will see it later. So we consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian reality of Hamiltonian, reality cross is sigma over this failed space. I'm using the blue to emphasize the difference with respect to the definition of asymptotic M torus. So this time-dependent Hamiltonian converge asymptotically in time. So an autonomous Hamiltonian H0. And we assume that this autonomous Hamiltonian has an invariant cylinder and the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field x. is conjugated to the constant vector field bar omega, defined at the end of this slide, over Tn times Rn. So a family of embedding or C, a family of reality or C sigma embedding, phi T, it's a weak asymptotic or C sigma cylinder associated to H phi0. If there exists H phi zero, if there exists an application, capital gamma, reanalytical C sigma, in such way for all Qt we have the following the following condition holds. So in this definition, we have the introduction of a new term, capital gamma, which has in totally converged to zero. As in totally converged in time to zero. So the So the remarks that we did for the definition of sytotic chemorus are always true in this case. This means that 6 is trivial. And if you have a weak asymptotic cylinder defined for all t large enough, then we can extend the set of definitions for all t. Concerning the dynamic, we introduced the definition of weak. We introduced the definition of weak asymptotic solution. Also, in this case, I'm using the blue to emphasize the difference with respect to the definition of asymptotic quasi-periodic solution. So G is a weak asymptotic solution associated to H. If G is an orbit of H and it satisfies the asymptotic condition at the end of this slide. End of this slide. So a G does not converge asymptotically in time to dynamic associated to the autonomous Hamiltonian H0, but to a dynamic which is generated by the time-dependent vector field bar omega plus gamma. Also in this case, if we have a weak asymptotic cylinder, then associated to a certain amiliton, then we have Then we have a weak asymptotic solution to say to this Hamiltonian. So now we have everything we need to state the abstract theorem, the theorem that I called in this talk, theorem bed decay, that we will apply in celestial mechanics. So we consider sine dependence Hamiltonian to be sufficiently small. To be sufficiently smooth in such a way that the Hamiltonian system associated is of class C sigma with sigma greater than or equal to H. So we need the Hamiltonian to be more regular than the Hamiltonian of the Terran good decay. The Hamiltonian capital H is the sum of an autonomous Hamiltonian having an invariant cylinder phi zero plus a time-dependent perturbation. And we assume that the perturbation decays. That the perturbation decays polynomially fast in time as 1 over t square. In this case, we need to assume epsilon to be small, and then we prove the existence of a C1 weaker symptomatic cylinder associated to this Hamiltonian. So, this is the result is weaker than the theorem good decay, but But we need this theorem for the application to celestial mechanics. Concerning the proof, the proof is a consequence of the Nash-Moser theorem. So we begin by the solution of the associated homological equation. So we have to solve the following equation from the unknown key. We can see that this equation is more complicated than the one. Complicated than the one in the proof of the theorem Goude K. G, Z and K are given functions of class C S, where S is between 1 and sigma, and they decay polynomially fast in time, g as 1 over t square, and z decay and as 1 over t. We can solve this equation. We can solve this equation by integration if we assume mu small enough and thanks to a suitable change of coordinates, a solution exists and it satisfies this estimate. So the most complicated part in this proof is to find this estimate. So also Also, in this case, in the linear part, we are able to gain back what we lose in terms of decay in the solution of the homological equation. But because of the presence of the term gamma, in the capital gamma in the definition of a weaker synthetic cylinder, we have a loss of derivatives. This is the reason why I'm not able to prove this theorem. This theorem just using the implicit function theorem, but I have to use the Nash-Moser theorem. This proof does not work in the analytical case. This is because the change of coordinates that we use to solve the homological equation depends by the time-dependent vector field bar omega plus gamma. And then at each time of the Time of the iteration of the Nash-Moser scheme, I lose a fixed part of analytic C. And this proof does not work in the C-infinity setting, because to solve the homological equation, more s is big and more have to assume mu to be small. So now we have everything we need. I have five minutes, five or six minutes. Five or six minutes? Yes, yes, six minutes. Yeah, okay, right. So now we have everything we need to solve the problem in celestial mechanics. So I remember you that I consider three fixed points undergoing the gravitational attraction on the plane with fixed mass and E, position vector X, a linear momentum. Vector x C, a linear momentum covector ye for e equals 0, 1, 2, and a given comet with fixed mass coming from a going back to infinity asymptotically along an hyperbolic Kepler orbit with a non-zero symptotic velocity. So the motion of the clock is given, is hyperbolic, and then with and then and hence with a non-zero symptotic velocity. And I remind that only. And I remind that only the planetary system is influenced by the comet. I remind that the Hamiltonian of the planetary body problem plus comet is the sum between the Hamiltonian of the planet three-body problem plus the interaction of the planet with the comet. We assume that for a suitable particle initial time t equal to one, the comet is far from the planetary. From the planetary system with a very large asymptotic velocity. And we localize ourselves in a subset of the space characterized by this condition, which means that each time each planet is far from the comet. We have the following theorem. Let H be the Hamiltonian of the planet three body problem plus comet, then there exists Problem plus comment, then there exists a subset with non-empty interior of inixel points, giving rise to weak absentadic solution associated to H phi0, where phi0 is a one-parameter family of invariantory for H0 supporting quasi-several dynamics with four frequencies. The existence of this of H0 is guaranteed by the result of Jacques concerning the quasi-merodic solution motion for the amino. Solution motion for the Hamiltonian of the planetary body problem. So, concerning the proof, it divided five fundamental parts. So, we introduce the existence of a linear symplectic change of coordinate in such a way that in this new coordinate, we can split the Hamiltonian of the planar tribal body problem in this way, where k is the Hamiltonian of the planar trip problem after. The planetary body problem after the simpleton reduction by the symmetry of transstation. Capital X is the center of mass of the planetary systems, a capital Y0 is the linear moment of the planetary system, and capital M is the sum of the mass of the planetary system. Then, as I've already mentioned before, Jacques proved the existence of a Lagrangian invariant tor of dimension 4 for the Minton of the planetary. For the Minton of the planetary body problem, after the simple reduction by the symmetry of class stations. So, thanks to the Weinstein theorem, we can prove the existence of simple change of coordinate in such a way that we can rewrite the Hamiltonian capital K in this form. And then, in this simpletic variable, theta x0, L and Y 0, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian H. Write the Hamiltonian H0 in this form. Concerning the perturbation, we introduce another subset of the extended phase space characterized by this condition. On this subset, the perturbation Hc satisfied good time-dependent estimates. What does it mean? It means that it decays as 1 over T squared and it is small. Over t squared, and it is small. So, good time estimate for the application of the theorem delta decay. But the Hamiltonian capital H does not satisfy the potis of the theorem delta decay. In order, so to this reason, we introduce the following Hamiltonian, which is a smooth extension of the Hamiltonian H, and it is equal to H in the subset U, and it satisfies the same as. It satisfied the same estimate of h outside u. Then it satisfied the product of the theorem by decay, and we can apply this theorem to this moot extension. And then there exists a C1 weak asymptotic cylinder, phi T, associated to this smooth extension. This is my last slide. So we observed that if we have a weak asymptotic cylinder, then we can associate weak asymptotic cylinders. Then we can associate weak asymptotic solution to a suitable Hamiltonian. So for all Z on this set, C tilde H Z, where C is the flow of tilde H, is a weak asymptotic solution associated to tilde H. Now, we introduce a suitable small ball central to the origin and we prove that for all And we prove that for all Z initial points on this set, the Ct calculated in Z belongs to U for all time. This means that if for initial time t equal to zero, the planets are far from the comet, then they remain far for all time. This is a consequence, this is because we have assumed that for t equal to one. That for t equal to one, the comet is far from the planetary system with a very large asymptotic velocity. The comet diverge linearly like V times T and we prove that the center of mass diverge like we prove that the center of mass of the planetary system diverge like log t. And this concludes the proof because then CHZ is equal to C H. CHZ is equal to CH tilde and it is a weak asymptotic solution associated to our Hamiltonian. Thank you very much. So thank you. So is there any question or remark? In fact, my question is the following. So if I understand you are able to find only C1. To find only C1 weak hyperbolic cylinder and under the assumption, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, under the assumption that sigma is bigger or equal than eight, you can find C1 wake hyperbolic cylinder. Yes, but if you increase the sigma, yes, yes, if I increase sigma, I can find more regular solution. Yes, okay, okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So thank you. Thank you. Are there more questions or remarks? Maybe I have one because in the TV problem, things can tend to infinity, like linearly write T or can be parabolic and be t power two-thirds. So sorry, I. Sorry. That in the three-body problem, when you have bodies going to infinity. Uh, bodies going to infinity, they can tend as t linearly, you know, and then they are hyperbolic, or they can tend at t power two-thirds. I mean, uh, yeah, sorry, I mean, yeah, sorry, I mean the speed one over t to two-thirds, sorry. And do you think that this could be also applied to the uh that you could also apply to your methods to this case? I don't think so because. because if I think this proof doesn't work because the fact that the comet, if I understood the question, if the comet diverge linearly, we can apply this theorem and we can find solution. But if it's less But if it's less than linearly, if less than t of the power of one, is this exponent less than one? I really don't think so. I don't know. I don't have to do that. But this problem, this theorem, this proof, I think doesn't work. Okay. Thank you. Is this the question? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So are there more questions? Well, if not, let's thank Donato again. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you.
