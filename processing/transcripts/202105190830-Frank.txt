Okay, so it's a pleasure to have Rupert Frank here. He will speak about which magnetic fields support a zero mode. Okay, please. Well, thank you very much for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for putting together this meeting. It's a pleasure to be here. Pleasure to be here. Even though, with a time difference, I try to attend as many talks as possible, and they've been very interesting. I hope to watch the other ones when they're recorded. My talk, I should say, does have very little geometry in it. It has, I mean, everything takes place on RN and actually in R3. I should also say that we have not been able to sort of achieve the goal. Able to sort of achieve the goals to prove really the theorems that we had wanted to prove. There's an obvious theorem that you want there. I decided, nevertheless, to talk about this topic here because I do think there's a lot of geometry hidden in these equations. And I think further progress is really only possible if one has a better understanding of this geometry. And so, I would like to have this as an invitation, and we would be very happy if this. And we would be very happy if there would be new ideas towards this problem. I also understand that the title here is not clear to everybody, but I will explain all this. This is kind of there is a physics problem in the background that we were interested in. And then thinking about that, we got towards other problems. And I should say that all this is joint work with Michael Loss. I think he's been thinking about this problem since the late 80s. The late 80s, and we have been working on this together for the last 10 years or so. And as I said, I mean, I would, it would be great if there would be new input. So, to set the stage, let me tell you about the theme of this talk, right? So, this is all about sharp functional inequalities. Okay, so we have certain, let me call them functions or mappings. them functions or mappings, and we compute some quantities in terms of them, say gradients or integrals or something, and we want to bound some other quantities. And what we're interested in, what are the optimal constants in such inequalities. Now, when the objects that we consider are scalar functions, then we know really quite a lot. And there are many inequalities associated with these. There are these Sobolev inequalities, isoparametric inequalities, you name them. Inequalities, you name it. And we also have quite robust techniques to prove these inequalities. I mean, each case is different, that's clear. But I think if you look at it from a very wide angle, then you see recurring methods used in these proofs. And those often hinge, for instance, on rearrangement inequalities. Okay, now I want to contrast that situation. I want to contrast that situation to the case when the mappings that are under consideration are not scalar-valued. Say if they are vector-valued, spinner-valued, when we're talking about differential forms. And we know hardly any sharp functional inequalities in that setting. And the talk is somehow about this mismatch in what we know about scalar versus what we know about non-scalar sharp functional inequality. Sharp functional inequalities. So, to set the stage with the most well-understood inequality is probably the Sobolev inequality. I'm stating it in R3. I can say just it's power 6. Don't have to say 2n over n minus 2, but it's really the same thing. And anyway, so we have the gradient squared integrated controls the six nodes. Controls the sixth norm of the function. There's a constant involved in this inequality, this S3, and the explicit value of that constant, the best possible value, is known. Moreover, we also know the functions for which this optimal constant is attained. What makes the inequality interesting and what puts it into this geometric context is that it has a certain conformal invariance. Certain conformal invariance. So, when you look at the equation naively, then I mean, obviously, it's translation invariant and it's rotation invariant and has a clear behavior under dilations. The non-trivial thing is that it's also invariant under inversions. And these transformations together generate the conformal group. And if you want to write this in a general form, then you say that if you replace your function u by By Merbius transformed function u, or you put a certain power of the Jacobian in front, then both sides of the inequality don't change. And as a particular consequence, you see that the inequality has a natural form on S3 by stereographic projection. And then this function, right, which looked a little bit random in your Which looked a little bit random in Euclidean space becomes very natural on the sphere because this is just the constant function on the sphere. Okay, so sort of random choice of what we have here becomes a clear and well that the natural choice. And you see this factor here that just comes from the Jacobian of this stereographic projection. The inequality, the finding. Finding the sharp constant in this inequality. That's, of course, I mean, an interesting problem by itself in the calculus of variations. It also has many applications, for instance, when in some mathematical physics problems, when you really want to compute or estimate some concrete things. And also in geometry, as you all know, this number arises as a compactness threshold in the Yamabi problem. Threshold in the Yamabi problem. So that's what I wanted to tell you to remind you of the things in the scalar case. Let's move on. So, Michael Loss and I were working on a problem that I tell you about in a few slides. And then we, well, we were trying to solve this. And then we found two inequalities, which, if they were true, would settle our problem. And then we've And then we've been spending quite some time in trying to prove these. We could not. So let me formulate these as conjectures. And so these are Sobolev inequalities in the sense that on the left side we have gradients and on the right side we have LP norms. The objects for which we want to have these Sobolev inequalities are either a spinner field. Inequalities are either a spinner field or a vector field. Moreover, the inequalities are quasi-linear in the sense that we have a power three halves on the left, over here and over there, in contrast to the power two that we usually have. Okay, the inequalities are stated here on R3, although there are similar inequalities in any dimension. The power 3 here, that's the only power you can guess. I mean, the only power for which the inequality can hold, just by an ordinary scaling argument. Now, what makes these two inequalities interesting is that they have the same conformal invariance property as the Sobolev inequality I told you on the previous slide. Okay, so see, you could look at, I mean, of course, we all. You could look at, I mean, of course, we all know that there are Sobolev inequalities for w1, three halves, right? There's also Ober and Talenti proved the optimizers in those inequalities. These inequalities, however, for scalar functions are not conformally invariant. The inequalities that we propose here, when you leave the scalar context but go to the well, vector field, the spinner field context, they get their conformal invariance. Conformal invariants. Moreover, we have here conjectures of functions for which we believe that equality holds. And well, we don't know, but one thing we can check is that these functions are actually solutions to the Lagrange equation. Moreover, what you also see in these functions here, you have this characteristic 1 plus x squared. 1 plus x squared, remember that's the Jacobian of the stereographic projection. So again, this looks very natural if you have ever thought about such inequalities. Concerning the dimensions, I should say that so conjecture one about spinner fields naturally extends to higher dimensions. Dimensions. Conjecture two, however, there's an interesting phenomenon. While the inequality itself is valid in higher dimensions, right, so the n over 2 and here is n, while the inequality is valid in general dimensions, the analog of this supposed optimal vector field, we can only construct in odd dimensions. You see that here you have a skew-symmetric matrix. Matrix. And here you have, I mean, which is built on a certain direction, on a vector w, and then you need the vector itself, and that sort of forces the dimension to be odd if you want to make the analog of this construction. So we do not have an analog of conjecture two in even dimensions. And I mean, that itself is kind of a very interesting problem, which might suggest that there are some perhaps topological phenomena in the Phenomena in the background that we do not understand. And I have to tell you right away that we are not able to prove these conjectures, they're completely open. Now, there's a modest step that we can do, namely what we can show is that there are minimizers for these inequalities. So, that in some sense makes us happy because once we have makes us happy because once we have minimized this we have an Euler Lagrange equation and when we can start studying the Euler Lagrange equation and you know I mean it's no longer I mean since we're dealing with vector valid object it's not clear what a radial function would be right but sort of you could imagine that hopefully there is some sort of ODE in the background and if you would understand this perhaps you could eventually solve the conjecture excuse me what sigma Excuse me, what's sigma on the left-hand side in the first one? I bring this up in a second. So these are the Dirac matrices. So in other words, this is the Dirac operator. Okay, that's the I guess there is just one natural way you can define a gradient-like object on spinners. That's the Dirac operator. And in R3, there are explicit formulas, which I will recall in a slide. Will recall in a slide. Thanks for the question. If there's anything unclear, please feel free to interrupt me. So, is the conjecture about the best constant or you do have a lower bound? Yes, that's correct. So, the inequality itself can be proved with a variety of methods. It's really the question is really what the best constant is, and perhaps also to characterize the cases of equality. This related. This related to the spin Yamabi problem studied by I forget and there's an inequality of Hiyasi. There is a relation, but there are reasons that this is sort of stronger. But yes, there is a close relation to that. So, in particular, what I will show you is kind of we reprove and extend some works that Extend some works that were there. But yes, that's correct. Okay, so that was these two conjecture related a priori not. Somehow, I mean, in the application that I will give you, both of them will be related, and who knows? Related, and who knows? I mean, the objects look very similar. I would not be surprised if there would be a relation, but so far, we don't understand that. Thank you. All right. So, I was going to tell you why proving the existence of minimizers in this problem is actually a non-trivial problem. You know, there are many, many works how to prove existence of minimizers. There are many techniques that are around. Are many techniques that are around, and in fact, there is also the existence of minimizers for the spin inequality, but that follows by rather standard methods. Here for this problem with the vector fields, there are three difficulties. The first one is that the equation is quasi-linear. I'm saying quasi-linear because the Euler-Lagrange equation is quasi-linear, right? I mean that the power here is not two, but it's three halves. But it's three halves. There's a certain non-locality that comes from this constraint here. And then there's the vector-valuedness. And so let me go through these difficulties. So there are typically three basic methods how to prove existence of minimizers or in this even this relative compactness of minimizing sequences. Perhaps the most elegant one is Lieb's method of the missing mass. But this method really But this method really hinges strongly that the norm, the good and the norm that you want to minimize, is a Hilbert space norm. So because we have the power 3, 2, that method does not work. Then there's this method of Lyons, his concentration compactness principle, but that is very local in spirit. And in recent years, there have been many inequalities where, I mean, where this just does not work. And I mean, to explain this non-locality, And I mean, to explain this non-locality, I mean, you have a vector field A, and then you try to find this scalar function chi such that the grad chi approximates A in L3 norm. Okay, so for your A, you construct a chi. But the point is simply, if your A consists of two bumps, one bump A here and another bump of A there, each one of these bumps has its chi, right? Right, but the sum of the A's generates chi's, but the chi for the sum is not the sum of the chi's. Am I making sense? I mean, you have an A, even if A is compactly supported, the chi will not be compactly supported. It's extended all over space. And so you have tails of one bump leaking into the other one. And since the underlying equation for the chi is again a For the chi is again a quasi-linear equation, it's for us very hard to get a good control on the chi. And then the other method that's also familiar from problems in conformal geometry, I called it Trujinger-O-Bin method of subcritical approximations. I'm not sure whether these names are appropriate, but I guess you all know what I have in mind. And so that means that, first of all, you look at the inequality. First of all, you look at the inequality on S3 so that it's compact, and then you lower the exponent. And then you try to prove bounds for solutions of the corresponding subcritical problem, which are uniform as this power approaches the critical power. Now that is based on regularity theory, and I think it's well known that regularity theory for vector-valued problems is quite a bit harder, in particular when you want to do things like In particular, when you want to do things like MOSA iteration and so on. So, I'm not saying that these methods do not work, but at least what I want to say is that there are significant obstacles and it's not clear how to make them work. What we will do is we'll use a method based on Eclon's variational principle, which is a little bit in the spirit of this, that we will have an equation to work with, but it's sort of a different type of equation. But it's sort of a different type of equation. And then we use a sort of truncation argument to get our control on these functions. This method appears kind of in a, I don't know, there's like half a page in a paper by Garcia Peral from 1998, where he suggests that one could approach the problem in this way. I guess because in his case, there are all these three other techniques, he did not really give many details, and so it was fun for us. And so it was fun for us to really see how this essentially forgotten method, or at least I should say, non-common method, can be made work here in this problem. But anyway, before I tell you more about this problem, let me now go back and let me tell you what the real theorem and what the real question is that we wanted to prove. And then at the end of the talk, I will come back to these two conjectured inequalities. So here's the theorem. That's a theorem that's not a conjecture, but there is also a conjecture here. So, first of all, here are the Pauli matrices that I was mentioning. So, I guess you can understand all this thing in terms of Clifford multiplication and make it somehow more abstract. I'm just using because I mean, we will have to do in the proofs real computations, and those are sometimes easy. Computations. And those are sometimes easier when you have a concrete representation. So you take these three Pauli matrices, sigma one, sigma two, sigma three, two by two matrices self-adjoint. And when you have a vector in R3, then you can define the dot product between the Pauli matrices and the vector just by multiplying the matrices by the components of the vector. Okay, and so the equation we're interested in is this one. So we have here. So we have here, this is, as I said, the Dirac operator. Sigma dot nabla is the Dirac operator. And then you have a vector field. And so you think of this as sort of a vector, which you dot into the Pauli matrix. And then you have a function psi, and you require that this operator acting on the function psi is equal to zero on R3. Okay, now we need certain regularities. Regularity assumptions. So, the vector field is always supposed to be L3, and the function is supposed to be in Lp for some P between 3 halves and infinity. You should not pay too much attention to these values. One can prove a theorem that if it satisfies this condition for one p, then actually it satisfies the same condition for any p. So it's just some initial regulation. It's just some initial regularity. And anyway, so the theorem says that if this equation has a non-trivial solution, then the magnetic field or the A, cannot be too small. And so what you get here is that the curl of this vector field in the three-halves norm is bounded below by a certain number. All right. And so And so, well, the number involves exactly this S3, the Sobolev constant that we've seen on the first slide. And it's natural to, when you look at this inequality, to measure the quality of this bound in terms of this factor 2 times S3. So, in other words, for such an equation, For such an equation to have a non-trivial solution, the curl of A in three-half's norm needs to be large. And the question is, what's the smallest possible A for which you have a non-trivial solution of this equation? That's the optimization problem, right? So we want to minimize this norm here, this here on the left side. And so the theorem says that 2 is So, the theorem says that 2s3 works. I will tell you that the inequality with 1 times s3 is very easy. And on the other hand, I will show you, or I mean, it's just the next line, that the inequality cannot hold with a constant greater than 4s3. The value of 4s3 comes from certain solutions that Loss and Yao. That Loss and Yao, this is HT Yao, they constructed a certain pair of functions psi and A, for which the three-halfsnom is exactly four times S3. And so the natural conjecture would be that these solutions of loss and Yau are actually the optimal solutions for this thing. And again, I should emphasize that this is a conformally invariant problem. Is a conformally invariant problem. Okay, in the sense that if you make a Merbius transformation of R3 and you transform A and Psi correspondingly, then this norm, I mean the three halves norm of curl A will be unchanged. All right. And if, so perhaps I should have said that first, if these conjectured sobola inequalities, These conjectured Sobolev inequalities that I mentioned on the previous slide would be true, then we would actually get the inequality with 4S3. And so the point is you have two conformally invariant problems, but there are Sobolev inequalities, but somehow the conformal invariance is preserved if you sort of concatenate them. And now to give you a little bit of background. To give you a little bit of background, why one should care about this problem. So, I mean, this comes from mathematical physics. There's something called a Pauli operator, which appears when you take the electrons spin into account. And the spin couples to the magnetic field. I should say that curl A is the magnetic field, A is the vector potential. And there is a famous work by Frehrlich, Lieb and Loss from 1986, where they Where they recognized that zero modes, namely solutions of this equation, actually present a fundamental obstacle to the stability of matter. And so starting from their work, so first of all, when they wrote this paper, they did not know whether there were solutions to this equation at all. Perhaps they even thought that one can rule out the existence of such solutions. The existence of such solutions, and then a few months later, I guess, Los and Yao were actually able to write down a particular pair of solutions, psi and a. And since then, there's been a huge literature on people just trying to find solutions A and Psi for this equation. And they've found a lot of structure in this equation. So, when one looks at the corresponding problem in 2D, one can classify all 2D, one can classify all such solutions a and psi. This is what's called the Arnov-Kescher theorem in mathematical physics. In three dimensions, that probably can be understood as an index theorem. In three dimensions, such a theorem will probably not hold. I'm not sure, but in any case, it's not known. So that's the background. Let me perhaps very briefly tell you the solution. The solutions that Loss and Yao found. I mean, these are the functions ψ and A that you might remember from the first slide, right? Which are the conjectured optimizers. And then you can check that they satisfy this equation. So in that sense, the two, I mean, this is the optimizer for one inequality, that's the optimizer for the other inequality, and they together form a solution of this thing. So that is a certain relation between the inequality. That is a certain relation between the inequalities. And then I should also say that, I mean, just because of conformal invariance, it's natural to look at the problem on S3 and that there is also a very close connection between these vector fields and the Hopf vibration. But let me not get into this because of lack of time. So I was comparing at the beginning of the talk the scalar. The scalar situation with a non-scalar situation. So let me present you the simple scalar analog of the question that we're asking. Okay, so look at this equation, this call it Schrödinger equation. Okay, so you have a solution u of minus Laplacian u plus vu equal to zero on R3. And you could ask yourself, what is the minimal What is the minimal three-halves norm of V for which you have a non-trivial solution of this equation? And the answer is this is exactly the Sobolev constant. And that's a very simple proof. And some of you might remember that this is exactly the argument that we've seen yesterday in Matt Gursky's talk. It's exactly the Hölder inequality where he was comparing minimizing the first eigenvalue of the conformal Laplacian. Eigenvalue of the conformal Laplacian under volume constraint to the Yamabi constant. So let's go through that argument again. It's very straightforward. So first of all, this is the equation you have. You multiply the equation by u and you integrate. And then you see that the gradient squared is equal to minus the integral of v u squared. So now the gradient. So now the gradient u squared you bound from below using the Sobolev inequality from the first slide, and you bound the right side from above using Holder's inequality. And then you see that if U is non-zero, then you can cancel it and you see that the three-halves norm of V has to be at least S3. So that was very simple. And what I'm trying to And what I'm trying to tell you is that the vector spinner field case is quite a bit harder than that. And I should perhaps also say that if you plug in an optimizer of the Sobolev inequality, then you get equality. So the minimal S value of V is actually S3. I put here on this slide some comments. It perhaps It's perhaps worth mentioning this explicitly so that there's a certain gauge invariance in the problem. So, if you have a solution psi A of this equation, look at this equation over here, right? Then you can multiply psi by e to the i chi. Well, that produces when you take the gradient, that produces a gradient chi, and that you can put into the a. Okay, so. Okay, so that's what I wrote here. So if you have a solution, then e to the i chi times psi and a minus grad chi is also a solution for any real function chi. And the problem is invariant under this gauge chi because of course the curl doesn't see the gradient. And then we have already talked about the conformal invariance of the problem, so let me skip that. That. Let's what we want to do is I want to tell you that the bound with 1 times S3 is actually easy to get using more or less the same techniques that we've seen for the scalar problem. Remember, that was the Sobolev inequality and that was Holder's inequality. Let's apply these two inequalities and see what we get. Okay, so once again, this is our equation. Once again, this is our equation. What we do now is we take the square of this equation. That obviously integrates to zero. Now, what we can do is we open up the square and we work out what these sigma matrices do. This is, I guess, related to some Weizenberg formula. So, you find once the order. So you find once the ordinary Laplacian on psi. And then you have an additional term, which is psi conjugate sigma dot curl ape psi. Okay, now what we want to do is, so we write the inequality as this guy is equal, this integral is equal to that integral. So we want to bound this inequality from below. Inequality from below, there's an inequality which is easy to see, which is that, so remember, psi is a c2-valued object. So, if I take the gradient, I mean the component-wise gradient, perhaps putting this vector field on, then this is an absolute value greater than if I take the absolute value of psi, this is a scalar function, and take its gradient. It's a simple pointwise inequality. So, using this, I can bound this term from below by first dropping A and then taking the absolute value of psi. Well, this gets me to the same quantity that appears in the Sobolev inequality, in the scalar problem. We can bound this from below. We get the constant S3 psi to the 6, and that's what we will do with this term. Now, what we have to Now, what we have to do on the other hand is we have to get an upper bound on that term. We do that using Holder's inequality. So, just pointwise, again, playing a little bit with the sigma matrices. This is bounded by psi squared times the length of the curl. So, therefore, we can use Holder's inequality just as we did before. Put psi in L6, put the curl in L3. And when you combine now these inequalities, you can cancel. Combine now these inequalities, you can cancel the six norms. It appears here and there. And you see that this integral, the integral of the curl, has to be greater than the S3, which proves this inequality. So that was simple, and that was more or less the same argument as in the scalar case. How we can get better and get up to two. And get up to 2 times S3. And we do that in two steps. The first thing is a so-called improved diamagnetic inequality. I told you that this inequality, this was the inequality that we've been using before, that was a simple point-wise inequality that is valid for any function psi. On the other hand, if you know that your function says Your function satisfies this equation, then you can improve the constant. Instead of one, you can put a square root of three halves. So if you would use that argument, then go through the same argument just to place it by this better constant, then you would get the constant three halves, which is sort of halfway between. Which is sort of halfway between one times s3 and two times s3 that we want. You should think of the three halves in some sense that there is one equation, one constraint. I mean, the gradient has three components, and there is one constraint here because you can express one component in terms of the other two. That's a rough idea. These types of inequalities, this sort of improved diamagnetic inequalities, they have appeared several times. Appeared several times before. I think one of the first instances is Stein's work, where he looks at harmonic extensions to the upper half plane. So he has harmonic functions in the upper half plane. He has constraints on the divergence and the curl, and he used that inequality to the maximal inequality fails at L1, but he applies, say, the maximal inequality. Say the maximal inequality to the square root of the function he's interested, then he applies the maximal inequality with a square and he gets what he wants. So, put differently, the reason Stein uses this is to effectively lower the power of a function, to replace a function by a function to a smaller power. So, hi, Rupert. This is so good. There's also this. Rupert, this is so good. There's also this Cato inequality, right? Absolutely, yes. So, if there is no A in some sense, I think it's Cato or something. Yes, but I think that's much later. So, I think the Stein thing is probably. The Stein thing is for the subharmonicity of the group. Absolutely, absolutely, yes. Absolutely. And exactly. So, there's a huge circle of A circle of results that go in this direction. As Sagun was mentioning, there's a Carto inequality which goes in that direction. Actually, perhaps even Carto has proved this original inequality. Yeah, he uses this regularization, which is in your slide. Psi squared plus epsilon square. Right, right. And then the very same inequality has been used by Yao. This is S-T-Y by Shin-Simon. T Yao by Shen Simon Yao in the context of minimal surfaces, and many times before, where they so it's an argument that allows you to change the power of the function, roughly. And then there are works which treat these inequalities from a more systematic and representation theoretics point of view by Calderbank, Gudescho-Herzlich, and by Branson. And an inequality very similar to the one that we're writing down. Very similar to the one that we're writing down is due to Feehan from 2001. I think there are some differences because our inequality really does not need any regularity. See, you have always some, I mean, everything is sort of easy when your function is not zero. But when the function actually has zeros, then you start to worry what happens there, and can there be some delta functions sitting in there? Delta functions sitting in there. So Fians inequalities for smooth objects which are not zero, but we can actually prove it by just using tools from Sobolev space theory. We can prove the inequality as an inequality between L1 log functions. So, but the upshot is this gets us half the way. So, what is the other half of the way? That's an identity. Of the way that's an identity, it's very, well, I mean, it's an identity. There's not much to say about it. The ingredient is that we, this is what I mentioned before, therefore I was talking about this, we lower the power of the function. See, in the argument before, we were looking at the function psi itself and we're working with psi, which was in L6. Over here, Over here, the plan will be to work with a function psi to the power one-half instead of with the function psi. And then we need to compute an object like this. And well, there is a term which involves gradients, m psi, m psi divided by epsilon psi. And then here it involves this term here, which is our friend from ingredient one. Which is our friend from ingredient one, right? That thing here, that's the power three halves, that thing is non-negative. And therefore, if you drop this term, then you get an inequality, namely that the gradient of square root of psi squared is less than something involving the A field. Okay, I should perhaps just one more word about this inequality is, I mean, first of all, it's the component. I mean, first of all, it's the computation. The fact that we put here A is sort of a triviality. You can just factor, I mean, see the influence of the A and see that this doesn't really change things. So, but you still need to prove it without the A. Again, you have to be a little bit careful about the places where the function psi is equal to zero. And again, I mean, the standard argument is to add an epsilon. And let this go to zero at an appropriate place. Anyway, once you have these two ingredients, then as I told you, you have this inequality. So what we're going to do is we're going to integrate that inequality over all of our three. And now, see what we want to do is we want to use the equation. The equation. So that means we put in this Weizenberg formula again. So where we put now pass from the usual gradient to this sigma dot, the Dirac operator. And that just as before results in an additional term sigma dot curl A. The first term, because we have the equation, is equal to zero. So therefore, the setting is the same. We have a bound. Setting is the same. We have a bound on the gradient from above by something that involves sigma dot a. Now, what we do is it's the same situation as before, except that instead of psi, we have roughly speaking square root of psi. So we bound that side here from below by the Sobolev inequality. We bound that from above by Holder's inequality. And then you see because there was the factor one-half here, we've improved. The one half here, we've improved our constant to two. All right, so that's as good as we can do it. And the big open problem is whether somebody can actually go up to 4s3 or perhaps actually tell us that there's a counterexample, that some other norm is best possible. So let me make a couple of remarks. So, let me make a couple of remarks concerning this previous proof. So, first of all, if you like Lorentz spaces, you can play the whole game in Lorentz spaces, right? There are Sobolev inequalities in Lorentz spaces and Holder's inequality in Lorentz spaces. So all that goes through. What's somewhat interesting is that at the end point, when you use the weak norm, then we actually believe that we can show that this. We can show that this argument is best possible. So then, this two sort of that we get is actually cannot be improved. Another thing is that this Los-Yau pair of solutions that I showed you on one of the previous slides actually satisfies a somewhat different equation in addition to the equation we've been talking about. Namely, you got a sigma dot. You got a sigma dot nabla, so this is the Dirac operator, but then on the right side, you have a lambda times psi. And for such equations, for solutions of such equations, we can actually prove, excuse me, I should say that lambda here is a function. Okay, it's a emphasize a function. And again, by dimensional counting, the L3 norm is the natural norm for this object. And for this type of equation, we can actually show the lower bound with. Show the lower bound with optimal constant. And if lambda would be positive, and if lambda would be smooth, that would be exactly Hiassi's inequality about the eigenvalue. And our contribution is, I mean, to remove all the smoothness conditions and also, more importantly, allow for a negative sign. And you can also see that perhaps explains. See that perhaps explains what was asked before. The spin or Yamabi problem has here a scalar object. Our problem has sigma dot a here, and therefore it is not scalar. In that sense, it's sort of a generalization or extension of that. I should say that Say that parts of this argument work for four dimensions three and higher as well. That these Los Yao modes have extensions to these dimensions. And as I already said, for four dimensions, there are things to be understood. Anyway, so that's what I wanted to say about this original problem. Now, for the last seven minutes or so, I want to come back to these two conjectures that we had at the beginning. So, the first thing is The is that I owe you still a proof why these two conjectures actually would imply the bound with 4 S3. But that's by now almost the usual argument. So let's start with the equation, right? So sigma dot nablab psi is equal to sigma dot ape psi. So if you take the three halves norm, you get this identity. Now what you do, you bound this thing here. Note carefully. This thing here. Note carefully that we have now a three-halves norm. So far, we were always working with a two-norm, but now we have a three-halves norm, and then we could use our conjecture one to bound the left side from below by the three-norm of psi. On the other hand, as you know by now, here we apply Holder's inequality to bound this from above. So we get now the Holder, the three norm of A, which is different. Which is different from what we had before, right? Before, we always used the Sweizenberg formula to get some quantity of curl A. But so, in order to do that now, we use the second conjecture, which allows us to bound the three norm of A by the curl. And you know, here there's this gauge fixing, right? But so we just choose and use the gauge invariance of the inequality to variance of the inequality to choose A in such a way that the optimal gradient is actually zero. So therefore you have the inequality that the three norm of A is bounded by a constant times the three half norm of curl A. Once again you cancel the three norms of psi and you arrive at the claimed inequality with a four. Okay and everything is consistent because these functions for which we conjecture that inequality hold are precisely those Equality hold are precisely those functions for which Loss and Yao have shown that the equation holds. Everything is consistent. All right, so now let's talk about the existence of minimizers. And I was already telling you that the usual methods do not apply, or at least do not apply immediately, and that we do something else. And let me roughly sketch the The idea of the proof. So one thing that relates to the question: I mean, whether we have the inequality with some constant, yes, the answer is yes. And we even have more. We have a so-called refined inequality. That was something that Gerard, Maillet, and Uru have shown to be a very useful tool. That's, for instance, the basis of these bubble decompositions. The basis of these bubble decompositions, which are used in many PDE problems. And so, once you have such a refined inequality with possibly a wrong constant, I mean, you don't care about the value of the constant, then you can immediately find that minimizing sequences have a non-trivial weak limit. And so, the interesting question now is to show that the weak limit is not zero. Okay, that's a little bit like in the EMRB problem. Like in the YMRB problem, you want to show that the limit is not zero. Now, just as in the YMRB problem, you want to have an equation to work with. Now, we do not look at subcritical approximations, but what Ecland tells us is that we can look at that minimizers can be assumed to satisfy an equation with a right side, and the right side tends to zero in a rather good norm. So we have an equation to work with. Equation to work with and then we can apply to that equation a truncation argument that's not completely trivial in the vector-valued setting, but that can be done as shown by Dalmas and Murat. And then we can pass to the limit and see that the weak limit satisfies the limiting equation, and that then proves also that it's non-zero in particular. I mean, sorry, that it has the full norm, which is what we want to show. Norm, which is what we want to show. And now, so that's the general outline. Now, there is one thing that whichever proof of compactness you use, at some point you would like to use the Rayleigh-Kondrchov lemma. Okay, at some point you would like to use that if your gradients converge weakly, then the functions themselves converge almost everywhere. You need to use this to when you have a non-linear problem, right, to pass. Non-linear problem, right, to pass to the limit in the non-linearity to, I mean, upgrade weak convergence to almost everywhere convergence. And essentially, even if we would use a different proof from the one that I've outlined here, we would need such an ingredient. And the point here is that this is not trivial. And this is my last slide where I tell you a little bit about this non-linear Rayleigh-Kondrich theorem. So I have a So, I have a sequence of vector fields whose curls converge weakly in L three halves. And then I'm assuming that I have a gauge condition. And the point is that this gauge condition is non-linear. Now, you might ask me, where does this gauge condition come from? Well, look at this constraint here. Look at this constraint here, right? When you optimize over chi, you get an Euler-Lagrange equation. An Euler-Lagrange equation, and that Euler-Lagrange equation is exactly this divergence condition. Okay, so this is it's from this point of view of the inequality, it's very natural to have minimizing sequences which have this satisfy this condition. And as I said, this is non-linear with respect to A. And the theorem is that if you have such a sequence, then you have strong Then you have strong convergence in L P log as long as P is subcritical. Okay. And this would be completely standard if you had just the condition divergence of a n equal to zero. Because then you, I mean, then you could take differences and then you could just appeal to the scalar result. Now here Scalar result. Now, here there is really something you need to prove. For technical reasons, it's convenient to prove the whole thing on the sphere, for one forms on the sphere. And then what it boils down to is to a stability theorem for the three Laplace equation or the n Laplace equations in Rn, RSn. Okay, so you have a certain equation that's a three Laplace equation on the sphere, and you have two different right-hand side. And you have two different right-hand sides, ψ1 and ψ2. And you want to say that if these xi's differ by little, then the solutions differ also by little. And we use results, quite deep results actually, by Ivan Niecz, who proves such equations below the critical exponent. I think I'm out of time to explain this further, but I hope I've given you somewhat I hope I've given you somewhat a flavor of what we've done and what we would like to do. And I thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you very much for the wonderful talk. Are there questions, further questions? Can I ask questions? Yes, please. Do you mean? Please. So, in your improve to obtain the constant two, you do not use a conformal invariance. That's correct. I think that's correct, yes. So, if you, for instance, you can perhaps try to assume that your spinner is subject to some vanishing moment according to the and then try to use the improve several F inequalities that have been explained to us just in the talk before you, in fact. Just the talk before you, but did you have tried this? No, we have not tried it. It is indeed a natural idea. But then again, as far as I understand, these inequalities are proved by compactness. So I'm not sure how one could get actually explicit constants out of that. But I mean, yes, this is improved. This improves 'cause it it is a work by Obama that It is a work by Oban that it was told to us just the talk before you. Right, I understand. So, if you are in the sphere, you can improve the base constant for functions that satisfy the moment in equality vanish along all affine functions. I understand, but isn't it the case? But isn't it the case? So, it will mean that in your case, you have an L2 term as well. So, you can improve the constant front of the gradient. But for the spinorial approach, for the spinorial approach, you only use the soboleph inequalities on Rn, on R3, with a factor two, with the L2. So, I think this Soble F inequalities can be improved if you have furthermore than. Furthermore, then your file satisfies certain vanishing moments. We will look into this. Thank you for the suggestion. Yes. I have a question, Rupert. Have you tried to use your ideas which are extremely beautiful to the Burgundian-Bragis inequality? You know, that is also quasi-linear. Yes. Has that flavor with P equals N. P equals n, you know, what you're talking about, and you get that in the Euler-Lagrange equation, and it has this flavor of divergence zero and all of that. And I'm wondering, because this the only known result is in 2D. It's a paper of van Schaftingen and Heimbreis. And they don't know anything about even the existence of minimizers in higher D. Because in 2D, it just becomes a Laplace. Yes. Plus. Yes, yes. That's interesting. Thanks for the suggestion. We have not thought about it. You might be able to make some progress. I have some feeling that you might be able to go further using your ideas, especially the last slides that you talked about. It might be very applicable. Thank you. We can perhaps talk about it. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Okay, any further question? Well, if not, I would like to thank Rupert and all the speakers of this afternoon.
