 Okay, let's start. Thank you, Ribari, for having me. So, I will not be talking about knots, but I will be talking about something that has some topology and some random stuff here. So, just as a reminder, the chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors that we need in order to give color to the vertices, so that if two vertices are joined by an edge, they have a different color. This problem is known to be hard, so we need bounds. Finding an upper bound usually means finding an explicit coloring and finding lower bounds when there are different bounds. The kind of ones I want to talk today are topological bounds. Of course, we're all familiar with the four-color theorem for planar graphs, but that's actually a number bound. But that tells us that topology is somehow related to chromatic number of graphs. Number of graphs. And the nice construction by Novas in 1978 with the neighborhood complex of a graph is a lower bound for the combined number of a graph, and it works for any graph. So basically, how this construction works is that we have a graph H, then we construct a sequential complex called the neighborhood complex, and then we study the connectivity of that neighborhood complex, and that gives a chromatic that gives a lower bound for the chromatic number. That gives a lower bound for the combined number. The neighborhood computer for graph is like this. It's a simplicial complex where the vertices of the graph are the vertices of the sim of the simplicial complex, and the simplices are the subset of vertices such that they have a neighbor in common. Balomash proved in 1978 that the connectivity of the neighbor complex purpose 3 is less than or equal to the common number of the graph, and he used that to compute. And he used that to compute the connectivity of the neighborhood complex of a special family of graphs called the Knesser graphs. And this number basically matches with the known upper boundary commercial number. So he established the commercial number of that family of graphs. And in particular, it proves that for this family of graphs, this topological lower bound is sufficient because it matches exactly with the upper bound. So a natural question that we may ask is: how well does this kind of Ask is how well does this kind of topological lower bounds perform for random graphs. Talking about random graphs, we can study the erdos ranking random graph. So that means we have n vertices and each pair of vertices we add it as an edge with probability p, independent of each other. So Kerr computed this in 2007, and basically, at least for this parameter p, he was able to prove that. P, he was able to prove that the connectivity of a neighborhood complex asymptotically almost surely is bounded between these two constants, 1 over epsilon minus 3 and 4 over epsilon minus 3. However, the combined number of the graph in that regime is tone to grow to infinity, so of course this is a very, very inefficient lower boundary number. So instead, the next question that we can ask is can we instead build a different model for random graphs? Different model for random graphs where actually these kinds of topological overbounds are responsible. So, to do that, what we did is that we define this graph that we're calling random Borsu graphs. To do that, in dimension D, we need a distance epsilon greater than zero. And then the vertices are going to be n independent points on the surface of the n of the d-dimensional sphere. Sphere and we will connect two of them if their distance is at least pi minus epsilon. So that means if they are almost antiprop to each other. So here's an example. It's a one-dimensional one. The combined number is ensoplin 3. And this is a two-dimensional one with combined number 4. So when we were able to compute this, if we let the parameter epsilon go to 0 while n goes to infinity, we can. While n goes to infinity, we can find the threshold at which the Cromwell number changes. So if epsilon is greater than or equal to a constant times this term, then almost surely the Cromwell number is exactly equal to 2. And if epsilon is less than that constant times this, then as in totally almost surely the Cromwell number is at most e plus 1. So the lower bound to these chromatic numbers is indeed Is indeed topological and it's equivalent to this known theorem by Borsuka Nulam about C to map between the n-dimensional sphere and the n minus one-dimensional sphere. Basically, what it means is that there is no C to map from Sn into Sn minus one. And the upper bound can be realized by an explicit coloring, which can be realized by projecting the faces of the P plus one simplex onto a sphere. So then that was good, and we were thinking, can we generalize this in another way? Basically, we can think of the antipodalities as sik to action. And then what we are doing is that when we are connecting x and y, if the distance at least pi minus epsilon is the same as connecting x with y if the distance between x and minus 1 is at most epsilon. Most epsilon. So, thinking in that way, what we can do is that we can connect points to other points if x is, we will connect x to all the points that are close to the orbit of x. And that will give us a graph. So, to get the direction, we define what we call g borse graphs. So, suppose that we have a graph G that is finite, and we have a geometric And we have a geometric G-simplicial complex. So that means it is a simplicial complex where we have an action of the group G that is a free action. We have a free action of the group G. So then if we have a subset of that graph, of that space, we can build a graph where the vertices is that subset, and we will construct an And we will construct an edge if and only if there exists some element that is not identity, such that the distance between x and g of y is among epsilon, or the distance between g of x and y is among this is an example if we consider a c2 action on the torus or on the two torus, this is how it would look like, or this is how it would look like if we consider the c3 action on a circle. And of course, this is an extension of And of course, this is an extension of the previous construction. So let me speak this for a bit. So when we talk about G simplicial complexes, it's always useful to compare them with some classifying spaces. In the case of C2 simplicial complexes, we compare them with the spheres. And the sphere can also be seen as having a C2 joint with C2 D plus 1 times. So the same can. Times. So the same can be done for other groups where we define the declassifying space as basically G joined with itself D plus 1 times. And this is a D dimensional approximation to the classified space. And once we have that, we can define the G index as the minimum dimension such that we can find a G map between X and this classifying space. This classifying space. And there are some properties on how to compute the G index. In particular, the G index of the D dimensional classifier space is equal to D, which we can think of that as a generalization of Boltzmann-Coulomb theorem. It was proven in ID3, but I thought. So we can think about the chromatic number of these graphs. It is actually a topological property of the space where we are drawing these graphs, and we can And we can think of that as the covering number. How many open sets we need in order that we can cover that such that UI intersection G of UI is empty for every element of the group. Then the chromatic number of the Bolshevik rafts is equal to that G covering number provided that the subset of vertices is dense enough and that our epsilon is small enough. And so then we can compare. And so then we can compute that number or this bounds to that number. The lower bound that we found is g plus d, the size of g plus d, and the upper bound that we found is this linear function on also dimension gene and the size of g. So we know the exact number for these cases, for the sit two group, for dimension zero, for dimension one, and for dimensions two and three, we just know it for small cases. For small cases. In all of these cases, the actual number corresponds to this lower bound, and it's the upper bound that we found here. Our conjecture is that in general, this chromatic number is always equal to this lower bound. And this is how the upper bounds that we found for those spaces look like. And what I wanted to get to is that the lower bound that we give is actually topological. Actually, it's topological and is very similar to Lobash's idea because what we do is that we start with a group with a graph H, then we construct a proxy infliction complex. This is known as the home complex, which was introduced by Babson and Kozlov. Then we stored the gene index of it, and that is what gives us the lower bound for our and then finally. And then finally, we also extended this to a probabilistic setting. So if we draw the points randomly, we also have a very similar threshold for when the commercial number changes between the corresponding to that dimension and for the dimension B. Questions will have to be at the after party. The next figure is Peter Frexford. He's doing research in PSU, so we got lucky to contact him during the workshop. If people don't mind, right? Oh, yeah. Thank you to the organizers for allowing me to speak here. Allowing me to speak here, despite the fact that my talk will contain no randomness. But there will be some knots and there will be some braids. My name is Peter Huxwitt. I'm going to be talking about some joint work with Jeron Cilia Wetre. And so let me begin by defining some notation. When I say conf nc, I'm going to be referring to the unordered configuration space of n points in the complex plane. In the complex plane. And I will be talking about the following problem, which is to classify all the holomorphic maps from conf NC to conf Mc for various values of M and N. And I'll only be considering holomorphic maps up to a certain kind of equivalence. So we will consider two maps to be equivalent if they induce the same map to the configuration space modulo the affine group, where the affine group is. The affine group, where the affine group acts on each point of your configuration simultaneously. So, this is the question, and let me give you some examples of some holomorphic maps. So, I'm going to be showing you a lot of pictures and animations of this form. On the left will be an example of something in the domain, and on the right will be an example of something, the corresponding thing in the codomain. So, here, So, here I will illustrate to you the discriminant, which is defined as follows. You take n distinct complex numbers and you compute this product, and you get a non-zero complex number at the end. And if you move the points on the left like so, then the discriminant loops around zero. So, this is the discriminant. And once you have that, you can start building other holomorphic maps, like pick your favorite configuration in the complex plane. In the complex plane, x0, and then just define this holomorphic map, take your discriminant, and then multiply everything in x0 by your discriminant. And for this example, moving the points, we'll just do this. But under my equivalence relation, this is no different than a constant map. And here's another thing you could do: you could take the identity map, but kind of mess it up with the discriminant. And when you move the points like this, When you move the points like this, it looks kind of wild. But this is just the identity map for me. You might wonder if there are other holomorphic maps. And there's a theorem due to Lin, which says that if you have at least five points in the domain, and you're not producing more points than you started with, then any holomorphic map is equivalent to either a constant map or the identity map. And in fact, last year, Le Chen and Exulte improved this result, relaxing the bound on M. And it's actually a conjecture that you don't need this bound at all. You just need to say that n is at least 5. So why do all these theorems have n at least 5 in them? Well, the reason is because when you have fewer than 5 points, there are other holomorphic maps that you can construct. Maps that you can construct. And one of them you may know under a different guise. But when you solve the quartic equation, the method that you do that, you start with your quartic and you produce a cubic. And if you think about that first step of solving the quartic, you can interpret that as a holomorphic map from configurations of four points to configurations of three points, where the configurations are just the roots of those polynomials. And it's kind of remarkable that these three points are. That these three points are all distinct so long as the four points you begin with are. But you can prove that they are. So, once you start to get to more interesting holomorphic maps like this one, it becomes very useful to think about the induced map on the fundamental groups. So, the fundamental group of a configuration space of points in the complex plane is the Brain group. And this picture is basically why. picture is basically why. If you have a loop in your configuration space, you can use that to draw a braid. And this braid is called sigma i, and the sigma i's generate the braid group. So let's go back to the map coming from solving the quadric and look at the induced map on the fundamental groups. If you do sigma one in the domain, you get sigma one in the image. And if you do sigma two, it looks very close to being something else, but It's very close to being something else, but the output on the induced map on fundamental groups is just sigma 2. And then, any guesses for what sigma 3 is? Do people know? Well, I'll just show you. You get sigma 1 again. So, this is a special homomorphism from the grade group on 4 strands to the grade group on 3 strands. And there's also more homomorphisms. There's also more holomorphic maps if you have fewer than four points. If you have three points, you can build an elliptic curve with them. And elliptic curves are abelian groups. They come with a group law. And when you have a group, you can look at the set of all of the elements of order exactly equal to k. And on an elliptic curve, these are called elementary k-tortion points. And for this elliptic curve, it has a symmetry. This elliptic curve has a symmetry about the x-axis, so the k-tortion points for k bigger than 2 will come in pairs. And so, if your goal is to produce a configuration of points in the complex plane, what you can do is you can pick your favorite k and then look at the x-coordinates of the elementary k-tortion points. And this will give you a map between from three points in the complex plane to a configuration space of more points. Space of more points in the complex plane. So for example, if you look at the elementary three torsion points, there are nine three torsion points in total on an elliptic curve over C. Eight of those are elementary. And then you get half as many when you take their expoordinates, so three points to four points. And this is what happens when you do sigma one. You end up inducing a three cycle. So it's very Cycle. So it's very important that you're not considering both sides to be ordered configurations, because this doesn't lift to a map between the ordered configuration spaces. And to understand the braid that you get on the right a bit better, you might draw this circle, which is called the canonical reduction system of the braid. And if you were maybe trying to prove that the only holomorphic map between these two configuration spaces that was These two configuration spaces that was not equivalent to the constant map is this one. You can imagine how you might go. You might try to prove that the induced map on the fundamental group does something like this, and then maybe leverage that to prove that this holomorphic map is the only other one that you can do. And this is exactly what Jaron and I did last year. We proved that if you start with at least three points and you're not producing too many points. And you're not producing too many points, then you can only do some combination of the constructions that I've just talked about. So, what we're thinking about now is like, can we go further with this? So, we've been looking a lot at more animations like this one. Like, this is what you get when you look at the elementary four torsion points. There's 16 four torsion points. You remove the two torsion, you end up with 12, and then you half that, you get six points. You half that, you get six points. And then you can draw the canonical reduction system for this braid, and you get this. It starts to get more complicated as you go further up. So with five points, there's five squared minus one over two points in the complex plane that you get with this elliptic curve construction. And it's not really, it's kind of hard to see what this braid is until you draw in the canonical reductions. The canonical reduction system. So there's like five going around the outer circle and then like five going around inside. And the five going around inside are going around like twice as fast. What's really cool is that if you look at the elementary six torsion points, you also happen to end up with 12. So you might wonder, are these two maps that I just showed, are they genuinely different? Are they inequivalent holomorphic? Are they inequivalent holomorphic maps? And the answer is that they have to be because they have different, the image of signal one has a different canonical reduction system. So yeah, these are the things that we've been thinking about a lot. And my final slide just has some of the ingredients that we used in the proof of our theorem from last year. But basically, there's two steps. Step one is to reduce the problem to a group theory question. The problem to a group theory question. And the main theorem that helps you do that is this amazing theorem by Imayoshi and Shiga. They proved that basically if you have two holomorphic maps and they're roughly the same homomorphism between break groups, then the holomorphic maps must be equivalent. And the second step is to constrain the possible homomorphisms that could occur from a non-trivial. Occur from a non-trivial holomorphic map. And these are some of the tools that we use, basically like restricting conditions on the homomorphism. And then hopefully you get to a point where you've shown all the homomorphisms are the ones that come from homomorphic maps. Anyways, thank you for listening. All right, well, thanks because I am.  Like it full screen. Uh L. There is a little button. Yeah. Okay. How does this one? Okay. Tenure? Yes. Okay, so this is a joint with Joel, and we were thinking about some way to put random menu. Random manifolds, or maybe more precisely, random sub-manifolds. We work in any dimension. So we were inspired by some other previous work by physicists who were interested in percolation in its three dimension, followed by mathematicians who were interested in the same percolation. We were interested in the same circulation in three dimensions, followed by some people who made experiments with knots, with our paper, and we generalize it from three dimension and from three colours to any dimension, any code dimension, and general many points. Okay, so let's define the model. It works like that. We start with a triangulated, it is combinatorial, we start with a triangulated. Natural: We start with a triangulated unifa M. Then we randomly color the vertices of the triangulation with some set of K colors. And then we are going to define a subset, a sub-aniport. So before that, we are going to extend the coloring to all points in the simplest complex. And we are going to do it using the Boronoi coloring. So each point is going to be assigned the color of its Going to be assigned the color of its closest coverage. So, in each simplex, we're going to extend it like that. So, for example, if all are the same colour, we're going to cover the simplex with that color. But if they are two different colors, and how those that are closer to the blue are going to be blue, and the other one will be red, and some vertices in the middle are going to get two colors because they are exactly the same distance from vertices of different colors. And so on. So, here the middle point gets three different colors. So here the middle point gets three different colors. And after defining this coloring, our sub-manifolds are going to be the color classes. So for example, all the points that are colored green, or all the points that are colored both, say, blue, red, and green, according to some subset of our colors, of our set of colors. So this defines some subsets of our triangulated manifold and And let's look at some examples. So, suppose we start with this two-dimensional manifold, with this triangulation. So, let's look at different subsets that correspond to different sets of colours. So, if we look at one colour, for example, on this red point, it's going to be D-dimensional, the same dimension that we started with. If we are looking at two colors, then it's going to be codimension one, and so on. And if we are looking at all the k colors, Looking at all the k colors going to be codimension k minus 1. So, for example, in this case, the three color class, which is correspond to all three colors, are only these three points, which is codimension two. So, some basic questions about this model is: first of all, does it generate a manifold? Is this subset actually a sub manifold or not? And we are going to focus on the K color class, the colour. K-color class, the intersection of all K-colors. Another question is: what sub-manifold do we get out of this random model? Can we get all sub-manifolds or not? And we can also ask the same question restricting to some particular M. So either we ask: do we get this sub-manifold in some other high-dimensional manifold, or do we get some particular M? Do we get some particular n inside in some triangulation of some particular n? So, this is the kind of questions about this model that we should talk about before asking questions about random distribution later. Okay, so here is a theorem. This is an answer to the first question. So, indeed, if we assume that our larger manifold, the D manifold M, is combinatorial, then indeed any coloring of the vertices. Any coloring of the vertices, all color classes are going to be sub-manifolds. And in particular, it is a proper sub-manifold. If we start with a closed M, then all the sub-manifolds that we get are going to be closed. And no. And then the K-color class, the sub-manifold that we get from all colors is actually going to be closed. Okay, and the combinatorial, so having a starting from a combined. So, having a starting formal tendency to be a necessary condition, so here is a counterexample. If we take the double suspension of the quantum hormonal of this sphere, so this is some five manifold, and there is some two-color ring of it, where the two-color class turns out to be not manifold. So, indeed, we needed some really complicated organization the triangulation of the name. Okay, now for the let's turn to the second question. Let's turn to the second question. So what can we get some given some manifold and can we get it as a sub-manifold somewhere in some in some higher dimensional in our model? Okay, so there are some trivial answers to this question. So for example, if we color all the vertices red, then we get that the red color class is going to be copied today. The other trivial answer, if we take n times an interval and color all those vertices as well. All those vertex velc says red and all the other vertices blue, then the red-blue interface is going to be a copy of M. And so on with three colors. But it's a not interesting answer. And also, note that here the ambient manifold M is actually not closed. So other sub-manifolds that we get from this model might have boundaries, which we want to avoid. So we're not happy with this answer. So we ask the question differently. We want n to appear in some clause. n to appear in some closed k color. So now what we can do, we can take n times s1 for example and color s1 like that and then we get two copies of n as our submanifold in the red-blue color class. So we fix that question again and ask, no, we want to get n and only n. We want n to be the entire k color class in a closed manifold n. So that's the right question. So that's the right question. And then the answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no. So some examples that we can build is that we can always get a sphere as a K-color class in some higher dimensional sphere. But for example, we can never get the projective plane in this model. And the reason is that the projective plane is not boundable, it's not null-component. And in this model, the k-class tends always to be a boundary of Always to be a boundary of any k minus 1 card minus. So some sub-manifolds we can negatively get in this model. And our theorem is that this is only obstruction. So if we have a null component manifold n, then we can get it in this formula model inside some ambient manifold n. And this is a proof idea. Let's throw an example. So suppose n is two points. So n is. Is two points, so what so n is the boundary of something, so we take a red and blue copies of this something, then we multiply it by an interval, then we from the bottom we glue the two parts of this product, and from above we glue it with another copy of everything with the third color, and here you can see that n is a three-color class in this uh larger manifold, and this works in any dimension and in any number of colors. Okay. Carters. Okay, so now for the third question. So now suppose that we want to find if we can find n in some particular manifold m, and can we do that? So some trivial observation is that n must be embeddable in m, otherwise it never be some. But it turns out that our more observable, so for example, if m is orientable, then our models always generate orientable. Always generate orientable sub-maniforms. So, for example, we can never get the Klein bottle, even though it is a melancholy form. And let me skip the proof and just say that this is more general than that. So, if we have any trivial Stefan-Wittnik class, so this is the first example, in the ambient manifold M, K color. M, K color M, then also in the sub-manifold that you get, the spammy classes with invariants are going to be triggered. Okay, so this is what we know about this search question. And now, so for example, here is some example of another thing which is of factored basis, so some format we can never find in a six-coloring of time. Okay, and the last question that we can add is. Questions that we can add is: What if we want to find some particular isotopic class of some embedding of NM? And this is here an important special case would be what if we want to find some knot type, which is a copy of S1 inside S3. So, can we use this model to generate any random knots? And indeed, for notes, we proved that it is always possible. We proved that it is always possible, so we can get every link. Now we take the triangulated S3 and we colour at least three colors, so it's called dimension two. And indeed, we can get any link, and this is a little bit more general. We can get a surface span by this link, and we can get a noted sphere, and so on. And the next step is to look at the random manual that we get and their properties. And this is this. This is what God is going to speak about in a moment. We have some lists for today. Enjoy with us. Okay and writing looks the same. No questions tomorrow. So we saw this random model. I'm going to talk about three color classes. So you see here that we get the point. And I'll be talking about questions about knots in three manifolds and surfaces in four manifolds. So here we see a three-dimensional simplex, and if you think of this as three colors. And if you think of this as three colors, the two reds are one color, then the intersection will be some sort of arc going across that tetrahedron, and it fits together to form a link. In order to get a random link, we'll triangulate a manifold, we'll subdivide it. So, a nice way to do that is to divide it into cubes and then divide each cube into six tetrahedra in the case of three tethered. Six tetrahedra in the case of three dimensions. And then if you keep subdividing these cubes, you'll get more and more cubes and smaller and smaller tetrahedra. And you can explore random structures for lots of links in this model. So this was done by some physicists originally. They defined this model where you take a ball, you take two of the sides red, you color the sides of this cube to the Cube, the front and the right are red, the top and the left are blue, and the other two sides are green. And then you subdivide it into a bunch of square cubes, divide those into Tetrahitra, and then randomly color them. So here you see a 5 by 5 by 5 cube, and the sides are colored according to the scheme. The left and the top are blue, and so on. And if you take a random coloring, and we ran this for We ran this for many examples, and you'll see here a figure eight knot. You get a knot, of course, by connecting these two vertices. There's always a component going through of this. Generally, there's a problem with many random knot models is you get many components. But there's always a component going to the red, blue, green point at the top, the top back. The top back and the plus, there's a red over here. There's a red, a green, red, red, and blue adjacent to each other on the tetrahedron. So you'll always get a component going from one vertex to the other, and that's the component that you use. Create a knot out of it like this, and show, as Klein said, that every knot occurs, every knot of loop occurs. And similarly, Similarly, you can show that if you have a knot in the three-sphere, and you think of the three-sphere as the boundary of the four-ball, then every surface in the four-ball bounded by L is obtained by some coloring of the four-ball. Back in the three-dimensional case, these physicists conjectured that under this model, which they were Under this model, which they would study the probability of a non-naught goes to zero as you subdivide, so we wait to prove that. That's fairly standard for this type of question. Here's some statistics on, this is just the three-dimensional thing you can see as you subdivide, you have 4x4 by 4 cubes or 10 by 10 by 10 cubes, and so on. Lots of expense. You see what kinds of knots. Lots of expense. You see what kinds of knots. Only six knots out of ten to the tenth experiments in the four by four by four case, but you get more knots subdivides. So this gives some three manifold statistics. But now I want to go on to four manifolds, four manifold surface questions. So there was a theorem of Manolescu and Piccarillo that if one of these five knots is sliced, These five knots is slice, then there's a counterexample to the four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. So that motivated us to try and find some slice knots, some slice, some genus zero surfaces in the four-ball bounding these knots. Unfortunately, that motivation went away later because a graduate student at Texas showed that none of these were sourced directly. But it's still generally an interesting question to find. Generally, an interesting question to find the smallest genus of the surface in the four-ball bounding knot in the three-sphere. There's no known algorithm to do that. So we can experimentally search for such things using this model by first constructing a coloring of the free sphere, which has a given nodal link on the boundary, and then search for small genus. Search for small genus surfaces in the four ball by randomly coloring, fixing that coloring on the boundary, and then randomly extending it to a color of the interior of the four ball and then looking for the genus of that randomly generated surface. Now, actually, if you do that, it tends to give very high genus surfaces if you just take a random surface. But what you can do is then try to reduce the genus by changing the colour. Reduce the genus by changing the color. So you have some coloring of the full ball. Maybe we'll have genus 500, but then you can say, what happens to the genus if I change the color of this vertex? If it goes down, then you look for another vertex to change the color of. And then you don't want to be too strict. Sometimes you want to allow changes that increase the genus because you don't want to get stuck at local minima. Stuck at local minima. But anyway, you can do this, you can repeat many times and try and compute the four geniuses. See at least what an upper bound for the four genius is. So here's an example of a computation we did. This was a particular knot. We actually did do this on some knots where the four-ball genus is not known. It was known for this one. Anyway, Known for this one. Anyway, you can create a coloring of the three-sphere. So you should think of it. So you did this by creating colorings on little balls, which give you this kind of local tile structure. And you stick these tiles together to get a representation of that knot. You should think of this. When you fold this up, you get a two-sphere, and this knot lies on that two-sphere. It's not, not lies on that two-sphere, then there's a way of putting that two-sphere on the inside of the three-sphere, inside a three-ball actually, and then that three-ball goes on the boundary of a four-sphere. And a good experiment that we spent some time on is this granny knot, which is a slice knot. This is a double of trefoil. And we ran this 100 million times. And the four-ball genus is zero. This is a slice knot. And with 100 million iterations of some random program with some adjustment, we were able to find that the FOBO. Find that the four-ball genus was smaller or equal to one. So we found a, so in the three-sphere, it's genus two. So we were able to experimentally find the genus one surface in the four ball. And that took, I think that computation took seven years of Windows of a Windows computer. It was done on a parallel system for two weeks with 200 CPUs. So that was a complicated. But there's a lot of roof. But there's a lot of room for time for questions. Do you think what you need is more iterations or a more refined triangulation before? Or what was the first option? More iterations. Yeah, it's not clear. I think our. It's not clear. I think we had enough room in there to fit a genus surface, I think, but just barely. So that might have been one problem. Maybe we need more subdivisions. I think rather than more evarients, probably what we need is some better guidance, better ideas on how to re-cover if we get stuck. But I don't know, actually. We didn't vary. We tried varying a few parameters, but not yet. You know, five years ago, You know, five years ago I would have thought this was hopeless because you get stuck on a local minimum. But I think the lesson from neural networks is we shouldn't let that stop us. This method may be. I think this shows that it's not completely hopeless to find some progress on this. Questions? Is it possible that this model is Possible that this model is related to some like walk and confinement or something like that. We heard about walks in confinement, that spatial knots and confinement that yours is also the knot is sort of confined. But this is what I'm going to assume. But but this is finding a surface, not a walk, not a walk, so but for random not it is a space field. So it is a order of n2. Surface you get presumably it's not uh connected automatically. You need to take a component. There's always a unique component that balances. There's always a unique component that balance the market. Yeah, but but but you but there are other components that you can elaborate. Thank all the speakers very much. Yeah, thank you all the speakers this week. Thank you for that. Stay for doing this.
