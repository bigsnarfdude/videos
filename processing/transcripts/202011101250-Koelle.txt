Can you hear me and can you see my slides? Great. Great, wonderful. Well, first thanks to Leonid and also to Jesse for the invitation to come speak here. It's been a really fantastic conference so far, workshop so far. We've really enjoyed it. So I'm going to be talking, and my group's been steadily working on SARS-CoV-2 phylodynamics over the last Phylodynamics over the last six to eight months. And so, what I'll talk about today are two different projects: one where we are doing SARS-CoV-2 phylodynamics with phylogenies, and then the second one, we're doing some methods development in the context of phylodynamics without phylogenies. So, just right off the bat, I want to mention some people who have been involved in this work. So, the first project I'll talk about, which is in press right now, is collaborative work with Adi Stern at Tel Aviv University in Israel with graduate students. With graduate students Danielle Miller and then also Mike Martin, who's here at this workshop doing the bulk of the work. And then the second project talking more about phylodynamic methods development. And that's with both Mike and Yangsung Park, who's a graduate student in my group. And that's currently in prep. Okay, so as probably the vast majority of you, you all know, sequences, viral sequences, can be used to infer the dynamics of spread within a region. This is generally done through two different This is generally done through two different approaches. One is using kind of some of these birth-death process models that David was talking about in the previous talk. So this is an example just from, you know, using 194 sequences from France where the authors here estimate R0 at two different time periods. And they see kind of that there's a decrease in R0 from early on to later on in the epidemic, in the pandemic. In the pandemic. So that's using a birth-death phylodynamic model. The second approach is using this coalescent-based phylodynamic modeling approach that Eric Voltz and Imperial has really developed and we've used quite a bit. And so this is an example from Portugal that he's used. And so using that model that's generally implemented in BEAST in a program called PhiDyne, you can also kind of look at what's happening to R0 or R over time. Or are over time. Okay, so we actually use this latter approach, this coalescent-based approach that Eric's been developing to look at sequences in Israel. So specifically, what Adi had where her and her group sequenced 212 full genome sequences from Israel between the end of February through the end of April. And so you can see these sequences here with these blue circles at the tips. Circles, you know, at the tips. And so, the part of this project that we were interested in that we contributed to was actually trying to look at patterns of viral spread within Israel based on these 212 sequences. And so, what we did was we first kind of developed one of these epidemiological models. So you can see this is just an SEIR-type model that Eric Wolz had previously used also for Ebola dynamics in West Africa. So, basically, we have susceptible individuals exposed but not yet infected. Exposed, but not yet infectious individuals. Then we have these two classes of infectious individuals: ones who transmit a lot, ones who don't transmit a lot. And that's to capture transmission heterogeneity that we also know is important for SARS-CoV-2. And then this recovered class. So based on this model, we estimated parameters such as R0. We estimated this P, or we looked across different ranges for this pH parameter, which quantifies the degree of transmission height. Which quantifies the degree of transmission heterogeneity. We added this kind of outside reservoir, as Eric Wolse had previously done, also, to allow for lineages to kind of backwards in time, kind of migrate out of Israel, or forwards in time, migrate into Israel. And then we allowed R0 to change a specific point in time when social distancing measures were put into place. So, just very quickly, the results here from this analysis is here we have on the x-axis this level of The x-axis, this level of transmission heterogeneity. So, this is the proportion of the population that is, or the proportion of the most infectious pH percent of the individuals contributes to 80% of secondary infections. So, a pH value here of 80% means that there's no transmission heterogeneity here at lower levels. For example, this is 5% of the most infectious individuals are responsible for 80% of the secondary infections. So, that's how you can. Percent of the secondary infections. So that's how you can kind of read this. And what you can see is across these different kinds of pH values, what we get is an R0 value between two and three, going up to three at very low or very high levels of transmission heterogeneity. R0 after March 19th was severely reduced. So this is the factor by which R0 was reduced. So it was reduced to about 30% of initial value to come at kind of right below one. Kind of right below one. What was really nice about kind of working with Adi Stern's group and with data from Israel was they have a lot of epidemiological surveillance also. So we had reported incidents also at the time kind of our analysis stopped. And so here we have reported incidence on April 20 on April 22nd here at this value, right? And so we can see that kind of these estimates here of cumulative incidence from Here, of cumulative incidence from very low levels or very sorry, very extreme levels of super spreading are consistent with those epidemiological data. So, we really think that there's quite a bit of transmission heterogeneity going on here in Israel that the Mala can kind of capture with these very low pH values. Okay, so I'm talking a little bit about this project. You know, we'll first, you know, in case you get the work, but then also because. And also, because it was really during that period of time when we realized, you know, with working with such early on SARS-CoV-2 data, just some of the limitations, you know, of using tree-based phylodynamic inference for understanding or inferring values of R0, for example, using SARS-CoV-2 sequences. So, when we were looking at the sequence data, one thing that we found is that there was a huge amount of phylogenetic uncertainty. There's a huge amount of phylogenetic uncertainty, right? So, this SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that has a very low mutation rate, you know, and so basically there's very relatively few substitutions, right, and very low levels of genetic diversity. So, it's very hard to actually, you know, the tree that you get, I mean, of course, you have to integrate over phylogenetic uncertainty because there's so much of it, right? The other limitations of tree-based phylodynamic inference more generally is, you know, looking at things like coalescent-based analyses, you know, generally assume the kingdom coalescent. Generally, assume the kingdom coalescent. Birth-death models generally have more difficulty incorporating nonlinear disease dynamics. And then, what we found looking at kind of phydine, Eric Voltisphydine, you know, and then seeing how the birth-death model had been used in other circumstances, you know, it seems like there were kind of some difficulties in terms of considering multiple different kinds of clades that were introduced into a region, right? And that, you know, for SARS-CoV-2, you know, wherever you look, it seems like there were multiple introductions into the region, right? Multiple introductions into the region, right? And so, you know, how do you actually kind of combine information across these different clades to do phylodynamic inference? And so there are ways that in which that could be done, but they required a substantial increase in model complexity to include. So what we started thinking about was, you know, can we actually use a very simple, you know, population genetic summary statistic for phylodynamic inference, you know, of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens. And other emerging pathogens, really at the beginning of an epidemic or beginning of a pandemic, when there's just very limited genetic diversity, right? And this is the case because with limited genetic diversity, you just have so much phylogenetic uncertainty. So why not kind of see whether you can circumvent basically phylogenetic reconstruction altogether? And so a natural summary statistic to use is Tajima's D, which many of you have probably not even thought about, you know, since your PopGen class. About, you know, since your Pop Gen class in college. So basically, Tajima's D is just to remind you: Tajima's D is the difference between two measures of genetic diversity: pi, or the mean number of pairwise differences, and s, the number of segregating sites. Those measures are scaled. I can point you to the Wikipedia page if you'd like. Anyhow, so Tajima's D is often used for identifying selection, right? Because basically, if there's kind of a constant population size where no selection is happening, you expect a Taj Mazd of zero. Selection is happening, you expect a Tajima's D of zero. But also, you know, if we assume that everything evolves neutrally, there's population dynamics is also known to impact Tajima's D. Specifically, expanding populations, growing populations, are known to have negative Tajima's D values, and populations that are becoming smaller are known to kind of have positive Tajima's D values or kind of increasing Tajima's D values. Or kind of increasing Tajima's D values. And so we started thinking about using Tajima's D. And so, you know, we decided to look in the literature first to make sure that it hadn't been done. And we found this paper here, which has published in 2017 and has one citation. Anyhow, so we started looking into this paper. And what they did in this paper, it's a very interesting paper to read. They used ABC to estimate epidemiological model parameters. They compared their results to the birth-death skyline. To the birth-death skyline serial model of Tanya Statler's. And then there are some choices which were a little bit more opaque and not fully described, I think, like they included some time lags and so forth, which I wasn't completely sure about kind of why they did it. And yeah, but it's an interesting paper. And these are some of their results. Here we have kind of their estimated posterior distribution for kind of the R0. Here we have the true R0 falling in that. This is in simulated. Falling in that. This is in simulated data. Then they also applied this method to flu, the H1N1 2009 flu pandemic on an island. And what they found is that they estimated an R0 of 1.55 with a 95% credible interval of 1.31 to 2.05 compared to the Birth skyline model, which got something similar. Similar. Okay, so we started becoming, you know, based on this paper and so forth, we were also, we started looking into this a little bit more. And just to familiarize ourselves a little bit more with, you know, can Tajima's D actually be informative, we started just playing around with some simulations. So we were interested in, well, first, can Tajima's D, if you have two simulations with different R0 values, do we get different Tajima D dynamics? Right? And what we see here, here's an R0 of five, here's an R0 of 2.5 simulations. Of five, here's an R0 of 2.5 simulation, and we do see different Tajima's D values here. We also simulated different levels of transmission heterogeneity, one where there wasn't, so it was just an SIR model, and one where there was considerable level of transmission heterogeneity, and that's the black and the red lines here. And what we found was that the one that had transmission heterogeneity actually had a different signature for Tajima's D, which was associated with actually a decrease in the number of. With actually a decrease in the number of segregating sites, as you can imagine, if there's transmission heterogeneity. We also looked at if there's a change in R0 over time, does that kind of can we see that in Tajima's D? And we can to some extent. We also found that the extent of sampling effort really affects the values of Tajima's D. And so we saw that Tajima's D might very well be useful here in being able to infer epidemiological parameters. You know, infer epidemiological parameters. So instead of actually using an ABC approach, though, what we decided to do was kind of scrap that ABC approach and go to a particle MCMC approach. Particle MCMC, well, particle filtering was talked about yesterday already, but we're using particle MCMC, which incorporates sequential Monte Carlo with MCMC. It basically uses a state-space modeling framework. So we have a process model and an observation model. Small and an observation model. It's starting to be much more heavily used by infectious disease modelers. For example, you can see this paper over here, which basically tries to kind of explain or make more accessible particle MCMC for looking at case data. And therefore, it also allows for a straightforward extension to combine epidemiological case data and genetic data for kind of inference using both of those sources of data. So here's some kind of So, here's some kind of results with looking at Tajima's D. This is on simulated data, so we know what the true values are. This is with an SEIR model. So, this is the data. So, we had, we simulated 606 sequences. So, 30 sequences were kind of sampled from this forward simulation. So, that's every four-day interval. And so, these are our Taijima's D dynamics. And what we see here in red lines are kind of the true values for the number of susceptibility. Values for the number of susceptibles, exposed, infected, and then Tajima's D. These are kind of, you know, the reconstructed state variables from the particle MCMC results to that, of that. And here we have our estimate of the starting time T0 and the true values kind of here at zero, and the estimate of posterior distribution for R0 with the true one being 1.9 here. So we were excited about this result. And so what we're currently doing. This result. And so, what we're currently doing is actually looking at this in the context of SARS-CoV-2 data from France. So, there's a very nice paper by Henrique Salje and co-authors in Science. And what they do is they use case data and both on hospitalizations and on ICU visits and death data from France and looking at these kinds of contact rates with the polymod studies and so forth. And what they do is they estimate using an SE1E2IR model. E1, E2, IR model, they estimate an R0 based on kind of infection case, fatality ratios, et cetera. And so their estimate is 2.9 with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8 to 3.01. Over this period of time from February 27th to kind of March 26, this is what the Tajima dynamics look like for four-day intervals for the sequences. And this is just, you know, And this is just, you know, this is actually done this morning. So it's not even in the talk that I uploaded yet. But what you see is, you know, starting off, you know, with an R0 of round two, what we see is kind of there's this increase kind of in this decrease again. Obviously, we have to run it out for another couple of days or day or so. But you can see kind of that there's kind of this indication that it will kind of get near to that kind of R0 value of around 2%. Of you know our not value of around 2.9 or so, you know, which we may or may not take as kind of truth. That said, we haven't incorporated transmission heterogeneity yet into this model, but that should be relatively straightforward. And that will likely increase our not estimates to some extent because of its impact on segregating sites. And so, just some final remarks. If I have another minute, yeah, some final remarks. Remarks. So, this approach, I haven't shown this to you explicitly, but multiple plates can be very easily considered in this context because basically, what you would just have is kind of multiple Tajima's D time series, right? And you just calculate, you know, the likelihoods or marginal likelihoods kind of based on those multiple time series, Tajima's D time series. Incorporation with time series data for simultaneous inferences should also be very straightforward. What I really like about this approach. Like, about this approach is that there's also no restrictions on the forward model, right? So, it could just be an SIR-type compartmental model, right? But it also could have, let's say, sweepstakes reproduction, which wouldn't actually fall under a Kingman coalescent. You could also imagine that a forward model could have large transmission bottleneck sizes. Not that I think that that's the case for SARS-CoV-2, but you can actually simulate a model like that if you wanted to. Actually, simulate a model like that if you wanted to. And you can also kind of use, for example, agent-based models or complex agent-based models. So, as long as you kind of get sequences out where you can then, you know, estimate Tajima's D, any of those underlying models are totally fine. We're also currently exploring other statistics besides Tajima's D and their use kind of for phylodynamic inference. And then, finally, we've been thinking about kind of using Tajima-SD also as a method to As a method to gauge the possibility of cryptic transmission, you know, whether if there's early samples and later-on samples, you know, whether that's actually kind of this, whether that's consistent, you know, with respect to sequences kind of or cases that have kind of been, or infection that's been circulating for a while, but not being having been sampled, you know, or whether there's an indication that there's been a reintroduction. And we think that. been a reintroduction and we think that Tajima's D can can provide a very kind of straightforward straight sorry straightforward kind of way to kind of tell some of those those things apart and with that just I want to mention my collaborators again on both these projects and I can take any questions if I have time thank you so there was a first question which came around slide 12 I think on I think on Toby, does the transmission heterogeneity come from different number of contacts or from differences in the infection? Yeah, so for the Israel analysis, we modeled transmission and heterogeneity as coming about from differences in that transmission rate. So presumably, the underlying, you know, our assumption would be that it's because of differences. Assumption would be that it's because of differences in the number of contacts or differences in the probability of transmission given contact. And so one of those, either those individuals have higher viral load, and so the probability of transmission given contact would be higher, or they just have a higher number of contacts. Presumably it's more the latter than the former. We've got time for maybe one more question. Maybe I'll ask you a quick one. So, the Tajima was in the ABC framework. Is it correct to think of it as a summary statistic for the data? Yeah. So, I think within the context of ABC, it is a summary statistics for, you know, it's one of the summary statistics that's used for ABC. Yep. So, I was wondering how does that translate in the particle MCNC case? So, what we have in the What we have in the particle MCMC, we actually have, you know, basically we have a time, we have the Taijima's D time series, right, which we've calculated from the sequences. And then what we have is this underlying state space model, right, where basically we have kind of this observation model, right, where we can actually compare kind of the simulated Tajima's D values, right, to those observed, right? And we know that the variance in Tajima's D values is one. Are is one. So that's, you know, that's nice. Typically speaking. And so now we.
