Okay, very good. So I would have loved to be with you. I am very sad that I couldn't make it, but I am very glad that you have this hybrid system and that I can see the thoughts here from Chile. Thank you, Philippe, Clariana, and Jan. Philippe, Gloriana, and Jan Francois for inviting me. So I am presenting joint work with Marco Varpiesi, Carlos Mora Corral, and Reni Rodiac. This is work on the Neohukian energy in nonlinear elasticity. And well, there is a paper from some years ago with Rani. Some years ago, with Rani, and there are two papers that have taken a long time to be reviewed. So there is a first part with the lower bound, with the lower semi-continuity result. That after two years of review, finally we had a positive report and we made all the changes requested in the presentation and hopefully will be published soon. The second one with the With the recovery sequence and some fine properties of the geometric structure of singularities. It has been 14 months under review now. So let's hope it gets referred soon. Well, I thank Fonte Seat for funding this research. I moved to Universidad de Ogins, so it is this region here, south of the metropolitan. Region here, south of the metropolitan region. And some years ago, there was a law creating a state university for this region because there was no research complex university. And I moved to this new project for the decentralization of the country. So I live in San Fernaldo, which is close to Rancarbua, where I work. So I hope you can come at some time. We've got some nice mountains. Sometimes we've got some nice mountains, it's like 5100 meters high. We've got surf on the coast, we've got rangers, and there is even an engineering research institute with mathematicians inside. So you are most welcome to come at any time. Okay, so we are studying the existence of minimizers for the new Hooken energy, aquadratic energy with some. Energy with some penalization term for deviations from incompressibility. So whenever volumes are not observed, you have to pay a very large price. And it is important to be careful with singularities such as calculation. So if you have a thin film of a thin polymer, Of a thin polymer, and it is confined, then, whenever you have any acceleration, you will have reaction forces because the steel plates would not want to contract horizontally as the body grows in the vertical direction. And in between, you end up having a multi-axial tension that. Multi-axial tension that can lead to fracture concentrated at points. And this is also what you observe in the formation of fibrillas in peeling experiments. And this constitutes a failure of quasi-convexity because even for a fine boundary conditions where you have When you are stretching things, it pays off to have a singularity and to have infinite values of the gradient in order to prevent paying too much energy due to the changes in volume. So even for a fine data, you can have singular minimizers. And if you copy this and reproduce this periodically, Boland Mira showed that Mira showed that this failure of quasi-convexity implies that the energy is not lower semi-continuous. So this is a problem in order to prove existence of minimizers. So one question that one could try and study is whether existence of minimizers can be proved in a space of deformation that, apart from satisfying some boundary conditions and being injected almost everywhere. Injective almost everywhere and having a positive Jacobian also have some regularity preventing the creation of cavities. And one such statement of regularity is that these divergence identities are satisfied. So that the Jacobian has a divergence structure, such as the one that you have for C2 maps, for smooth maps. One particular case of this divergence. One particular case of these divergence identities is when the test function g is the identity or a multiple of the identity, and then you recover the divergence structure for the Jacobian. So the dead equals dead, which prevents cavitation. So we would like to see if there are minimizers of the nucleic energy. You can have an a priori energy bound because you can think that the boundary condition can be extended inside and. Can be extended inside, and this is an answer for the minimization problem. And in particular, if H has some superlinear product at infinity, this would give you integrity of the Jacobians and help you a little bit. Now, there is an example proposed by Conti and the Lis creating based on the phenomenon of bubbling in the Phenomenon of bubbling in the harmonic map theory, and where you can create a harmonic dipole and you can extend it to 3D, preserving almost incompressibility constraints. So you can control Jacobians and do a 3D example in elasticity of something that resembles a harmonic dipole. So it goes like this. All the drones will be 2D, but this would send a But this would send axially symmetric 3D formation. So you have to think of a vertical axis of symmetry, and you have to rotate all these pictures with respect to the vertical axis. So let's begin with an epsilon half disc. You stretch it a lot horizontally and you contract it in the vertical direction in order to keep volume constant. And this film, you can think that you can place. Can think that you can place it on top of a sphere. So you have this bubble, this marginary bubble, and this portion of material will be placed on top of this sphere. So that's one part of the deformation. Now, there is a region on top of it that we go we wrap the speed also, but with no big deformation, so with no. Deformation, so with no wide deformation, there is nothing that is being stretched a lot or contracted a lot, it is just bounded gradient deformation in region E. Now let's go to region C. And in region C, you again, we have a large stretch in the horizontal direction, a large contraction in the vertical direction. Contraction in the vertical direction, and this new short ceiling there will be again placed on this imaginary bubble that we are constructing. Something similar with region A prime that again is stressed and contracted vertically and placed on top of this bubble. Then the region inside will go to the interior of this bubble. Will go to the interior of this bubble, keeping angles more or less constant. So if you take a line with a certain angle pointing towards the origin, this line will now... So if I begin from outside and go to the origin, then this thing will now go to the bubble. So it will hit. It will hit the new surface in these directions. So, you can easily think of a parameterization of this deformation where each line segment is mapped to the corresponding line segment, and there is something that looks like a reversal of orientation, but for the time being, nothing is really physically pathological, so nothing is violated yet. Violated yet. Okay, and then you manage to map region B to region T and region B to region B using some complex variables or something. And you end up with a sequence of maps that have a bounded neo-Hukan energy where all the Jacobians are controlled. These maps are believed sheets. They are admissible maps in any reasonable theory. Of our theory and they converge in H1 weekly to something that in reality is very nasty. So you have two portions of the material that were separated in the reference configuration and now are being put in contact across this created surface gamma, the sphere or this bubble. And the bubble actually came from two points, comes from two points. So it is a phenomenon of cavitation. So it's like a disk of radius zero is being stretched infinitely to a whole sphere, but it's two cavitations that are put in contact with each other, where material from one part of the body, where the cavity creates. Part of the body where the cavity created at near point P is filled with the material surrounding point O, and there is a reversal of orientation, so there are cancellation of the topological of the topological degrees. So, material that is inside this loop E in the reference configuration will go outside of the image of this loop. And you can see, for example, that the invertibility condition of neural inspector that. Of neural can spectro that or the whole theory of weakly monotone maps is not set. So things that go inside should remain inside, and this is not happening. So it is not a physical deformation, and you would like to try and prove that you will not get this as an energy minimizer. So you end up with a regularity problem. If you begin with a minimizing sequence, can you prove that in the limit you will? Prove that in the limit, you will not have this orientation reversal, that you will not have this form of interpretation of matter because the material is being sort of transported through a tube and put in contact with different parts of the body. And one way to make this question mathematically precise is to realize that the inverse map has a jar discontinuity, because if you take a point in the created Because if you take a point in the created surface and you try and reach from the two different sides of the created surface, so if you have reach this point from the two different sides of the creative sector, you will convert. Will converge through the inverse deformation to two different points. So you have two lateral traces that do not coincide. The discontinuity is not so bad because the limit does exist when you approach from one side of the puppet, but it is clearly a jump discontinuity. So, one way to ask this question is whether when you begin with a minimizing sequence, can you prove that in the limit you will get something that You will get something that whose inverse function, whose inverse deformation, has overlay regularity and does not have jams or counterparts. So this is the problem we are studying. And these divergence identities that I mentioned in the beginning happen to be related to the so-called regularity of the inverse map as having studied. Have been established in a series of papers. One of them, you can find it in this paper of 2015. And this is because these expressions coming from the divergence identities, when you change variables, they give you precisely the distributional derivative where this is any test function of the test function in omega in the reference configuration composed. Configuration composed with the index mark. So it is related to the chain rule in BB for the composition of the singular mark with a test function. And the absolutely continuous part is precisely related to the cofactor matrix, to the two by two minutes, whereas this distributional derivative is related to the change of variables that gives you the Change of variables that gives you the three by three full Jacobian. So it is always an interaction between three by three Jacobians and two by two Jacobians, which has a topological meaning because the volume is the region enclosed by the boundary. So the 3D volume is dictated by its 2D surface. So in this interaction between 2D and 3D, these changes in topology are detected by these identities and they happen to be connected with the so-boller regularity for. With the sober level regularity for the inputs. Okay, so I state again the problem: can we prove that the weak H1 limit of a minimizing sequence for the New Huken energy has a sober inverse? And since we already have a nasty pathological deformation by Conti and Deleuze in the axisymmetric world, then one would like to study first the axisymmetric problem. So, can we prove in the axisymmetric case that The existing metric case that the limit of a minimizing sequence has a sovereign inverse. Okay, so this is related to the relaxation of the neofocan energy, and there is this very nice result by Mali in 1993, stating that in the case where the limit is smooth and orientation preserving, then there is lower semi-continuity for the. Then there is lower semi-continuity for the neo-foulant energy. So the relaxation of the neo-fucan energy. So if you take the infimum of the limits of the energies for all sequences that converge to a given map U, sequences of regular maps that converge to U. In the case when U, when the unit U is a regular map itself, well, it coincides with the new Hooken energy. With the new Hooken energy. So, this relaxed energy is an extension of the Nehucan energy to the admissible space where singularities are also allowed. So, this regular current is where the diagrams and identities are satisfied. And you can then have an abstract result stating the existence of minimizers for the relaxed energy, and that would be the minimizer of the new Hooken energy in the weak closure of. Closure of the space of regular maps. And then we would like to go from this abstract result to something which is much more explicit. So can you give an explicit expression for this relaxed energy? And can you give an explicit expression of an admissible class that contains this weak closure of the space of regular mass? And we have a conjecture for what. A conjecture for what can be the relaxed energy. So, we have a conjecture for what should be the explicit formula for the cost of creating a dipole singularity, which is stated in terms of the inverse map. So, in the axisymmetric case, we are able to prove that if you are the That if you are the weak limit of regular maps, of maps that satisfy the divergence identities, then the first two components, the components that are perpendicular to the symmetry axis, do have this above regularity. So we are able to prove these fine properties for the weak closure. And for the component of the inverse map that tells you the position in the symmetry axis where the singularities are coming from, we at least have We at least have a Bd regularity. And for this third component of the input map, then the singular part of the distributional derivative, the total variation of it, is precisely what we believe is the cost of creating a harmonic dipole. And this, we hope, will be useful in proving that dipoles are too expensive and can be And can be beaten by a more regular competitor. And therefore, if you begin with a minimizing sequence, you end up with a regular map creating no dipole and having a sobolette inverse and prove this open result of existence of minimizers of the nucleic energy in the class of maps that are sufficiently regular as to prevent. As to prevent pathological and physical examples like the harmonic types of context and the legacy. Now, for the time being, it is a conjecture that this is the actual relaxation, but it just so happens that even though even in the case, though, these were not the exact relaxation, we do have. We do have a rigorous existence theorem in this explicit admissible space. So the quick closure of regular maps is contained in this class. It might be a smaller class, but we are able to work in this function space B, where no holes are created, where the image of omega. Where the image of omega is the whole volume enclosed by the boundary data, where the first two components have subolate regularity and where the third component has at least bounded variation regularity. And in this class of maps, we are able to prove the existence of an infinite for this explicit energy functionality. So it is similar to what you could do with the relaxation. Could do with the relaxation approach because it turns the lack of compactness problem into a regularity problem. Now that you have a well-posed variational problem, can we prove that the minimizer is regular, that creating these dipoles is too expensive, that there is no room for paying this extra cost, and therefore the minimizer in B doesn't have this singular term. Doesn't have this singular term, and it is actually a minimizer of the original neoclicking energy in the class of regular mass. So it provides a playground and a strategy to tackle the original problem. Okay, so let me first show you some heuristic calculation. What is happening here is that this expression for the limit map U is forgetting. Map U is forgetting what was happening in the red region C. It was forgetting this stack of disks that were being wrapped to a sphere, this stack of bubbles where you had a large concentration of energy, and this is completely forgotten by the limit map. So, in order for it to have some memory, you need this relaxation approach. You need to think where the limit map was coming from, and this map u epsilon. And this mass u epsilon in this very short cylinder of radius epsilon, well, there is a huge stretch of a surface. So it is really a 2D singularity. Because you want to keep volumes constant, the derivative in the normal direction is very small because if you stretch in one direction, you have to contract in the other. So it is really not a three by three matrix, but three by three matrix but it's a it's a two by two components of of the x1 x2 plane so you can essentially neglect the third term and apply cauchy's inequality um and then um this is related to the change so to the surface element giving the change in area for the the forming surface and in this stack interface and in this stack of bubbles for all values of x3 you are essentially creating a copy of the same bubble so you are getting the area of this sphere of radius one half and and you you can recover some energy you can have some memory of the concentration of energy that you had in the beginning now this looks like a very simple calculation and it This looks like a very simple calculation, and it looks like you are losing a lot of information. This is precisely the jump set of the ingress map, but it turns out that we can prove a matching upper bound at least for this example of country and the layers. So, at least for a pathological information like this, the result is sharp. So, you have a matching upper bound for this very simple. Important realistic argument. Okay, how much time do I have? Is it like five minutes or? Ten minutes. Ten minutes? Okay, thank you. Okay, so we have one first theorem stating the existence of minimizers in this class. Then we have these matching upper bounds. It says that if you take the limit map of Compi and the Levis. Country and the levies. Then you can modify the reconstruction, which happens to be not optimal in the relaxation sense, and you can try and satisfy the equality in these inequalities, which requires creating a conformal transformation of these bubbling phenomena. So this epsilon disk, you are wrapping it into a sphere of radius one. It into a sphere of radius one. And in order to have this conformality, you have to do things in a very special way and then you have to adapt in the normal direction in order to keep volumes controlled. But it so happens that this is possible. And for this map, the relaxed energy is precisely what we propose. Now, this is not. Now, this is not just any map because we are able to prove a third theorem that is in the restricted class of maps that have finite zero energy. So, you can quantify how far are you from fulfilling the divergence identities? So, you can take the supremum of this quantity, which in the case of test functions of separated variables happens to be precisely happens to be precisely what you get in the divergence identities. And in the study of cavitation and structure, you actually see that this gives you the area of the created surfaces. And this happens to be valid also in the harmonic dipole example. And under the additional assumption that at least the surface energy is finite. The surface energy is finite, then, so under the additional assumption that you do not have counterparts in the inverse, and also that the jump set has finite household pressure, then you can prove that the only problems are d-drax in the distribution of Jacobian. So, you can prove that there are calmations that can have different signs, and this quantity here is something. Here is something like the difference between the topological image and the geometric image, which essentially captures the holes with different signs because there is this cancellation effect. So the dipole effect that you have a cavitation of positive orientation being compensated by one of negative orientation is captured here. So in the limit of regular maps, you always have these features as the ones that you have in the context. As the ones that you have in the context of the Lis example. So the Contradés singularity is quite generic. And if you are able to prove a matching upper bound for the Country de Le Lis example, it is a result that is much more general than one could think initially. So I am running out of time, so I will not go into the details of this theorem. I will Okay, I will try and okay. I will mention some recent results by Dole Salova himself and Mali stating that if the penalization term grows at least as the Jacobian to the power minus two, then the limit of maps satisfying the invertibility condition of Miller and Spectre, saying that material that was inside remains inside, this is. Inside, this is stable. This passes to the limit if you have this draw using techniques of bounded distortion. And I will focus on that result. Okay, so I wanted to show you a little bit how was the construction for the matching upper bound, but I am running out of time, I suppose. So there was something regarding the need of Regarding the need of things to be conformal. And then, in an original disk, so you use the stereographic projection, you end up having a very explicit formula for this bubbling map. And then you use cylindrical coordinates and you find that the incompressibility equation has a multiplicative form that gives you an. Multiplicative form that gives you an explicit expression for the radial coordinate in order to have the precise contraction that will compensate the changes that will compensate the stretch of the creation of the surface so as to keep volumes constant. So you end up having a very explicit formula for the radial function in the cylindrical coordinates decomposition. And you can prove for this explicit formula. Prove for this explicit formula well, after a lot of work, that it is like the stereographic projection, and you can get the exact value of 2π. With the derivative, you can prove that it's actually negligible. So, these computations can be done, and you can look at them in the articles. And then you have to show that you can do that without paying any extra energy. Extra energy. And that's very hard because you are wrapping the sphere at very different speeds when you are doing this bubbling than when you go back to the normal region. So there is a huge gradient in these very tiny zones. And we managed to explicitly compute things and show that the error committed is of the order of epsilon times the logarithm of epsilon squared. Logarithm of epsilon squares, so there is really no room for doing things in a different manner. So it's really a sharp result. You are always thinking that this thing will fall down the calculation, but in the end it works fine, which is related to one of the messages I wanted to give. And it is that even though in the neo-human energy, the term with the Jacobian seems to be the really complicated term. Be the really complicated term, the really, the really non-linear and nasty term. In the end, you really want to make the Dirichlet term happy and you are able to adjust to this conformal mark that makes the Dirichlet term happy, controlling Jacobian. So, the dominating term is the Dirichlet term, and that's why we are finding these striking connections with the hard link problem in harmonic mass. Problem in harmonic map theory. Okay, I don't have time to explain about global semicontinuity. I just want to mention a few new results that we are in the process of writing up right now. So combining the result of Henry Sheldolexalogen Marlin, then we have that the last man standing is the counterpart. So under these growths for the penalization, for the For the penalized for the penalizing term, then if you have no counterpart, you are done. If you combine the stability of condition in with the fine properties for the structure of the singularities that you can create, this theorem that we have proved. So, this thing that singularities come essentially by pairs, that you have topologically negative habitat. Negative cavitations with positive cavitations, then you are able to prove that the only remaining problem is to show that there are no counterparts. And we were able to prove the lower bound, the lower semi-continuity, with the right constant that shows that it is a 2D problem instead of a 3D problem, even without axisymmetry. And then we have some ideas about Cantra. So one just okay, so in the regularity of the So, in the regularity of the horizontal components, it was very, very important for us to use the study of on the local invertibility and the regularity, the solar regularity of the inverses, then also the work of HVADAC, and this is very connected to the problem of invertibility. And one last thing. I think so. Up to now, all the analysis for elasticity had been done, changing a little bit the problem. So, what if instead of the quadratic energy, you have an exponent P that is slightly larger than two? Or what if, as Dole Salova, Malkonova, Henchel, you put some linear dependence on the cofactors, or what if you have something with bounded distortion, then you change the problem and you can prove the existence of minimizers, you can prove. Existence of minimizers, you can prove that the cocactors are equipped, and you cannot have this dipole. So, continue is like a sharp barrier showing what can go wrong. And we are trying to go a little bit on this unknown land. And it is like if you are trying to study calculus variations in W11 and you have two options: either you change to W1P, modifying the project, or I Modifying the project, or either you go to BB, and that's a little bit like what we are doing: getting a singular term that is present in the inverse deformation. Okay, here I stop. I stopped. Thank you very much. So one thing. So one thing. So you mentioned that you assumed that the input function was SV, right and didn't have a country part on this one error. I mean, I am having a bit of trouble imagining something where the inverse function exists, does have a kind of right? Because I mean, what are you thinking? I mean, you're thinking some sort of Kanto function, not a linear function, or something like that. But is that not a do you expect this assumption to be unnecessary when you have a theorem? So, okay, in the case where you have SBD regularity, you can say more about the structure of the singularities. But the existence theorem doesn't make that as a Theorem doesn't make that assumption. So, as low-semi-continuity is concerned, this is a general result that allows also for tantal deformations. And we believe that this type of constructions, where you have this dipole creating a jump discontinuity in the inverse, because essentially. because essentially you are putting in contact a material, sorry, you are putting in contact material that is near P with material that is near O. So that creates a jump from P to O in the inverse. We believe that this construction can be adapted so that there is a diffuse way of putting the two Putting the two parts of the material in contact with each other. So that instead of having something so regular, you may be able to construct something like a snowflake, like this cock curve connecting two different parts of the material, but such that the The variation of the inverse is actually throughout the whole segment. So we believe that we can prove the existence of examples, of counterexamples, that are different from the harmonic types, that these cantor things have to be attacked. And then we need to find a way of showing that these cantor singularities are also very expensive and they are not energy minimizing. So it's a regularity problem, but we believe. Regularity problem, but we believe that the way you have to tackle the jump discontinuities case for the inverse and the canto discontinuity case for the inverse might be different. They might require different analysis. Thank you. Thank you, Dufan. Thank you, Jim. I think we should probably adjourn. Thank you. I'll turn out the coin.
