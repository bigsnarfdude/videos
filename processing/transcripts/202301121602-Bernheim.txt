And it is now at the Pastor Institute in Paris. And I work on the way bacteria defend themselves against viruses. So as most of you know, bacteria are engaged in constant arms race. And until four years ago, if you would have thought about anti-fake defense mechanism, you could think on how bacteria can mask their receptors. I'm not discussing all the phenotypic aspects that were previously brought up. We were previously brought up. But so you can have capsules, you can master receptors, or you could have so-called restriction modification enzymes, or CRISPR-CAS systems. And that was the view. And while I'm doing introduction, I just want to tell you that I'm a molecular biologist by training, but I won't show any pictures of gels, I promise. And I do some genomics, but I want to show you some stuff here, like data on the genomic and experimental. On the genomic and experimental side, to pretty much then ask you for help in how to think about the different things that we are observing. So there won't be any modeling. The goal is to maybe raise your interest so that you can think about these things with me. So that's what it looked like four years ago. And then there was this observation that maybe it took a lot of time to discover CRISPR, and people thought, well, it's bad, you know, we should have discovered them while. It's bad, you know. We should have discovered them a while ago. It took 40 years after researching modification enzymes. So maybe we should look for more. And people started looking for more by looking into actually some sort of evolutionary signal that is peculiar. And that was described first by Eugene Kunin and Kama Kalova. And that is that bacterial anti-fake system cluster together on bacterial genomes in so-called defense islands. And so what do I mean by that? This is a genome, those are genes, if they're colored the same, they belong to the same. They're colored the same, they belong to the same systems. And pretty much you see that you have a restriction modification, and just right next to it, a CRISPR, and another one, and another one. So, this is an iron. And if you look into other genomes, you have the same type of thing, the CRISPR, we can somehow see some toxin-antitoxin system, TA, R, antiphage, LM, etc. And the major idea of a paper that was published in 2018 and really completely changed the way we think about these things is that probably the Is that probably the gray genes that are here and that didn't have a known functions might well be anti-phase system themselves just for a guilt-by-association approach. And so in a landmark study, they pretty much tested this hypothesis by looking in the published genomes and then tested it experimentally. And they showed that, yes, all of these genes had an anti-phage activity. So this was a bit crazy because we were at like two C systems. Because we were at like two C systems and they discovered nine in one shot. But then in the following years, so since 2018, this method has been refined and then because people started finding some system, people started looking for more additional systems. And this had led to an explosion of the number of anti-gonal systems. This is just like a few of the the papers. And some of the papers I just put a few names. I just put a few names, but actually, like in that one, there are nine, in that one, there are 22, in another one, there are 23. So, really, a complete crazy explosion of this number of bacteria defend themselves against viruses with super diverse molecular mechanism. And so, a lot of molecular biologists started working on these things, trying to decipher all the ways that bacteria defends itself against viruses. And I like to show this picture because we wrote this review in 2020. We wrote this review in 2020 and this is completely outdated by now. Like this is only showing something like 20 or 30 systems. And as of today, we are like 132, something like that. And so besides the fact that we are super interested in looking at how they work, we started to think that maybe the way we've been looking at phage bacteria interactions completely overlooked these components. That a lot of the strains we're working on were just black. Of the strains we're working on, we're just blind toward the fact that they encode so many anti-faith systems. And so, I forgot to add something in this back. And one thing that I just want to mention is that we started wondering why do you have so many anti-fake systems? This is, of course, across bacteria, but also in closely related strains, where two strains that have almost the exact same genomes, we're talking a few SNPs, might very well have completely different Will have a completely different set of anti-faith systems. And so we started to think about the question: like, what is the role of the anti-faith system in natural populations? Where does this diversity come from? What can we learn about this? And so at the point like in 2021, when we started thinking about this, there was one thing we didn't have, and that is the first question that comes to mind is: what strains, which systems do? Which systems do a strain have? We knew that there were a lot of these systems out there, but we didn't know if typically a strain had one of these systems, or several of these systems. And if you have several systems within the same bacteria, you have the same, you have different ones. So with a PhD student in my book, Florian Thesson, we started to wanting answering that question. So we built a tool called Events Finder that is a quite simple bioinformatics tool that detects all the known Tool that detects all the known anti-fate systems in a given genome, the one that has been described in the literature. So, if you are interested, you can, it's available to like use as command line or online, so you can check it out. And one thing that I want to underline is kind of the speed by which it is changing. We started and I think we pre-printed the work. There were 30 systems. It was published with 60 systems in May of this year. And we released the last version a couple months ago with 130 systems. 136 days. Huge double, like a very tiny doubling time. And so we keep really trying to keep up to date and for now we've been okay. We'll see how it changes. But really the idea is that this allows us to have kind of zoom out view on what's going on. And the thing we did with that tool was just run it on pretty much RefSec, which is like a database. Which is like a database of fully sequenced genomes with many diverse species, and to find these questions. So, the first thing I wanted to show you, I will only mention a couple of the results from that work, but it's online so you can find it, is that defense systems are not at all common in all straits. You have restriction modifications that are present in more than 80% of the straits of the bacteria, CRISPR we're around 50%, and then all the ones are like All the ones are like 17% or less, and many are actually like 0.5%. So, really like long, long-tail distribution, and that also makes us think that there are many more to discover. And then, if you look in bacteria themselves, how many of them, how many systems you find in a typical bacteria, what you find is that actually it can vary a lot. So, some bacteria don't encode any systems that we know of, so of course in these can be systems. So of course in these can be systems we don't know of. Some encode a lot. So this figure is a bit now updated because the mean was around six, but currently at the state of the art it's around seven. But the general idea is that it varies a lot and this is around like I thought it would be three or four so it was a bit more than what we thought. And typically the x-axis here is cut, okay? Because the champion of defense system for now was fifty-seven. System for now was 57. So you can imagine that's really a large part of the genomes to devote to anti-fate systems. And so, of course, one thing we wanted to know was maybe some species actually encoded a lot of different systems, maybe others not. So just to give you a snapshot, the answer is yes. Some species encode like less than three and some encode a lot. So the weird thing about Elicobacter Pillow, it comes notably the to the fact that it encodes a lot of re-switching modification systems. Switching modification system for quite a specific reason that I'm not going to go into. Yes? Do you know about variegation within species? I mean, that's the next. So yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to say. This is an average, what I'm showing you. And within species, it can vary a lot too. So you have some species, typically the one that have very little different systems, doesn't vary a lot. Usually they will have the same type of T. Will have the same type of genes and they don't vary a lot. But for species that have a lot of systems, typically some strains will have in equal like 0, 2, some will have up to 14, 16. So this is really like super strain dependent, completely weird. And yes, so one thing to illustrate a bit this idea, if we go, it's not even species specific, it's strain-specific. So I'm showing you like isolates of E.C.O.I. and here you have like just And here you have just a few of these systems, and so you see the LM are very common, but then presents patchy distributions, nothing we can make up. And one of the reasons for this is that these systems are extremely prone to horizontal gene transfer. So they are transferred all the time. If you look at the rate of transfer of genes in bacteria, you have first the most transferred are mobile-educal mass, and second are defense systems. Our defense systems. So, really, all the time transferred. And what emerged recently that actually one of the reasons for the fact that they are highly transferred is that they are highly present on mobile genetic elements. And so, you have phages that encode anti-phage systems. Plasmid encoding anti-phage systems. And I say they're anti-phage systems, but I'm actually going to get to it. That's how we phenotype them. But for restriction modification and CRISPR, they are anti-horizontal gene trends altogether. Whether or not all these new systems Whether or not all these new systems are also effective against horizontal gene transfer, we don't know. It needs to be assessed. We have no idea. So, overall, from this, we kind of concluded that we have really different types of antiviral arsenals that exist, so probably different evolutionary dynamics shaping them, some with many diverse systems, some with few systems, and some with many similar systems. And so, we kind of want to try to understand better what's going on and why do we have this kind of things. These kinds of things. And so to do that, one of the first questions that comes to mind is: why would bacteria accumulate these anti-thexis? Why would you need, I don't know, 57 or in the moment, even like seven? Why would you need so much? And I think an hypothesis that was always put forward, but was not, I would say, rigorously tested is that intuitively, and I will say that I will put a lot of intuition, and my goal is to get some help in getting more quantitative data. Quantitative data on this, or quantitative intuition, maybe, is that more anti-fake systems mean more resistance to fakes, right? So either more resistance in the sense that you will protect one system against A and B and the other against C and D, or more resistance in terms of robustness if you have one system protecting against A and the other also against A. If the first one fails, the other one might take over. So it can work in both things. And by the way, we recently wrote a review. Way, we recently wrote a review on that subject. So, this is the hypothesis. So, how do we test for that? So, we decided to go one way, which was experimentally, because genomically there is not much we could do. So, we decided to kind of reshake the question, which is a bit the same question, like how does it impact the resistance of the roads to phages? So, we chose to focus on E. coli because it has a very diverse number of antiphages, it's versatile, and this project is very. And this project was really led in collaboration with medical doctors who also had interest in phage therapy and how can all of these things impact phage therapy. And so we decided to test for this at the level of the genus. So this is the level at which phages can infect, pretty much like the role stage. And in natural isolates, because that's also where we would find the natural combination of anti-phage systems, and at the beacon of scale, because we don't want to just be looking at other interactions. Of each project. And so this project is super collaborative because it involves a lot of experiments. And so it's been led by Betty Gamer, Frances Moini Goveset and some medical students in Astral Achievement. So what we decided to do is just to take a very large collection of E. coli that was put together by people that know E. coli a lot and it's representative of the diversity of the genus of Achillesia and to come up with a collection. Come up with collections of eco-life ages, 97 of them isolated on 35 different hosts. So, really to aim at having a lot of diversity. And just to give you a bit of the sense of the diversity I'm talking about, the idea is that this is the genomes of the collections of the strains, and we detect different stuff because we have access to the whole genomes of these bacteria. So, we can know the phylogeny, we can have the strains, and then we can compute things that are important. We can compute things that are important with things for phages and capsules, prophages, and then defense systems. And one thing that I want to show you is that the small map that I showed you when you have strains that are similar with different defense systems, this is a bigger version of it. And you see that it's completely true. You see like random systems popping up here and there in super closely related strains because they are organized through the final team. For the viral collection, also to show you the diversity, I'm not going to go into deep detail. I'm not going to go into deep details here, but pretty much whenever you have blue points, it means that we have one genome in the NCBI database that is known as the E. coli phages. And when you have some red, it means that we have phages with similar genomes in our hand in the lab. So pretty much we're missing a couple places here and there, but overall we have very diverse collection of phages. It's over 17 genus of phages. So quite different types of So, quite different types of waste refects. And then, what we do, we do our favorite experiment, which is called a plaque assay. We have a loner bacteria, we put clubs of phages at three different concentrations, and we have yes a genomic and the phenotypic characterization. So, this is quite simple, it's fine, and we of course do it in duplicates, but it becomes quite fun when you start with numbers, because now that's like a lot of interaction, and we so pretty much were the same experiment. So, pretty much was the same experiment over and over again. Duplicates need to be done in reasonable times for the data to be exploitable. And that's why it was a very collective effort. It was really like four people at all times kind of stuff. And we had fun because it was led by two students who are super short, like tiny, so they're always disappearing behind the blade. And to give a bit of the sense of how the scale of this experiment, we computed the height if we would just. Computed the height if we would just pile up all the plates that they had used, and that's the height of Notre Dame de Paris. So that's quite a bit. So then I have some kind of open questions that pretty much once we got this result we started with and then made some choice, but it's still stuff we are thinking about. So if you have any advice on this, at some point this is what we do. So we took pictures of everything in the same way, so we can a bit try to automatize that some way how we look at it. Try to automatize at some way how we look at this because this is the type of phenotypes you can get. So, some like you will see futures, some are not, some fates are smaller, some flakes are bigger. You know, biology varies. And so, we have three phage concentrations, three replicates. So, how do we encode what is a successful infection, what is not, how do we do zero versus one, or do we do continuous, discrete, categorial? All of these questions are kind of open. Also, whether or not we can incorporate additional. Or not, we can incorporate additional information we could extract from the pictures on the side of the plagues on this type of thing that also open questions that we're thinking about. But just to be very short, we encoded everything at 0 and 1 to get the first picture of this kind of big matrix of interaction. And this is what we get. So what we have here is the bacteria, okay, ordered by phylogeny. What you have here are the phages, also ordered. Are the phages also ordered by first what is called morphotypes for the people, fake people in the room, neurovioli, podivier de, that's how they look like. And then, a second order, this is at the genomic level, the genus of the fake. And so you see that we have like diverse ones. And then whenever you have a red point, this is actually where the fake was able to successfully infect the bacteria. A few things, we have some red and some white. On average, a fake. On average, a phage disabled has a 17% chance of infecting an E. coli. In other species, it can be much lower, so this was somehow good for the phage. You can see that you see that some phage are generally, they can infect a lot of the stains, others seem not as good. And also you see that you have some weird, like it's hard to say what's going on precisely because you have places where you have a lot of red, where you have actually some white. So, what's going on there? A place where you have. What's going on there? A place where you have a lot of white when you have some red. What's going on there? Meaning that you wouldn't expect this to infect, but they infect all the contrary. And so our goal in life is pretty much trying to make sense of this. So yeah? Do you get a red field or white field when you have the same result in triplicate? Yes, so strangely enough, I would have to say I expected this to vary a lot. Not a lot, but I would say like if we get concordance between the triplicates Get concordance between the triplet jets to more than like 75%, I would have been happy. Actually, to this level of encoding, 0 versus 1, because we have the three concentration and the way we encode, I think it's about 95% concordance between the toxic case. So it's very much a concordant of what we see. Like it doesn't vary too much. I have to say that probably we would change one parameter of the experiment, such as the temperature or the media, would change drastically. But Change drastically, but this will. But for now, like the duplicates were quite coherent. How did you select the initial environment? Like, how did you pick the median, the temperature? So, to start for this, the idea was to just work in a rich environment because it was that we have naturalized, so some don't go so well. And then we decided that one day we will change the environment, but we want to learn to not redo the whole matrix, just be able to pick which one would be interesting, and then we would. Which one would be interesting? And then we would redo the experiments on maybe kind of a representative part if we are able to choose smartly. But that's kind of things we want to do in the future. So you said the defense mechanisms don't follow the biology very well? Not at all. The defense mechanisms are in closely related strains, you can have completely different defense mechanisms. And then, when we have this type of results, of course, what we want to try to do is. Results, of course, what we want to try to do is to link the genotype and the phenotype. And then again, open questions: how do you, in that case, what are two similar bacteria? Same defense content, same core genome, same par genome, same. All these questions are a bit open and should we just take random cameras and decide this is how we see? Like, I don't know. Also, there are some variables that are a bit hidden, this isolation strain of the phages. So, all of these questions are open and easy. Questions are open and in the end. But still, we want to try to move forward. So we'd had this our hypothesis: more anti-phage systems, more resistance to phages. So ideally, we wanted just to make a simple correlation, number of successful infection versus that. And that's the day when the student working on that was really sad, and I got super excited. We found no correlation. So that somehow was unexpected. Was unexpected, and at the same time, you could say, Yes, of course, it's expected for many reasons. And so then we try to understand a bit more what's going on, and so we decided to go into the data and look at what's going on. And one thing that is striking just by the art is that you do have kind of it seems that there are some patterns, that big patterns happening. And actually, this is linked to the the virus. The virus, the viral genus. And so then we started to look a bit deeply into the genome of this virus. And viruses have these so-called RBPs, so receptor-binding proteins, which are genes that allow them to go on the bacteria and try to fix it. And when we look at them, we are able to map them in the genome, and there are parts that are quite variable. And if we build this kind of networks of the type, so this network is like if you are linked by one By one thing, it means that you have one of these RDPs in common and it's colored by the genus. So, what it shows is that, and if you have like bigger ones like here, it means you share two or three RDPs. And what you see is that actually, usually when you have things that are colored, they share links. So, it means that probably within the viral genus, what makes a difference is this type of RDPs. And we can even go a bit deeper, and within specifical like Like biogenus, look at these RBPs and actually look at the isolated strain. And so, in like the Felixonu Verus, you actually see that we find these phages were isolated mostly on two different strains. And actually, when this is the case, we see different types of R D Ps. So, this type of R D P is for me would kind of place us where we are in the matrix. Are we in a place this plus a fibrotian of the sign, are we in a place where we have a lot of red and so expect a lot of red? Red and so expect a lot of red, or are we somehow in a place where we have a lot of white and expect a lot of white? That's that's a bit how I feel about this. But then you could say, okay, so maybe so defense systems don't defend against phages. Well, actually they do. It's much more that I think they play a role at deciding if you are in a place where you have a lot of red, do you have white or not? And so this is the type of things we can start to kind of understand by taking here is a five. By taking here is a phylogenetically similar bacteria super close to one another. Here are similar phages, so we're really looking at things that are similar. And then, if you're all end, you can infect, and then you have some right. So, then what we can map on this data is the present absence of different systems. So, as you see here again, some differences in super closely related strains. And you can see that actually, for these three fakers that are able to infect here this bacteria. I don't know if you're good at these games, but we are missing actually here one thing, which is the Shango system. And Shango is a defense system, strigging systems, no idea how it works. But probably this is because of the absence of this system that these phages are able to infect. We are right now validating this type of things by going back to the strains, cloning this system, and trying to complement and see if it's happening. This type of example. Part of it. These type of examples, we see many, many of them in the matrix. So we'll try to find a a way that is more systematic to try to find them. But that's how we are. So the picture we kind of have is that the global effect are this kind of RBP can you observe and then the more local effect may be linked to different systems or other type of procedures. So overall I told you that bacterial species have different viral strategies, that more antiviral systems does not mean better protection against Does not mean better protection against phages, that there is a lot of complexity there. And where are we going with this? Well, for medical doctors, they want us to go toward trying to get some better idea on how to choose phages to kill a bacteria based on the genome. So that's something we're thinking about. Like, if we think that we have a specific bacteria, can we place it in our matrix and say, ah, these phages might be very good at killing it? That's something that we're trying to do. With this matrix, we With these metrics, we want to ask very basic and fundamental questions about these anti-fate systems. Are the systems redundant or complementary? Are there specific combinations of anti-fate systems that are more efficient? Are they co-regulated? Because the beauty of this is that we kind of have this treasure map and then we have everything in the lab, so we can really go and do whatever experiment, transcriptomics, we can do in different media, look at the absorption of AJAC, where many things we can do, genetic engineering, all of this. Genetic engineering, all of these, and ask specific things. So it's kind of a first step to get a map, and then we will go diving into specific problems. And the last thing that I want to end on is to go back to the initial question, is why so many systems? And currently, there are maybe two different hypotheses that are out there. And one is the idea that maybe you have a lot because they are exchanged, so at the level of a population. So, at the level of a population, you would have some sort of collective immunity. Like, you would pretty much have, it's very costly to encode like 50 different systems, but maybe if they are spread in the population and you can exchange them, then you have this sort of distributed immunity balance selection thing that could go on. So, that's one. And the other one, which is actually right now my favorite, is that actually there are not systems that are there for the bacteria to be. So, the bacteria to defend itself, that's not where the selection is. It's actually a system encoded by mobile genetic elements. And these systems are there just for the war between mobile genetic elements themselves. And this could be a way to explain the type of results where we don't see a direct link between the different things, between phages, infection, and the system. And I think it's quite cool somehow to think that the cell would be a battlefield. Would be a battlefield for the elements to have world, and we're just witnessing the battlefield. And so, what I want to think about is how could we test for this hypothesis? What would be the condition? Maybe in some species of bacteria this is playing, maybe in other, in E. coli, really I favor that one also because all these elements are really all the time on mobile change garments. But how do we find good ways to prove it? What would it look like in the data, experimentally, genomically? Experimentally, genomically, what hypothesis can we make? And there is a most wonderful essay wrote about this by David Bigar and Eduardo Rocha in a recent Protein Ethics paper. Yeah, so these are the questions I have at the moment. And on this, I just want to thank my lab and the people who did this. And thank you for your attention. Yeah. I think you kind of mentioned it already before future work, but at the moment I don't know if any of those active? No. Let's say check that. We know that it depends also what you mean active, because we don't know anything about the regulation. We know some of these systems were cloned, expressed heterogeneously in a sensitive strain on a multi-copy plasmid, and in that case, And in that case, provided defense against fages. But in the conditions, what we need to do to validate this is to do knockouts or knockdowns or this type of stuff to see directly. The problem is that these type of effects are much harder to see because we expect some systems to be redundant. So typically, if you knock them out, you will still see protection against pages, even though they do protect against pages, just because some other systems are. Some of the systems are kind of taking over. Yeah. And you'll certainly know this, but Graham Hatful started the C phages program where students isolate phages. And now they start to have enough genome sequence on those that they find these anti-phage defense things. So they're the phage infect the cell, become a lysogen, and make the cell immune to other different kinds of To other different kinds of things. Anyway, the same way that you search the bacterial genomes for these defenses? Are you searching phage genomes? Yeah, so we did that work with the typically in the paper I mentioned, we looked for that. So in the phages that are as phages in NCBI, we find little because those also are little phages. So we expect to find more prophages. So what we did was to detect prophages. So what we did was to detect prophages in the bacterial genomes and look at the system. So there we find quite a lot, of course. And I have to say that we published that paper before there was a big batch of systems that were discovered to be specifically present on these elements. But we even did an analysis in the paper showing that typically when we look for systems, the ones that were discovered in prophages, we find them more on prophages in the COVID. them more on prophages in the chromosome, whereas there are some systems like CRISPR-CAS you would almost never find in prophages, probably because they are super big. So yes, we are looking into this and I even think that for now for me that's the place where I look more for discovering new systems is defense islands, yes, but also a lot in hotspots of these profits. So yes, we are doing this type of analysis and my feeling is that maybe you have two things going on, a kind of cold Going on, a kind of co-immune system of the bacteria that would have systems that are present in the chromosome and be dedicated to the defense of the cell. And maybe you have systems that are more specific to mobile genetic elements and that would be much more present on mobile genetic elements. And there was a recent paper in E. coli that also seems to have this trend. And so maybe, you know, both of them have an effect on phages, but maybe they're not used for the same reason. Use for the same reason. I was curious, so you show that on closely related strings you have a specificity between the defense system defending against a specific fight. I was wondering whether you think that's restricted to closely related strains, or whether that's a kind of global thing across all the strains, and if not, why? That uh that you have different strains that go different systems? No. No, no, that so you showed this slide where you had um the pages and the strains and where you showed the specificity between the system and the page. So these were not really, I'm not sure that's exactly what they were saying. I think she's asking whether Shago kills that particular page across all genetic factors. I have no idea. And more generally, the And more generally, I would say the type of agent, the system target, for some systems it seems to be like it's very easily saying, I kill this type of family, protects against, and for others it's much less clear. And this will very much be linked to the trigger of the system. Like, how does the system recognize fake infection? And so, for some systems, even like it's starting to emerge that system called Lamasu, that it's That it would be able to send the topology of the DNA. And in that sense, it can also recognize the other mobile anti-organisms. So, but this is very much what molecular biologists of the field are looking into. So, for now, some studies, one study suggested that yes, it's family specific, but I didn't find the data super convincing. So, I just think we need to wait a bit. You highlighted another three hundred ninety collect. How confident would you be? confident would you be to be able to predict which phages they would resist? So I don't know that's kind of a game we are playing right now. So when I say we are trying to predict, so we are trying to build models that would give us a combination of three phages that would kill and we are going to test for it. Like we have a hundred other E. coli that we've never seen, we have their genomes and we're going to play the game of doing prediction and then doing experiments where we take these E. coli and we try to kill them with specific To kill them with specific phases, we won't redo the robotics, but to try to kill them with some specific phases and see if we are good at it or not. No idea. It's like an experiment that we'll run in the next few months in the lab. So we're trying and I hope I will be able to tell you. My gut feeling is that we won't be very good. Did you find any bacteria without sequences that were phage resistant? Yeah. We have some that have no known We have some that have no known anti-phase system. The key question is that maybe they resist through many other ways. You can hyperceptors, you can resist phenotypically, or there might be different systems we don't know. All of these are like plausible explanations. Research based on just homology? Another question on the idea. Do we have an explanation where they are closed in the genome? You mentioned at the very beginning that a way to detect them were to find. The way to detect that, we have to find closer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when I think close is like you really find them within like you have these islands and they're one next to another. So usually when we do this search, we do like less than 10 Kb away, knowing that this system can be easily up to 4 or 5 Kb. Is there a reason for that? I mean, ah, there are reasons. One of the open questions of the field, several hypotheses, co-agulation. Coagulation. Another hypothesis: transfer together. So if you have a good combination, it can be transferred together. Third hypothesis, you have a hotspot of horizontal gene transfer. So all the things arrive there and it's just kind of garbage. Or not garbage, but that's where the things integrate because it has been shown that you have hotspots for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. And maybe I'm forgetting your couple, but those are the three main ones driving in those. One of those topic in those stages that Graham Happles look at. They're also they have multiple systems in individual they're also clustered and they certainly are co-regulated, which makes sense because they need to be early to get the immunity set up. Yeah, so also I think at some point we have to start thinking of what is the system because we do see that you know when you have co-localization You have co-localization of these systems together at some point, they will start working together so much that it can form like only kind of one system. So, we find this example of, I call them embedded systems. So, you see two genes of one and two genes of another. And so, these are the one or two, it's kind of up for discussion. But these are the type of things that typically in phages, I didn't know of example where we find many because usually phages are quite. Many because usually phages are quite dense. So, for now, the ones that have been described in the literature were more like white hotspots with one or maybe two systems, but not much more, but like big islands like we see in bacteria. But yes. Is it okay, but it's cut off?
