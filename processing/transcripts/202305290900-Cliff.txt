Thank you. Thank you to the organizers for organizing and also inviting us. And thank you to the hosts for hosting us. So I have been told that they want informal stream of consciousness talks. And so that is what I am here to provide. But that means that you should feel free to interrupt me and ask questions at any time. So this is based on joint work, very much in progress. Joint work very much in progress with Colin Ingalls and Shav Paquet. And the plan. So, I'm going to start with some background on twisted sheaves and also just to establish some notation on quiver moduli spaces. And then I'm going to explain from several perspectives a construction of a quasi-universal sheaf on M. So the point is that we wish we had a universal sheaf and we don't. And so we do the next best thing. Don't. And so we do the next best thing. And then the final part is an application, which is the motivation, explaining that a quasi-universal sheaf is pretty okay too, and we can do some things with it. And it applies to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebra. So this is an interesting project for me. I've never worked in this area before. But Charles Paquette is a representation theorist. He studies finite dimensional algebras and Finite dimensional algebras and uses words like sure, vector, and things like that that I don't understand. And he was giving a talk. Colin was in the audience, and he said at the end, well, I have this conjecture. If I had a universal sheaf, I could prove the conjecture, but I don't. And Colin thought, aha, but I bet you have a quasi-universal sheaf. And I bet that that might be good enough. And so then Colin came to me and we tried to do the geometry side. And now we're working on. And now we're working on whether that does indeed prove Charles' conjecture. Okay, so it's geometry and algebra, but not too much physics. Okay, so let me start with a little bit about sheaves and twisted sheaves. So I'm going to start. These are some slides that I made by hand on the plane. Okay, good. I have a pointer. So I start with M, the space that I'm interested in, and I choose a The space that I'm interested in, and I choose a cover Y. And let's just establish some notation over here in the left corner. So I'm interested in the intersection of Y with itself, and I'm using P1 and P2 to denote the projections. And then over the threefold cover, I'm going to use Q1, Q2, and Q3 to denote the projections all the way down to Y and Qij to denote projections to two factors. So that's To two factors. So that's my conventions that I'll hopefully stick to. And okay, let's start with an ordinary sheaf, F0 on M. And what do we obtain with this cover? So this is a familiar story. We pull back to Y. I'll call that F. So that's a sheaf on Y. And if I pull back further to Y cross Y, in the two ways that I can do that, I have an isomorphism because there's a commutative diagram of pulling back. Let's call that phi. Let's call that phi. And the property that this isomorphism satisfies is that if I pull back yet again to the threefold intersection, I have a commutative diagram that looks like this. So it says that if first I do the pullback of phi along q23, and then the pullback along q12, and compose that, that's the same as pulling back along q13 just one time. So that's this equation here, star. And so this. And so this data of F and Phi is called descent data for the sheaf F0. Are these? Can you read my writing? Is it too small? Okay, yeah. Good. And so the theorem is that there's an equivalence between these pairs of descent data and sheaves on the original space M. And so this is just saying that we can glue sheaves along its HAL covers. Tile covers. Okay, but now we want to do something a little bit more general. So these are called twisted sheaves. This is introduced in the thesis of Calderaru. So he says, let's start with a Tuco cycle. So a map alpha with values in Gm. And suppose that instead of having this condition star on the nose, we have our sheaf F, we have our isomorphism phi, and then this equation holds only up to a factor of alpha. Up to a factor of alpha right here. So, this is called an alpha-twisted sheaf. And in particular, when alpha is each. Zoom. Ah. Yeah. Thank you. Did I just have to go to the next one? Okay. Now we can't see. Okay, now we can't see their faces, but I'm sorry. Okay, thank you. So, in particular, if alpha is equal to one, then we just recover the original descent data. And so one twisted sheaves are the same thing as ordinary sheaves on M, but we now have a whole other family of stuff that we can study. And one key property is that we can tensor these sheaves. These sheaves. And so, if f is alpha twisted and g is beta twisted, then their tensor product is alpha times beta twisted. And if the sheaf that was alpha twisted was locally free, let's call it E, then its dual is alpha inverse twisted, which means that the tensor product of E with its dual, even if E is not an ordinary sheaf, it's got a real twist alpha when we take that tensor product or we look at the endomorphism. We look at the endomorphism sheaf, that always is one-twisted. So it descends to give an ordinary sheaf on M. Questions? Okay. So these were introduced by Calderaru in his thesis, but he provides some comparisons to other things that were studied before. So let's suppose that from the beginning we're fixing our cover U. Beginning, we're fixing our cover u, and one choice of alpha and a locally free alpha-twisted sheaf. Let's suppose that such a thing exists and we've chosen one. Now we can construct from this a projective bundle. So recall that we had phi, which was a map between the pullbacks of E that satisfied this equation where we had an alpha in there. If I projectivize this, Then, well, the alpha doesn't matter anymore. So, the alpha goes away, which means that the projectivization of E descends to a projective bundle on M. And so, in terms of cohomology, if you like that sort of thing, my writing got even smaller. So, the projective bundle on M, I've denoted that with a bar to indicate that it descended from. Bar to indicate that it descended from the projective bundle on y that corresponds to a class in H1. And we have this co-boundary map that gives us a class in H2, and that class is exactly alpha. And if alpha was one, then the projective bundle would lift to an ordinary bundle on M, but in general, it doesn't. So we have something different. And then in general, we can look at sheaves on this space. Look at sheaves on this space that we built, this projective bundle, and we put some condition on the fibers, and these correspond to alpha-twisted sheaves on M. So there's an interpretation of alpha-twisted sheaves as actual sheaves with some properties on a different space. Another way to look at it: so remember that we said that the endomorphism sheaf, it's one-twisted and it descends. And also, because it's an endomorphism sheaf, And also, because it's an endomorphism sheaf, it's a sheaf of algebras. We call it A, and this is what's known as an Azumaya algebra, sheaf of Azumaya algebras. And one can also show that there's a relation between alpha twisted sheaves. So that's F together with the phi here and sheaves of A modules on M. So I could take my F, I could tensor it with E dual. So that's one twisted now because it's alpha times alpha inverse. Alpha times alpha inverse. So it descends to M, but it's not just a sheaf anymore. It has the structure of being an A module. And so we also have a correspondence that way. So some people prefer to study that rather than the formulation of twisted sheaves that I gave. And finally, a third perspective is in terms of gerbs. So the co-cycle alpha that we started with was a two-co-cycle, which means that it parametrizes a gerb, which I've called curly m because it's Called curly M because it's stacky over M. And because our co-cycle was defined relative to the cover Y, this gerb has the property that when we pull it back, it's the trivial gerb. So it's a copy of Y with B of the group. And then, so suppose that I had a sheaf on M alpha. I could pull it back along this map. What do I get? I get a sheaf on Y that has a GM action. That has a GM action. And so alpha twisted sheaves correspond to sheaves on the stirb that have weight one with respect to this GM action. So that's a third, I guess a fourth interpretation of alpha twisted sheaves. And mostly I'm going to use the concrete definition that I started with, but these other perspectives we'll see that they're kind of sneaking in. Other questions? Other questions about that? Okay, so that's the background on fisted sheaves. Now, let me establish some background about quiver moduli spaces. So probably this is review, but I just wanted to fix my notation. So I'm choosing a quiver. For now, let's let it be acyclic. I denote the vertices by Q0 and the arrows by Q0. Vertices by q0 and the arrows by q1, and I choose a dimension vector d with components di. Then a representation of the quiver is a choice of matrices here of the appropriate size. So in this, in my example that had two vertices, I have k to the d1, k to the d2, and I have three matrices. And in general, a representation is given by a list of matrices that whose size. Matrices whose sizes are determined by the target and source of each arrow. And because at the end of the day, we're going to be talking about finite dimensional algebras, let me emphasize that perspective. So let's recall that we have a path algebra KQ. If our quivers finite, which they are, I should have put that conditions. This is a finite dimensional algebra. And with no loops, yeah. Um, with no loops, yeah. Um, and so I'm looking at the vector space, which is a direct sum of the Kdi's, and I'm making it into a KQ module by saying that a generator alpha acts on the appropriate components by the matrix A alpha, and otherwise it acts by zero. And then, when are two such isomorphisms, such Isomorphism such representations isomorphic? Well, we have this group which is the product of GLDIs, and it acts. I'm going to say it's acting on the right to fix that, by changing the bases of each KDI. And so if our list of matrices really give the same maps with respect to different bases, we say it's the same or an isomorphic representation. And then a choice of change of basis is giving an isomorphism between those representations. Inside of the group G, I denote by Inside of the group G, I denote by delta the center. So these are scalar matrices, a whole list of scalar matrices with the same scalar z. So it's isomorphic to Gm, but often I'll denote it by delta to distinguish which I'm talking about. And that acts trivially. And so the action of G on this set R really factors through the quotient, which I'll call P. Okay. Okay, now I'm not going to talk about stability, but I'm just going to say for now that we pick out a set of stable representations, and the key property for us is that if I look at one of those representations, its stabilizer is given by this group delta. And this means that in particular, P acts freely on this subset RS. And so we find. Rs. And so we form the moduli space of stable representations as the quotient of Rs by P, and I denote that by M. I should probably denote it by MS, but it's the only one that will ever appear. So I just dropped that from the notation. And a remark is also that if I had not factored out this delta, I could have done the group quotient or the stacky quotient, sorry, here. And that would be a G. And that would be a G a G M gerb or a delta gerb over m, and that would be the moduli stack. Okay, so as I said, Charles came at this six months ago and he said he wished he had a universal bundle on M. He doesn't, but if he did, what would that give him? That would be a sheaf on M, so an OM module, but with a compatible action of the path algebra. So a KQ tends to Path algebra. So a KQ tensor OM module, or a sheaf of KQ modules, such that for any point, any representation V, the fiber of our sheaf at the point in M is isomorphic to V as a KQ module. And so this exists by work of Alistair King when the GCD of Of the components of our dimension vector is one, but in general, it doesn't always work. Yeah. Over the stable part, yes. But if there are not table, is there a disconnect table? I have nothing to say. Okay, here. Okay, so let's explain how we can construct a twisted sheath over the moduli space. And so we're following basically, almost word for word, the argument that Mukai uses about moduli vector bundles on a curve. And Kalderaru adopted this argument to talk to say it in the language of twisted sheaves. And then you can also read in a paper of Hoskins and Schaffhowitzer about. Hoskins and Schaffhowitz are about the quiver context. So, in some respects, our case is easier than Mukai's because he has a base curve x, and then he's looking at moduli of things over x. We don't have an x, we have a point, but then we have an algebra also. So the most general situation would be like we would have a base x, a sheaf of algebras on x, and we'd be looking at sheaves of representations for that algebra. Representations for that algebra. So that's kind of the, we think like a general framework that would split into both of these stories. But for now, our life is a little bit easier because every time Mukai has to deal with X and refine X, we don't have to worry about it. X is a function. But anyway, we start with the same two key observations that Mukai has in his context, which is that over, before we take the quotient, we do have a universal bundle, and it's just a direct sum of copies of the structure sheaf with the total. The structure sheaf with the tautological KQ module structure. So, as an O module, it's trivial. It's free, but the KQ module structure depends on where we are in the moduli space. And then the next observation is that we had a principle, it was a principal bundle over a principal P bundle. And so if our sheaf upstairs were equivariant, Were equivariant, it would descend. But it's not P equivariant, it's only G equivariant. So, this answers the question about the moduli stack. Because it's G equivariant, almost by definition, it's a sheaf on curly M, but it doesn't descend all the way to the coarse moduli space. And so, the reason is that it's just G equivariant, and this delta that we would want to act trivially doesn't. It acts by weight minus one because I had it acting on the. Minus one because I had it acting on the right. So, what we do is we choose a cover Y of M over which our principal bundle trivializes. So now I have this Cartesian diagram here where the pullback of Rs along this map U is isomorphic to Y times P. And notice that if I have a cover, such a cover Y, saying that I have a trivialization is equivalent to saying that I have a section here. We'll use that notation later. So now on this pullback, on this, so y cross p is now a cover of RS, and I have two G equivariant sheaves. I have the pullback of my universal one, which still has weight minus one, and is Still has weight minus one and is still universal with respect to this covering space. But I also have the line bundle L that just came from the fact that y over g is a delta or a gm bundle over y times p. And that has weight one, which means that if I tensor them, it has weight zero. And so that does descend to y. And tensoring a universal bundle with a line bundle does not destroy the universal property. And so Universal property, and so we do get a universal bundle which I'm going to denote by uy on y. And because it's universal, maybe after doing some refinements, which I'm not going to worry about, I do get an identification of the pullbacks of this universal bundle along two maps to the twofold cover. But there's no reason that that should satisfy the co-cycle condition. The co-cycle condition. However, so this composition, if it was really a co-cycle, this composition would be one. And I can't assure that it's one, but it's an automorphism of a family of stable bundles, which means that it's a map into GM. So this is where stability is really important. And I can say nothing if I don't have that. Okay. And so this composition is exactly multiplication by a co-cycle. And if I rearrange my equation, I see that uy together. Equation, I see that uy together with this phi is a twisted sheaf, an alpha twisted sheaf. Okay. So, so far I have an alpha twisted sheaf on which is defined relative to this cover Y, and I want to produce a real sheaf on M, which is as close to being universal as it can. This is what we call a quasi-universal sheaf. Call a quasi-universal sheaf. So we know that to produce a real sheaf on M, what should I do? I need to find a twisted sheaf free of rank N, where the twist is by alpha minus one, and tensor those, and then that will descend. And then what will happen, it will no longer be universal because I've made it too big by rank N many times. And so the fiber of the descended thing at a representative At a representation will be isomorphic to Kn copies or V tensor Kn, or in other words, N copies of the original representation. And so this is what we call, or Mukai calls, a quasi-universal bundle. So we just get a bunch of copies of the thing that we wanted instead of the thing that we wanted, but that's still pretty good, especially if we can figure out locally how to extract just one copy that we like. And so, a goal is to minimize n. So, we don't want too, too many copies. And I'll explain from the representation theory side why that seems to be important. And so, let me explain some candidates that we have. I mean, we can do this. We can find an E, but we don't know yet which is the minimal one. So, just some notation. Remember that we had our dimension vector with the entries di. With the entries di, I'm going to denote by little d the GCD, by big d the sum of the di. So, in other words, that's the rank of our bundle uy. And I'm going to denote by I zero one of the i's such that the di0 is minimal. So, the naive candidate, and this is what in Mukai's situation exactly does what he needs it to do because he doesn't have an algebra acting, is just well, the original. Is just, well, the original sheaf that we had that was alpha twisted was free. So we can just take its dual and tensor with that. That will always work, but it's really big. So we can always do that. And our n is equal to d, the sum of the di's. A bit better is the observation that each of the sumands, if we just look at the sum and corresponding to one vertex i of the quiver, okay. Vertex I of the quiver, okay, that's no longer a sheaf of KQ modules, but it's still a vector bundle, and it's still alpha twisted. So the alpha twist respects the components. And so I can take the minimal one. So ui0, take its dual, and I can use that guy. So this is significantly better than the sum of the di's. And what we're hoping, I don't know, we have varying degrees of optimism. We have varying degrees of optimism, but sometimes we think that we should be able to find an E of rank n equal to D, the GCV. So here's maybe a little bit of motivation for this. It's a fact that we can choose alpha not just to have values in Gm, but to have values in dth roots of unity. And so in particular, when d is equal to one, our sheaf is one twisted. Our sheaf is one-twisted, which means it actually does descend. We don't need to play any of these games, and we get a universal sheaf on M. So, this is proven in other ways by King, but this recovers that result. And so when D is equal to one, we don't need E of rank DI0. D works, the GCD works, and so that's kind of maybe some reason to hope that something could work more generally. Are there any questions? Are there any questions so far? Is there something like some homology class which if you compute it and give you the instructions they have? Probably. Yeah. Speaking for the online audience, we could probably reach the question. Ah, okay. Okay. The question was: if there's a comology class that provides an obstruction to finding a twisted chief of a given rank, yeah, I'm not sure. But I know that, like, in general, yeah, the fact that the alpha has values in mu d is not enough. But sometimes I feel optimistic that the fact that we actually have this whole family of. Have this whole family of alpha twisted sheaves with the right thing that fit together in a nice way, and maybe we can do some like wedge or something. I don't know. Yeah, if anyone has ideas, I would be very happy to talk about it. Let me give another perspective in terms of projective bundles, because this, so this construction that I explained, we're very closely following things that were already known. They were not written in these words, but it doesn't feel like we've done that much that's new. And similarly, this is from a completely different perspective. This is from a completely different perspective, a very kind of algebraic quiver representation kind of focused thing. There's a construction that yields the same thing if you just take it a few steps further than the authors did. So this is in a paper of Engel and Reineke called Smooth Models for Quiver and Moduli Spaces, or something like that. And so they explain input. Input is: We started with our quiver and our dimension vector and our stability condition. So here's an example of a quiver. And then they say, okay, let's also have the additional input of another sequence of integers. And what we do to our quiver is we add in a point at infinity, and we add EI arrows from infinity to i for each i. So that's what the EIs are doing. They're telling us how many arrows to add. And so they say, okay, the output of this construction is a new quiver where we have one extra point and a whole bunch of extra arrows. We have a new dimension vector. We keep the same dimensions at all the original vertices and we add dimension one at infinity. And we have a new stability condition where epsilon is a small positive number that's designed to make things work out. Out oh, I just added a point and I call it infinity instead of i. Yeah, you still have a geom action on that node between, yeah, well, yeah, exactly, exactly, yeah. So it nothing is, I just used the name infinity, but I shouldn't, I could have chosen any other letter, it's not special, yeah. So the result, we do exactly the same construction as before, and we get a moduli space. M hat E over M, and the fibers are projective of dimension E times D minus one. So this is what they explain in their paper. And then we looked at this and we thought this seems useful. We like projective bundles and twisted sheaves. And so we have several favorite examples. So one is that we pick one vertex that we like, call it J, and I just add one arrow to that guy. Just add one arrow to that guy, like this. And so, what do I get? I get a moduli space whose fibers are of dimension dj minus one. Or I could add one vertex and one arrow to each vertex. And so I denote that with the kind of a bold-faced one, and we get We get a projective bundle of rank D minus one, where D was the sum of the DI's. And so the comparison to twisted sheaves, we're still writing this up, so I wrote in progress, but these both satisfy a universal property. And this M1 was exactly the projective bundle that comes from UY, or twisted sheaf, and the M delta J was the one that came from the UYJ. The one that came from the UYJ, the jth component of the twisted sheaf. So these are the same constructions, just from very different perspectives, which we found kind of cool that they more or less existed already. And for a third comparison, remember that we had this idea of gerbs being involved, and we have this map from delta from H1 PGL to H2 of M. Of m okay. And each of these guys, they all correspond to the same alpha. It's the same twist. And I'm pretty sure, I haven't checked it carefully, that this is the same as the twist that gives the gerb of the stack over the moduli space. Okay, so probably there's also a story one could make using universal sheaves on M that don't. Sheaves on M that don't descend to or bold M, not curly. Oh, I guess. Are there any questions about that? Okay, so let me do an explicit computation, which I found kind of helpful. So let's look at this quiver with two vertices and three arrows. And three arrows. And so, in particular, and I'm choosing the dimension vector 2, 2, so representations have total dimension 4. And we're going to construct a quasi-universal bundle, which is going to have rank 8. And unfortunately, this doesn't help with my open question because 8 is equal to 4 times 2, and 2 is both the G C D and the minimum of 2 and 2. But this is the example that we could do. Is the example that we could do? So, to study the moduli space, first we translate it into a question about quadratic forms. So if you have these three matrices, two by two matrices ABC, I can look at a quadratic form whose value on XYZ is the determinant of XA plus YB plus ZC. And so, okay, that's a quadratic form in three variables. So it corresponds to a three by three matrix, asymmetric. Is symmetric, which I'll call x. And one can show for appropriate choice of stability condition that this is stable if and only if the determinant is non-zero. And so the moduli space M is given by these quadratic forms with non-zero determinant up to scaling. And so it's p5 minus this closed bit where the determinant is zero. Determinant is zero. These are some conics. Okay. Where? Oh, in P5. No, you could have some, you could have a matrix, symmetric matrix with it's got six entries. They're not all zero, but the determinant could be zero. The fire line didn't take care of that. That's right. Yeah, sorry, trying to understand ABC two by two matrix. That's right. The x's, x, little x, y, and z are variables. They're numbers. Yeah. So what's a three by three? So this is a quadratic form on our on on C three. Oh. A quadratic form. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I'm looking in P5 and I've thrown away some closed locus. And okay, so the first thing that we did, this was early on in the project, one of the collaborators, we just produced a sheaf of Clifford algebras on M that did the right thing. And then later I'll explain how it actually comes from this more general construction. So we built a sheaf which has three generators, E1, E2, E3, with relations EIEJ plus EJEI is equal to two. Plus EJ EI is equal to 2xi. So this x depends on where we are in the moduli space, and that's why we get a sheaf. This is graded with the degree of EI equal to 1. Okay, so the first clue that we're doing something okay is that we did get something of rank eight. In the even part, we have four elements in our basis. Let's call that A0. In the odd part, we have four elements of our basis. Let's call that A1. And this is a sheaf of K2. A1 and this is a sheaf of KQ modules where I put A0 at the first vertex, I put A1 at the second index, and my three maps are given by multiplication by E1, E2, E3. And the claim that I'll discuss on the next slide is that this is quasi-universal, which is that if X corresponds to three matrices ABC, as in this construction over here, then the fiber of A Then the fiber of A at X, we can split it. And so instead of having a four-dimensional guy here and a four-dimensional guy here, it splits into two copies of two-dimensional things. And each of those things is isomorphic to the original guy. So this is a quasi-universal sheaf. So how do we do that? So here I've just copied down the stuff about our algebra. So for simplicity, let me just assume that. For simplicity, let me just assume that x was diagonal and I can scale. So I'm going to assume that I have a one above. For the general case, we use Gram-Schmidt to do this. This is the first time I used Gram-Schmidt out of a linear algebra class. I was kind of excited to do that. Okay, so first observation is that E1, E2, E3 is central. And if I square it with parentheses, I get minus the determinant of x. The determinant of x, and so what I do is I choose a square root of minus the determinant, and then you can check if you're bored that this element f that I can write down, which is clearly even, it's idempotent. f squared is equal to f, which means that the fiber of a at x splits as a direct sum of ax times f and ax times 1 minus f. Each are of dimension 4. Each are clearly closed by Each are clearly closed by multiplication on the left by the EIs. So they're sub-representations. And so I've split AX into two copies. And then one can just check. You can just write down. You choose, you use these bases. You choose bases here. You write down the matrix. Like it's going back to linear algebra class. You write down the matrices for multiplication by EI, and you get the matrices, the matrix that you started with. Matrix that you started with. Okay, so this is just a direct construction that works in this case, and we have no idea how to generalize it, but let's relate it to the twisted sheaf interpretation. So the observation was that we couldn't choose this square root globally, right? And so globally, our sheaf A does not split as a direct sum. F couldn't be defined globally. So, what we do is let's choose a twofold cover of M in which we adjoin a square root of this element. And then, once I've done that, I can choose a representative ABC of any class X, exactly the way that I do here. So I run through this. That I do here. So I run through this argument and I say A is going to be multiplication by EI, B is going to be multiplication by E2, and so on. And so that gives us sigma from Y to Rs, which means that Rs trivializes over the pullback. So this is exactly the first step that we needed to run Mukai's argument. And so the claim is that this works, but I haven't explicitly written down the sheaf E. The sheaf E that does this thing. But it was kind of exciting that the same data that we needed to locally prove that it was a quasi-universal representation to get this splitting exactly gave us the cover that we needed to trivialize and then do the argument. Yeah. Other questions about that? Okay, so the last thing that I want to talk about is the representation. About is the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. And I am not at all an expert, but this is what my collaborator explained to me. So let's let A be a finite dimensional algebra over K. Then representation theorists are interested in determining whether A is of infinite or finite representation type. So it's of infinite representation type if it admits infinitely many isomorphism classes of finite dimension. Isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional indecomposable modules. Okay, so, okay, this has been studied for a long time and there are many results. But there's a generalization. So there's something a little bit stronger. An A module N is called a brick if its endomorphism algebra is a division algebra. Algebra is a division algebra. And so such a thing is certainly indecomposable, but it's stronger. A is brick infinite if it admits infinitely many isomorphism classes of finite dimensional bricks. So I think that they're interested in algebras which are of infinite representation type but finite brick type. So this is kind of among the infinite representation type algebras. Type algebras. In general, those are just too scary and wild to do anything, but this is like something that's maybe a little bit more manageable. And a theorem is that A is brick infinite if and only if it's tau tilting infinite. And okay, I looked up the definition and I don't remember, but apparently this is exciting if you like cluster algebras. Okay, so in principle, if we want an algebra to be brick infinite, there's two ways it could be brick infinite. There's two ways it could be brick infinite, right? Either we could have one dimension, finite dimension D, and we could have infinitely many bricks of that dimension, or we could have only finitely many bricks in each dimension, but we could have infinitely many dimensions in which we find bricks. And if I understand correctly, for infinite representation type, either thing can happen. There are representations, there are algebras who only have finitely many in each dimension, but overall, In each dimension, but overall they have infinitely many. And there's the other case as well. But for bricks, it is a theorem, and I don't know the reference, unfortunately, but that if it's brick infinite, there's at least one D where there's infinitely many representations. Okay, so what's the relationship to quivers? The first fact is that any finite dimensional algebra is merida equivalent to a quotient of a path. A quotient of a path algebra, an admissible quotient. Okay, so for now, let's just ignore the quotients and take a path algebra with a dimension vector d and capital D the sum of the di's and consider the moduli space of representations of d. So for a fixed capital D, there's finitely many choices of dimension vectors that give rise. Of dimension vectors that give rise to that. So, if there was going to be infinitely many representations of total dimension d, there would be at least one dimension vector d underline, where the moduli space would have infinitely many bricks. Okay, so every point in our moduli space parametrizes a representation, and we know that its endomorphism ring is k, so it's a brick of dimension d. So these moduli. So, these moduli spaces are parametrizing bricks. So, it's related to this question of brick infiniteness. And, in particular, if the moduli space has dimension at least one, then the algebra is brick infinite. And I think they say something, if in principle, we could have dimension zero, but infinitely many points. And that would be like brick discrete or something. And I believe that they conjecture that this does not happen in the cases that they're interested in. interested. Okay, so how does this relate to our quasi-universal sheaf? Let me first go back to the infinite representation type, which is better studied. So a generic module for A is an indecomposable module which is infinite dimensional over K but finite length over its own endomorphism algebra. And it's a well-known theorem. It's a well-known theorem of Crawley-Bovi that A is of infinite representation type if and only if it admits such a module. So you can find one module, and that gives you guarantee that there are infinitely many finite dimensional indecomposables. Okay, so now we try to generalize this from the infinite type setting to the brick infinite setting. And so we define a generic brick to be a generic module. Brick to be a generic module n such that its endomorphism algebra is division algebra. So it's a generic module, which is in particular a brick, or in addition, a brick. And the conjecture of Cave Moussavant and Chapaquet is that A is brick infinite if and only if it admits a generic brick. So this is known for hereditary algebras because it's known when a hereditary algebra is of finite Is of finite type. If it's a finite type, then it's not brick infinite. If it's of infinite type, then they can construct a generic brick and they can show that it's brick infinite. But in general, Charles tells me this has been too hard to show because they don't know how to construct generic bricks. So this is an obstruction to finding evidence or counterexamples to this theorem. But the conjecture that we make is that if the dimension of M is at least one The dimension of M is at least one, and U is a minimal quasi-universal sheaf, then on M and we evaluate at the generic point. So we take the tensor product over Km with Km, this is a generic brick. So this is consistent with the observation that if the dimension is at least one, we get a brick infinite. We have a brick infinite algebra. So there's another conjecture that says that an definition is that an algebra is brick continuous if it has a continuous family of bricks, which means that the moduli space would be of dimension at least one. And there is a conjecture that an algebra is brick infinite if and only if it's brick continuous. One direction is in the definition, but the other direction is also consistent with this, which says we need to mention at least one y. At least one. Why? Because otherwise, this guy won't be infinite-dimensional. Basically, we just want to add a lot of dimensions when we do this tensoring here. And the minimality, what does that mean? It should be some condition that ensures that we have an indecomposable module here. So if I took too many copies of E, say E worked, and then I used direct sum of E with itself two times, clearly the module that results would be a direct sum. So it wouldn't be in decomposing. Decomposing. Okay, so that's the idea, and apparently, it will be helpful. And I found this very exciting because I haven't worked with representation theorists of this kind. And we would have emails that go back and forth where people would say like completely incomprehensent, like mutually incomprehensible things and come to the same conclusion. So using the representation theory, he was able to predict that such and such thing must have dimension whatever. And then using the algebraic geometry, we get the same conclusion. And so that was algebra and geometry, not of Higgs. Algebra and geometry, not of Higgs bundles. Okay, so the future work then is to generalize this quasi-universal sheaf construction from KQ to quotients of KQ. This doesn't seem like it will be too hard. And then to generalize even further to a sheaf of algebras over a base X. Yeah, so that is what I have to say. Thank you. Great. Thanks for the really wonderful talk. Emily, do we have further questions? So, Roxandra, I want to give you this microphone, but you're so far away. I'm so far away from you. Yeah, who's the problem here? Thank you. Thank you. So, I have two questions. Were you able to compute some of the churn classes of these? Some of the churn classes of these quasi-universal sheaves? We haven't tried. Okay. And then I have another question. So you must be familiar, maybe not, with Yoshioke has constructed an alternative to this story that I think that Huybrecht also and Stellari. This was, I think, like mid-2000s. And what they do is they pull everything back to, so the gerb gives you a projective bundle. It may not be the projectivization, as you're explaining. Projectivization, as you're explaining, of a vector bundle, and then you could cook up a non-twisted sheaf on the projectivization. Uh-huh. Okay, so that must be. And then you can actually get a universal sheaf there. Right. But it has some, I mean, I'm familiar with this because I've started working on a project with someone on this and it has its own technical issues. So I'm not saying, but it could still be useful under this correspondence. Like under this correspondence, it's exactly the same thing. That's right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
