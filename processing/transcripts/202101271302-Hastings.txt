And her family live in Calgary, though. I don't know, given her latest comments about saying, gee, it was great that they canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. Some of you may have heard her saying that on NPR last week. Who knows? So, and again, thanks to the organizers for inviting me. And I've got something which is maybe a little different. It's a little bit more general and I'm More general, and I'm afraid that thinking that some of this may be sort of carrying coals to Newcastle, but some of it is sort of showing that, in fact, a lot of what I've heard in the very interesting talks the last couple of days can sort of fit into a slightly more general framework that may prove useful for thinking about things more generally. And so, what I'd like to start off with is just a reminder, and this came out of And this came out of a group where we were trying to do things, it didn't work out as well as I had hoped that issues of time scales and tidescale mismatches are key to essentially all conservation problems. And I'll return to this in a minute. And I'll point out, and this is a paper that I know. I know Odo Diekman likes to refer to as the most cited and least read paper of all time, and he attributes that remark to somebody else, Kermack and McKendrick. And this paper has this very nice slide in it, or very nice figure in it. And can you see my tell me? Can you see my cursor? If I know if I try and. I know if I try and let's see, you can't. Annotate. All right. That we can see that you've got this in the solid lines, the model output. The dots are the population, the data from the plague. The plague in Mumbai, which used to be Bombay. And as oh, okay, so that's not working. Once I do that, I can't do that. Okay, so all right, let's see. Whoops. Okay, now it's going. Okay, there we go. So the idea would be that we've got the asymptotic behavior. We've got the asymptotic behavior, but that's not really anything that we really care about in a sense. We know that eventually the epidemic goes away, but what we really care about is could be either one of these diagrams. One is the peak, and the other would be maybe the total number of infections illustrated here. And so, what this says is that the transient is really the key. And this is really important because And this is really important because a lot of our tools for doing and analyzing mathematical systems are based on that's right, I've got to do it on this slide. Here we go. Laser pointed. Are based on asymptotic behavior, but what we're really interested in is behavior. What we're really interested in is behavior on a time scale that's relevant to the problems. And we've seen that a lot in a lot of the examples that we've seen over the last couple of days. And it certainly comes out a lot of work on optimization ends up focusing on finite time scales. But in general, it's something that's worth emphasizing. And out of this idea that transients are the key, there's this figure that was borrowed from or copied from a paper. From or copied from a paper by Claudia Paul Wolstel Wolstel, excuse me. And it's just the idea that time scales and various loops are the key to thinking about many human environmental issues. And I'm not going to go through the details. And in particular, when we're thinking about dynamics of ecological systems, that we've got at least three times. At least three time scales that might. There's the time scales of the social system, so like decisions to buy electric cars, decisions to do various other things like that. There's the time scales of the ecological or the physical ecological systems. Those we really don't have much sway over. And then there's time scales for the decision makers. And the social systems and the decision makers are what time scales that we may be able to. That we may be able to change. And a lot of what I'm going to be talking about today came out of material from a working group that was at Nimbus. And I know Mary Lou is part of this meeting. And maybe I can't remember who else is. It's hard to see who's on the screen at all times. And I'll return to a I'll return to a paper that came out of this group that just appeared, I think, last week or so. It just went online. And this was focused in particular on the role of transients in ecological systems. And we'll put up sort of the overarching figure now, but then want to go back to more general issues before I return to that. So the overarching figure is: first of all, if you have a behavior, can it If you have a behavior, can it be a long transient? And we saw this in a lot of the systems. And in particular, as you see the way that we define transience, which may be a little bit odd, that, for example, some of the dynamics that Frank Hooker talked about yesterday, as well as some of the dynamics that Yo talked about. Some of the dynamics that Yo talked about, Yo Wasa talked about the first day, and others, which fit into this scheme, which is why I think this is useful. And we have here the sort of standard figure describing adaptive management and basically putting it in the context that thinking about transients is a way. That thinking about transients is a way to maybe do a bit more in thinking about these issues. And we've heard, I know, heard the term ghost the other day. And in response to these transients, we might have various ideas that we may either want to get into the transient state or maintain it, or we might want to shorten the transient depending upon what the desired outcome. Upon what the desired outcome is. But in order to sort of emphasize that this is a useful kind of overarching view of things, that I want to go back to some of the more general overviews that we did, a little bit less focusing on management per se, and then I'll at the end turn back to management. To management questions and give some examples. So, the idea would be that, in some sense, just like we can use ideas from dynamical systems to think about the behavior in an asymptotic sense, we can similarly begin to classify transients and their dynamics using similar approaches. And a lot of this is not in. And a lot of this is not in some sense new, but just trying to organize well-known ideas. And as I go, I'll point out that tipping points and the behavior associated with them in some sense is a subset of what we're trying to talk about here. So, first of all, transient basically, we need at least a rough definition, and that's dynamics that occur when the system is not at equilibrium. At equilibrium. And by equilibrium, I mean any kind of asymptotic state. So anything like a chaotic system or a limit cycle or a point or could be quasi-cyclic, et cetera. System that will stay there unless perturbed. And so we could think about that as an attractor. And a long transient, well, a crude definition would A crude definition would be that it lasts longer than you think, and we can sort of conceptually non-dimensionalize. And I guess my little circle there is going to stay forever. I don't know how to get rid of it. So that's because I chose the wrong annotate thing. Let's see. Is there a way to erase it? No. Okay, so I'll keep going. And the idea there is that we sort of non-dimensionalize by choosing as our measure of long something inherent into the system. So dozens of generations or more would be one. And another would be long enough that, from the standpoint of some other idea, we would think of it as. As long-term behavior or the asymptotic behavior. And so we've got these three different ideas. We could have noisy equilibrium. We could have essentially an equilibrium after that we have some change and it takes a while to get there. And then we have the idea that we have a disturbance and a lot of transients would be responses to disturbances. So empirical examples suggest that this kind Suggests that this kind of transient is widespread in natural and experimental systems. And here's the kind of slide that you may be able to read on your screen, but you certainly couldn't read in a regular room. And the idea would be that we collected, and all this is a big we, a various number of examples. And some of them we've sort of heard a lot about, the eutrophic macro, eutrophic. Macro eutrophic oligotrophic lakes. And then there's a variety of others, flower beetles, fish. I'll return and talk very much about coral algal grazer systems, dungeness crab, I'll at least mention, and a variety of others. Extinction dead is a classic one. And the spruce budworm system that was beautifully modeled by Ludwig Jones and Holling. Jones and Holling, the way we define transients, we're going to call it transient. So, first, I want to briefly mention one example: the laboratory populations of flower beetles. And these are some dynamics that were looked at in some work by Jim Cushing at Aal, where the experimental stuff was done by Bob Costantino. And what we have here is on the two different replicates. On the two different replicates, one outlined in blue and the other outlined in red. And in the one in blue, if you look between time steps five and 20, the number of larvae as they observe every two weeks and the number of pupae are more or less constant. And then it goes back to this essentially two-cycle. And in the replicate without a transient, it's At without a transient, it's just always the two-cycle, and so that suggests you get a different kind of idea by thinking about transients. Here's one where one could argue whether or not we should call this a transient, but it emphasizes one idea is that in Dungeness Crab, that if you look at the dynamics of dungeness crab, and here we took Crab and here we took a very detailed model. I don't want to go through all the details in the model, but basically, it's a model that incorporates essentially everything that is relevant with two sexes and cannibalism and harvest of males that are big enough, and the fact that females have to be smaller than males to be inseminated and males. And males that are older than this all get a castrating parasite. So, that we can assume that any female older than this is either infertile or dead. And we harvest these males. And then we have these one-step-ahead lollipop-type predictions for eight different ports up and down the Pacific coast starting. The Pacific coast starting at Fort Bragg and heading up to southern Washington. And notice too that this is the catch, which we can think is, we estimate the harvest rate, which ends up being very, very high. It's like 80 or 90% of the allowable size class or age class. That these catches are wildly oscillating. These are log scales on the left of catches in thousands. Left of catches in thousands of kilograms. And the point would be that if you essentially do a stochastic simulation that you get long-term oscillations where you do the stochastic simulation using the best fit parameters, but without the stochasticity, they all basically go to a stable equilibrium except one that has a small amplitude oscillation. So we think. Oscillation. So we think of this as a transient. And finally, just briefly mention the spruce bugworm example, where we think of this as outbreaks. And again, the dots are data. The blue line is a simple model. And the data shows that you have this long period, which You have this long period, which we will call a transient, followed by an outbreak, followed presumably by another place where it's rare. And so ghost attractors, we've already heard about this week. We can get a ghost attractor in a two-species competition model where, and I'll mention and call it a quasi-potential because if you go to higher dimensions, suddenly the Higher dimensions, suddenly the notion of a potential runs into some problems. Karen Abbott, in some work with Ben Nulting, a former postdoc of hers, did some very nice work on quasi-potentials in ecology, a nice sort of summary of how to do that and how to make use of those ideas in a paper in ecology a couple of years ago. And the idea would be that the density of competitor one looks like. Competitor one looks like this. And then, if we change things so that we get change the dynamics a little bit, you get near an equilibrium, but then the species collapses and it moves very slowly near the ghost of the attractor. And I would submit that even in this deterministic setting, that what's outlined in the green in these two different cases would be viewed very similarly. Very similarly. If, in fact, you start off with a chaotic attractor, and this is a three-species food chain, and again, this is numerics. And on the left, we have the two different asymptotic outcomes for a particular chosen set of parameters. And this is the resource along this axis, intermediate level, the predator, the excuse me. The predator, the excuse me, the intermediate level, the consumer here, and the top level, the predator here. And we have two things. The predator can either, if you start off with too few predators, it goes extinct. If you start off with enough predators, it approaches the chaotic attractor. And with a small change in parameters, the only dynamic that you get is eventually asymptotically approaching a state where the predator is absent. A state where the predator is absent. And here, with the chaotic dynamics, I would point out that there is no way you're going to be able to tell the top from the bottom. And finally, not finally, but the next would be that you can approach close to a stable to a saddle, and we'll call this a Saddle, and we'll call this a crawl by. Then we can illustrate this dynamic in a phase plane with predator-prey. And we saw some of this yesterday as well, or the day before, with phase planes. And the predator and prey, if you have a small amplitude limit cycle, you don't have any transients. And then you can get different kinds of dynamics, so it does that. And this has a crawl by as you increase. Crawl by, as you increase, essentially move the predator isocline farther away from the hump, using the old language of Rosenzweig and MacArthur, it gets close to the saddles and you have a dynamic that looks like this, which is very similar to one that we saw yesterday. And here we could call this essentially evidence of a transient, or this the evidence of a transient. This is the evidence of a transient. If you observe the system here, you might think that it has reached its asymptotic behavior. This system, as illustrated in lots of work that was done by Sergio Rinaldi and also Martin Scaffer in a variety of papers, can exhibit multiple time scale dynamics. And here you get a different kind of dynamic where the solution reaches a case. Reaches a case where the prey is at very low levels, but the predator dynamic never gets that small. So you don't approach a saddle, but you still get this essentially two different kinds of dynamics through time. And again, this would very much could very much look like a transient, and you get this. We've already seen Seen stochasticity, another place that you can get transients, and this on the left is actually from a very old paper of mine where we looked at a model in space where we had local overcompensatory dynamics and an integral difference equation with dispersal just to nearby locations. And you get very, very long transients. This is a time scale. This is a time scale. Notice goes from 0 to 20,000. And when we do that, we can see that even for here, you get one kind of dynamic. This is the total population size. And after a fairly long time, you switch. And then here, you seem to have a very, very long dynamic. And it switches several times without any external changes. And for each type of transient that I've gone through here, Transients I've gone through here, we have in particular an empirical example. And for the ghosts that the forest fish, and so a ghost would be, there's no invariant set, it occurs after bifurcation. So in particular, one case where you would get a ghost would be. A ghost would be if you have a tipping point, a crawl by, if you have any saddle-type invariant set. And I did that in the case of having an equilibrium as, or fixed point as the saddle type. But the saddle could be, saddle, could be a chaotic saddle, it could be a fixed point, it could be a Fixed point, it could be a cycle, and this the three species food chain exhibits that as well as others. Slow-fast systems, there's no invariance set. Multiple time scales, and uni-vaulting insects can exhibit that particular kind of example. And the other place is that once you Other place is that once you increase dimension, then in particular, you get equilibrium or cycles or chaos. And that can happen in a variety of ways. And I showed dimension going up by adding space, but any real ecological community would be of very, very high dimension. And in particular, Stochasticity. And I want to point out that if there's an invariant set that's present, then you can generate a variety of dynamics. And if there is no invariant set, then you can generate also quasi-periodic cycles. And one of the aspects would be that a lot of what I've talked about here has been in the context of. In the context of or framed it a bit in the context of deterministic systems and one could argue that g stochasticity would always destroy the transients so that the deterministic aspects would be completely irrelevant. But in fact, stochasticity can either extend a transient, it can also It can also destroy a transient. And so, either example is, or either kind of behavior can occur. And that's something that we also are preparing, this group preparing a sort of try and summarize the current state of where things are. So, I seem to have gone much faster than I thought. So, I'm going to go through three examples. So I'm going to go through three examples and maybe it won't be quite as brief as I said and I probably will leave lots of time for questions. So the first is a coral algal grazer system. And at the context of a single reef, we can write down and think about dynamic And think about dynamics is quite simple. That a desirable system would be one that's dominated by corals, and an undesirable system is one that's dominated by macroalgae. And what prevents the system from turning into one dominated by macroalgae is the presence of grazers, which play a big role. Play a big role. So the various transitions possible, and this is a mean field model. We've seen that kind of thing already, where, excuse me, where at the level of a single patch or single reef patch, that corals can be overtopped by macroalgae. That's a blue arrow. Turf can be overtoped by a maximum. Turf can be overgrown by macroalgae, so low-growing algae essentially. Turf can be settled upon by corals. Corals can be settled near essentially by turf. And the way we've done this, there have been, this was first done in a paper with Pete Mumby and Helen Edwards back in 2007. 2007, and since then, we've done a lot more work on this. Some of it with Julie Blackwood, who is in this workshop this week, that if you did not have anything besides the blue arrows, there'd be transitions back and forth between the turf and the corals, or the corals and the turf. Some of this would be the idea that just Would be the idea that disturbances can remove corals or can remove turf, and we assume they immediately are then turned into either macroalgae or either turf or corals would settle there. And if you had this kind of dynamic, everything would end up as macroalgae and you'd end up in the undesirable state. And the only thing that prevents that is the presence of grazers. Grazers, which play a big role in turning macroalgae back into turf or keeping macroalgae from taking over turf. And then we can have a system where you can have healthy reef. And using some of the ideas about transient dynamics and some work with Carlo Haock, who's a postdoc with Pete Mumby and Pete. With Pete Mumby and Pete, who's since moved from Exeter to Australia, and so now is focusing on the Great Barrier Reef, that we can think about disturbances, and we can follow the dynamics of the coral algal grazer system, which has dynamics very similar to a A system that is, or the dynamics and equations are quite similar to the system describing the transitions between a eutrophic and a ligotrophic lake, and also between systems of among grassland savannah systems as well. That we can have a system with low coral cover and the And the stochasticity and transience mean that you may not recognize that the system will eventually recover and you may think that management is necessary. You can think that you can be trapped in a level of low coral cover if there's not much coral recruitment. And then you can have a system. You can have a system where, if you follow the system and then there's suddenly a way to get, or there is a way to get more coral, it will then approach a healthy reef again. And some of this is very appropriate for thinking about issues with how to manage and know what states rare systems in the Great Barrier Reef are in, where there are a variety of disturbances. Where there are a variety of disturbances ranging from things like typhoons to crown of thorn starfish to bleaching to warming. A second system, and this one was looked at in the paper that Tessa Francis mentioned earlier, that I mentioned earlier, is that the Is that the lake eutrophication? That again, we could think about this: that as I think we've already seen, that that's a system where as a function of the phosphorus input into it, you can change between a system where you essentially are oligotrophic to one where you're eutrophic. Again, the desirable to the The desirable to the undesirable. And if you change and reduce the input, that this is something which is some of the language around tipping points suggests that once a system has left a regime, once the parameters are changed so that there's no longer a stable equilibrium where the system would be in an undesirable state, it will quickly return to the desirable state. It will quickly return to the desirable state, but that's not true. The dynamics are very slow here because the dynamics, the rate of change is zero at this point, and just a little ways away, the rate of change is still very small. And so management to achieve the desirable state, you have to change not only the input, but then you may need to do something which would change the state of the system. And this is in a stochastic sense, excuse me, various. Sense, excuse me, various realizations of the model that would achieve that. And in the next slide, we can see this viewed in a different way where we don't do any management, where we do a small change in the parameter, maybe a small change in the Input of phosphorus versus a large change in the input of phosphorus versus a small change in the state versus the various aspects. And then what we can do is see, in fact, that it may pay and it emphasizes that it pays to do both to push things across to the desirable state. And to think about the idea that transients play a big role in thinking about this. In thinking about this, we also then focused on something which is somewhat similar to, and this is from a model, and again, I'd rather give the equations that describe the kinds of outcomes. And that here, this is a model that had been developed by Steve Carpenter to look at a system where. At a system where we have a lake where we've got harvest of fish, which essentially in this case would be recreational. There's predation on smaller fish. There's survival to the bigger fish, recruitment to the smaller fish. That woody debris accumulation helps the small fish survive. Development does various things. Does various things. And if, in fact, we have the estimate of the stock of the fish, what we don't want is this boom bust, but we'd like to try and manage the system to sit at essentially a transient. And you want to avoid what's a slow-fast type of transient. Type of transient. And you have to do an adaptive management to avoid the slow-fast kind of transient to stay in the desirable state. And I want to finish up with a couple of things. One is one way of sort of thinking about the way to do this from the standpoint of models. Point of models and empirical aspects. And the other is, I'm going to put up a list of references. I'm going to use that as a way to emphasize one more system that I want to at least briefly mention. And one is that basically we want to do models that we do them on appropriate time scales, emphasizing transient. Time scales emphasizing transients. And that's what we've been doing very much essentially every model in this workshop, or a lot of them have focused on that. But a lot of times there's an emphasis on long-term behavior. We want to include external influences in models. And this then suggests something which is another area that the mathematics is catching up, which is in the analysis. Which is in the analysis and thinking about non-autonomous systems, where even linear non-autonomous systems are difficult to analyze, and non-linear non-autonomous systems are very, very difficult to analyze. And from the standpoint of thinking about more empirical approaches, we would want to use time series analyses to Time series analyses to think about things. You'd want to make sure we observe on appropriate time scales and to the extent possible, obviously think about how external conditions are changing. And we can have changes on a variety of different time scales. And in terms of the time scales and transients, in some sense, ecological systems have various time scales, and socio-ecological systems, as I am. Also, ecological systems, as I emphasized, have a variety of other time scales. And I'll put up a list of references. I want to use that as a way to emphasize a couple of one set of ideas here, which is that I've talked mainly about non-linear aspects of transient dynamics, but even the linear Dynamics, but even the linear aspects of transient dynamics are really, really important and very vital for us to think about when thinking about some socio-ecological systems. And in particular, they show up very much. And the one I have the pointer to and the last one are examples of this. They show up very much with what's in some sense a very With what's in some sense a very large natural experiment, or maybe natural experiment is the wrong word, that throughout the world, and in particular in California, there have been established marine protected areas. In California, these were established in response to the Marine Life Protection Act passed on the order of 10 years ago. And this is a case where this was science-based, the establishment of these based on. The establishment of these based on a lot of models. And now that they're there, that politically, after five or ten years, people want to know, has this set-aside, which has had impacts in a variety of ways, had a positive effect, and one can look at both within a marine protected area or Protected area or outside a marine protected area where you'd be looking at the fisheries yield. And even the very simplest aspect of looking at the impact here can be done on a single species context where we use eight structured models. And we use the idea that the eight structured models are important because the first thing that happens when you turn off fishing. Turn off fishing is that you get larger, older individuals are entering or are now able to survive, which then show up. And one can look at questions and say, as a function of how much fishing there was and on function of the natural life history of the species, for example, which species you should monitor to see if there has been an effect based on. Based on the degree to which they respond, how soon they respond and how much they respond. And then one can ask how that affects fisheries yield outside the marine protected area, which again is something that can be studied even with a linear model. And just understanding the fact that the response is not immediate is a way to begin to look at things. To begin to look at things. So I'll stop there. I want to thank everybody again for their attention, and I'm sure I've left plenty of time for questions. Thank you very much. That was a most interesting talk. And we have quite a lot of questions in the chat box. We have about five minutes for questions. So, should we go in the order they were put into the chat box? Put into the chat box. So, Lou, do you want to start with your question, please? Sure. Thanks, Pauline. Alan, you didn't mention the fact that you're doing a AAAS session on this topic in a couple of weeks. People might want to join in that if they're interested. Yeah, and thank you to Nimbus for that. And make sure you put it on your report. It's there. So just let me just say, let me just quickly say that in theory, there's in theory there's the talks are pre-recorded and then during AAAS you actually have a live thing but the pre-recorded talks should be already available for that cool cool yeah okay so yeah so back towards the beginning this is a question about policy and management and the time scale issues so you had the sort of circular diagram of the processes of planning monitoring et cetera back at the very beginning have you have you come up with an effective way Come up with an effective way to get across the ideas to particularly policymakers in terms of allocation of effort associated with changing the time scale at which some of those things happen. Because you mentioned Steve Carpenter's work on boom-bust cycles and what you'd like to do there. Have you come up with an effective way of basically convincing those who actually have some control? Actually, have some control over policy and management decisions that the time scales really matter. I can think of several ways to do that in that kind of a diagram, either as a movie or by changing the lengths of them so that the really long time scale ones are longer. But have you come up with any way to do that effectively? I'm not sure we've come up with a way to do it effectively. I mean, the answer would be maybe for the very simple linear fish marine systems that I mentioned. Systems that I mentioned that we do have this idea of emphasizing focus on those species which show the fastest response. Because if you have something like a Boccaccio, which has a lifespan of forever, it's going to take a long time to show a response that's not what you should look at. And then you've got to look at something which is relatively heavily fished before you put it in the protected area. So it will show a big response as well. And so there, at least, we can. There, at least we can have provided. We were actually got money from California Fish and Game to do this through Sea Grant to actually develop a monitoring plan, but then they didn't make as much use of our information that they even paid for as one would have hoped. Yeah, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. So let's move then to the next question. Oh, this is Ho. Next question. Oh, this is how you were going to tell us about a case study that you developed. Thanks, Pauline. Thanks, Aden, Alan, for the great talk. I just want to make a comment. We recently worked on a case study on the phytoplankton and zooplankton, which also mentioned in your talk as examples. And we try to show the possibility of the transitions between different tractors, how that can occur on some noise. And I think we have. And I think we have, of course, it's hard to like describe when it can occur. So it's kind of constantly switch between different chapters if you have the constant noise given, the environmental noise given there. And it seems like the species can stay at one chapter for up to a long time, then it will switch to another one. So maybe I don't know how to describe that, the lens or even the marks question, the length for the time length for the transition. That's kind of even harder. Transition? That's kind of even a harder question, I think. Here we try to describe when, under what kind of conditions this kind of transition can occur, can possibly occur between different chapters. So the one case where I know you can, there are reasonable results on sort of expected time to move away from an attractor, for example, would be if you have a case where a chaotic attractor has changed to a chaotic sack. Has changed to a chaotic saddle. There are results on the time scales of that. Some of those were developed by Gravogi and by Ying Cheng Lai. But the stochastic one, I think it's very interesting. And I suspect that, you know, when you mention that, it strikes me that some of those ideas have to be somewhat similar to sort of some of the ideas developed in genetic. Population genetics literature by people like John Gillespie and others about the time, expected time scale for mutants to make it through. Whereas sometimes a mutant comes in and even if it's favored, it would be eliminated. And even if it's not favored, it might reach very high levels. And again, I think they have results on that. And that's a very interesting suggestion, Hal. That's great. So they can describe the scale of the challenge, like when it Scale of the transition, like when it can change it. Yeah. After, well, that's great. Can I get that paper maybe later? After the talk, yeah. Yeah. Maybe you can put it to the path, Avon. Can you? Well, I mean, this is a whole huge bottle of lots. So I don't like to cut off the discussion, but in order to keep to the schedule, could we have about a four minute break and then come back for the next talk by Chris Spokes? Talk by Chris Spoke, and we'll take up the questions again in the discussion period later on this afternoon for most of us. Thank you, Alan. Thank you. Hey, Chris, are you there? Chris Bau, you mean? Oh, yes. Yes, I meant Chris Bau. Sorry. I can go get him. Oh, I mean, just so that he could try and share his screen just to make sure that the technology works. I'm sure it'll be fine. He's done a million Zooms. I'm pretty sure about that too, yes.
