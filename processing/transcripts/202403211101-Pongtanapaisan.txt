about knotting and linking in confined space, particularly in nano channels in two regions. So here's a way to build random knot. So you look at a point in exterior lattice 3-space and you just flop backward, forward, probably up, down. Maybe you come back to yourself and you get a circle. So it's natural to ask a question like, you know, if someone hands you a knot, how likely is it to be knotted? How likely is it to be matted? So you've probably listened to music before, and you're polite people. So if you're on the plane, maybe you take out your headphones and probably it'll be tangled. So this conjecture is quite natural. So Frisch Washman Philbroot conjectured that sufficiently long pre-polymers are knotted with high probability. And it was first proved in lattice model. First, proved in the lattice model by Sumners and Whittington, and independently by Dippinger. So, subsequently, there were proofs for other models as well, like the grid diagram model by Chris L'Aurel and other people, and the pedal model by Joel Haas and his co-authors. So, in a lot of these models, there are some questions that they cannot answer, but you'll see. Answer, but you'll see that some of those questions can be answered if you look at it in a tube setting. Okay, so yeah, I want to advertise that studying not to links in tubes are interesting. So Chris and her co-authors, and Di and some other authors, showed that studying polymers under confinement it's really good to look at it as links in tubes because polygons and tubes are on the same order as the polymer's length. Order as the polymer's length, and so it's comparable to channel sizes via experiments. So it's a picture of ring, polymer, channel. So when I'm talking about two, right, so you have my x, y, z coordinate, right, and I can let the x length be as long as I want, but then I restrict the z height and the y length to be finite. So in this case, the z is 3 and the y is 1, so it's 1.32. Y is 1, so it's 1.32. As mentioned, so the question suggests the exponential growth constant. You know, is the exponential growth rate of trefoil the same as the exponential growth rate of the Leonod? So that is not known in the non-constrained setting. But if you look at the tube setting, then Nick Beden, Kai, and Chris and Jeremy, Mario, Koya, they prove that the experiential. So the experimental growth rate is the same for Chi-Fo and the M0. So an important ingredient in the proof of the theorems in this paper is the characterization of what knots and links fit in a tube of a certain size. So, yeah, you can ask a natural question. If I have a 2x12, so it's like this. One tube, right? So it's like this skinny long tube. Does every link fit in it? So I already said that their proofs rely a lot on the characterization of which links fit into my ones, so probably not all links. So if you're not going to find it, you can put any link in the lattice, but that's in the skinny tube. So this paper by Hawir and Tai, other people, so they characterize precisely what it means to fit in an N by M tube. So it depends on a certain complexity. So, it depends on a certain complexity, which measures how wide the knot or a link is. Okay. So, if you want to see if you're not a link fit in a tube, you can use Rob's software. So, yesterday he tried to do a test to find the minimum step number for unconstrained setting, right? But you can also, there's also a tube setting. And so, for example, this is half-link, and there's a representation in 2x1, but sometimes, you know. One, but sometimes, you know, what if maybe you don't know beforehand that your link fits or not, right? Then maybe you have to wait for a long time, you get really old. So maybe it's helpful to know, okay, I know beforehand this link spits in it three by one. So I know that I wait a little bit, but there's hope, right? So that's the hope for today to give you some techniques to decide if your link spit before you try what routes software. Okay. So, like I said, right, so. So, like I said, right, so this is already proved by Javier and several others. Fitting in a tube is determined by some complexity that measures the width of the knot. So, right, it is natural. If the knot is really wide, then you need quite large tube to fit the knot. But what do I mean by wide? So, I want to, someone gives you a picture of a knot, right? Just draw horizontal lines. And so, if you draw the line a little bit too. And so, if you draw the line a little bit too far to the left, right, then you don't intersect the not so much, maybe two points. So, you only consider transverse intersection. So, no tangency. So, if you look at the spot where they intersect the most number of points, so you get eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So it's kind of wide, right? Compared to the one on the right, right, if you look for the widest spot, right, it's intersecting four points. So, this is a little bit. Intersection four points. So this is a little bit wider than this, right? But maybe I wasn't really making sense because knot theory is not just about one picture. So you can deform your knots in many ways, so that becomes a hard problem to determine if your knots or lengths are wide or not. For example, this is the unknot, the most trivial knot you can have. So obviously you can have a width of 2, 1, 2. But you can do some silly move like But you can do some silly move like wiggling, so then you can have a lot of width, right? So, actually, to define width maybe more precisely, you come to some deformation. So, this knot remarkably, so you can show that no matter how you deform it, you cannot reduce this width. So, no matter what picture you see of this type, eight is the least. Uh eight is the the least, so it's pretty wide. Um so you can use uh their characterization to say that it doesn't fit in three by one two. So not two by one either. So we want to come somehow try to estimate this width, right? So the term max width was given by Lackenby. Ozawa studied Ozawa studied the same quantity, but he called it trunk. So there's a few terminologies for this complexity. Okay. So yeah, we've established that fitting a link in a tube is measuring how wide your knot is, right? But then how do you calculate it? It's hard because maybe you can do a lot of deformation and you don't know if you can reduce from eight to six. To six. So, yeah, so maybe you need a good lower bound, right? So, there are some lower bounds in literature called representativity. That's kind of also hard to compute. So, today I'm not giving you a good lower bound, but maybe a better upper bound technique. Okay, so using our technique, we can show that it's six. But maybe it's not so hard to see from this picture. Right, so our technique, so this is just So our technique, so this is joined with a collaborator from Arizona State, Han Kuo, and Rippy Lee from Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara. And we come up with some coloring game that if you succeed, then you'll fit in 3x12, something like that. So, but before I tell you the rules, let me make some observation. So, looking at the width of knots, it's actually kind of related to the ordering. Actually, kind of related to the ordering of maxima and minima. So maybe when you teach your student about maxima and minima, you look at the height function vertically. But the convention for people that study knots and links in tube is that the tube goes horizontally, so you have to tilt your head. So local means maybe like these C-shapes things. So you can maybe convince yourself that any knots and links can And links could be made up of some of these local mins and maybe some braiding, right? So these strings don't backtrack. So only go one direction and maybe some max. So any nuts and links are made up of these pieces. Okay. So if you look at how a link is positioned, right? So if you're not So if you're not, if you don't care so much about being thin, then you can always just put the maximum for the minima, or minimum for the maximum, right? So here's a minimum, and it adds two intersection points, right? So at this point, there's one more minimum, so it becomes four. So each local minimum contributes two more, right? And so if you're like sort of, so in this particular configuration, the minimum Particular configuration, the minimum, right? The free minimum minima comes before the free maxima. So it's like you're monotonically increasing complexity. So it's kind of like maybe not an efficient way to do it. But for some spatial cases, maybe you can be successful in putting a maximum before minimum. So here it's the same linked height, but I just move it a little bit so then it shows a thinner position. Thinner position. So here's right, so the minima, but then right, you have a maximum before. So the thing is a little bit thinner. So yeah, so when you can do this, it's really nice, you can fit in a smaller tube. But yeah, so that's what our game will do. Okay, so our theorem has more cases, right, applicable for more. More cases, right? Applicable for more cases, but for demonstration, I'll just do the case where you get four minima. So, right, so there are two ways, right? Now, so you have to assume like prime don't split. So, if you take it from the table, it will be prime non-split. So, case one is look at the non-efficient way, right? So, all the maximum, all the minima come first before maxima, but the better way is you have minimums a max form. A max form. So we want to try to see if we can extract this ordering from a coloring. Okay. So here's the rule. You start with, right, someone gives you a link, right? You start with three colors, red, blue, green, on three strands, right? And then I want to extend the coloring through the whole diagram with only this move. So if the move is, the move is, the over strand is colored. The over strand is colored, the incoming is colored. The move is extending the incoming colors to the outgoing. So, in each stage, you have one more strand that makes color. So, we show that this coloring gain corresponds to a new embedding of a link with the ordering of maxima and minima in a certain way. So, this three original strands corresponding to embeddings of three minima. Of three minima, right? And then you keep going. So you want to, again, the rule is you want to extend to the whole diagram using this move. So there are many choices that you can start. Maybe this is a good choice. The over is colored. You don't really care what the over color is, but you care about the incoming. So the incoming is blue. I want to extend the outgoing to blue. There we go. The next one, right? So over is colored, incoming is red. Outgoing should be red. There we go. And here, over is colored, incoming is colored. Here, over is colored, and coming is red, so it should be red. So you keep going, right? And at a certain stage, you see something special. So when you're just doing the coloring moves, you can show that in the corresponding embedding, you're not creating any new maximum or minima. It's just going to be braids. Yeah, so that's the nature of the coloring move. So so yeah, this four move in in the embedding that you can construct, right, just it's just gonna be three minima at some frame. Minimum at some frame. But then at a certain spot, there'll be a really special crossing. So, what's special about this one? So, the coloring move kind of tells you that a lot of crossings would have this property, but the two sides of the crossing has the same color, right? Because extension. But at a certain spot, you have this kind of thing where the over is colored, but the two sides are different colors. So, that doesn't happen a lot. And if somehow you can play the game. And if somehow you can play the game so that this special process appears before you add another color, then you have the thin decomposition. So at the moment, you can extend some more. So again, extending with the color move, it's just braid. But now if you look, you cannot color anymore. So now you have to add one more color. So that one more new color purple is the maximum. So the takeaway is there's some The takeaway is there's some game that you can play, corresponds to some new embedding of the link. And sometimes it gives you a better upper band than just the slicing method that we can use. So maybe you're thinking this is really complicated, right? The slicing is a bit better, but to the computer, they understand this method better. Because each strand is just a sequence of crossings. Maybe if you number them one, two, or something, this would be like one minus two. So just have some sequence of numbers. So, just have some sequence of numbers. So, this coloring extension is really not compatible with the computer. All right, so yeah, so maybe more demonstration. The beginning goes the highest. So, the ordering that the colouring appears, so you embed in decreasing height, right? So, in the beginning stage, So, in the beginning stage, you get a bunch of disconnected strands, right? Then our method shows how to connect them. So, this coloring method was not originally by us, it was by Ryan Blonde's co-authors, but we kept track of the ordering of this special crossing to get the width down. Okay, so that's how you maybe get a better estimate of how wide your link is. So, width can also help you prove something about statistics. So, this is my work with Chris and Is my work with Chris and Rob and Jeremy Yang. So, right, we saw that many people proved that the unknot is exponentially rare among all knots, right? So, you can ask the same thing about links, maybe multiple components, right? So, you have to say some assumptions to make the probability problem more well-defined. So, for example, you require that the x-coordinate, right, X coordinate of the component started in the same number. The X coordinate on the far right of one component is equal to the exponent of the other component. Anyway, so you have links in tubes, right? And you want to ask questions like are most links linked, not trivially. So this, Chris and Stu, Ernst and Mashid proved the statement for large enough. The statement for large enough tubes using this idea of persistent tangle. So, this is terminology that we use in films papers. So, this is a tango, so it's like a picture, a pattern, right? So, that once you see this inside your link, so outside it can be really complicated things that you don't understand. But once you see this in the middle, it's automatically the whole thing is linked. So, if they can show that if someone gives them systems. If someone gives them a system of polygons and has enough occurrences of this type of tango, so surely it'll be linked, right? And so there'll be exponentially more linked ones. Yeah, so split links are exponentially rare among links with two monotonics each spanning large enough tubes. So I say large enough, right, because large enough means three by one or bigger. So their paper didn't cover the case of two by one, right? And it turns out that. And it turns out that that is too wide to fit in a two by one. So, yeah, so we have to use, right? If you want to show that the unlink is exponentially rare, then use a different technique. So, then maybe you're asking, okay, this pattern doesn't work. Aren't there other persistent tangles that you can use to guarantee that if you just see that, and I don't care on the outside, that it's linked? And the answer is no, because the tube is so small. Because the tube is so small, that any pattern that you think could be persistent, that you can just cancel it out. So, for example, yeah. So, this pattern fits in an unlinked, so there's nothing that guarantees linking. So, we have to use a different technique. Yeah, so instead of showing that system of polygon has many occurrences of persistent tangles, So you focus on classes of unlinked polygons, and you show that it has many occurrences, order of epsilon of this really nice pattern, right? So there's a lot of them. And so you come up with some pattern that changes the link number. So this one decreases the link number. So you have two of them. So there's at least two to the epsilon n ways to change the link number. So it's exponential. The linked temperatures, but it's exponentially more linked ones. So that's how the proof goes for the 2x1 tube. Okay, so in Jeremy Eng's thesis, he also has a question in experimental data about comparing links with linking number 0 and unlinks. So unlink has linking number 0, but there are links out there that are non-trivial but has 0 as well. So you can consider if unlinks are random. If unlinks are rare among linguums zero, and if they are, and the proof will be, right, since we know that this pattern theorem exists, right, so there's many spots for me to insert things. So, but then you just pick the pattern that does the right job, right? So, this doesn't change the linking number, but it changes some other variant. So, you need two instances of this, but if you can complete that, we'll be fine. All right, so I think that's. All right, so I think that's my time, and I'll end there. And so, I usually like to end with the thank you slide with some questions. So, in the paper that Marielle and Chris wrote, they're co-authors, they showed experimental growth constants in independent blink type. So, in my paper with Chris as well, but so it's only for 2x12, right? And because the things that fit in there are so nice, but for larger tubes, maybe 3x1 or something. For larger tubes, maybe 3x1 or something, you can have kind of interesting behavior. For example, you have some unlink. So maybe you can show this unlink, where you can put this black loop, you can kind of pull that tongue over. So it's unlink. But once you concatenate, you get non-trivial link. So concatenation is really important argument in equating the expansion of growth constant. But it won't work for these large hit tubes. So if you have any ideas, let us know. So, if you have any ideas, let us know. Thank you. Is there a relationship between the size of the determinant?
