uh so i hope people can hear me well good also people on the online i assume that can hear me well yes we can hear you thank you okay so uh so i'd like to uh thank first i'd like to thank the organizers for this uh very nice uh invitation and for organizing this uh nice workshop on pattern formation i think it mentioned it even in the title which is not obvious these days Title, which is not obvious these days. And yes, so I'd like also to, I'm happy to start this meeting with this talk. And this is about, as Ivo mentioned, about the collapse of viscous bubbles. And my interest in this problem started almost exactly two years ago in August 2020, the first summer of the pandemic, when this Pandemic, when this beautiful paper, the cover of Science Week, appeared online. It was unfortunately not my experiment, where I don't do any experiments, but definitely not such a beautiful one, which I'm going to tell you about soon. And then the talk is not going to be about, it's going to be about the theory that basically occupied myself and my very Very talented, really extremely talented guy, Avraham Klein, who is mainly a hard-condensed matter physicist. And that's what we have been doing in the last couple of years mostly. So what is the problem? The problem starts with a I cannot move. Oh, sorry, because it's not on your laptop. It is on my laptop. Okay, I think it's okay. Okay, I think it's okay. So, so it started with this experiment by JC Bird from BU, who started it actually almost 20 years ago when he was a student in Howard Stone's lab back in Harvard. And now he is, I believe, a full professor already at BU. And his students, Alex Soratis. And the origin of this, the first phenomenon that I'm going to tell you about here, that they basically repeated. That they basically repeated and studied in more detail was done by De Bruja and the company, and I think Brochard and DeGen in 1998, and will follow that by Imahadevan. And this is about the collapse of viscous bubbles. So what you see here is a very, very viscous bubble. It's viscous, okay? So it's silicon oil, but it's very, very viscous. If anybody knows what silicon oil is, it's something that you touch and it appears to you like a solid because it's so viscous, you can barely move it. Because you can barely move it, and that's what you have. So, you have this bubble of silicon oil which is floating on top of a bus of silicon oil. It comes to the surface, and as you know, there is a pressure inside that hold the bubble, that's what we call the Laplace pressure. And then eventually, the bubble can sit there for a pretty long time. If it's a water bubble, it will stay very short time, but if it's very viscous, it can stay very, very long time, many hours. And it drains gradually over time. Gradually over time, but at some point a hole is going to be popped somewhere in the film, and then the pressure escapes and the bubble collapses. And what you are going to see now is how this happens. So this is a movie, which is, if it slows down, it's silicon oil and it still slows down. And that's basically what you see. You see some kind of very beautiful instability that occurs after the bubble, as the bubble collapses. Okay? Okay, so that's the movie. And the story is there is something weird about this movie. I don't know if you noticed it, but I'm going to emphasize it. What was the weird thing, Alan? That's one thing, but what was the other thing? Okay, you will see in a second. So here is now a summary of what you see here. You have a bubble, you start with an incident market. You start with a. Is there a marker, a pointer that I can use? Yeah. Oh, perfect. Thank you. So you start on the left side with the Laplace pressure in the bubble. I call it delta P, it's larger than the ambient pressure. As the pressure collapses, as the pressure drops, the bubble starts to flatten. And then you see the wrinkles. And that's basically what you see. Now, what Now, this was observed, this observation was made back in 1998, most of it. And what JC did, and then the paper, I should say, then the work of Mahadevan and the Silvera tried to do some theory of this, and they argue that there is some expansion of the hole, some kind of interaction between the expansion of the hole and the gravity field that explains the wrinkles, wavelengths, etc. And what JC did was. And what JC did was two very, very beautiful things. JC did not believe that gravity has anything to do with this. So the first thing that he did was to show that you can do the same thing without gravity. Namely, he just slipped the whole setup upside down or he put it sideways and basically you see the same thing. Okay. So basically it means that gravity has no effect, essentially, or marginal effect. And even the more amazing thing that he showed, that he did, was to show that the hole has no effect. Was to show that the hole is no effect, and that was the weird thing in the movie that I showed you. There was no hole there. So, what he did was to come to build this setup. He came with a tube all the way down through the bus and sucked the air quickly from the bubble without touching the film itself. And essentially, you see the same thing. And then, this was a big what we learned from this experiment is that. Is that there is some kind of novel even the radius of the unwrinkled bit to the size of the wrinkle bit, that doesn't depend upon how fast you circuit? Well, they don't have a detailed data on this, but that's what it appears to be. Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to explain to that's exactly the point of part of the thing that I want to explain to you. So what I would like to say. So what I would like to say that this experimental observation indicates that there is something pretty fundamental in this phenomenon that we need to understand, which I would call it an interaction between or interplay between viscous hydrodynamics and interfacial thermodynamics, which is basically surface tension. And if you read these papers, and as we often do in pattern formation theory, you see such a pattern, and the first thing that comes to your mind naturally is, oh, what's the... Your mind naturally is, oh, what's the wavelengths? And there must be some scaling rule: the thickness of the film, the inertia, the disk, the viscosity, et cetera, et cetera. But often, and I think I had some discussion about it with Stephen the other day when we had to spend 24 hours here with many, the question is, what is the base flow in the language of pattern formation that gives rise to instability? Why? There is an axial symmetry in this problem. The bubble is, right? I mean, it's high hemisphere. I mean, it's high hemisphere, it's perfectly symmetric, axial symmetry, and this instability breaks this symmetry. What is the base flow? Why should the instability be broken? Why should this symmetry be broken at all? What is the base flow? And this question is barely discussed in the literature, and that's what I would like to focus my talk on. Yes? Okay, very good question. I'll try to address it quickly. In the experiment, it is not because the way you prepare it. Is not because the way you prepare it, you have to bring the air bubble from below, and there is lots of lubrication that happens as it comes out, and it's very non-uniform. And part of the hand-raising arguments in the papers that you can read before is that this non-iform sickness underlies the instability. What I would like to show you in this talk is that assume, if you were the spherical horse assumption, that there is a uniform thickness of the film. I can suggest. I can suggest you experimental protocol to do this. My point, you are going to see almost exactly the same thing. Okay? So it's kind of a red herring, this non-uniform thickness that you see here. That's my point. Annie, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we wonder if you might be kind enough to repeat some of the questions you're getting for the Zoom audience. Oh, thank you. Al Shad Kudroli, here, we should remember to use the microphone here. Al-Shad asked whether the thickness of The thickness of the film is uniform, and I answer that in the experiment it is extremely non-uniform due to the preparation of the bubble. That I believe it's not so important here. Nevertheless, I would like to argue, and that's a significant part of the talk, that this is kind of a red herring. And if you assumed, like, and there are also experimental protocols to do this, if you assume some, if you start with the uniform thickness of the film, you are going to see, and you depressurize it, you are going to see more or less the same thing. It you are going to see more or less the same thing, okay? Okay, so to understand the base flow, I would like to start with a quick review of what is hydrodynamics. I guess I don't have to say, to tell people here what is hydrodynamics, but let me try to do it quickly. Anyhow, hydrodynamics is a macroscopic flow characterized in the bulk by local thermodynamics, I mean equation of state satisfied locally, and conservation laws. And conservation laws. Okay, that's from a textbook, probably the first chapter of, for instance, Ladar in Leafsheets on Fluid Mechanics. Now, the first realization of this, even before he knew about thermodynamics and probably he knew only about conservation law, was by Euler, who sought to conserve what? What is what we know is conserved? What is being conserved is energy, momentum, and mass. And this is the essence of Euler equations for ideal flow. Then came Then there came more or less 50 years later, or 60 years later, roughly, separately Navi and stocks, and basically they killed the energy. They didn't want actually to kill the conservation of energy. What they wanted was to allow diffusive momentum, a diffusive transport of momentum. So it's still conserved, but it can diffuse. That's the essence of viscosity. You can think about it as diffusion constant for momentum. And along the way, maybe they did realize it, maybe not, they killed the energy, you realize it energy. kill the energy you realize that energy is not conserved so this is navier and stock and then so and then came along uh soon after uh poset and other people probably stocks himself and others and realized that in many applications specifically relevant for engineering purposes the boundary conditions you have flowing some channels and the boundary conditions implies that momentum is not conserved anymore momentum is being Momentum is not conserved anymore. Momentum is being dissipated from the boundaries. That's the essence of the shear flow in your boundaries. So basically, you kill momentum conservation, and you left only with mass conservation. And quite long time afterwards, came Trouton, probably I should give credit also for Lord Reni for this, who actually said, no, no, there are situations in which momentum can be remained conserved, this tangential momentum. And this is what happens when you have. And this is what happens when you have the two surfaces are all free. Okay, so you have a film in which the two surfaces are free, and that's what you get is something that is quite different from the parabolic shape of a conserved flow. It's actually what people call plug flow. There is slight variation of the velocity field across the signals, but it's really tiny. And that's in this case, momentum is still conserved. What does it mean? It means that if you look at the momentum density, the momentum density is proportional. The momentum density is proportional to a gradient of some tensorial field, exactly as in the original formulation of Euler and Navier and Stokes. Okay? So what Rauton did was actually something like this. He actually was interested to understand what happens when you have films or jets in which the thickness varies, it's small thickness, and the thickness varies on a very large scale compared to the thickness itself and the velocity field that you can basically write. That you can basically write your full Navier-Stokes equation. You can combine them into a coupled set of equations for the thickness and the tangential velocity. So he had in mind mostly planar, or not planar, sorry, as a straight midline or straight mid surface and oscillations or fluctuations of the partial variations of the thickness. And then maybe in the 50 or 60 years later came Taylor, and then came a very famous. And then came a very famous paper by followed up by Blackmostern, Ackman, and Ting, who basically said, oh, you can basically think of, you can also imagine that the mid-surface or the midline, if it's a jet, is also not flat. It also varies on a long scale. And now you have also the mid-surface itself, which they denote by this coordinate x. And this is called, they show that it's actually very, there is an interesting analogy between this and Euler elastica not to. This and Euler elastica, not to be confused with the Euler equation for fluid. So, this is what they call the Vicida, okay, when there is no inertia. And there were many works followed up. And I'm not going to give credit to all of these works, but people like Stephen here works on this. I know that people on the audience, on the virtual audience, like Basilo Duli, probably, and other people also worked on these things. I assume also that Camille has some works on this. Camille has some works on this. Okay, so there are many, many applications of this I'm not going to mention, but I'm going to mention one important development which is barely noted, I think, in the literature, which was by Peter Howell from Oxford in 1996. And it was the end of his PhD, the paper that summarized his PhD. And he was, to my knowledge, he was the first one, the first to come with a generalization of these Taylor ideas for a film. Okay, so now you don't have just the planar variation. Don't have just the planar variation of a jet or jet or a planar variation of a film along one direction, but you can have Gaussian curvature. You can really have a curved surface with some thickness. And he showed that there is a very nice similarity between the equation of motion of this problem and the Fockel van-Karman equations of elastic sheet. It's not a full analogy that I'm going to highlight later on, but there is a very strong similarity. Okay. Okay, and essentially, this what you see in this slide provides you a framework to realize, at least intuitively, that what we should the origin of this instability that we see here should be with some compression. Exactly as you will have elastic sheet, that if you put it under compression, it will buckle and sometimes it will wrinkle, depend on the conditions that balance this instability. So, it should be the case also with viscous steel. Okay, so there should be some compression here in the There should be some compression here in the fluid film that generates this instability. But the question is: where does compression come from? Why should the film be subjected to compression as it's being depressurized, as the pressure within it falls rapidly? Okay. I don't know if somebody follows the chat. I try not to follow because it will confuse me and distract me too much. But if I'm happy to take it, I'll let you know, Benny. There's no question so far. Okay, so he is English, Charles. Thank you. So far, okay, so yes, initial charge, thank you. Okay, so so, so this will be the outline now of the talk. So, so I'm already 15 minutes in, so this was part of the introduction, but I'm going to continue now this introduction. And I'm going to give you the answer to this question, where the compression comes from and why do we see wrinkles in a nutshell with very, very few equations. And then I'm going to follow up. So, for this part, I will not mention Peter Howell's equations, but later on. But later on, I will bring them in, I'll show you in more detail what's really going on. Okay, but yeah, so what is the origin of stress? So, let me now elaborate on the connection between hydrodynamics, between viscous stress and elastic stress. So, let's think about an elastic system. You can think of this green stuff maybe as a shell, if you wish, and it's let's say being pressurized. Again, you have the larger pressure inside than outside. Than outside, then you have some displacement from the original location, and this displacement generates some gradients, and there is some sickness. And in this case, the strain, which is the gradient of the displacement field of how much material is destroyed from its original stress reconfiguration is what we call stress, and the proportionality constant is what we call the young modulus E. And if we have a sickness, we call it stretching modulus E times H. And that's the stress. Of course, the stress. And that's the stress. Of course, the stress is a tensor, not a scalar, but here I'm doing it for the purposes of the introduction. I omit distance voreal notation. Now, suppose now, let's look now at the liquid field, which has similar shape. So now this is a liquid here at the bottom. And now I don't have displacement field. What is displacement in liquid? This liquid does not have a preferred stress reconfiguration, right? There is nothing like this or preferred metric, if you wish. If you wish. So there is a velocity V, tangential velocity, and there is still some sickness. And now, the way to write the stress is: first of all, there is a viscous component, which is proportional to the viscosity, again, times the sickness, times the gradient of the velocity field. But you have another component. This component is the surface tension. It's multiplied by two because you have two surfaces. And you may argue, oh, I can have a tension all. Oh, I can have a tension also, I can have a surface tension also for a solid film. That's true. But for a solid film, it will be an adds-on. For a liquid film, it's a part of the thermodynamic relation. In the sense that you can have elastic sheet without pulling on it, at equilibrium. You cannot have a liquid film at equilibrium without pulling on it. Okay? And that's really a deep point. It's a deep point because it tells you it can't. It's a big point because it tells you it comes from the fact that the solid does have a preferred metric or what we call target metric sometime, whereas a liquid dream does not. Okay, so that's really tied in here. Okay, so that's about that's the relationship between viscous stress and elastic stress. And now let's do the simple exercise. Let's focus on a viscous film for now on. And let's ask what happened at equilibrium. I don't have flow, I have a pressure here. I don't have flow, I have a pressure here inside to support the pressure difference. And normal force balance, if I just look at any piece of the film and I try to do normal force balance, I know that it must be balanced because there is pressure difference, it must be balanced by tension that couples to the curvature. Okay, so this is two sigma over r. And what is two sigma? I just thought to you before, what is two sigma? It has part of two gamma, that the surface tension, plus a viscous force, but now I'm in equilibrium. Course, but now I'm in equilibrium, so this is zero. So, what I get is the famous Laplace law, which is the rate connects between the radius of curvature of the film and the surface tension and the pressure. Now, let's assume that I'm depressurizing this film, this bubble, the gas, but very, very slowly. How slowly you decide, okay? Infinitely slowly. Capital T is very, very large. Okay, so now what do I? Okay, so now what do I have? Force balance still tells me that I have to have this relationship h-time. Okay, I don't have inertia. Okay, so I have this from force balance, but now the radius can change and the sickness and the stress can change. And now what I have, I have, I still have this relation, but now if I do the if I do the depressurization very slowly, adiabatically, I can assume that the velocity is sufficiently small, so this is negligible. And what am I going to get? I'm going to get the modification of the. Get, I'm going to get a modification of the Laplace law, which just connects between the current value of the pressure and the current value of the curvature. And basically, what you expect, what you expect to see is just the film will retain its spherical shape, like a spherical tap, as it collapses. Should say that you see here that the meniscus is fixed. Okay, so what is really changed? The radius of curvature is only of this part, of the top part, not of the only here, this part is a Okay, only here this part is a remains constant, but hopefully, this is a clear. So, if you look at the stress configuration, the stress profile along in this state, you see that I put it by these red arrows. It's more or less being fixed, it's isotropic and uniform by the surface tension. It's a tiny contribution due to the flow inside, which is really tiny. And you can find how small you have to do it, how slow you have to do it in order for this solution to be. In order for this solution to be relevant, one we have not discussed. Now, let's assume a rapid depressurization. Still, I neglect inertia, but I assume that the pressure falls instantaneously, essentially. Okay? So now this delta P is zero, but this still has to be satisfied, right? Because this is normal force balance. But you see, now R cannot follow the pressure. The radius is still large. I still have a bubble. So the only way for me to achieve force balance. for me to achieve force balance is by making the using the discoura stress to balance the surface tension so basically this should be zero so what does it mean it means that i i solve this equation it's a simple solution if you want axial symmetry it just means that you need an inward radial flow proportional to r that balances the compressive stress that it induces balances the tensile effect of the surface tension so you have a force balance Of the surface tension, so you have a force balance. So, basically, what you get here is a stress-free configuration of the film. For a solid, this is the desired state, this is the equilibrium state. For a liquid film, it's not good. It's an excited state. There is lots of energy consumed here by this viscous flow. Okay, if you want to think somewhat differently in a different way intuitively, you can think that what happens is because of normal force balance. Because of normal force balance, the pressure here, the stress, the two-dimensional, the in-plane stress here must be zero. So you create like two-dimensional vacuum in the film, and the film starts to suck liquid from the bus, just like if you have a vacuum. Okay, that's what happens. Very nice. Okay, and basically, this gives you a tells you the characteristic time scale. It's actually the radius over this basic time scale, which is given by the ratio. Basic time scale, which is given by the ratio between the viscosity and the surface tension and the thickness. And if you look at the data, it shows you that the collapse of the bubble is really followed pretty closely to this time scale. But this is not good, actually. It's not good because according to what I showed you, what I discussed, this bubble, once it starts sucking liquid from the bus, should just remain stable. It will keep sickening by sucking the liquid and eventually will collapse under gravity, under the age of the universe. Gravity under the age of the universe after a very, very long time. So, nothing really of this. So, there is really a paradox here. And that's what we call the phantom bubble paradox. So, what is this phantom bubble? It's this situation in which you have lots of viscous flow to cancel the Laplace, the surface tension. It's a non-equilibrium, it's a stress-free state, which will be a very non-equilibrium for a liquid film, and it's enabled by viscous flow, and it retains. Slow and it retains a steady spherical shape because now there is no tangential force, no normal force. Okay, everything is happy. Okay, so why it's a paradox? First of all, it sounds like a paradox, but there is another thing that is used because it's a paradox. And the reason that it's a paradox is this state that I told you about, I just described to you, is perfectly, makes perfect sense mechanically. But from thermodynamic perspective, it's very bad. It violates the first law of thermodynamics. Violates the first law of thermodynamics. Okay, so what is the first law of thermodynamics? It tells you that if you have dissipation of kinetic energy, you must have some source to it. You cannot have a viscous, you cannot have electric heating in a bubble without having a battery or some voltage source. So, here the only source of energy is the surface energy. Right? You have a large surface area, and if you reduce the surface area, then it can. If you reduce the surface area, then it can generate flow. But if the bubble just retains its shape, where does this energy come from? So it's a real paradox. You know, you don't satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. So that's basically the questions here. What drives slackening of rapidly depressurized bubble? What causes radial wrinkles? And how general is this behavior? And that's what I'd like to address in the next 20 minutes of this talk. Any questions so far? So far? Okay, so I'm going to tell you quickly also the solution to this question. So, okay, without mass, but the solution is like this. What really happens is the bubble flattens by front propagation, which is akin to phase transformation. So what really happens is that there is a topological instability that during the depressurization time, no matter how short it is, I tell you instantaneous. But give me a time. Tell me, I don't know, 10 I don't know, 10, I don't know, what milli below micro, I don't know, femtoseconds, one cemtoseconds, one tiny 0.1 femtosecond. So there is always a size, there is always a tiny bit of the around the north pole view of the bubble, which can flatten at this time. There is enough time for its tiny portion to flatten. Why part is flattened? The normal force balance does not require any longer the stress zero to be zero. So you can have stress inside. So, you can have stress inside. And now, what you have is you have a flat portion and the curved portion. And all that you have, all the way, the way the flattening happens is by expanding this flat portion that consumes the curved portion. So, this basically resolves everything. First of all, there is always enough time to like you have an island of radius, very tiny radius, which nucleates. It's really a nucleation process in the stress we see. See, and then it expands at some rate, and now you don't have the problem with the first law of thermodynamics is being recovered because now you have a change in surface energy, and this surface energy, this change in surface energy, can feed the viscous flow, the energy for the viscous flow that is being consumed to maintain this stress-free state here. Everything is resolved. And now, why you have wrinkles? Okay, now we finally go to the wrinkles. You have wrinkles because it sounds Linkers because it turns out that this stress, the distress part, the planar portion, is under hoop compression, okay? Which is really similar to the stress generated in elastic film by a disclination, it's just a point charge, okay? Negative disclination, I should say. As far as I know, it's the first time that the disclination stress field of any defect-type stress field is being found or being conjectured or being told. Or being conjectured or being told about for viscous fields. Typically, we associate such stress field with violation of some crystal or metric structure, and here we don't have metric, we don't have anything. It's just the stress, the viscous stress field with the capillary term that finds itself into this kind of solution. Okay, so and then once you have this, you have a planar portion, a planar wrinkle annulus, which is expanded between the planar core and the spherical period. Okay, so that's basically that's the story. Okay, so that's basically the story. And if you got it, and basically you can go and take a rest for the next one. Can I ask you a question? Yes, Ian. Why wouldn't popping release energy? Why would what? Introducing a hole. You could, instead of flattening, you could introduce a hole. Is that too slow? No, no, it can be. Well, it's not too slow. It can be a, let's assume that you introduce it, you do this at time t equals zero or capital T equals zero, which is very, very short. equals zero, which is very, very short, okay, or capital T very small, and then you have lots of energy. But what I'm saying is that all this time that it takes to flatten, you need constant energy supply, which for the consumer of the energy. Where do you want? You cannot, it's not the first law of thermodynamics require, it's not, it's for each time. You know, at each time you understand the flame energy, it produces extra energy, but a hole would not do that. I know, but where are you going to put it? You have to put it in a liquid somewhere. You don't have a big storage. You don't have a big storage to put this, you don't have an arbitrary storage to put huge energy nowhere or sometimes somewhere in the sky and then consume it through the viscous flow. See what I'm saying? It's like okay. Okay, so now let's go to a in a more detail to what I just told you about here. And I'll go back to the structure that we have here is the non-inertial dynamics of momentum conserving fluid. Okay, that's what we have. Okay, that's what we have, and I would like you to think about now the stress field. The stress is a tensile, as you know. And this tensor consists of two parts. One part is the tangent, is the surface tension, which is uniform, okay, isotropic and uniform. And the other part comes from the viscous stress tender, which really have two components. One of them is the gradient, which now, if I have a curved surface, this would be a covariant derivative along the surface of the velocity. And the other part, which is And the other part, which is actually you need to get it for consistency, and this was noted by Scriven many years ago, is that you have also a rate of change of the curvature. So again, nothing can depend on the metric of the metric. Sorry, G is the metric. So nothing in this term depends on the metric itself. You don't have any term that depends on the metric that can enter you. Okay, or not even metric minus a target metric like you have in elastic solids. But the rate of change of metric is perfectly fine. Is perfectly fine and you should allow for it. Okay, this is a more detailed writing of the stress of the stress tensor. I note by maybe it's confusing, but capital R minus one is going to be the curvature tensor. Okay. And the equations are like this. So let's first start, let's compare between planar film, okay, and let's come and the curved film. So each of them has some thickness to it, and both of them are liquids, okay? And let's first write the normal force balance. Normal force balance. So the normal force balance on the planar film is trivial, right? I mean, there is no curvature, so it's satisfied automatically. For a curved film, what we have is really the Laplace pressure, basically the Laplace flow of what, which just being extended to non-equilibrium configuration. So it's just the dot product. Now it's a dot tensorial scalar product between the two tensors, the stress tensor, which now does not have to be just two gamma times i, as you have in equilibrium, but can account also for the viscous star. For the viscous part and the metric and the curvature, and so on. Okay, so this is the general, this part is generalized, just in Laplace law. And you have a small component, which, if you have a viscous film, it's going to be proportional to the thickness cube, just like as you have in the Euler equation for elasticity, which is small. Okay, that's why I put it in a narrow gray. Okay, so this is one part. This is the normal force balance. And now let's look at the tangential force balance. So the tangential force balance is Balance so the tangential force balance is just a divergence-free stress tensor, in-plane stress tensor. And now, you know, that it's a function pre-found in many textbooks that if you do it for a planar film, what you get from this is you have to introduce this equation implies that you can write the stress tensor as driven by a potential, what we call Erie potentials through this relation, just as you have in electrostatics, you have that if you have a Kerala free. You have that if you have a Keral-free electrostatic field, it can be written as a gradient of a potential. So you have in elasticity and also in viscosity. If you have a stress-free divergence-free tensor, you can write it as this. So what you get is the biharmonic equation, known as the Stocks equation sometimes. What was shown by Peter Howell, that's basically the essence, that if you have now a curvature, you have now a term on the right-hand side, you have a source. On the right-hand side, you have a source which, for elastic, for the Foppel-Van-Karman equation, you will have just the determinant of the curvature tensor, which is what we call the Gaussian curvature. But for viscous film, it's the rate of change, this Gaussian curvature. So the rate of change of Gaussian curvature drives stresses in viscous film. That was the observation of Peter Howell. You have also another term that I'm not going to discuss. Another term that I'm not going to discuss that's important for us, okay? So, that's what we have: we have Gaussian curvature, dn is the normal velocity, the trace of the Gaussian curvature, the trace of the curvature tends to be what's known as the mean curvature. Okay, okay, so now what? Now, let's apply these equations to our problem. So, we start with, we give the pressure, as I said, and we let the pressure to be rapidly collapsing, rapidly. Pressure to be rapidly collapsing, rapidly decaying. And now I want to show you the simulation, the numerical solution to this problem. So, this is how it looks like. Okay, this is an axis symmetric solution. Here we impose axial symmetry. Okay, should I show it again? Okay. Okay, so you see a beginner flattens at the top and then it Begin it flattens at the top, and then it you see a curved part which continues. Okay, okay, so that's what you have, that's a solution, and now let me show you the profile. So, the shape looks like this: time t equals zero. I have the hemispherical shape, you approximate it as parabola, it's not really important, and after a long time, long after the depressurization period, but still very short in terms of the natural time scale, we have a flat. Of the natural time scale, we have a flat portion, and then here what we have is the curved part, which is the phantom bug, where we have a stress-free configuration. Okay, so that's basically the solution of what you see. And now I to elaborate a little further, I would like to show you what is the stress field because we don't get only the shape, we get from the numerical solution everything. Also, the stress field, okay, of the potential, the a potential, we get also the stress field. I'm going to show you the hook. Guess also the stress field. I'm going to show you the hoop component of the stress field, and that's how it looks like. So, you see, it's basically zero here. In the carewood power, it's zero as it should be. And in the flat part, it has this shape which seems to diverge and has also a negative component to it, which corresponds to compression. Okay, now what you see here is really a shape in which this zone is the, as I said, the stress-free zone, which is curved, but the rate of curved. Curved, but the rate of curvature is not changing, okay. And so that this part is really zero, you don't have a source there. This part is really flat, so the curvature is zero by default, but the stress can be now non-zero because of the normal force. And this tells that this is the font. In the front, you have a jump in the one component of the stress field, the hoop component. You cannot have the same thing in the radial component for force balance, so this is the only jump. Component for force balance. So, this is the only jump that you can have, and you have it. And here you have also all the rate of change of Gaussian curvature is focused here. There is no rate of change of Gaussian curvature here. There is no rate of change of Gaussian curvature here, only here in the font, classical font solution. Okay, so now let's elaborate a little bit and let's forget for the moment about this zone. And basically, I can totally neglect this regularizing term, and I still have this equation. And let's think about the second equation as this. So, it just if now I So it just, if now I write, let me change a little bit notation and right now this Laplace notify the realize that the trace of the stress field is nothing but the Laplacian of this curvature. So now I can forget about the Eric stress potential, which is maybe a little more confusing to think about. So I can think about this second equation, the tangential force balance, as the rate of change of Gaussian curvature, which exists only here at the front. Which exists only here at the front, drives a non-zero restress. So, this is really what it drives. It's very similar to electrostatics, if that's what I want to bring you here. So, if you think about the trace of the stress tensor as the analogous electrostatic potential, what you have is something very similar to electrostatics. So, what is zero? It turns out that the part which is zero, you can think about this is the stress. There are two solutions, right, to this equation. Either the stress is zero or the radius of curvature is zero. zero or the radius of curvature is zero. This is what normal force panel tells you. So these are the two solutions. So one of them is this, the other one is this. And the one way to think about this thing is that, and this part, now, if I think in the electrostatic analog, what I have on the right-hand side will be equivalent to a charge density in the electrostatic sense. So rate of change of Gaussian curvature acts analogously to density of electric charge. So, and now if I push further the electrostatic. And now if I push further the electrostatic analogy, this sigma non-zero could be sort of as a vacuum, whereas sigma equals zero is the condition of the conductor. Okay, so what I have here and what this equation means, this means that the solution of this equation must be of the form I have only Gaussian curvature here at the front, but I must have another source of stress because otherwise I will not get the stress-free condition on the outside. Okay, so basically I have two parts. Basically, I have two parts, two concentrations of the what you have, the discharge density, one of them at the propagating front, and the other one is this discrimination at the front. Essentially, you have a problem which is totally analogous to what? To electrostatic quadrupole, axial quadrupole. That's actually what we have here. This problem, this is the stress profile that we have. So, the flat part where there is stress is the vacuum, the curved part where the stress must be. The curved part where the stress must be zero is the conductor. Okay, here you have charge which I'm going to call minus q. So, here you must have compensating charge in order to have the stress-fee condition. This is basically what we see in a, it's like you take a conductor and you try to put some, you have some hole inside, you put some charge Q inside the hole, and then all the charge, the negative charge is going to screen this all at the surface of this conductor, at the boundary between the vacuum and the conductor. The boundary between the vacuum and the conductor, and that's basically what you have. You know, that's the problem. So, this part is just a perfect analogy. You can think about the trace of the stress tensor as the electrostatic potential. The gradient of this trace of the stress is what's going to be what we call electrostatic field. The rate of change of Gaussian curvature is analogous to electrostatic charge. And it turns out that charge neutrality is the analogous thing to having an absence of normal force in this problem. In this model, okay, so this is the electrostatic part. It's still the electrostatics as it sounds, it's only electrostatics, it tells you nothing about dynamics. So, to get the front propagation, you now have to determine. So, for a given sigma and R, for a given, if you tell me what is the stress configuration and what is the curvature, I can tell you, like if you tell me what is Q and what is R, these two variable, like what is the radius and what is the charge inside, I can tell you what is the stress and the curvature, but of course, this both. Curvature, but of course, these both are changing, and these are determined first of all by the front propagation condition. It turns out that the jump in the stress must be related to the jump in the Gaussian curvature. This is one equation. The other equation is the thermodynamics that tells me that I cannot have just arbitrary charge. It needs to be balanced by the rate of change. So, the rate of change of surface energy corresponds to the viscous stress. These are details that I'm putting here just to show. Details that I'm putting here just to show you that it can be done pretty straightforward. But the technical details, nobody here can probably, maybe somebody can derive this at this time. But this is the full solution of the problem, of the axisymmetric problem. And you can compare it with the numerics and you see very good agreement. I will not discuss further. Okay, so this is the quick summary of what we did so far. I described to you only the axial isymatron solution, the base flow that gives rise to the instability. That gives rise to the instability. You have rapid pressurization, it gives rise to phantom bubble, which is a stress-free, very non-equilibrium, spherical shape. It's being topologically unstable. There is a dynamical nucleation of a disclination front pair. Okay, the disclination at the center and the front, where you have rate of change of Gaussian curvature that screens it and makes the rest of the film stress-free. This is akin to electrostatic quadrupole. And the axisymmetric flattening process is basically the Flattening process is basically that the curvature is eliminated only at the front, and this is analogous to expansion of electrostatic quadrupole. That's all the problem. And that's why we have why we have wrinkles now. We have wrinkles because, as I showed, this disclination at the front has some generates some hook stress. And if you have negative, as we have in elastic problems, this generates instability. You can solve this problem just by introducing a single mode and that's. Producing a single mode, and that's this is very similar, inspired by problems in elastic systems. I will not go into the details here, but what you see is now three zones. You have the planar part in the beginning, so here, here where you have good compression, beyond it, you have this planar wrinkle zone where wrinkles, the stress is the compression is being suppressed not by the curvature, but by the forming wrinkles, which accumulates the compressive stress by the growth rate and beyond this. By the growth rate, and beyond it, you have this curved part. Essentially, what we have now is trisson in terms of the electrostatic analogy. We have vacuum, we have a metal or conductor, and we have what we call polar metal. It's very, very good, dielectric that can screen all the stress by forming some microstructure, which is the wrinkle sphere. Okay, so that's basically what we have here. We have this kind of picture again. I know that the most interesting thing in this problem appears to be at least. Seeing in this problem appears to be at least the wrinkles, it's actually the least interesting, it turns out to be, at least from my perspective. What's really interesting is what I'm the kind of structure that appears to be here. I'll show you. Really need to go quickly in time, but okay, I'll still go, would like to show you this movie. Okay, I think I'm going to skip the movie because there are some important things I want to tell you. So you have rapid depressurization. So, you have rapid depressurization, goes to a phantom bubble, what I call the stress reconfiguration, then you have topological instability, and this topological instability gives rise eventually to symmetry breaking instability through this compression, where it's suppressed sub-compression. So, that's basically the sequence that we see. Okay, so in the last two one minute or two minutes, I would like to go quickly over some what's next. Okay, so first I would like to tell you about some questions we pushed under the round. You about some questions we push under the run. So, here is a question: Does film thickening suppress or amplify in-plane compression? What do you think? I did not tell you anything about the thickening of the film. And then the other question is, what is the role of the meniscus? Many people noted here in the beginning that there is a meniscus. When you see it in the film, in the movie, what is the role of the meniscus? And basically, the equation is flattened to shrink. Okay, so I'd like to show you that maybe counterintuitively, the in-plane compression amp. The in-plane compression, the thickening amplify and not, if you think elastically, you would say that it releases compression, but here it's amplified and the role of the meniscus is crucial. So here is what I would like to say. So if we have a meniscus, that's what basically assumed it's basically immobile, then what we have in the inward flow, we have the info flow, the Kabunsel, in any case, we need to have the generate phantom bubble state, namely stress 3 in order to have for. We stress free in order to have force balance when you don't have pressure. Here, you do it in the menu. The only way to do it is that the main component is you have some part of it, but it's the inward flow, the tangential flow. However, you still have another option. If you don't have the miniscuous, if you can withdraw everything inward, what you can do is you don't need to generate any flow, any tangential flow. You can do everything by thickening, by the change of the metric. So, thickening implies change of the. So, thickening implies change of the two-dimensional metric. And what you will get there is very different. You get thickening-dominated. So, all the compaction you will not see wrinkles here, you will see wrinkles. And I think part of the problems of previous assumptions of this work, they neglected the role of the meniscal. So the base flow was totally flowed. So, this is one thing. What about the wrinkles? So, I know that this sounds like the most interesting things, but it turns out to be quite non-trivial. First of all, it cannot be explained by linear stability analysis. Explained by linear stability analysis for reasons that I don't have time to get into it. Data suggests the following rule that it's simply just related to the geometric mean of the larger reduced to the thickness. And we believe that some type of startup threshold analysis, like we do in elasticity theory, may work, but we still don't know how to do it. What about the Rayleigh-Stocks analogy, which many people like to invoke between viscous dynamic and elastic deformation? So the idea is like this: here is viscous stress looks like. Here, viscous stress looks like proportional to the gradient of the velocity. That's elastic stress is proportional to the gradient of the displacement. By this relation, if you change eta d dt, you change it to e, you get basically, it looks like you have mapping of all the stokes equations into the Poppel van-Kaman equation, but it turns out that this works only if you don't have Gaussian curvature. Once you have Gaussian curvature, you lose this instability, you lose this analogy, and the signature of it in this problem is. And the signature of it in this problem is that this kind of jump of hoop stress is something that you don't see in elastic systems. Okay? So if you wish, this part can be mapped to elastic problem, this part can also be mapped, but the transition between them is a new type of non-equilibrium problem, which cannot be mapped to elastic problem. Okay, so the last is so this is basically my last slide. So we have momentum. So, we have momentum conserving. What I showed you is that this is a general scheme that we have here. This is just one example of what I would call a more general subject, which is nearly barely untapped, I think, in which momentum conserving viscous flow in two dimensions of films is defined by this equation. So, the tangential force balance, so a no-normal force in this particular example. Here, the self-extension is what generates, if you wish, the elastic power. But more generally, you can think about more general problems in which you have arbitrary normal force. General problems in which you have arbitrary normal force balance, still you have momentum conservation. And the elastic part of the stress tensor is not only surface tension, but maybe something more interesting, which you can do. For instance, if you have either viscoelastic material or a graphene drum head, in which you have electrons, if you are strongly correlated, they can form a two-dimensional viscous flow. And okay, I think I will maybe skip this analogy, but it's something that we are quite interested to explore, but I think it's pretty broad. To explore, but I think it's a pretty broader field. I just want to go to summarize. Before I want to summarize, I want to tell you that a little more about my colleague. I mentioned that he's a very talented and great guy, Abraham Klein, who is in the affiliation with Ariel University. And I want to, Ariel University is located here. It's a new Israeli university. And I want to read a disclaimer expressing only my opinion that this is an academic institute located in an Israeli settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories. In the occupied Palestinian territories illegally according to international law. Personally, I'm objecting to boycotting individuals in the academic community due to their views or affiliation. And Avraham is a great physicist and great friend, also great person. I'm happy to collaborate with him. But that's the situation. Okay. So again, just a quick reading summary, curvature-driven hydrodynamics in viscous flow. We see that rapidly depressurized bubble is a people into a mostly unexplored branch. Mostly unexplored branch of sort of laminar yet geometrically non-linear fluid mechanics in two dimensions, which I hope this talk will contribute to push forward by people here and others. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Ben. Questions? Let me give you the microphone. Hi, Benny. Nice talk. On the wrinkling. On the wrinkling stuff, of course, your argument is that there's compression, and so we should wrinkle. But, you know, in the elastic system, the argument is there's compression and we wrinkle out of plane because actually you have a preferred metric and you can do so to relieve the compression and it's energetically favorable. So I'm a little confused about the compression leads to. About the compression leads to wrinkling argument. Yes, thank you. So, so I think we have to go back to the elastic system, and I think your description is not correct even in the elastic system. What gives rise to buckling and to wrinkling is compression per se. Okay, and I can show you why this is correct also in the elastic sense. Namely, it's not the strain, negative strain that gives rise to buckling, it's negative compression, negative stress. Compression, negative stress. Okay, so in this sense, it's totally analogous also here. Okay, I think it's a longer discussion that needs some explanation. But I think all that I want to emphasize is that your basic statement, we have a disagreement on this. And that's why. But at the bottom line, you can just take down the equations of motion and you see that you just do linear stability analysis and you see that if there is compressive part in the viscous stress. Part in the viscous stress or in the stress fluid of the liquid, you will get it will be unstable to modulations out of play. Okay, so that's the fact. Interpretation is probably what we can discuss later. Very fascinating talk. Lovely, lovely. I was just wondering now, so you have no explanation for the length scale of the wrinkles. For the wavelength, yeah. The wavelength of the wrinkles. There wouldn't be somewhere lurking in here an analog of an elastic foundation, because then that would give you, based upon a linear instability. We did it. We get some wavelengths. Yeah. That's what I wrote quickly in this. My second question is: please show us. It turns out that it just does not fit the data. Okay. So you can do linear stability analysis exactly in the analog that you say. Analysis exactly in the analogue that you say, like elastic foundation will be played here by fluid inertia, which is crucial at the beginning. You can do it, and you just totally it seems to be done, that just doesn't agree with the data. That's it. Yeah, yeah. And the total suggestion is no dependent on inertia. What's your intuitive feeling as to I don't know? No. The point is that we really would like to do these kinds of things, but we don't have energy functional to minimize. For this, we need linear stability analysis you can do just on the equations of motion. You don't need energy. Equations of motion. You don't need energy minimization. So it's not a problem of what Bob would call energy-driven pattern formation. You can just do it by linear stability analysis, regardless of where your equations come from. But to do a star-form social analysis, we need energy minimization, and we don't have the upper functionality. Yeah, a second question. I'd love to see the film.
