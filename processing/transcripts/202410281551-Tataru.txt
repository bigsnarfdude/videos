And so now looking at the first slide, I'm realizing I have shortened the title and possibly l lose the distinction of having the longest title. I apologize for that. And now for, given what we had so far, for something completely different, I'm not going to tell you anything about solitary waves, I'm not going to tell you anything about numerics, but it's still going to be about water waves, more broadly about waves. Waterways, more broadly about three boundary problems. And the question that I will be addressing is the question, a very simple question, very classical question of local volposiness. What is a good way to describe what does it mean to have well-posiness, local volposiness for a free boundary problem? And this project that I'll tell you about is a joint work with Mihaila Mitkin, whom you all know, and also with the And also with Benjamin Tinot and Mitchell Taylor. Ben and Mitchell were my graduate students, and now they're postdocs at NYU and at ETH. And this is a project that we started about two years ago. And I'll tell you about two types of results that we have obtained. Next slide is the requisite of Is the requisite obligatory slide for this workshop? But it's nicely hand-drawn. Nobody else had that. Okay, so we're looking at a free boundary problem. We have some fluid domain where we have some version of incompressible Euler. We have a free boundary with some boundary conditions in there. We have this configuration that evolves as a function of time. Each such configuration we think of as a state, and we're asking. We think of it as a state, and we're asking what does it mean to have a well-defined evolution here? What does it mean to have a local well-posed, and that's number one. Number two, how do we study this problem if we want to look at it at low regularity? What are good thresholds for low regularity for this problem? Can we get results, local repositance results, close to this optimal regularity? This is a problem that is, let's say, intensely studied. Intensely studied in the realm of quasi-linear or non-linear evolution equations, and particularly in fluids. Alright, so you can look at fluid problems, fluid boundary problems in fluids in many situations. You can take color on Navier-Stokes equations. You could look at compressible problems or incompressible problems, gas versus fluids, and the favorite in this workshop. Favorite in this workshop, the irrotational setting for incompressible problems, so waterways. And then, in terms of boundary conditions, we have the simplest, the classical boundary condition that tells you that the boundary is moving with a fluid flow. And then we have the dynamic of a boundary condition, which depends on the specifics of your problem. So, this is all very well known to this audience. And now we get to the well-posed. And now we get to the well-posedness question. Now, when you study water waves in particular, you reduce the problems to the boundary. And so, all you care about is how you parametrize this boundary and how you look at the boundary evolution. But if you allow for, let's say, vorticity in a problem, then you also care about what happens with the evolution inside. And then you have these two classical ways of looking at the problem. You can write your equations in Lagrangian coordinates, or you can write your equations. Lagrangian coordinates, or you can write your equations in Eulerian coordinates. And if you forget for a moment about free boundaries, which is where I want to get to, but if you forget about free boundaries, then things work nicely in the Oulerian setting. Perhaps the Lagrangian setting serves as a bit of a backup plan. But if you look at three boundaries and you have this boundary moving and you allow for vorticity, then sort of the Then, sort of, one might think that the easiest way to go about this is to look at the problem in Lagrangian coordinates. However, if you get some result in Lagrangian coordinates, then transposing it back to Eulerian coordinates is fraught with difficulties and maybe does not give optimal results. Maybe you need extra regularity to work with that. And so, the objectives of this project that we have been pursuing for a few years are first For a few years, are first to try to think about these free boundary problems purely in the Eulerian setting, so completely forget about doing any Lagrangian computations. Then we want to obtain, well, you can take the word sharp with a grain of salt, but sharp or nearly sharp results for the regularity of the data and the regularity of the solutions, and then equally importantly, to provide this complete theory. To provide this complete theory, where not only you start with some initial data and you want to find the solution, but then you also want to see how the solution depends on time as, let's say, a map from some time interval into your state space. And then, more importantly, how does the solution depend on your initial data? I'm perturbing my initial data a little bit. That means also perturbing the initial surface a little bit. How does the solution change? Change. And if this were a different audience, perhaps I would start this talk with a different problem, which is work that I did with Michela and then with Michela and with Marcelo Dispanzi about four years ago, where we worked on a compressible Euler flow. But this is an incompressible audience, so I'll just skip this and just provide this as a reference for you. We wrote into the Reference for you. We wrote, I think, two very nice papers on that, where we got some results, which actually, based on some work that one of my students is doing now, we know that they are sharp. And then I'll insist for today on the incompressible setting. And so the first problem is. Is most closely related to this workshop. So it's essentially the water wave problem with the orthicity. So we have the incompressible Euler in here. You might wonder why am I omitting even gravity in these equations? And this is because I'll tell you about the droplet problem, where it matters not whether you have gravity or not. So imagine a water droplet, which is Imagine a water droplet, which is in three fault, right? And you have some initial data. So for now, we don't worry about the droplet. Let's say we take this Euler system in all of our N, you put some initial data in sobola spaces. And then if D represents the dimension, this problem is classically known to be well posed in sobola spaces. They're just sobola spaces. S has to be greater than dimension over 2 plus 1. I don't even know who proved this. This goes back into the mystery. Know who proved this. This goes back into the midst of history. I should have done my homework better. But I know that this result was proved to be sharp more recently by Boudin and Wang. So here we have a sharp threshold for local velposeness, even if there is no free boundary. And then if you want to add a free boundary to this, you might ask: can I get local velposeness exactly up to the same threshold that we had in the boundary-less case? States. And compared to water waves, the difference here is that we have vorticity, and then vorticity satisfies a transport equation. TT is the usual material variable. Okay. So now we go to the droplet problem. So the image you should have in mind. Image you should have in mind is simply what I draw that. You have a boundary, you have the weight inside. And then inside the domain, we have the velocity as the main variable, and the auxiliary variable, the pressure. We have on the boundary, the kinematic boundary condition, which tells you how the boundary is moving, and the dynamical boundary condition. We don't worry about surface tension right now, so no surface tension. Right now, so no self-suspension, and the usual pressure equation. And then the single most important object in here is the Taylor coefficient, the normal derivative of the pressure, and that governs local Volposinus for this problem. And as a necessary condition for Volposinus at any setting, is that this del coefficient should be greater than or equal to zero. And if you make it strictly positive, then the problem gets a little bit more worse. And the other thing that Where is it? And the other thing that we have seen also on many talks today, the Diracleton-Neyman map, which you can think of as a map from Hs of the boundary into Hs minus 1 of the boundary, assuming that the boundary also has sufficient regularity, and I'll get more specific with that. And so this is the formulation of the problem. And we ask, first of all, what is a good setting for local robustness? And then, do we have Volposness, and then do we have velposiveness at that set. Alright, so one way you can get some understanding of what is a good situation for local robustness in terms of sobolic spaces is by looking at a scaling law for this problem. So you have this scaling parameter lambda, lambda is a spatial scaling parameter, and then you have different scaling for time and then And then also, you have a scaling law not only for the velocity and the pressure, but also a scaling law for the free boundary. And this scaling is set up so that, if you want, the Lipschitz constant for the free boundary is preserved unchanged, if you want. And then if you look at the scaling, you immediately realize that in terms of Immediately realize that in terms of sombolar spaces, first of all, you should be working at the same symbol of regularity for the velocity inside the fluid domain and for the free boundary. So the s here is the same. And then the other thing you realize is that there is some sobole irregularity where this problem becomes invariant with respect to scaling, and that scaling is dimension plus one over two. And if you compare this with the classical Sompolev index. Some of indexing here for gun and one, d over two plus one, you see they're not the same, right? So you have d over two plus one over two, the scaling, and d over two plus one as the sharp threshold for local positiveness. So when you look at nonlinear problems, somehow the scaling plays the role of a universal threshold for local repositiveness, but sometimes you have different obstructions, and this is what happens. Right, so go back to this. Right, so go back to this. And then the other thing that plays an important role in my story are what we call control norms. And to motivate the notion of control norms, you have to think of energy estimates, for instance. What is an energy is some coercive quantity that you try to control its evolution in time and measures the size of your solution, right? And so then, what are the parameters that control? What are the parameters that control this evolution of the energy? And you have two parameters somehow. One parameter that you want to control the coercivity in time of the energy at fixed time. And that should be at the scale-invariant setting. And this is this parameter A. And this parameter A corresponds to a Lipschitz boundary of gamma and the C one half regularity for the velocity. If you wonder why. For the velocity. If you wonder why these regularities are different, this is at one derivative, this is at one half derivative. Imagine the Sobolev space in here, ht plus one over two, embeds in C one half, because you're in D dimensions, you're inside. But when you look at the regularity of the boundary, the boundary, hd plus one over two, embeds into, well, not quite, but almost into leaves, right? And so that motivates this first control norm. Motivates this first control norm. So you think of A as the elliptic control norm, it will govern the energy coercivity at a fixed time. And then the evolution energy on the Bronwale control norm, this B, is one half derivative higher, so you measure the velocity in the Lipschitz setting and the regularity of the boundary in some sort of modified C1, one-half setting. So one half to a regular higher. And the Lipschitz region. Higher. And the Lipschitz regularity for the Beller state should be a very familiar object. You all know that when you try to write down energy estimates, let's say, for the Euler equation, those energy estimates are governed by the Lipschitz norm of the velocity. Alright, so we'll see in a moment how these control norms come in. Alright, and maybe the single most important thing when you try to work on this problem is to identify what you might. This problem is to identify what you might call the good variables in your problem. So you have a moving domain with a moving boundary. You're trying to track the regularity of the boundary at the same time as trying to track the velocity inside. So what are the objects, the critical objects that really govern these two pieces of regularity? And there are three pieces of information that we have in here. One is the vorticity, which we try to measure. Which we try to measure in Hs minus one space, I want derivative lower than the velocity. Maybe I should put here that we want velocity in Hs and the boundary also in Hs. And so then the vorticity should be one derivative lower in Hs minus one. You can think of this in a very naive way as having the velocity decomposed into a rotational part and an irrotational part. Part and an irrotational part, except that this decomposition is not, let's say, bounded decomposition in HS. So it's not ultimately the right way to think about this problem. Then the next object is the terror coefficient. I already told you that this plays an important role in the local robustness, and that's a classical result. And that is our measurement of the boundary regularity. Boundary regularity. And one way you can write this down is: if you look at the Dirichlet-Nermann operator applied to the Taylor coefficient, this is morally like the Taylor coefficient multiplied by this kappa represents the curvature of the boundary, the mean curvature for the boundary. And then the third object is the material derivative of the Taylor coefficient. And so this guy, it has to be, so A has to be one derivative better than the curvature. The curvature is two derivatives. The curvature is two derivatives less than the surface, so the curvature is S minus 2, and that means that A has to be Hs minus 1. And finally, this material derivative, from the scaling computation, you know that the material derivative scales like a one half of a full derivative, and so this has to be one half derivative below A. And again, morally, you can think about this material derivative of the Taylor coefficient. Of the Taylor coefficient as controlling the normal component of the velocity. But if you really try to look at the normal component of the velocity, this turns out not to be accurate again. And instead, the material derivative of the Taylor coefficient is, so this is the paraproduct notation, is the paraproduct of n and the velocity. So it captures the normal component of the velocity, but only in the situation where the normal Situation where the normal vector field is at lower regularity, sorry, at lower frequency than the velocity. And this is important because the velocity restricted to the boundary is hs minus one half, but the normal has the same regularity as the Taylor coefficient, which is s minus one. So if you look at this At this situation in here, I've decided that it needs a break. What I wanted to show you is that the velocity restricted to the boundary is at s minus 1 up, and the normal restricted to the boundary is at s minus 1. So if you were to. Minus one. So if you were to take the product of them as opposed to the para product, you get extra contributions which are at leading order. So it's very important that you have this para-product in here. In any case, so these are the objects that we're trying to track. And now I want to give you some idea of the kind of results that we were able to prove for this problem. So this is a paper that we posted about a year ago. A year ago, and I told you, I want to tell you about volposiveness, right? But we found out that it's very interesting to split this volposiveness into four parts. And I want to show you these four parts. And the first part, you might say, is uniqueness. You want to look at uniqueness of solutions. And what's interesting about uniqueness of solutions is that, as it turns out, you do not need a whole lot of regularity to have a uniqueness statement. And that came as a Statement and that came as a bit of a surprise to us because normally when you look at uniqueness statement, you say, Oh, I have two HS solutions. Are they equal? Right? But it turns out you do not need to look at HS solutions. It's enough to look at Lipschitz solutions, so much less regularity than HS. And so we have a very strong uniqueness theorem. And what's interesting about this uniqueness theorem, even more than this statement itself, is the way. Statement itself is the way we prove it. So to prove uniqueness, you have to compare two solutions, right? And imagine now that you have one solution which has one free boundary, that's called the red solution, and another solution which has a different free boundary, and you want to compare them. This is obviously not the linear space, right? So, how do you measure the distance between two solutions? So, to achieve this, we have to do To achieve this, we have to do two things. First of all, we have to construct a distance functional between these two solutions. This is a non-linear object because we're not in a linear space. And then we have to be able to propagate this distance functional. Now, what's the challenge here? The first challenge is you want to have a distance functional which measures the distance between these two solutions. So you might say, well, I just subtract the velocities inside, and then I'm looking at Velocities inside, and then I'm looking at the distance between boundaries. I should be just about done. But then you realize that having such a distance that roughly has the right size is not good enough, because then you want to be able to propagate it. This is the challenge, right? If you want to see how this challenge is resolved, you have to look at the paper because it's like 20 pages of math. But it works. Okay, so this is the unique math. Works. Okay, so this is the uniqueness theorem. Then we get to the expected result, the Welposiness theorem. And the one thing that I want to point out to you in here is that we're able to get Valposinus exactly up to this threshold of Borgan and Wang, up to the sharp threshold. So this is the optimal Volposius result for the free boundary problem at exactly the same regularity level as if you did not have the free boundary. And then to point out that what does the And then to point out that what does this valposiveness mean? It means the full Hadamard called this enhanced Hadamard valposiveness, that's the plus that you see in there. So, you know, in a naive way, you could say well positiveness means existence and uniqueness. What Hadamard brought in, and we didn't believe this, so actually you looked at Hadamard's paper from the 19th century and verified this. There is just written in words and it's in French. There is just written in words, and it's in French, but he said it. That you, in some way or another, you want this continuous dependence of the solutions on the initial data. And then what we call sort of the enhanced atom is that you also have this weak Lipschitz dependence on the initial data for the solution. So you have your solutions in the HS topology, right? But if you try to measure the distance between two solutions, you have to measure this distance in a lower topology. To measure this distance in a lower topology, and this is typical for every quasi-linear problem. So, having these four points in here is what we think of as a full complete theory for quasi-linear well-posedness. So, these are the first two theorems. And then we go to the third theorem, where first is the energy estimate. And what I want to show you in here is that at integer energy levels, you have a coercive energy, so the coercivity. Coercive energy, so the coercivity is in here. It measures the coercive nerves, and then you can propagate these energies. And what I want to emphasize in here is where the control parameters come in. A comes in as an elliptic control parameter in the implicit constant in here, and B, which is half derivative of half scaling, is the guy that actually controls the growth of the energy. And this is a scale-invariant energy, both morally and actually, as it Actually, as it gets constructed. And finally, the last theorem that we have is a continuation theorem, which tells us that we can continue solutions not only when HS norm of the solution remains bounded, but exactly like the classical continuation criteria for the Euler equation, you need our B-control parameter to stay bounded, which is essentially the Brad V in L infinity and the corresponding regularity of C1. Regularity, let's see one, one half for the free boundary to be interprovo in time. So, this is our first line of results. This was a paper from last year. I'll go quickly over this prior work, just emphasize that this is mostly done in the Lagrangian approach. And so I emphasize this five points. These five points that are key in our proof. One thing, maybe, that I did not mention is as a warm-up, we consider the linearized equation. For any non-linear equation, it's also good practice to begin with the linearized equation, because the linearized equation, getting good estimates for the linearized equation, gives you a good linearized energy, and that gives you a clue of what the And that gives you a clue of what that distance function has to be. Then I mentioned before these difference bounds, which are at the L2 level, different bounds for two solutions, the blue versus red picture in KM. The energy estimates, that's where it's critical to identify the good variables in our problem. And based on this good variable, you want to construct suitable energy functions. And of course, not everything that's coercive works. And of course, not everything that's coercive works, so you have to be careful when you construct these energy functionals. And then to prove this propagation bounds with our sharp control parameters, that's also a lot of work because the naive kind of estimates that you might try to do will give you much, much worse control parameters. So nobody else before had sharp control parameters. Everybody was working with control parameters as being high-so-boller norms, as it were. As it were. We also have a new scheme for the existence of regular solutions, which is inspired from my earlier work with Mihaila in the compressible case, which is a direct constructive approach to the time discretization, where the time discretization itself is split into three steps. One, you take your data at one step, you regularize it. Then you do the transport separately and the Euler step separately. And the Euler step separately, so sort of an Euler steam, but with a built-in transport and with a pre-regularization of your state. And finally, this existence of regular solutions, what we found out is that it's most efficient to carry out that high regularity, and then you get rough solutions as limits of smooth solutions. So, first you construct smooth solutions, and then once you have smooth solutions, you've got your hands on the objects that you want, but perhaps not at the regularity that you want. You take your rough initial data, you approximate it with smooth initial data, and then show that the limit exists. And this is essential if you want to also study the continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data. And maybe I should emphasize it here, we have coming out of a summer school that we ran a few years ago at MSRI with Mihaila, we wrote sort of a primer explaining how Pasilinear, what Pasilinear velposness works in a simpler setting where you want to hit these bullets, hit these marks, to get the continuous dependence on the data, to get the continuity of the solution in your state space. All right, so this is about the first project that I wanted to tell you about. And now we move on to the second project, which is still work in progress. But we're really at the proofreading stage. If you ask Ben, he thinks we're two weeks. Maybe. Maybe more realistic would be a month. So, this is the system. So, this is still water waves if you want, but you add in a magnetic field, right? And now you have a system of two coupled equations. You have the equation for the velocity and the equation for the magnetic field. The initial data is on the same suballer space is Hs. This is still worked for S greater than T over S. Proposed for s greater than t over 2 plus 1. And if you set b is equal to 0, which is consistent with the second equation, then your solution actually solves the incompressible Euler. All right, so think of this as an extension of incompressible Euler, where you have this extra magnetic field. But if you add in the magnetic field, one sort of interesting point is that you no longer can think of the irrotational problem because this magnetic force, the Lorentz force, creates. Magnetic force, the Lorentz force, creates vorticity. So the moment the magnetic field is zero, it will create vorticity in the problem no matter what. So you have to think about the problem with vorticity. All right. And then maybe the droplet problem is the same problem. You have a water droplet, but now your water is magnetized if you want, or some other fluid that's magnetized. You have the same boundary conditions as before, a kinematic boundary condition, dynamical boundary condition. Dynamical boundary condition. What's new in here is the magnetic boundary condition, where this magnetic vector field, for physical reasons, has to be tangent to the boundary when you are on the boundary. So this is something that happens at fixed time. And now you have the dynamical variables, the B and gamma that we had before, and the magnetic field P. The pressure, you you notice maybe I switched from small P to capital P. Uh this capital P P has uh different physical meaning. This is what's called the total pressure. Meaning, this is what's called the total pressure. And the total pressure, if you want, consists physically of two portions: the pressure of the fluid, which is the small P, and the magnetic pressure. So this is just to establish the physical terminology, because in practice we only work with this capital P. You have the Laplace equation for capital T, and this is a copy-paste title. This should have been a B. All right. Alright, and then the Taylor coefficient plays exactly the same role as before with the necessary condition for a positiveness. I won't insist on scaling on some all of spaces. Everything is very much what we had before. B has to be the same regularity as the velocity. The control norms, the A remains unchanged. We just add Remains unchanged, we just add B in here, but an interesting twist happens for this B because now it has to also contain the material derivative of the pressure. Now, if we had added the material derivative of the pressure for the classical incompressible boiler, it would have made no difference. But in here, as you'll see on the next slide, the material derivative of the pressure is really a new object. And the reason for that is because what we end up doing is working with what What we end up doing is working with what we call diagonalized equations, where instead of looking at B and B as the two components of the system, we look at this W plus and W minus, the sum and the difference, and then we have two commuting material derivatives. One material derivative with V minus B, and the other material derivative with V plus B, which you can substitute if you want by W minus and W plus. And then when you recast your equations using these new variables, you have the material that the You have the material derivative, the plus material derivative of W minus, gradient of the pressure, and the minus derivative, material derivative of W plus is also the minus gradient of the pressure. So you have these two components, you have two transport equations, but now these two transport equations move in different directions. Okay? T point, these two material derivatives commute, which Which I don't think people have realized before, and we were quite surprised when we found out. And then you have a pressure row that you can write in terms of this. All right, good variables. Now we have two vorticities, the curl of W plus and W minus. Again, a single Taylor coefficient. By the way, the vorticities solve the requisite transport equations, but they get coupled a little bit. Little bit. And then for material derivatives of the Taylor coefficients, now we have two of those. And there's two twists in here. So this is two of them, first of all. And secondly, you cannot just take this material derivatives. They require some sort of normal form type correction. I don't have time to get into this, but if you want to get the right estimates, you need to do this. And hopefully, the results that will be in the published paper will be. Will be this. The first one is the uniqueness theorem. And again, here is just in the Lipschitz class with our control parameters A and B staying bounded. Then for the well-posedness, we want to work well posedness as greater than T over 2 plus 1. But the new twist that we found out is that it's not enough to take this velocity and magnetic field and gamma in Hs, but also the gradient in the B direction. Gradient in the B direction of all of these objects to be in Hs minus one half. So this B vector field plays a different scaling role as the scaling of one derivative. And so this ends up at one half derivative level. All right. We have energy estimates. I put this B in the red in here because right now we don't quite have the optimal B, but we're glad that we have some B. We're glad that we have some B because there is no local robustness result for this problem so far, so this should be the first. And then the one result that we do not have at this point is the continuation theorem at the sharp setting. All right, so again, a few prior works, some with the over-determining boundary conditions on the free boundary, and some again Lagrange. Um Lagrangian results with some extra conditions on the initial uh boundary. Um and uh again the key steps in the proof which I've shown you before, so this is just a copy paste of that slide to try to find home. And thank you for that. Um question? Um question? Comments? So in in the main result your D, the dimension, is it always two or bigger? Well, I mean in dimension one these problems are not as interesting, right? Because then your field boundary is just a point. Yes, this is. But and then I was wondering one is the energy estimates they were Energy estimates, they were also in, so we have k is zero, then you were in negative spaces, right? Negative order spaces. The energy is theorem 3 started at k0, right? Ah. That's a copy-paste mistake. Okay, it should be one or two or something, right? One. Well, fine. One. Well, yeah. I can explain that in the compressible Euler case, we wrote the equations at the first of the system and then we started L2. This is a wave equation one. Yeah. It shouldn't be. And then the final method. There is this own sort of critical index, right? Then there is this index. Then there is this index which you have here, which is so how do they relate and what happens in between? So I don't really understand. Well, Onsager, to my mind, simply tells you that the problem is that bad things happen below scaling, right? Yeah, but then you sort of lose control of that. So, but okay, Onsago uses different norms using holder norms, but it tells you that if you're below. You that if you are below the scaling of the problem, you can construct lots of silly solutions if you want. But here you're asking for well-posedness, and for well-posedness, you are really to be half-derivative above scaling, else you end up having ill-posedness by the work of Burgandemo. But they're in between. In between, it's a range where perhaps Where perhaps bad things could happen, but not as many bad things as predicted by all sector. Yeah. Right. So I'll take this time to the stop here. Thank you again.
