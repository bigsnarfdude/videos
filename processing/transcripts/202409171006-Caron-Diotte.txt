I'm Matthias and today I'll talk about something that's not here, but we wish it was. The same data. Quickly, how many of you here work with raw data? By show of hand. How many of you collect your data? Less. So those of you know that collecting data can be a real nightmare. Be a real nightmare because people do not show up, people do not want to disclose some information, and we'll discuss about why taking into account missing data missing responses is important in the context of modern social behavior. So Missing data, as I said, is an integral part of the researcher's experience. You cannot really do data connection without having to handle missing data to deal with it. So it can be voluntary or involuntary omission from those who disclose the data. So people might not want to. Want to answer to a question that was so important that they answered, but they did not want to, or they can forget to answer it. It can also be impossible to take the measure. So sometimes the person might want to participate in your study, you might want to go collect the data. Go collect the data, but it's not possible to do it because, for instance, there's a storm and you cannot go to where it is. You can also have error in the measure instrument. So, sometimes you have data that is corrupted. You can also have people who dropped out of their research. So, that can be some situations. Situations in which you have missing data in your device. This missing data can bias the results from your statistical analysis and reduce your statistical power. Generally, we see missing data as an off cycle, and we want to handle it. So, because the main focus of the workshop is on modeling social behavior, I've Modeling social behavior. I've done a quick review of, I was trying to find: is there modeling of missing data that is currently done? The main case where it is performed is to test the impacts of missing data. So what are the consequences of having missing data on my inferences or on my data distribution? To test the efficiency of missing data mitigation techniques. Techniques, so which data analysis techniques are better to handle missing data. In the case of power analysis, so I want to plan a study, I need to know how many observations I need to collect. Sometimes we want to include missing, to take into account missing data. Or in feasibility analysis, the same thing. We want to know: is my study feasible if I Feasible if I collect data with missing missing. But not really anything in trying to understand why there is missing data. So the objective today will be to argue that our modeling of social behavior can take into account missingness as an objective. So we'll briefly review the missing data mechanism. Missing data mechanism. So, the theory of missing data detailed three mechanisms that describe the relationship between the missing data and the observer and the other variables. They are not an explanation of the relation between the variables and the probability. Sorry, not the explanation of the cause of missingness, but it depicts the relation between the variables and the probability of missingness. So, we have four components. So we have four components. X, which is the completely observed variables. Y, partially observed variables. Z is the cause of the missingness. So it is external to both X and Y. And R is the probability of missingness. So R is the probability of having missing value on Y. So the first mechanism we have is the missing comp the at random. Is the missing complete at random mechanism in which it is a situation where the probability of missingness is not associated with any other variables. So the fact that you do not observe a value on y is not related to either the variables in x, so the variables that you have observed, and the The uh why variable itself. So it's just data is missing for absolutely like no important reason. The not really aptly named second mechanism is the missing quantum mechanism, which depicts a situation in which the probability of missingness is associated with another measurable particle. Another measured variable. So here the probability of missing data on Y is associated not with Y, but with X. So for example, if I am working with COVID data on, for instance, people who see that COVID is That COVID is an oax, and that I'm interested in their attitudes on the sanitary measures. So, for instance, let's say I have missing data on the attitude of individuals about the sanitary measures. So, that's my Y variable. My X variable will be if people consider that the COVID-19 is approximate. So, in this So, in this, and I have all the information in this variable. So, let's say that for people who say that COVID-19 is an oak, they have a higher probability of not answering to their attitude about the sanitary measures. So, that's a case of missing at random. And the third, also wonderful. Also, wonderfully named mechanism, which is missing not ant random, is a situation in which the probability of missingness, of missing data, is associated with variables, with our variables, but most importantly, with what we are trying to measure. So, in this case, it will be a situation in which why Why my data on my data y is missing is because of the value of y itself. So if I retake the example, if people who have a negative view of the sanitary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, if they have a negative attitude toward these sanitary measures, they might be less likely to disclose this negative. This negative attitude. So, my probability of missing data is itself linked to what I'm trying to measure, which is not measured. So, that's a big problem in missing data. But there's also sometimes cases in which we, as researchers, want to introduce missingness artificial. There can be some situations in which it In which it can lead to lower the cost of data collection because I need to collect less information about my participants, for example. So they need to take less of their time, so I need to remunerate them less so it can reduce the burden on them. So they have less answers to give. And sometimes it is. Give and sometimes it is impossible to collect all of the necessary data at the same time. So I can introduce missingness artificially in a way to help my data connection. So the plan missing is: I need to make it random and equivalent in my sample. So who does not Who does not answer to some question and who does is at random, and that's why it is important. There are different ways to introduce plant missingness. So you can have a wave missing design in which respondents are randomly assigned to a group in which this group will be surveyed or not at each data connection point. So, for example, some groups will be only contacted. Will be only contacted at the first and second data collection waves, and other groups will not. And other groups will only be contacted at the first data collection point, the third and the fourth, for example. You can have also the multi-leto design in which an instrument is used with other respondents, but we also pass a more precise and costly instrument to Of a costly instrument to a subset of individuals. So we will link the answers or the data of those two instruments to try to estimate the more precise value on the costly instrument without having to take these instruments with everybody. We can have also the multi-farm. We can have also the multi-form design, in which we have different forms of the same questionnaire. So they will be given to random subsets of our sample. So everybody has the same core random items, they answer, but some items are only present in two-thirds of these samples. So that's a way to reduce the data collection. The data collection. And we have to deal with planned or unplanned missingness. We have some contemporary methods, like using full information maximum like EOP, which was in the ERIC and Felix sculpt. We also have multiple impetition, in which we predict missing value using all the available data in The available data for each participant, and we add some random variation in like a certain number of data sets. So, for example, I'm doing 50 data sets, complete data sets using the information that I have, predicting the missing values. And we can also use other methods that are based on, for instance, inverse problems. On, for instance, inverse probability weighting missing. So the first step we want to do is quantify and qualify the missingness. So we will ask questions like on which variable there is missingness, what are the proportions of the missingness on variables, are there any missing data? So do some Do some kind of missing data patterns repeat frequently in my sample? So, for example, a subgroup of people always do not respond to questions pertaining to the attitudes about the sanitary measures or the questions about them finding that the COVID-19 is a house. And we also check if the missing completely at random mechanism is possible. So, is it possible that the missing data is unrelated to or other than that we have observed? We do this with little space. But the big question that we always have is why there is missingness. So, there are, so I identify. So, I identified some reason why there are missingness. So, some person-level causes that have been identified in the researcher is factors like reading speed. So, people who are better readers are able to quickly read or prompt our items in their surveys so they can. In our surveys, so they are less likely to miss some of the items we want them to answer. Also, the personality threat of conscientiousness, which is defined by people who are applied in what they do. So they are less likely to miss questions because they are applied in answering to a survey. We can also We can also measure the intent to drop out. So, people might have, if we do a logital tiny little study, people might have an idea of, well, am I going to answer to the next wave of data collection or not? Other factors is, for instance, if respondents leave the area without the TFIN, so sometimes they leave the area in which we do the survey. In which we do the survey, and they can't deconflict anymore. So, those are distributions of some person-level causes that we might find useful. We also have trinable-level cause, which is they are unrelated to the respondent experience per se, so with the person, with the individuals, but they are. With the individuals, but they are associated with the kind of questions that we are asking. So, for instance, if we are asking something about a sensitive topic, sometimes people are less likely to disclose information about this topic. For example, with questions related to, like we had a talk yesterday with HIV, so those can be seen as sensitive topics, and people might be less likely to disclose. Might be less likely to disclose information about such tests. Variables also, the variables under study might also make a higher propensity of being unreachable, not wanting to interact with researchers. So that's the case if you work with, let's say, kids with violent tendencies or social difficulties. So there might be Difficulties, so they might be less likely to want to take the time to be with the researcher and answer to your questions. So, what you want to understand is already making it more difficult for you to get data on the subject. The last one might be the response to treatment. So, sometimes we do an intervention, and people who are Who are taking place into the intervention are separated into experimental and treatment and experimental and control. And sometimes, well, people will say, oh, well, my symptoms are gotten better. So I don't need to be involved in this study anymore. And in other situations, in the Other situations, in the other way, people might say, Oh, my symptoms are not getting better, so I'm not going to associate myself with them anymore. So how people respond to their treatment might also cause misinda. And I also identify a last kind of causes, which are the context-level causes, which is based on dynamics at the social level. So, there are some complex level factors that can be associated with missingness. So, for instance, let's say you have an interpolarization situation in your research campus. Let's say it's during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw that there was a big polarization between, for instance, people who were vaccinated and those who were not vaccinated. And this kind of polarization might be more, might make the, for instance, Make the, for instance, the people who are not vaccinated to see researchers as being threatening and thus less likely to answer to your survey. There can also be, if there are big social changes in the environment, there can be disruption in transport and communication, making people unreachable. So, more missing data. And you can be in a dangerous situation. You can be in a dancer situation, so you do not want to answer any survey during this time. Let's be brief. So, a little illustration of the COVID-19, the end of the world as we know it. It's a survey, a resident survey survey of 3,617 Canadians from the 10 provinces. They responded to 12 surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was on the technology. The survey was on the technological impacts of the pandemic and factors, socio-demographic factors, and other attitudes and facts about behind the minute were also collected. So we wanted to see which variables were more predictive of how many surveys people were. Surveys people were answering. And what is most important here is we see that there is a small effect of people who distrust the health system. So people with less trust in their health system were less likely to answer to a high number of surveys. But what's more Surveys, but what's more interesting is that people with kids were also less likely to answer to many surveys. So, for instance, they might have had less time during the pandemic, especially when there was lockdown with school closed. So, there were more missing the parents this sprint. But the biggest predictor of a lower number of surveys completed was Surveys completed was the agreement to the fact that COVID-19 was an oax. So people who believed that COVID-19 was an oax were more likely to complete a lower number of surveys in this project. So that was the results of a Poisson regression. And what's important is that we might be That we might be better to embrace missingness in when we model social behavior. So because choosing not to answer or not being able to answer is a behavior. It's something that is interesting by itself. It might be because of the social context or it might be because of my own situation or choosing not to answer or being unable to disclose something interesting. Something interesting. Sometimes a manifestation of the phenomenon that is under study. So, and being able to model such a manifestation demonstrate a deeper understanding of the process, at least not only being able to estimate what the person is thinking, but also if they will be answering or not. And modeling also, non-responses, also gave endpoint insight about how to intervene in these situations. So we might want to think about what is the expected proportion of missingness on the variables that we want to simulate, which variables could explain the missingness, and what are the relationships. Are some variables subject to be missing because of their own values? If so, what is the probability? And should there be any reasons to introduce some missingness in the model? So, for example, if you are making a model. For example, if you are making a model which is taking into account how researchers or the government is monitoring the phenomena. And when we model, we want to identify auxiliary variables, which are variables which correlate or inform us about the cause of missingness. So we can include the general question level causes that correlate, but also a variable and context level causes. Context value classes. We can consult expert knowledge on the subject, make a review of the relevant literature, and we can also do follow-up studies on those who are initially missing in studies that are related. So we can ask people, try to contact people and ask them, why did you not answer me? So, in conclusion, missing data is in Iran to research, especially. Data is in Iran to research, especially in social behavior. Missingness and bias analysis can thus be mitigated, but it can also be an information about some things that maybe interest us about psychological and social dynamics. And incorporating the dismissiveness into our modeling of social behaviors can provide a more realistic account of these social behaviors more under. Yours, a more deeper understanding of the ferroman, which is a so I want to thank you and all the people who are
