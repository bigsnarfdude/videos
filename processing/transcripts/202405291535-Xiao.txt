Thank you. First, I would like to thank Professor Du for his introduction. Also, like thank the organizer for giving me this opportunity. So today I'm going to talk about the linear and non-linear determinacy on the propagation speed of a lot of voltage computation system. So this is a joint work with malinear. Joint work with Mao Linzhou from Nankai University and Chang Hongwu from National Yangming Jiao Tong University. Okay, first, I would like to give a brief introduction on the so-called linear conjecture. So we know that early in 1937, Fisher and Komgoff and his cooperator proposed the so-called Fisher-K-B equation. So this Equation, so this equation to dedicate the spatial propagation in a homogeneous environment. And it's well known that under the KPP condition, the spreading speed of this equation can be directly derived from the linearization at the invading state W equal to zero. So for a long time, it had been conjectured as the non-linear differential. Nonlinear differential equation for population spreads always have the same speed as their linear approximation. So, this is a so-called linear conjecture. So, this conjecture had been developed for more than 18 years, but haven't been completely understood yet. So, today's talk, our main focus on the speech selection process. The Lotka, the speech selection problem of the Lotka vote retailer computation system. And if I have time, I will show you how to extend our argument to the long local diffusion equation. Okay, so our main result is established on observation on the decay rate of minimal traveling resolution. So for the single equation, For the single equation, for the monostable single reaction integration equation, we know that there is a traveling wave solution which is in this form. And the traveling wave solution set is a boundary condition where the w minus infinity is equal to one and w positive infinity is equal to zero. And this w is. And this W is strictly decreasing anchor C. So for the general monostable nonlinearity, we know there is the critical speed C star. So the C star is greater than or equal to 2 times of square root of f dash u d rho. And for every S C Every C greater than or equal to this critical speed C star, there exists a carbon wave. So this C star W is called the minimum traveling wave solution, and this critical speed C star is called the minimal speed of traveling wave or minimal traveling wave speed. Okay, next I will explain why we Explain why we call how to define the linear speed linear selection and speed non-linear selection. So the minimum traveling wave speed is classified into two types. So for the physicist, they like to call it put front or push front. For the mathematician, we also call it speed linear selection or speed non-linear selection. So we look at the travel. We look at the traveling wave solution here, this traveling solution. So we linearize H at the invading stage where W is equal to zero. Then we will get this second order linear equation. And we assume that the capital W decays to zero. Zero with this exponential order, and we bring this form into the linear equation. We will get a second order equation on lambda. And the critical speed C star can be computed formally by this variational form. And this value is exactly equal to two time of. equal to two time of square root of f dash of zero. So when C star equals this value two times square root of f dash of zero, we call the speed call its speed linear selection. And on the other hand, when the C star is strictly larger than this speed, this value we call it speed nonlinear selection. Here is a very typical example, which is Example, which is proposed by Hazard and Rote in 1975. So since we only consider the non-negative solution, so this non-linearity is of monostep type. And the S here, the S here is a continuous change in parameters. And by the case plane, analyzed, so for every S. For every s, the minimal traveling speed of this equation can be computed explicitly in this way. So please look at the figure on the right-hand side. We can see that for s larger than or greater than or equal to zero and small than equal to one, the non-linearity satisfies a KPP condition. So the shape Condition. So the shape of F is below this tangent. And so in this case, the speed, the traveling wave speed is equal to 2. So it's linear selection. And there is a gap between 1 and S equal to this region. So in this region, So, in this region, the non-linearity doesn't satisfy the KPB condition, but the minimal traveling wave speed is still equal to 2, it's still linear selection. And for S is which is strictly larger than 2, the speed becomes non-linear selection. So, in this case, S equal to 2 is the threshold between linear selection and non-linear selection. Selection and non-linear selection. And we call the minimal travel wave when S equals to the minimal traveling wave as the transition from linear selection to non-linear selection. And for the speech selection problem on single equation, there is a remarkable work which is given by Lucia and Muratov and Novaga in 2004. In 2004. So they proposed a variation approach to determine the speak linear section and the non-linear selection. So from their result, we can see that even for the single equation, it's hard to find explicit and easy to check sufficient and necessary condition. Moreover, Moreover, since their approach relies on the variational form, it's hard to extend it to the system. Okay, so next I will move to our main result, our works. And so we look at, we consider the speed selection problem of this few species load carbort competition. Load cabout computation model. So, in this model, there are four parameters. So, we have small d here, small r here, and small a and small b. So, small a and small b are competition coefficients of v and u respectively. So, the studies for this local voltage competition system are usually divided. Computing system are usually divided into three cases. So for the case when A is larger than is greater than zero, smaller one, and B is greater than one. So the system is of monostable case. We also call this case a strong-weak competition case. So in this case, U is the strong species and V is the weak species. And the system And the system admits only one stable state, which is UV equal to 1, 0. And for the case, both AB are greater than 1, so the system is of bisable case. And we also call this case a strong, strong competition case. And in this case, there exist two stable states, UV equal to 1, 0 or UV equal to 0, 1. UB equal to 0, 1. And the third case when AB, both AB greater than 0 and smaller than 1, so the system is of coexistent case. So call this case the weak, weak competition case, because in this case the system admits only one stable state, but this this stable state is strictly positive. Strictly positive. So we will start our discussion on the monostable case. So we consider the cosh problem with the initial data, where the u0 is a complex list portage continuous function, and the v0x is And the V0x is identical equal to 1. So it means that we consider the strong species is invading species and the weak species is original species. And so we can use the invading front of U to define the spreading speech for the system. And since And since so under this condition, so I introduced before the system is of monostable type. There exists a traveling wave solution which can be defined like this. And so there exists a critical speed which is a C star. The C star is large. The C star is larger, greater than or equal to 2 times of square root minus A. And for every speed greater than or equal to this critical speed C star, there exists a traveling wave solution. Okay, so for the system, so for the system, this value, two times of square. times of square root of one minus a is called the linear select linearly selected speech. So we linearize the the the u equation we linearize the u equation at the invading states u v equal to one zero. So we linearize the The uh uh and we assume we will get a linear uh equation of uh capital U, and we also still assume that the u decays to zero with this exponential order and we bring this form into the linear equation. We will find that uh the capital at the critical species. The critical speed C star can be computed by the variational form, and this value is exactly equal to 2 square root of 1 minus A. So the problem is how to determine when the C star is equal to 2 square root of 1 minus A and when the speed C star is strictly greater than 2 square root of minus A. Okay, so for this program. Okay, so for this problem, there are some previous works. So one of the most famous results is given by Louis Lee and Weinberg in 2002. So they find easy to check results. So it's under in this region, the speed is linear selected, and their results. And their results is extended slightly by Huang. And in 2010, in this paper, he claimed that his result is optimal. But later in 2015, Lokis and his collaborator, they showed that this region can This region can still be improved. Okay, so I would like to mention that all of the previous works worked on this probe on this region. So the monostable, so A is larger than the rows more than one, and B is larger than one. So as I introduced before, this is and this region the And in this region, the system is of monost type. But we find that if we want to observe the complete process, how the linear selection translates to the non-linear selection. So I have to extend the region on B. So by some numeric simulation, we find that We find that though the nonlinear selection can happen for some B, which is strictly small than one. For example, we can see the first picture here. So we fixed the value A equal to B equal to one half and we fixed R equal to one. And we find that when the diffusion coefficient of V equation D goes to infinity. Goes to infinity, the speed becomes non-linear selection. So in this figure, the red line here, it indicates the speed, the linear selected speed. So if the if the and if the if the line the the blue line cut the blue lines Cal uh blue lines uh strictly uh uh uh uh is uh is on the buff of the red lines means speed become non-linear selection and in the second figure we we fixed the a equal to b equal to one half and d equal to one and we find that when the r goes to zero and the speed To zero, and the speed also becomes a non-linear selection. So, okay, so to study this problem, it's important to extend the range on B. So we fixed A larger than zero and smaller one. So fixed A, so it means that the linear means that the linear selected speech 2 square root of 1 minus a is fixed. And we also fix the D and R and let B be a continuous change in parameter. So by the simple completion argument, we can prove that the speech, the propagation speech Uh, propagation speed the star is non-decreasing on the parameter b, and also when b goes to infinity, the star becomes non-linear selected. And when b goes to zero, the c star becomes linear selected. So this means that the three should there exists a threshold B star. Threshold B star, the threshold of linear selection and longevity selection, and the B star is well defined, so it's strictly positive and finite. And so for B is small than or equal to B star by the by since the B C star B is not decreasing. C star B is not decreasing on B, we can see that the C star B is always equal to 2 square root of 1 minus A for all B is more than or equal to B star. And for B A is strictly larger, greater than this value B star, the speed is non-linear selected. So and this and this uh uh so we so we want to uh uh correct characterize the uh the the transition front from pushed uh front to push front the transition from front what we want to characterize this transition front and uh so so for uh for b small than a strictly small strictly small than one, in the weak week computation case, the traveling wave can be defined similarly. And so the shape of the travel wave is slightly different, but the propagation properties is the same as the monostable case. So yes, and so So, our main result shows that the asymptotic behavior of the transition front is given like this. And this is a necessary and sufficient condition. So, if and only if b equal to this threshold b star, the asymptotic profile behavior of the minimal traveling wave. Minimal traveling wave is given like this. So please let me explain this result. So we so if the speed is linear selected, so if the C star B is equal to 2 square root of minus 1 minus A, so we linearize the equation as the invading state UB equal to 1, 0, 1. So we get So we get a linear equation here. And if we bring this exponential form into this linear equation, we will get equation, second-order equation on lambda. So since the C star is equal to 2 square root of 1 minus A, so this equation admits only one root. Only one root, so it says equal to square root of one minus a. So, this is root is a double root. So, by some standard ODE ODE theory, we know that the asymptotic behavior of the traveling wave is given by the linear combination of the two eigen functions, which is z exponential minus numz. Exponential minus numz and exponential minus z. And so the coefficient AB here cannot be equal to zero at the same time. And our main result, theorem one, shows that the coefficient in front of that times exponential minus that, the A, the coefficient A here converts to zero, B goes to B star. B goes to B star. So it means that the leading order switched from that at times exponential minus Z to exponential minus Z at this critical at the threshold, at the transition front. So our second result is trichotomy classification of the traveling. Classification of the traveling wave. So when the speed C equals C star and the C star is linear selected, the asymptotic behavior of the minimum traveling wave, so because here C is equal to C star, so it's a minimal traveling wave. The asymptotic behavior of the minimal traveling waves is given like this. Given like this. So, as I explained in the last slider, so in this case, when C is equal to this value, so this lambda equation admits only one root, one square root of one minus a. So, this is a double root. So, the asymptotic behavior of Behavior of U is given by the linear combination of these two eigenfunction. And for the case, C star is non-linear selected and C equal to C star. The asymptotic behavior of the travel wave is given like this. Uh, given like this, so in this case, since c is strictly larger than two square roots of one minus a, so the lambda equation admits two simple roots, larger one and small one. And here, the lambda positive u is indicates the larger one. So, in this case, the traveling wave decay with Traveling wave decay with the faster rate. And for the case, C is strictly larger than C star, the critical speed C star. So in this case, this lambda equation also admits two simple roots, a smaller one and the larger one. And here, the lambda u minus in case the smaller one. So in this case, So, in this case, the trembling wave is decays with the slower reach. So, this kind of classification for the single equation is well known, but for the system, for the local system, the proof is far from trivial, especially the second one. So, we need to use some super analysis. I use some super and sub solution argument to prove it. Okay, so I think I should stop here. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions? Questions Donia and I actually have a question. So for the if I'm not sure I understood you correctly, but for the multiple case, you require B greater than one. Yes, for the system, yes. The system, yes, for the yes, when B is larger than one, so the system is of monostable case. Yes. So yes, and then when you define this B star, can we look at this page where you define B star? If B star is, sorry, B star is given like here. The star is given like here. Yes, so now if you fix A between 0 and 1, you let B change, then what's the trend wave? The wave of traveling waves. So for B is more than one, it's a light. is uh it's uh it's like uh the the right the right uh traveling wave i dropped on the picture so the the shape is the difference with the monostept wave yes yes the shape is different but the propagation the the the the the property of the wave on the invading states are almost the same as the monstable wave okay so you Okay, so you automatically change the traveling wave limit at minus infinity when C goes from bigger than one to bigger than one. Okay. Yes. So in this case, we still can define the minimal traveling speeds. So the C style still exists. Yeah, okay, yeah. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. One question for you. When B is strictly less than B star, you're well inside the linearly determined regime, how do you show that the coefficient in front of lambda e to the minus lambda or whatever is positive? That coefficient capital A? Excuse me, can you repeat? Excuse me, can you repeat your question again? Yeah, so down below, you say that your general solution will look like capital A times Z e to the minus lambda Z plus B. So you mean here? You mean here? That's right. Okay. So how do you go about showing that capital A is strictly positive? So if capital K Okay, so the capture A is greater than or equal to zero. It's non-nective. Otherwise, you best. Yes, you is strictly less than B star. Capital A is strictly positive, I believe. That's okay. So if B is strictly larger than B star, it's become the non-linear selection case. Selection case. So, in non-linear selection case, the coefficient here, the lambda, will change. I was asking about B less than B star. Okay, B less than B star is a linear selection case. So, we can write the solution as a linear combination in this way. So, if A is negative, then the U B becomes a negative. The UB become negative because this is the leading order. Okay, maybe I'll send you a question after that. Yeah, because of final limitations, maybe we stop the discussion now. And so thank Donia again.
