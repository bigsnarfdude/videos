Okay, shall we start? Is anybody missing their neighbor? Yeah, then let's continue with the second talk of the morning session. If one elliptic curve is not enough, here will be two of them. A pleasure to announce Andrei Pokaka to hear about the epsilon form of the differential equations for the five-mass height integral. Please go ahead, Andrei. Please go ahead, Andre. I'd like to first start off by thanking the organizers. It's a great pleasure to be able to tell you all about some recent work here. And this is done in collaboration with Michu at McGill, Francesca, who's in the audience, and also Joan, who is Oliver's student. So I want to start by just motivating why we care about hyogenous Feynman integrals. Genus five-minute integrals. Then I want to spend a decent amount of time describing the three-mass sunrise, which depends on one elliptic curve, because this is going to form the basis for everything we do for the kite. So we need a good understanding of that. And then we'll move on to actually looking at this five-mass kite, which depends on two elliptic curves. And this is because it has two sunrises, which each have their own elliptic curve as soft topologies. The sunrise. The sunrise integrals, they come with two punctures each. And this is not enough to encode the kinematics of the five mask kites. We have to identify new variables on the torus and new punctures. And we'll do that by integrating max cuts. And then we will find a basis, we'll sort of algorithmically build the gauge transformation that takes us to epsilon form using. form using essentially modular covariates. And then once we have this epsilon form differential equation, we want to write it in terms of nice functions on the torus. So we'll pull it back and write everything in terms of these nice EMPL kernels. And then if time permits, I'll say a few things about initial conditions and what we found by trying to actually integrate this thing. Okay, so yeah, so it turns out that actually. Yeah, so it turns out that actually for a long time people thought that all Feynman integrals would evaluate to MPLs and they studied Phi 4 periods or even in Super Yang Mills, you have to either go to very high loops or high loops to being high and many points. And so it took a while before the first counterexample was really found where we saw something beyond MPLs. And this is something that it This is something that had an elliptic structure. But now we have a decent understanding of what the function space is at genus one. They're iterated integrals on a bunch of torus, and we call them EMPLs. And the first sort of, if you allow masses, the first easy example is this two-loop sunrise integral. So it's kind of amazing that it took so long to actually find this. But yeah, anyways, we can, when we're interested in just understanding what kind of objects And just understanding what kind of objects can appear in a generic quantum field theory, it turns out that there's a whole zoo of things. So we get these hyper-elliptic or genus, what? Oh, you don't think it will get hyper-elliptic? Okay. I mean, okay, that's good. Okay, that's fine. I mean, I'm okay, sure. I'm just referring to Andrew's work. You can fight. And I guess we'll also hear a talk by Sven tomorrow. Okay. But we do see clavios and so. And so there's been a sort of new industry of people really just wanting to understand these new objects that can appear in quantum field theory. So one of the first examples was these all-loop banana integrals, which depend on Clavius. We also see them in gravitational waves, as Roger told us on the first day. And it also appears in integrability. And in general, we actually don't really expect an upper bound to the complexity of. An upper bound to the complexity of the algebraic curves that would appear in a generic quantum field theory. And so the question is: how do we deal with this complexity? But for today, I'm actually going to just stay at genus one. And then sort of interesting thing is going to be that we have two elliptic curves to deal with instead of just one. So we're going to look at the sunrise integral, five minutes sunrise. Essentially, it's the most generic two point. Generic two-point, two-point function, sorry, two-loop, two-point function. And interestingly, all the elliptic structure comes from the two sunrise topologies. And so if you actually took the max cut of this guy, you'd actually find something that looks polylogarithmic. And I'm making no assumption on that. So it's just the Feynman. That's so it's just the Feynman integral at this at this point. So I'm trying to stay theory agnostic. But yes, someone who's more familiar with standard model, it would be, yeah, I don't know what you would fill this in with to actually get it to appear in collider physics or something like that. I'm not too sure. Please. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Beyond the standard model stuff, I guess. And so, and yeah, so it's not a so taking the sort of like maximal cut is not a good enough check. You have to take the maximal cut of all of its subtopologies as well, because that's where this gets all of its elliptic structure from. So, our goal is going to be to derive this epsilon form differential equation. And so, we need to start by guessing. Exactly, exactly, yeah. Exactly, exactly, yeah, yeah. And so we have to guess a basis of integrals. We're going to guess a crappy basis at first. There's 30 of them. We're going to just take the sort of normal thing. So we take the kite. We're going to take the four propagator subtopologies. We, I don't know, these look like eyeballs to us. So we're going to call these four guys eyeball topologies. They'll play an important role. And then we get these Harry Potter glasses. So blue and red correspond to the two different elliptic curves that will appear. Okay. That will appear. Okay? And anything in green is just polylog. So that's our four propagator subtopologies. And three propagator subtopologies. We have the two sonmars sectors. And yes, this basis is not an epsilon form. It's just something that you can put into the IBP thing. And then these are all our, we can ignore the green guys for the most part. There's just 30 of them. And then we get these final double tadpole guys at the end. Guys, at the end. So the first step is just to find a differential equation. And we know that these, that once you choose a basis Feynman integral, the differential equation looks something like this. And the generic solution is a path-ordered exponential. And we'd like to truncate this to some order in epsilon. And this is very easy to do if this matrix A is linear in epsilon. Is linear in epsilon, and that's it. But from this basis that I showed you before, it's a, in some sense, a bad basis. And we have this epsilon to the power zero piece right here, which is screwing everything up. We can't easily truncate this. Different orders talk to each other in complicated ways. And so what we want to do is find a systematic way to remove this a to the zero part. Okay, let's review the three-mass sunrise. So you can actually find a one-fold integral representation of the sunrise. You get the following dx over y, which is the holomorphic form. So y squared is equal to a fourth degree polynomial in x here. So this thing has a square root branch cut, and it also comes with this complicated law. But you can actually also. law. But you can actually also find, it's kind of hard to find one fold integral representation, so most convenient to just take the maximum cut and you can read off y from that as well. Okay, so just some elliptics 101. We sort of start here where I've drawn an elliptic curve, but it's with one root at infinity. And we're interested in working on this space where we sort of understand the mathematics best. Best. And so our integral, it has a square root branch cut because y is a square root, and we have four roots, so there's two different branches, and we have two sheets. And so the way to get to this picture is to sort of blow up these branch cuts, take each copy of a complex plane, glue them along these branches, and we get a torus. And we see that the two different independent cycles that we get from circling different pairs of roots just map onto the A and B cycles here. A and B cycles here, which in this picture right here, which is the complex plane, where we work a modulo some lattice where it's you know z plus z tau, and we identify any z, sorry, too many z's here, any puncture, like any small z plus plus this lattice. And so the a cycle will just be this one from zero to one, and the b is zero to tau, and tau is just the ratio. Is just the ratio of the holomorphic form along these two periods. Okay, so yeah, so how do we go back and forth? Or well, actually, we're not going to be interested in going back. We're going to be just interested in this direction. So how do we go in that direction? It's through Abel's map. And so first, before even going to Abel's map, we already see new functions. We can take this dx over y, and we can integrate it between pairs of roots, and we're going to get new functions. We're going to get new functions that we didn't see at genus one. And tau is going to be the ratio of these two periods, psi two over psi one. And Abel's map takes a pair x and y, and we get a coordinate z on the torus by doing this integral and modding by the lattice. And there's two images, one for the plus root, one for plus y and the other one for minus y. Okay. Okay, an important feature, or important thing later, is that the lattice is not really unique. We can do modular SL2Z transformations and play with tau and still get the same thing. And so understanding, well, there's these objects or nice functions here that I should say called quasi-modular forms, and they transform in a very particular way under these. Under these modular transformations. And the modular behavior of the things is actually going to basically fix a lot of this gauge transformation and guide us how to get to epsilon form. So this is very important. Okay. So I think this is the last slide of mathematics. We need these EMPL kernels. kernels, which Oliver introduced, well, he introduced higher genus and also talked a little bit about these guys on Monday. And you get these by just taking some ratio of theta functions with some auxiliary parameter eta and expanding in eta. And then the coefficients of eta are quasi-modular forms. And these are the integration kernels for the elliptic polylogs, which we denote here, but we actually won't really need. We actually won't really need this. And I guess the only thing to say is that at genus zero, weight and depth were really the same object. Here they're not. You have to sum over these things. So these kernels, they have a quasi-modular form of weight n. So they are the analog of a d log. So they have this type of simple pole behavior. But there's an infinite tower of them. And that's. Infinite tower of them. And that's the difference. So we not only have weight, but we have the modular weight as well. So when we talk about weight, we usually add up all these numbers. Okay, so back to physics. We have this kite integral. It has five scales, five masses, one external momentum, and we can build these five dimensionless parameters. Dimensionless parameters. We have these three for one of the sunrise integrals and these three for the other sunrise integrals. And so they really, these two sunrise really share one of these kinematic parameters. And so for each sunrise sector, we have an elliptic curve. Oh, I should say I'm going to denote the different sectors by just which masses appear. So the red is 1, 2, 3, and the blue is 345. So we have two elliptic curves defined by each of these sunrises. We have periods for each, and we have. We have periods for each, and we have these modulated parameters, tau for each. And everything we can do, we can find all of the explicit expressions for all of these things. And I don't want to show that here. So we also know an epsilon form basis for this integral. So on the max cut, the epsilon form basis that I want to use is a linear combination of these things right here. So we have Of these things right here. So we have the holomorphic form normalized by the period. We have the holomorphic form with some additional poles. And then we have the derivative of the holomorphic form. And this is important because I really don't want to normalize by the inverse period matrix here, because this introduces explicit factors of tau in your basis. And tau doesn't transform, is not a modular form. It depends on the A and B parameters in your modules. Depends on the A and B parameters in your modular transformation. And so I don't know actually, when I have explicit tiles, I don't know how to integrate that. I don't know how to write it in terms of EMPL kernels, because this is outside of the quasi-modular, it's not a quasi-modular, or at least that's what I, and maybe somebody else knows how to do it, but this is where I get stuck with the inverse period matrix prescription. Okay, and oh, yes, I should say, I think Sarah's going to talk about this tomorrow, about this work, Labial. Tomorrow, about this work, Labiel's, and she will also, I think, say some virtues of this basis where we take derivatives of the holomorphic. Yeah, okay, so for the sunrise, the punctures, these sort of kinematic variables that we get on the torus, come from taking Abel's map of where these poles are. So that's where we're going to get our two punctures. There's actually a third one, but it's linearly related to these two. Nearly related to these two. So there's only two independent degrees of freedom. And the differential equations for the sunrise, they are EMPL kernels whose arguments are just specific linear, like Q-linear combinations of these two punctures. Okay. Okay, so on to the kite. I feel like I'm rushing. Do I have how how long have I? Do I have how long have I? 15 minutes overall. Okay, I can probably slow down. Okay. Okay, so yeah, so each sunrise has three degrees of freedom. And there's a given by the modulus tau, two punctures. And then there's this third one, which I said, but it's not independent. Okay, so we can kind of ignore it for the rest of the talk. And the sunrise, so sunrise has these. So, sunrise has these three degrees of freedom, but the kite has five. So, there was a very confusing question that we had at the beginning: do we work on basically M13 cross M13? Or do we work on M15? And this took a really long time for us to figure out what to do. And so this, so I mean, this is also already too big of a space. You would need to take some slice of it. But it turns out that this is actually really not the right object. That this is actually really not the right object to work with. We need to go here. It is not, it's different elliptic curves. Yeah. And so, and the reason why we want to go here is because we actually only know how to define EMPL and their kernels with respect to a single elliptic curve. So, and yeah, so this tau is only going to know about the Landau locus for one given sunrise. Locus for one given sunrise at a time. And so, what we need to do is we need to have two of these spaces, one for each elliptic curve, where we have extra punctures that are going to encode the additional degrees of freedom that we have on the kite. And we have a choice. We can map everything onto either one of these tori will be the solution. Okay. So, how do I I actually describe the kinematics of the kite with respect to this red torus. Well, the sunrise gave me two punctures already, and I need two more degrees of freedom. So the idea is actually to just take the maximal cut of these eyeball diagrams and then do an integral. An integral. It seems kind of strange at first. Why would you do this? But if you do, you get something that looks like this, where these two objects really look like a puncture. They have the same functional form. If I wrote down the explicit expression, you would go, ah, these just look like punctures. So we're going to take those as our punctures. And it turns out that we can do this for the other torus as well. So we have two options. We can embed all of the kinematics into the red torus or all the kinematics into the blue torus. And these integrals. And these integrals over max cuts might seem strange, but they actually appear naturally if we went through the gauge transformation procedure without doing this first. So that's why we think it's a nice prescription. And you can also find the sunrise punctures through a limiting procedure of these integrals over x cuts. And why we think it's a nice procedure is because, okay, these are indefinite integrals that I showed you before to get these. That I showed you before to get these punctures. So there is some sort of notion of shifting by half periods or something like that, but we hope that this is at least something close to a canonical change. The gauge transformation, meaning the transformation for the basis that takes us to epsilon form. Okay, so that's how we get the functions. Now I actually need to construct this gauge transformation that takes us to epsilon four. That takes us to epsilon form. So let me first just show you the structure of the initial differential equation for our bad basis. So it looked like this. We have this top sector of the sunrise. It's all polylog until you get to these sunrises and you start to see some elliptics. You have these eyeball topologies, which look the same. It's all polylog until you hit sunrise, but they only talk to just one sunrise. This guy talks to both. And then we have the sunrise set. Both. And then we have the sunrise sectors themselves. So that's where the elliptics are hidden inside this matrix. So our goal is going to be to construct a matrix U such that I get some new basis J, which is U dot I, and its differential equation, DJ, is epsilon some matrix B times J. This is the end goal. And B has to be independent of epsilon. Okay, so we're going to do this in steps. So I'm going to construct a sequence or a series of these u's. series of these u's and the full u is just their they're their product and then each time i do this gauge transformation i get a new differential equation and a new basis so i get a new basis j i and a new differential equation which is just given by the standard gauge transformation of the of the uh of the original differential equation or the previous differential equation uh wants to be a recursion j equals u j one of the j minus oh i'm sorry these should be j minus one apologies yes uh Yes. Yes, yes. This j should be j minus one. Yeah, and so we're going to start with our initial seeds, which is j0, which is our starting basis, and b0, which is our starting differential equation. So the first step is to go take the sunrise sectors and put them in epsilon form. This is already known how to do, so we can just apply this transformation. We can just apply this transformation. Outside of the sunrise sectors, we still have some epsilon to the power of zero components that we need to get rid of, but everything above is in nice epsilon form. And this gauge transformation, what does it introduce? It introduces periods and their derivatives. And these are the only things that actually carry modular weight or know about the elliptic structure. Everything else is rational differential forms in the kinematics. In the kinematics. So, when I want to think about the modular weight of thing, everything's going to be modular invariant except for where these two functions appear. And that's going to make it really easy to actually understand the modular behavior of each term in my differential equation when I want to now then map that back to the torus. Okay, so the second step is to remove the remaining diet. is to remove the remaining diagonal terms in this piece that we don't want here. These diagonal terms are all correspond to the maximal cut of the kite and the eyeballs, which, as I alluded to earlier, look polylogarithmic. There's nothing interesting happening there. So I just normalize by the inverse maximal cut as usual, or at least the epsilon to the power zero point. And once I do that, I get a new differential equation. And it still has an epsilon to the power zero piece here. So I've got this B2 zero. zero piece here so I've got this B2 zero but this time it's a strictly lower triangular. Okay so the next thing is well I want to make sure that this matrix is closed because I need to do some sort of integration and I want to do this in a path invariant way. So one way to make sure that this is closed is by enforcing that B30 wedge B30 is vanishes. And then Vanishes. And then, via integrability, we're guaranteed that this thing will be closed. And it turns out that this condition is much easier to solve than the other one. Then trying to solve the full integrability, like, yeah, okay, yeah, in general. So yeah, anyways, this equation, this implies that our unknown variable u here has to solve this differential equation. And here, it's actually simple enough to just. It's actually simple enough to just integrate. And you'll get some debraic function of the kinematics. So nothing special is happening there. And so B03 is now closed. And now we want to remove it. And you do this by integrating. But we know that this contains difficult, hard elliptic functions. So we want to solve this in a way that actually avoids direct. In a way that actually avoids direct integration. And we can do this by exploiting the modular properties of our functions here. So let me just remind you what the modular transformation is. You take tau to a tau plus b over c tau plus d, and z transforms similarly, where a, d, b, and c are integers satisfy this equation. And as I said before, these are the only two objects that have any sort of modular weight. Two objects that have any sort of modular weight. The period transforms like a modular form of weight one, and this derivative of the period transforms like a quasi-modular form of weight. Okay, so how does this work in practice? Well, we want to solve this top equation over here. And to do that, we're going to isolate the different pieces in this matrix V03 via their modular properties. Via their modular properties. We have one part that's proportional to psi period and another part that's proportional to its derivative. And then these coefficients here are just rational differential forms in the kinematic variables. So this whole B3 guy transforms like the derivative of a weight one modular form. And so if I look back here, if I'm to make this equation consistent, that means that this. Consistent, that means that this u also needs to be a weight one modular form. Okay, so now what I want to do is I want to take this equation and actually do a modular transformation. And I'm going to assume that this equality holds at the top. So after I do that, I get the same equality again right here times this piece C tau plus D, but this vanishes by assumption. And then we're left on top right here is actually an algebraic equation for the determined. Algebraic equation for determining this unknown u. So I don't actually have to do any integration. Okay? So what I do is I just take these differential forms in here and I expand them into dxi by d tau, dxi by dzi, and I match the d tau pieces. And I'll get this equation right here. So this right here is completely fixed. So this right here is completely fixed, and we compute these dx by d tau by looking at the inverse of this Jacobian, where we change variables from our initial kinematic space to the variables on the torus. Hopefully that's clear. Okay, so now we have a sequence of gauge transformations that guaranteed to take us to epsilon four. to to um epsilon four and we can we check that we numerically check that that um our diff that that this thing does indeed vanish and we have no higher terms in in epsilon so um but at the moment everything is still written in differential forms in on like the kinematic space like in terms of the capital i's and this is not we don't know how to integrate any of these these these these these things so we need to map this differential equation in the space Differential equation in the space of x's to some differential forms on the torus where we actually know how to integrate. Okay. Okay, so what is the procedure? Well, I think I've said it multiple times. We need to understand the modular weight of each element of this matrix B. And then we make an ASATS on the moduli space of in terms of different. In terms of differential forms on the moduli space of the torus, that has the same modular properties that we know from the element of b. Okay, we also know, yeah, okay, then we'll fix everything using numerical evaluation. And the cool thing is that we know that these chronecker forms are closed differential forms on the moduli space of the punctured torus. They contain these quasi-modular. They contain these quasi-modular functions that I introduced before. These are the EMPL kernels. And we know that what appears in the arguments here are Q linear combinations of the punctures. So that means by doing this numerical evaluation and fixing whatever Q coefficients are inside of this argument, we actually fix it analytically. So even though we're doing some numerical matching, we actually get the analytic function in the end. function in the end. Okay, oh yes, and I should specify that these Kronecker differential forms, they transform like a modular weight, modular form of weight, quasi-modular form of weight, k minus 2. There's a shift by 2 here, which will play important role for this slide. So here is the modular structure of our differential equation. So I've written down what What omega indices appear here? So the four corresponds to a Pasi-monitor form of weight two, so k minus minus two, as on the previous slide. So because of this, I know exactly what I should build an ansatz of, right? You know, I should, here I should build an ansatz of omega kr4s, here twos, and so on, right? So this is the sunrise block, and this is actually solved. We know how to do that. And so the interesting thing. How to do that. And so the interesting thing is that here we have a bunch of d log forms in the kite and eyeball sector until we get to these two rows of the two columns of the sunrise where we start to see things that have weight one, quasi-larger weight one. And if you were to take B, this matrix, and dot it into itself, like multiple times, to see how these two elliptic sectors would mix. Two elliptic sectors would mix, what you would find is that these two red and blue sectors are only going to mix using d log forms. Okay, and this is really important because the d log form is something that's modular invariant. And this means that I can really write it on either torus. There's an easy prescription to write it on either torus. So this mixing is not a problem. I can still write my final answer as a... Write my final answer as iterated integrals on each torus separately without the two mixing. Okay, so right, what does our ANSATS look like? Oh, actually, let me talk about the D-log forms. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. So there's a bunch of, yeah, okay, so there's these delog forms on the diagonal, and we need to map these onto the torus. So the only chronic reform that is modified. The only chronic reform that is modular invariant is this Kr2. So we take some ANSATs, where we have a bunch of KR2s, we put linear combinations of the punctures in the argument here, and we're also allowed to multiply tau by some number like this. So we take a sufficiently large ansatz here. And how do we get these set of linear combinations of the functions? Combinations of the punctures is by examining the tau to I infinity limit, where this chronic reform has become becomes nice. It just becomes a regular d log of sine of z. So by doing this for each d log form along the diagonal, we build up a list of these li's and that we will populate our ANSATs with. So a concrete example is that this concrete example is that this component, the eyeball, eyeball component, contains a d log of x0. If I take the tau to i infinity limit of these omega forms and map this x0 to the torus, I find the following d log of sines and the two punctures here. That means that z1 and z2 are things that can belong in this. Are things that can belong in this list that I can stick in my arguments? And the amazing thing is that we find that we don't need anything beyond what we find from doing this examination on the diagonal. So we basically get all of the singularities from just looking at the d log forms of the diagonal. Okay, so once we know or have this list of List of linear forms in terms of the punctures, it's pretty easy to actually pull back the differential equation to the torus. So here is the type of things that we see in this, that we'll stick into the arguments of this chronic form. These simple ones, Z1, Z2, and Z1 plus Z2, come from the sunrise. Then we get some new guys that come from the eyeball. And then this last guy from. This last guy from the kite, and so now that we have this list, all we have to do is plug them into some ANSAT. And now our goal is to just fix what coefficients, what numerical coefficients appear in front of these things. So we're just basically fixing these threes using numerical methods. Okay. So yeah, okay, great. So we have these. Yeah, okay, great. So we have these Karniker forms, and now we can actually integrate the differential equation in terms of elliptic polylogarithm. And to do that, we also need a boundary or initial condition. So we found one at this specific point, and then we were able to cross-check against pi sect deck for small p squared, and we got numerical matching. Moving away from this point, we had trouble. This could be due to our. This could be due to our own lack of understanding of how these public codes work, like GNAC and stuff. But the point is that we can write down an analytic expression in terms of EMPLs for what these integrals, for what the kite evaluates to, but we had trouble evaluating it numerically. So maybe if somebody here is good at that, I'd be happy to hear more. I don't know off the top of my head, but we can. We found that GNAC was very unstable, that if I move the numeric points a bit. No, PySec doesn't, we could match with PySect. It was GNAC, which meant that I had an analytic expression for the MPLs. It was evaluating the MPLs. That was hard. We were getting numerical instabilities. We were getting numerical instabilities. Going, going, yes, going away from this soft limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We were in the Euclidean. Yeah, yeah. Great. Then I would love to discuss more. So, this is why I put this in the slide, is to just tell you where I had problems. I'm not good at numerics, and maybe somebody else has can show me how to actually evaluate. How to actually evaluate these EMPLs in a good way. No, no, EMPLs. EMPLs, yeah, that was the problem is we had these EMPL, we had it specific, right? You want to say, oh, great, I have this nice analytic formula, but now I want to evaluate it numerically. And this is where we ran into trouble. So the only way we could figure out how to get it to work was like just some, you know, taking, we have a series representation for. We have a series representation for these things that seem to do okay in some regions. We didn't try using iterated modular modules. We wanted to get EMPLs. That was the goal. But yeah, it does seem that other people are also singing the virtues of iterated modular. modular forms as being better converged and better for numeric evaluation. Anyways, that's it. So what we did, what we managed to do was parameterize the kite kinematic space in a way that's compatible with the elliptic nature of two sunrise subtopologies. We found an algebraic procedure to construct a gauge transformation to epsilon. Transformation to epsilon form that avoids the need to, well, not completely avoids, but it avoids the trickiest bits, the trickiest integrations by exploiting modular properties. And to fix what are arguments we can put into our ANSATs on these differential forms on the moduli space of the tower, we used this tau to i infinity limit to basically find the Landau locus on this moduli space. And then we did some numerical boots. And then we did some numerical bootstrapping to find actual analytic forms for our differential equation. And then we found some initial conditions and matched with some public and found that we could match leading order with some already public code. So feature directions is, well, it's a bit awkward to have these two elliptic sectors floating around. So we really have. Floating around. So we really have EMPLs. We're really saying take a sum of EMPLs for one torus and add a bunch of EMPLs from the other torus to it. So we really have two kind of distinct objects that we're adding together. And it'd be nice if we could figure out how to parameterize, you know, have one geometric object instead of two. I don't know how to do this. It seems maybe unlikely, but okay. It'd be more interesting to also test our method of, you know. Our method of getting this epsilon factorized differential form for other multi-scale problems with several elliptic curves. I mean, we could be really ambitious, and I put the penta box, but that's very far away. And yeah, okay, this seems, this could be just me, but at the moment, I don't know how to efficiently evaluate these EMPLs numerically and stably. So I do think that there's still work needs to be done there. And yeah. We do hither? And yeah, what parts, what ideas from this analysis actually carry over to multi-scale, hyper elliptic, and flavio? That's it. Thanks so much for your time. Yeah, we have plenty of time for questions. Who would like to start? Technica, please. Um can you go to the page thirty four I think where you said about the fixed thing? Here you said it fixes W's numerically. What did you fix numerically? What I fixed numerically were these coefficients three and four and two. But you knew that it would be numbers. Yeah, I knew that they would be numbers. And so that was part of the whole point of just like, I wanted my basis to have these nice positive. To have these nice quasi, to transform as quasi-modular forms. So I knew I would land in this space. And then once I know I land in this space, I have differential forms in which I can write an ANSAT score. And I know that the only thing that I have to fix are these guys here, which I got from the d logs and taking the tau to i infinity limit. So the only thing that was left to fix was just three factors, numbers, which I knew were gonna be in Q. So that's why the numerics is very powerful. So that's why the numax is very powerful here, because it's fairly small ansats, and I'm just fixing factors of two and three. Okay. And one more question about this condition on closed. It's not on this, but in the beginning, you said you have to make sure that this matrix that you multiply transform is also closed. But why do you have to do it at this stage? Because I assume that because if they are fine, the integrals and finishes already set up the prices, right? It does, but I want to. It does, but I want to remove a piece, right? I've broken up my differential equation into epsilon zero piece plus an epsilon piece. The whole thing is closed. But I want to make sure that this epsilon to the zero piece is closed because I want to remove it in an unambiguous way that does not depend on how I integrate. Yes. More questions? I was wondering in the context of your follow-up questions, you mentioned several elliptic curves, Pentabox or whatnot. Are there interesting examples with two elliptic curves which don't have this Z2 symmetry of the right, like reflection symmetry along the middle edge, which probably makes your two elliptic curves enter on equal footing? Yes. Is it straightforward to extend to a case where the symmetry is not there? We hope so. We don't really see it. We hope so. We don't really see an issue with that, but I think we need to get our hands on an example, right? Do you think of an example? We haven't yet. Okay. Yes. With two different elliptic curves. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, okay, we wanted to look at it. I mean, okay, we wanted to look at something that they didn't do, but yes, we could maybe, maybe it is worth checking that out as well. But yeah, so the problem right now is that, I mean, so we need an initial differential equation to really play with any of these things. So the bottleneck is we have to guess a crappy basis and find an initial differential equation for this, and that requires doing a lot of IVPs. So for example, like the next step up might be the act node. Like the next step up might be the app node. So this is like the crossbox. Can you draw that? Something like that, where we have the masses on the inner and out. But so far we have not been able to get the IVPs to finish. So we really need something with less scales and more elliptic curves in order to play with things. To play with things. Or we need to recruit somebody who's very good at IVPs. Sorry? No, I don't. You have? Yes. Do you want do you want to do you want to draw it? Please. Oh, okay. I've never seen this one before. Just the same mass, I can just put equal mass everywhere. You can, yeah. Okay, and it has multiple elliptic sectors, is the thing? You don't know, okay, okay. But it might be easier than the crossbox, is what you're saying. Yeah, okay. If I put enough masses, I expect some elliptics, so yeah. Might what look like what? Your office experience, you can do angular thing. Yeah, okay, yeah. But I mean, if anybody has some interesting multi-elliptic curve integrals and they already have a differential equation for some, you know, let's say bad choice of basis, you know, we would like to get our hands on that as our starting point. No, no, no. That's also a source of sort of mystery at the moment. We know we need to introduce additional elliptic functions on the torus to keep track of the new kinematics. Kinematics. You know, so in the sunrise, these punctures have the interpretation of the integration contour, the singular surface going through the integration, like the vertices of the integration contour. Maybe I'll draw. We have some like simplex, and then there's some curvy thing that goes through. That goes through each of these points, and at least have the interpretation as functions for the sunrise. And so for us, we don't really know what they correspond to in a sense like this. But okay, okay, okay. Okay, I can say that, so okay, yeah, let me say this instead. So I'm still actually a bit confused about this picture. I'm still actually a bit confused about this picture. So, the way I like to think about getting these punctures is like this. So, if I go to the max cut, I have these additional poles that are still there. And that's where I'm getting my punctures from. And so, the same thing kind of happens in the max cut of these eyeball diagrams. I have some additional pole, so then when I integrate, I get some new elliptic function that knew about that pole. And that's what I'm calling these new punctures. These new punctures. That XI would be the ball of the eyeball. Yeah, yeah. So, so, so, well, okay, these are for this one, but there's a similar story for the eyeball, where like Z4, for example, would know about the extra propagator that the eyeball has that the sunrise doesn't have. So you get those additional questions? There was briefly a yes-no discussion about genus. Is this material for private conversation or something for public? If so, now or tomorrow. Okay, I'll just ask you in private. Thanks to an active audience. Thanks a lot for your wonderful talk, Andrei. Thank you.
