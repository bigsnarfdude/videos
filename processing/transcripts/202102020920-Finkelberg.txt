Okay. So, thank you very much for the invitation. It's a great honor for me. In fact, I have dreamed of visiting Banff for many years, and now finally, my dreams are as close to their realization as ever. So, So, my talk will be as well, slight variation of the previous talk by Sasha. And as he explained, given a compact, simple group, structure group K, one can study the monopoles, say Euclidean monopoles with this structure group. With the structure group, and in fact, there is a hierarchy: there are Euclidean monopoles, periodic monopoles, and doubly periodic monopoles or monopoles with this structure group. And as Sasha explained, there's a theory due to Donaldson in type A and Hortubes for classical groups and Jarvis in general that identifies the moduli space of Euclidean. Space of Euclidean monopoles with maximal symmetry breaking at infinity with the modelized space of based rational maps to the corresponding flag variety of the structure group K. And I will talk about the similar algebraic geometric incarnations of periodic monopoles and doubly periodic monopoles. Okay, so to begin with, we replace To begin with, we replace the compact group K with its algebraic version complexification. So just a semi-simple complex algebraic group G. We will also need a complex smooth projective curve X that will specify X to be a line or punctured line. A line or punctured line or elliptic curve later on, but we start with a general curve. We also need the standard Cartan and Borel subgroups and the opposite unipotent subgroup. And we fix a degree or topological charge. This degree will be a positive element, the core root lattice, that is a positive linear combination. Positive linear combination of simple corals. And then we define the moduli space, the main character of this talk, the open Zastova space. So this is the moduli space of G bundles on our curve X equipped with a flag that is B structure of degree alpha and also another sort of flag. Sort of flag and minus structure that is generically transversal to the first flag. It is known to be, this moduli space is known to be a connected smooth variety of dimension twice the length of alpha. And it comes equipped with a very important structure, namely the so-called factorization projection to the configure colored configuration space of our Colored configuration space of our curve. Namely, it remembers the points where our two flags are not transversal. And with respect to this projection, the Zastava space has a local nature. It means that the inverse image of any analytic disk inside the curve is independent of the curve. So, for example, we can define the Zastwa space for a D-score for any affine open algebraic curve because of this locality. Okay, and now we make a contact with the monopole theory. So, we consider our curve to be the additive group. Group, or in other words, we take its completion projective line, but we require that our two flags are transversal at infinity. Then the image of this transition projection never meets the infinity, so it actually lands into the configuration space of the affine line. And this additive Zastava space is isomorphic to the moduli space of. Isomorphic to the moduli space of Euclidean monopoles with the co-compact structure group with maximal symmetry breaking at infinity and topological charge alpha. And in particular, it carries a hypercolor structure and hence a holomorphic symplectic form. And I want to explain the algebraic geometric construction of this symplectic form and then it's explained. Form and then its explicit calculation. So the modular construction of symplectic form comes from the shifted symplectic framework. And just let me say two words following Tony Pintev and Tom Spade: that the classifying stack of our group G has a Group G has a natural two-shifted symplectic structure, somehow coming from the killing form. And the map from classifying space of Borel to the classifying space of G has a quasotropic structure. But Zastva space, we know that it's the based, the model space of based rational maps to the flag variety. So in other words, it's just a flag. Just a fiber of the projection from based rational maps to the classifying space of Borel to the based rational maps to the classifying space of G. So in other words, it's the Cartesian product of this projection P and just a bedding of point. And so this So, this Cartesian product inherits just a usual symplectic structure. And this is the one I have in mind. And this is the structure that comes from the hypercolor structure. Okay, so now I want to describe it explicitly in coordinates. And to this end, I explain why this factorization projection. Why this factorization projection to the base curve is called factorization. Because if you consider the fiber of this projection over a divisor of degree alpha, which splits into a disjoint union of two smaller divisors of degree beta and gamma, then the fiber of Zastava space over this big divisor is. Big divisor is just the direct product of two smaller fibers of degree beta and gamma. This is called the factorization property. And because of this, away from diagons, we are reduced to just the product of the simplest possible Zastova spaces of degree, just one simple coroot. Simple core root. And each such moduli space is very simple, just two-dimensional, and it's the product of the base curve additive line and the fiber just multiplicative group, punctured a fine line. And once again, due to this factorization property, away from diagonals, this gives rise to the The collection of horizontal coordinates in the additive line and vertical coordinates wise in the multiplicative group. And they are well defined up to simultaneous permutation. So they are sort of etal coordinates. And now, in terms of these coordinates, I can write down an explicit formula for this symplectic structure. And well, instead of doing literally Instead of doing literally this, I just explain what is the coordinate change to the Darboux coordinates. And you see it here, I just multiply the vertical y coordinates by certain products of differences of the horizontal coordinates. And to do this, I have to change to choose an orientation of my Dinkin graph because I take Yeah, because I take products over arrows in the graph. And then I obtain a sort of semi-logarithmic Darboux coordinates. Okay, this is the desired explicit formula. And let me say a few words about the related integrable system, because you see from this explicit formula that this factorization projection is an integrable system. So the An integrable system, so the w coordinates they all pass on commute, and this integrable system was studied in the foundational book by I.T. Hitchin about magnetic monopoles. So this is called the IT Hitchin integrable system. And in case, in fact, I.T. Hitchin studied it just for SU2. And in this case, And in this case, the degree alpha is just a positive integer d, and this Ati-Hitchen system just coincides with the total phase space of open-tode system for GLD. So in particular, the base, the configuration space on the affine line, identifies with the cost and slice for the Lie algebra GLD, and the total phase space is identified with the universal centralizer. Centralizer. So an element in the cost and slice and the commuting element in the group GLD. Okay, we have yet one other description of this same integrable system, namely we take this smallest zust of a space of degree one, which is just the product of the additive and multiplicative groups. That's an algebraic surface equipped with the natural Natural symplectic structure. And the whole total phase space or Zastava space is an open sub-variety of the Hilbert space of just papunctual Hilbert scheme of this surface, namely the transversal Hilbert scheme. Transversal means we consider only those finite sub-schemes of degree D whose projection to the Whose projection to the affine line is a closed embedding. It's an open sub-variety of the Hilbert scheme. And once again, the symplectic form on our surface gives rise to symplectic form on its Hilbert scheme. And this is the same symplectic structure we were talking about before. Okay, and let me give one last. Let me give one last realization of the same Zastava space in the additive case. Namely, this is a Colomb branch of an appropriate quiver gauge theory. So we take a Dinken graph of G with this chosen orientation, and then I consider the gauge group G. The gauge group G, the product of general linear group at the vertices that acts in the home space along the vertices of my Dinkin graph, just by coordinate changes at the vertices. And then to such a representation of a gauge group. G, one associates a certain space of triples over the Feynman Grassmannian and then And then, according to mathematical formulation of Coulomb branch due to Reiverman and Makajima, this Coulomb branch is the spectrum of equivariant homology ring of this space of triples. And it is symplectically dual to the corresponding Higgs branch. This Makajima equivalent variety. In fact, this particular Makajima equivalent variety is just a. Particular Makajimo quiv variety is just a point because we have no framing. Okay. And now there is an identification of this column branch with our Zastova space. And in these terms, the integrable system corresponds just to the embedding of the equivariant cohomology of the point into Of the point into this covariant homology of the sparrative triples. So after listing this plethora of equivalent incarnations of Zastava additive Zastava spaces, let's move to the multiplicative case. And it is very similar. So again, our base curve is just a projective line. So before. So, before we required that our two flags are transversal at infinity, now we additionally require that they are also transversal at zero. And we obtain the multiplicity Zastava space. And so now the factorization projection goes to configuration space on the multipliquity group. And again, there is a way to define its. Way to define its symplectic structure in modular terms. But as Sasha mentioned in his talk, the symplectic structure is not the restriction of the previous symplectic structure on the ambient additive Zastova. For example, in the simplest case, when the degree is just one simple co-root, the multiplicative Zastova is the The multiplicative Zastova is the product of multiplicative group in the base with the same multiplicative group in the fiber. And the Poisson structure is well of multiplicative form like this. And now to make contact with the monopole theory, we consider the quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. The quasi-Hamiltonian reduction with respect to the action of Cartan torus. And this is an algebraic geometric incarnation of the moduli space of periodic Euclidean monopoles. But now, while in the additive case, all the complex structures in this hypercalar sphere were isomorphic to each other. Isomorphic to each other. But now they are not anymore in the Molecular case. And we only get one particular complex structure, namely the one in which this space is a fine complex variety. And since we took this Hamiltonian reduction, it's not a direct analog of the The Euclidean monopoles, but rather direct analog of the centered Euclidean monopoles that can be also obtained by similar Hamiltonian reduction. And in terms of Colombrane, the centered monopoles correspond to taking the gauge group, not product of GLs, but product of SLs. Cells and in this case we should take K-theoretic Coulomb branch. Now, the futurization projection is also an integrable system and also well known for SL2 or SU2, namely it's the relativistic open TODA system for GLD. And so the total, the disaster space is actually The customer space is identified with the total phase space of relativistic open to the system, that is the universal group group centralizer. And again, it can be identified with the transversal Hilbert scheme of a certain surface. And this surface is the Zastom of degree one, so the square of multiplicative group. And the only somehow The only somehow really new feature compared to the additive case is that this multiplicity Zastova space carries a natural cluster structure. And well, it is the case with all k-theory column branches, in particular here too. Okay, so now we finally move to the elliptic case, namely when the base curve Namely, when the base curve is an elliptic curve. And we start with the simplest case of SU2 once again. So the corresponding surface will be the product of our elliptic curve with the polypeliptic group. And it does have invariant symplectic structure. And we can consider the induced symplectic structure on its Hilbert scheme of. On its Hilbert scheme of degree D. There's an open subspace of the cotangent bundle to configuration space of our elliptic curve. And now comes an unpleasant surprise. So if we consider this Astova space, it is not isomorphic to this Hilbert space anymore. Instead, it is an open sub-variety of the tangent bundle. Tangent bundle to configuration space. And it does not carry any symplectic structure. So somehow all the nice identifications we observed before in the additive and locative case break down, and well, what to do? So, since we still have some time. Since we still have some time before discussions, I have to go on. And in order to go on, we will need certain compactification. In fact, in fact, this is exactly the compactification Sasha talked about, but in this case, it's not a partial computification, but a total compactification, because the base is compact now, and I will compactify the fibers. Will complectify the fibers, sort of say, in both directions. So, one way to describe this complectification is to use an embedding of Zastava into so-called Balance on the Rift-Grasmanian. Just because given transversal flags, B and M minus structures gives rise to it. Gives rise to a trivialization. So, since our flags are generically transversal, we obtain a generic trivialization of our G bundle. And the Balance Ondical Grassmannian is exactly the moduli space of such things. G G bundle equipped with trivialization away from certain collection of points on the elliptic curve. And so we take the compactification of our Zastova space inside Benesson Refuge Mania. And let me describe it in somewhat more intrinsic terms, just repeating what Sasha said an hour ago. So, namely, this will be the modelized space of genetic transversal generalized. Genetic international transfer generalized flags. And while we are in the generalization mood, let's also allow to twisting of n minus structures. So what we get is the following model A problem. We have a G bundle, just for SL, let me describe it for SL2 in the simplest case. So then G bundle is just a two-dimensional ranked. Just a two-dimensional rank two vector bundle of a trivialized determinant. And the B structure or a flag was just a line sub-bundle inside of degree negative D. And another M minus structure was a projection onto just trivial bundle O. So now, because of this generalization, we allow not Generalization, we allow not just trivial line bundle O, but arbitrary line bundle L. Okay, so here I explained that the compactified Zastava is modelized space of this data where we allow zeros. So the morphism from L to V is not necessarily injective, it can have zeros, and the morphism from V to K is not necessarily surjective. Okay, but we Okay, but we require that the composition from L to K is not totally zero. So then it's an embedding of invertible shift L into invertible shift K of co-length D. So the quotient has length D. Fine. So this is the definition of twisted generalized ZAST, but this compact modelized space. And for generalized And for general G, we do the same thing, we just consider all the possible associated vector bundles, and then again, amorphism from lines of bundle and onto, or not onto, another line bundle with Plucker equations. And we get the compactified Zastava twisted by k, and the twisting parameter is. And the twisting parameter is a totoros bundle. So, in particular, for any simple root, we obtain the corresponding line bundle. Okay. And now this modelite space has a very explicit projective embedding that I will use. And the reason for this explicit projective embedding is that. That the Benitz-Andritel Grassmannian, as any Grassmannian, carries a canonical determinant line bundle. And when you restrict it to the Zastova space, you get a very ample line bundle that gives rise to projective embedding. But a miracle that happens is that if you restrict this ample determinant, like Ample determinant line bundle to the torus fixed point in Zastava, then it gives rise to an isomorphism of the global on the global sections. And the Taurus fixed point in Zastava are very explicitly describable along with the line one restricted to them. So, what one obtains is the following Is the following answer? So, first of all, the torus fixed points just split into various connected components, not numbered by partitions of alpha into sum of two smaller core roots. And the restriction of the Fermat line bundle to such a kinetic component is written here explicitly. Maybe it may seem somewhat horrifying at the first glance, but you never need this explicit. Never need this explicit expression. What you only need to know is that this is an action of this simple correspondence. So you have the direct product of two configuration spaces. There is a projection onto E beta. And there is just the addition of divisors map, finite map onto E alpha. Onto E alpha. And then on this product, there is a certain line bundle that is determined by this twisting data, K. And then also it twists by some diagonal divisors. Never mind which particular divisors. So now the Sinvanju. Recipe is that we will sum up all the That we sum up all those vector bundles for all the partitions of alpha, and we obtain a big vector bundle of rank two to the length of alpha. And what is very important about it, that it is factorizable. So it shares the same factorization property as Zastova itself over configurations. So, in particular, to determine this vector bundle away from all the Vector bundle away from all the diagonals, we only need to know the answer for the minimal possible degree, one simple coroot. And in this case, this vector bundle is just two-dimensional, and it's a direct sum of the trivial one and the twisting line bundle. And the ZASTOVA itself is just projectivization of this two-dimensional line bundle. And away from all the diagonals, the Zastava itself is just embedded by Segre, embedding into the Cartesian power of this one-dimensional projective bundle. And the whole Sastava is just the closure in the total projectivization of rank to the power alpha. Alpha to the power alpha of this gray embedding away from diagonals. So, this is some very explicit description of the compactified Zastova due to Ivan Nirkevich. Okay, and now if we are interested in our original problem, open Zastava, like the complectified ones, then we just remove two hyperplane sections corresponding. Corresponding to two extreme decompositions. One when beta is zero, one when gamma is zero. Okay. And now to return. If you remember what was the original problem. The original problem was that the open Zastava space was. Did not carry any symplectic structure and was not isomorphic to the relative transversal Hilbert scheme already for SL2. And we wanted to somehow to remedy this. And to this end, we somewhat modify the construction of this factorizable. So I do the same thing as before. So, I do the same thing as before. I just somehow change this twisting by diagonal divisors. Here is the difference. And also, this vector bundle has some physical meanings, so to say. Namely, it is related to the elliptic Coulomb branch. Namely, it is the direct sum of equivariant elliptic homology of some part of this. Some part of this space of triples, namely the part leaning over the simplest super varieties in the Grassmania, the smooth minuscule super varieties. Okay, so now we repeat the same procedure. So we sum up all these contributions, we obtain a big rank. Big rank two to the power alpha dimensional vector bundle. We projectivize it. Away from diagonals, we have a very simple segregated embedding of just product of projective lines. And then we take closure everywhere, so diagonals included. Then we remove these two hyperplane sections corresponding to extreme. Plane sections corresponding to extreme partitions with beta and gamma equal to zero. And we obtain the open Colonzastova. And they are really isomorphic to the spectrum of equivariant elliptic homology of the space of triples. So it's an elliptic Coulomb branch. Okay, and now since this is an elliptic Coulomb branch, it must carry. It must carry some asymplectic structure because it comes automatically equipped with quantization. If you add the loop rotation to the covariance, then you obtain some quantized Coulomb branch, and hence the original commutative Coulomb branch carries a Poisson structure, even symplectic. Okay, in particular, in our simplest case of SU2. Case of SU2, this cologne modification of Zastava is isomorphic to the transversal Hilbert scheme. So we modified our Zastava problem and we finally did obtain the desired Hilbert scheme. And its compactification also makes some geometric sense. And now let me describe Describe more explicitly the symplectic form I just explained on the Coulomb's Astoma. Namely, we know that away from diagonals, the Colonzastova is isomorphic just to the product of the total space of twisting line bundles. And each line bundle carries Line bundle carries natural invariant symplectic form, I mean invariant with respect to dilatations. And now the fact is that this symplectic form extends regularly, so without poles and without zeros, through the diagonals. And we obtain a symplectic form on the Cologne elliptic Zastava. And if you remember, to make contact with the periodic monopoles, we had to perform some Hamiltonian reduction. So we do the same thing here. But now to perform the Hamiltonian reduction, first you have to take the level of moment map. So what plays the role of moment map here? It is the composition of the It is the composition of the factorization projection to configuration space of elliptic curve and further Abel Jacobi map to the product of its Picar varieties that are also isomorphic to elliptic curve itself. So you then land into the rank of G power of elliptic curve. Fine. So now we Fine. So now we fix a moment level. So we fix the classes of configuration divisors. And we take the quotient by the action of Cartan Taurus. And this is the so-called reduced Colonzastava. And this reduced Colonzastava is conjecturally isomorphic to the modelized space of doubly periodic monopoles. Doubly periodic monopoles or monopoles introduced by Sergei Cherkis and studied by him with co-authors. But once again, let me mention that this is analog of centered Euclidean monopoles, the Colomb branch with the gauge group product of SU, not total unitary groups. Okay. Okay. So now returning to our original elliptic Zastava, we can do the same thing to them. So they are not symplectic. So we cannot do any Hamiltonian reduction procedure, but we can do some Mock Hamiltonian reduction. Namely, we can take the same level of The same level of Abel-Jacobi map and take its quotient modular Cartan torus and just declare this to be the Mach Hamiltonian reduction. Now, what we obtain does have some meaning. It is so-called Scheginadesky moduli space, at least when the twisting bundle is of degree zero and regular. Degree zero and regular. Regular means that all the associated line bundles associated to roots are non-trivial. So for example, in SL2 case, I require that the square of this line bundle K is non-trivial. So then this reduction is the moduli space of G bundles of Of some fixed isomorphism type, namely, they are semi-simple. They are direct sum of line bundles. So they are reduced, they have reduction to the torus. And they're also equipped with a flag. And this flag also has a fixed type, meaning that the associated graded is another fixed direct sum of line bonds. Fixed direct sum of line bundles. Okay, so my total bundle is a fixed direct sum of line bundles, and the associated gradient is also some other fixed direct sum of line bundles. And then this Fig-Nadiesky moduli space does have a natural symplectic structure. And its origin is very similar to what we To what we said about the additive case in the very beginning. Namely, we have the moduli space of G bundles and T bundles, and also the moduli space of B bundles that we can view as a correspondence between Ban G and Banti. And then Ban G and Banti carry nature. And Banti carry natural one-shifted plague structures. This correspondence carries a Lagrangian structure. And this Faganadeski moduli space, as we just defined it, is just the Cartesian product of the band B correspondence over band G and Band T, and just the point where I fix the G band. G bundle and the associate degraded of P bundle. Okay, so then as a product of two Lagrangian correspondences, it has a natural non-shifted symplexic structure, and this is what I mean. Fine. Now we're close to the happy ending, namely, the following miracle happens that after the That after the Hamiltonian or mock Hamiltonian reduction, the two versions of Zastava coincide: the Cologne Zastava and the usual Zastava. But they only coincide if we rearrange our twisting appropriately. So here you see the formula for a new twisting for Colonzastava. And this is not the last miracle. Last miracle. The last miracle is that this isomorphism of reduced dust of a space respects the symplectic forms, the nature of symplectic forms on this, only them. And since the symplectic form on the Kulonzastva was very simple and explicit, away from diagonals, just a direct product of surfaces, of symplectic surface. Uh, surfaces, opposite platic surfaces. So, this was sort of Darboux coordinate system. Because of this, we can write down an explicit formula for this Fifig-Genodevsky symplectic structure on the usual reduced Zastova. Namely, the usual reduced Zastova, due to their factorization property away from diagonals, also carry some natural coordinates, W's and Y's. W's and Y's, just as we had in the additive case. But now W's are points on the elliptic curve itself. And Y's are still invertible functions. So they are points in the multiplicative group. But now on the reduced Zastava, the doubles are constrained to have a fixed sum in our elliptic curve, and the Y's are. Elliptic curve and the y's are homogeneous coordinates, so we only can consider their ratios. Only this makes sense. Okay, so this being said, the non-trivial brackets are just, as you see, so the same named Y's and W's again are sort of Derby coordinates, but now we still have non-trivial brackets between Y's. Between y's. And these non-trivial brackets are written down in terms of the Weierstrass zeta function of the corresponding differences of W coordinates. So I can only remind that the Weierstrass zeta function is a primitive of the Weierstrass p function. So the derivative of zeta is negative p function. So this is the explicit formula. Formula and this is the end. Thank you. I'm sorry to go five minutes over time. We're not five minutes over time. We've started a bit late, so. Okay, we're good. Did you have more you wanted to say? Me not. No, that's it. Thank you. Are there any questions? So very good. Go ahead, Sergei. One question. So you understand there were so you're producing this symplectic holomorphic symplectic forms on this table in all of these cases. Yes. And Sasha's talk was sort of very provocative. Sasha's talk was sort of very provocative. It said that even though having electric doesn't extend, you can partially compactify the spaces, and in a sense, we compactified in my mind by some lower strata. Yes. So you see the stratification of all these Zastavas, which unites them in one space, one large space? Oh, yes, certainly. If you consider the compactified Zastava, then what you glue In the boundary are the same Zastava spaces of smaller degree multiplied by configuration spaces on our elliptic or whatever curve of the complementary degree. So now the question, does this respect corresponding syblectric forms? I know that in the additive case, the supply The symplatic form extends as a Poisson form to the boundary. And somehow, if you consider some partial quantification, namely if you allow to generate only one flag, if you generate both flags, then I'm absolutely sure that this is still true. I mean, that the whole sublactive form extends as a Poisson form, but I cannot prove it. For example, I cannot prove that. Cannot prove it. For example, I cannot prove that this total complexification is normal, and this would be a necessary condition. But I'm absolutely sure it's true. Thank you. Welcome. Any other questions? Well, then let's virtually applaud once more.
