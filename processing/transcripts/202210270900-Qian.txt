Okay, thank you. Uh, have hello, everybody, there. Um, thanks, UNIA organizer. And I'm sorry for not able to making a workshop and inside on site. So my talk will be a slight Well, it's slightly different from my submitted abstract, okay, so but still related to corner equations. I'm going to tell you about in my recent work on developing a fast solver for solving harmony equations, these are based on a butterfly algorithm. Okay, so. Okay, so in the overall call here, we would like to develop micro-local analysis-based fast algorithms for computing high-frequency waves in homogeneous media with some desired features. Here, macro-local analysis understanding. understand understood in a very broad sense or actually like microlock analysis originated from geometrical optics or 3 theory sometimes in physics we call it WKBJ approximation so here for waves we would like to obey the Shannon's Shannon's sampling principle. Here, for wave computation, we would ideally have fixed number of points per wavelength for wave propagation, no matter how high in the frequency it is. So, essentially, we will not have oversampling with respect to when the frequency. When the frequency becomes large. So this in turn requires we would have so-called uniform accuracy with back to the frequency parameter. Also, we would have computational scalability in terms of both the CPU time and memory requirement. Okay, so here, like ON log n type of complexity. Type of complexity, the complexity that we are looking for. At the same time, we would have the algorithm itself should be able to handle multiple frequencies, multiple right-hand sides. These kind of requirements are important for the inverse problem and imaging. Okay, so we in migration, we actually We actually need to handle both many frequencies and also many different right-hand sides. Okay, so that's really a background of this work. Of course, so medical imaging and non-destructive testing also has a lot of such kind of setup. Okay, so on the question, can we? On the question, can we have such a model solar? So, we most specifically consider the solution to homogeneous with the variable refracting index and subject to optical source in the problem we are aiming at. Okay, so here we are to use a micro-lock analysis. Here we assume. Analysis here, we assume that the index refraction is smooth, sometimes called slowness function. It actually one of the spherical of velocity or sound speed. Okay, as a generic source function with a complex port in a bounded domain, okay, boundary domain, our d-dimensional space, we got angular frequency. So, here we also assume that the so-called some field radiation boundary condition holds that we consider outgoing waves. Okay, so when the source function as a delta point source, then the solution of the equation is called a green function. Okay, so we consider volumetric discretization. Check discretization of the computer domain with NV degree of freedom. Okay, so that's a total number of unknowns in a d-dimensional discretization of the domain. Here we also enforce Channel's sampling principle that is a sampling mesh. Um, these sampling mesh size should be proportional to the wavelength that in turn is related to the frequency. Okay, so that means total number of unknowns will be omega to the power D in the discretization. Okay, so numerical discretization of this Harmony equation can be done by right or By a variety of methods, such as the finite difference, finite element integral equation for hybrid symptomic finite element. So gave rise to N V by N V the linear system. So there's a lot of work in the literature. So I will not give the superior references. Superior references. So here we would have a scheme to have two properties: almost have almost linear complexity. That's one log n type complexity in terms of CPU time memory storage, also uniform accuracy with respect to omega. Okay, so there's no so far no methods available in join these. They are about two properties simultaneously. Okay, so we will try to develop such a kind of algorithm. Okay, so the starting point that if the green function is given for the Homer equation, then we can carry out the integration process to absorb a solution. Of course, here, Of course, here with the boundary domain, then we have to impose some kind of absorbing boundary condition outside the domain V. So here we assume this thing has been carried out in the process when we write out the solution as the integral. Okay. So me Um, the approach here that we are going to use is that we first use the so-called Hadam Barbicane answers to construct this green function, okay? Green function. And then we use a fast hierarchical of diagonal butterfly algorithm to compress this integrator, okay, this integrator. Okay, integrator and finally, we can apply the compass integrate between the source function to a desired harmonic solution. Okay, see general point that we are going to follow. So this will give us a scheme that satisfies our desired properties. Okay, so that's the Disney talk about. So let's start with the geometrical optics for the harmonic equation. So we have these, we consider the point source problem for harmony equation. We apply traditional geometric optics to this equation. Then we end up with so-called according equation for the traditional For the travel time or phase function, how and also transport equation for amplitude coefficients, okay, amplitude coefficient S. Okay. So here, these why these answers are useful because you see these for the harmonic equation, we have a K0. That's the essential notation is a essential corresponding omega. In this case, here you see by using these answers, we have carrying out scale separation because the tau phase function is independent of this K0 parameter. Okay, so that gives us a scale separation and the oscillating part will be captured by these exponential function, okay, here. Function okay, here. However, these answers have some issues in terms of computation. Okay, so this essentially, how do we initialize the amplitude coefficient at the source point? Okay, because in 3D, the amplitude will be have a proportion to one of our distance. Okay, that means when the observation point to close to the source. To close to the source, then the amplitude coefficient will be unbounded. Okay, so that creates a potential computation problem. They also will not give us, if we don't treat the condos in grad carefully, we will not have uniform accuracy near the source. Okay, this kind of issue has line into by Joe Keller and his Joe Keller and his collaborator a long time ago, but they were able to handle the problem for three-dimensional case, but wasn't able to solve the issue, initial issue for even dimensional case. So, here's the Barbetto idea. Essentially, he used the so-called Hata Ma methods in climate domain, then take a Fourier transform. From our hard armor formulation, then he obtained his answers. These answers, they based on Hanko functions, very piece of order Hanker functions, okay, piece of order Hanker functions, and these he introduces the bases, okay. What he's really doing is that try to absorb all those synchronized into this Hanko function. Into the Hanko function. And in terms of the so-called Babesh coefficient, okay, here we call it a Hardam Barbsh coefficient Vs are analytical near the source point. Okay, so then these are these Vs can be initialized at the source with the bounded quantity, okay? Bounded quantity, okay. So Disney, this need. These answers we are trying to use, okay. We are trying to use this give us a nice computational initialization, computational initialization for computing these travel time, okay, travel time and the coefficient, okay, coefficient, okay. All right, so now come back to the equation where I'll try to solve the We are trying to solve the homology equation with the up to the right hand side. We assume that no medium-induced acoustical occurs for green function at the only point source in the computing domain. Okay, so that is hard and Bopsh answers applicable to computing wave fields in V. Okay, so it's then if we have no inclusion, then in the domain, then we have the The solution for the Harbati equation, which is in this integral form, integral for integration form. Okay, we call this Hadamabachi integrator. Okay, so now to compute this integral, we disqualify the again describe the domain into MV regular cells with cell center, cell size H. Okay. H is a These actually relate to wave propagation itself. Later on, we have another mesh which we use to compute the HP ingredients. So they're like a phase function and so on. So actually here these omega dependent, okay, omega dependent. Okay. And then also the source function needs to discretize. Need to discretize with a low discrete as here. We essentially use a piecewise constant discrepanization of this sort of function. This initialization, the discrepanization is very rough, very rough. But we can use these to demonstrate and feature our methods. Okay, so once we have those discretization, then we can write that integration as a matrix waxed product, okay, which is wax product. And these we have a huge matrix here, K, volume to volume, okay, volume to volume, okay. I is only right, those are source-related vectors, source-related vectors. So the relative vectors, okay. And there's a Kij, there's a matrix, okay, the entry correspond to Grouping function, okay. Grouping function essentially initially sources correspond RJ and R in the observation point. Okay, so we need to have computed is a green function, okay, for many all those source locations in the domain, okay, then it's domain. These domain, okay, the domain. And to compute these, uh, these entry of this k matrix, uh, we need to take out these so-called self-term or diagonal term. Okay, then at this essentially observation point coincide with the solar point, okay. So then these can be done by detail some careful mathematical. For mathematical analysis, we have been able to do that. Okay, that's no problem. And then to compute the entry of the matrix, then we need to use the Acorner equation. Essentially, we need to compute the toss square, phase function squared, and V0 and V1. V0 and V1, that's corresponding to Barbicane of those coefficients. So the amplitude, the Barbetti coefficients, okay. And then if we're doing this naively, then we need to do that for solve those computer quantity at all those NV points. Okay, that will give us the computing time, memory is the storage. Memory is the storage like nv square, okay. That's me, and then the metric-like product will be uh expensive as well, okay. So, and then, okay, so here's some additional remarks. When the media is homogeneous, then we have a screen function, okay? So, uh, if only inhomogeneous, then these answers actually converges in the asymptotic. Converges in the asymptotic order. Okay, so here our starting assumption is that we assume the mediums are smooth without introducing caustics, okay, in the computational domain. Okay, so that's me. Okay, that's our setup. Okay. We would like, okay, so let's see. So, how we can come up with a linear complexity for. By the linear complexity for evaluating these matrix vector products. Okay, so we leverage the rank representation of the squared phase function toss square and also do the V0, V1. And those coefficients, we know this if we have those media smooth, then there's a V0, V1, tau square, all will be analytical, okay, analytical. Then that means we can have a low-rank representation. Means that we can have a low-ranked ventilation for these coefficients, okay, ingredients. Okay. And once those low-ranked ventilation are obtained, then we can do the operator. That's a K2K operator can be compared by butterfly algorithm. Okay, so okay, so here in some general things. Okay, so we We can compute all the quantities. Then we do the trick that use the chip-shaped integration in the sense that, okay, so I set the source point at the trip-shift prime source point. I mean, it's a source point for a corner equation, a corner equation. These are at some triple shift points and computed due to a coherent travel time. The covenant travel time HP coefficient. Then, once we have the table, then we interpret the table to the preservation points at tributable points again. So, those give us sort of some analytical formula for these travel time, okay, travel time. Time, okay, travel time squared, how squared function. These now, these functions as viewed as a two variable or two variable function, are zero r. Okay, so that's an evasion formula in some sense, okay? And we compute it, okay? So is to in to use these things, essentially we we just We just now, these ni is a finite number, so we can use a very small number of these triple points. Okay, triple ship points. This here, how to compute this. I will ignore this. Okay, so to improve the computation, evaluate this formula for more efficiently, we use a block form and then we can use a blast. And then we can use a BLAS library to do that. Okay, so now this is still not good enough. We use a butterfly to compress these kernel or integral K matrix matrix. So butterfly, there's why these butterfly algorithms needed. These actually initially these butterfly algorithms These but by initially from Michael's worker's work, and then many people follow that to handle the way publication. A few years ago, these Beyond and Hong Kai, they come to analyze these why these wave propagation problems are so hard, and they come up. Up. It's eventually they concluded that you need to use the kind of butterfly structure to come to induce a low-rank structure from this kernel, integrating kernel. Okay, that's why we are doing this here. Okay, so I think I have time to go into the more detail here. What we really doing that we have to We have to partition the volume domain into a tree and then come using low-rank complementary low-rank property to compare these integral kernel into a matrix into a sequence of, let's see here, okay, sequence of sequence of sparse matrices, okay, sparse matrix. Okay, so there's only one of So, okay, so there is only one sub-block of our diagonal sub-block, and this can be using compassion into the sequence of diagonal matrix, okay, block diagonal matrices. Okay, so then we can carry out evaluate carry out matrix product rapidly by using the sparse structure. Okay, these kind of support structures is induced by the Is induced by the low-rank complementary property, okay? That has to be induced by these butterfly structure. Okay, so let me just go ahead and show you some examples because I just have five minutes left. Okay, so here is an example that we have in homogeneous media. Media, uh, each direction we have 50 wavelengths, and then there's a uh, this is a point source problem, I guess. Yes, okay, so this we compare these point source solution with the mark solution computed by finite difference frequency domain method, which in this case, we our scheme use 10 points per wavelength is a finite difference. There is a finite difference frequency. You must use a 50-point per variant. You see that they match quite well, but those are oscillations, some tiny oscillation comes from the final difference scheme. Another example that source function here now is we don't need to recompute everything, we just input the change in the source function right-hand side. This here is a Gaussian. Here is the Gaussian V package, okay? So we can compute those nicely. There is the inclusion that we have a summer circle inclusion, then scattering happens. Okay, there's in community and media. We can compute this thing nicely. And if we, although we don't allow these casting in the right-hand in the mid duty. Uh, in the mid uh, due to the medium, but we can have uh cost induced by right-hand side here that we have concave kite shape, then we can we have cost here. So, these uh comprises okay, this is 3D computation. Uh, we can uh these are now we here our scheme use a five-point pervalence, but the uh finite difference five-point pervalence. At the short wavelength, will give us such one of the solution. That if we refine the mesh, then the computer cannot handle that, okay, as a Berkeley lab. Okay, so that's a new situation. These case, we have VBX solution, so our solution matches with the gas solution very well. Now, convergence. As I claim that we would have a uniform. That we would have a uniform convergence with respect to frequency. Okay, so the first order, just keep one term, we have a one-nigger type of convergence. These essentially observed here. And then second order, we can then now this means that omega increases will become very small quickly compared to these other terms that you can reflect here. You can refract here. Actually, beginning, we have omega quadratic convergence, okay, second-order convergence. Then later on, there's a term come there's another term due to computing error due to computing our phase function, then this term will be dominant. Okay, okay, so that's a necessary. Okay, so now CPU time. 2D, we essentially have a lot on log n type. On log and type CPU CPU time as storage, okay, storage, okay. And now the in 3D, we have a CPU time that on login, but it is almost like on login in storage, okay? In storage, okay, so that's our observation. Um, uh, then uh, in more detail, that's we need to do those things, okay? All right, so let me just summarize. Okay, so we have here we uh why we use the uh these hot and pop shins because we in this case we can have unique. We in that case, we can have uniform percentage to the green function at some source. Okay, um, now there's a uh once we have the green function, we can use a we can use the butterfly type algorithm to compare the matrix, kernel matrix into sequence of our Signals are our sparse structured sparse matrices. Okay, then we can once compared, we can use this integrator to only solve the function, the simple matrix vector modification. All right, so we can also handle this inclusion problem, no problem. So, okay, so let me conclude. We have developed And we have developed a fast butterfly compass intubator. These are for harmony equation. Enjoy some unique features. We can use these to handle multiple frequency, multiple right-hand side. Image can be used for imaging problems. And then dealing with medium into the classic ongoing work. Some other Some other framework, like we, because we solved this in for Maxwell equation or elastic wave equation, and Baby sometimes questioned that whether there are such kind of answers for Maxwell equation or elastic wave equations. He posed that problem in the encyclopedia or PDEs or mathematical sign in the PDE sequence. sequence um he wasn't able to solve problem and we we we with my postdoc student we uh we able to we are able to deal with the usual and so we are also to uh develop such kind of uh compass the uh integrated or maximum elastic wave rotation okay uh of course eventually uh deal with inverse power also okay so i got uh stop here but I will stop here by thanks and SF for me financial score. Okay, thanks. I stopped here.
