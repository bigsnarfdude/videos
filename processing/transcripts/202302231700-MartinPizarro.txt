I'm a little bit pizzaro to speak about veteran ET and Equational Expire. Right, so well, thanks, especially thanks to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to give a talk here. Thanks to all of you for staying and not going to your groups. So I had the opportunity to teach one's linear algebra at 8:30 in the morning. It was great because everybody was sleeping. Because everyone was sleeping. And I think this is what's going to happen now. So, right, I mean, I tried to make lots of funny remarks to wake us up. I mean, okay, so what's the setting? I mean, so we want to present actually some ongoing work together with Martin Siegler. And the setup, I mean, for all the rest of the talk, it's just going to be about complete first third-door theory. Terminal. And what else? And then F is a family of partition formula. Partition formula. Okay, so these are the partition of the variables. This is completely random. I mean, there are many possibilities. Closed under. uh closed under finite disjunctions by conjunctions and containing the proof formula okay so it can be different partitions yeah so I'm running over all possibilities actually I mean f is just some collection of formula and then what we would like Then these partitions of two formulas, then you conjunct them, can be compatible or not? Right. So if you do a conjunction, I mean, there's going to be, if we see a conjunction, we'll see them usually maybe in different variables in vectors. Okay? Right? And just in case, I mean, U is a sufficiently saturated model of T. Okay, so that's. Of t. Okay, so that's going to be the setup. And I'm going to define. So I should not put this point. X equals X. Or if you want this, whatever. If you like this formula better, I mean, which is our formula, whatever. Just any tautology, just put it. Okay. So, right. So we're going to say that F is unitarian if If it has, or I mean the collection of instances, if this collection where we φF x, y is some f runs among the family f and b is just a couple of parameters in the ambient model if this has the DCC. So the DCC means, I mean, there is no information. The VCC means, I mean there is no infinite, there is no infinite descending proper descending chain where we'll have P0, XP0, contained P1, of XP1, contained, contained Pn of XPN, and so on. Okay, so if this is not And so on. Okay, so if this is not the case, I mean, uh then we'll say that the family is the Materian. I mean, there are stores uh many examples that we know already, so examples. For example, if T extends the theory of fields, and if we look at F, the collection of all finite systems of polynomial equations. Polynomial equations, then this is no theorem by Hilbert basis theorem. Okay, so another possibility. So if we look at, if T expands, for instance, the theory of differential fields of differential fields statistic zero, then the Then the collection of finite systems of polynomial differential equations. Equation, this is a kind of Ethereum by the theorem of Fritz Badenbusch. So, I mean, there are several families that we know, and right, and then maybe what I would just like to write. And maybe what I would just like to remark, first of all, is that the name is not just a bit random, is that actually if f is Poeterian, then so is the collection of finite unions of formula in F. Okay, and the instances, these instances, define a noetherian topology. Okay, so this is why maybe we would like to give it such a name. So if there is something that one has to do with the natural notion of what irreducibility is, but using irreducibility, or if you want to use ultrafilters, I mean, any of the two actually works, it's very easy to show. Of the two actually works, it's very easy to show that actually finite unions would also have the same descending chain coefficient. Okay, so maybe just because it appeared from the title. So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna give a definition. I mean, I'll say that a formula in a given partition, I'll say that it's an equation if the family of finite conjunctions of phi Phi is material. So if we are only interested in one single formula all the time, but then we have more and more instances which intersect each other, I mean, it is not possible to have a finite, an infinite proper descending chain. Then we'll say that the formula is an equation. And clearly, I mean, this is just a stupid remark, but I guess is that if every formula Every formula in an Reuterian family is an equation. But an equation is way more than just looking at intersections of a single formula and instances of a single formula. We have to start mixing formulae in different instances. So there are more chances that actually we get chains which do not. Chains which do not support. Okay. So, right. Why is this relevant? Okay, so maybe there's a trivial remark. Actually, there are lots of trivial remarks. So a trivial remark is that if F is noetherium, then every type B over any set of parameters, and it can be in any variable. Set of parameters and it can be in any variable. So I mean next has a minimal formula. Okay, so I'm defining the notion, a minimal formula. Every time I have type every time. No, no. Every type. I haven't said what it is, so I mean so that's gonna be what it is, that's what you're thinking. I mean, so it's a formula in L where actually this formula belongs to F. formula belongs to f and we have n so n for all psi of xy in f and a prime in a what we have is that so you think it's only about the f done you were right but i can call f pigment sorry f pigment okay sure but i mean f is going to be all the time so uh but yeah i mean uh f will so this belongs to the type So, this belongs to the type if and only if we have this inclusion at the level of definable sets. Okay? And the reason is just because, I mean, we look at phi of xA is the intersection of all the Xi of XA, where G of XA is a formula in the type, and G of XY belongs to F. belongs to F. Okay? And this is, I mean, this keeps actually, well, this goes from the finite conjunction. So if we keep on looking at these intersections, I mean, it cannot be that at the moment it has to stabilize, okay? Because we cannot have the DCC and I by construction. So this intersection happens to be a single formula. And that formula determines whether or not any other instance belongs to P. Okay, so that's so far. I hope, I mean, there are many trivial. I hope, I mean, there are many trivial remarks. I'm not saying anything very interesting. So, right. Can I? And the only thing that I'm using, okay, is that actually the type contains already one instance in F. So this intersection is not empty, because otherwise I saw it. Right? Oh, there we go. So now, okay, so maybe just to try to get into the Just to try to get into the whole neostability thing. Okay, so what is actually getting the mood? Okay, so T is to say that T has N T R L. So if with respect, of course, to F, okay, F is no Ethereum. So So, if every formula, every partition formula, I should say, is a Boolean combination of formula in the same partition in F. Okay? So, as in the case of algebraic cryptospheres, I mean, whatever we have. Sorry? I thought people were going to be like, John's so stupid, etc. And now you're like, so no, no, three minutes. Okay. Right. So you are awake again. So So example, example, okay, so ACF B where V is zero or prime is no Terrible or B C F zero is noetherian because in both cases actually, I mean what we have is that this distinguished collection of formula give us everything that we want. Okay, so right. So, um right. So are we okay? Hopefully I'm not waking you up. Uh so okay, okay, okay. Right, so first remark, lots of remarks. So T in Ethereum, then T is equational. Okay, so Ethereum is equational if every formula can be written as a Boolean combination of equations. Okay? And what we just noticed. And what we just noticed is that if we have a Noetherian family, every formula in the family happens to be an equation. So we have actually a stronger version than just equationality, whatever that was. And the second remark is that if T is countable and noetherial, then T is omega state. Because actually, this motion is very restrictive. I mean, we don't have. Motion is very restrictive. I mean, we don't have a lot of opportunity, I mean, a lot of choices. And the reason for that is that actually, I mean, why? Why is this because P, a type of ray, is uniquely determined by its minimal formula. I should say, actually, the minimal formula exists up to T equivalence, but it's going to be very vague. Okay, up to T equivalence. Okay, up to T is the lights. For uncomfortable theories, is T present that? Yes, so I haven't thought about it. But I mean, okay, so this is going to be stable for all the kappas which are going to be larger than the language. I mean, this is not an interesting? I don't know if you can build it. I would imagine that maybe just at a moment there has to be a positive thing which appears in one of the trees and then you have to countable. But you're saying in the uncountable Right, and maybe I should just say, I mean, so what we have is that this notion, whatever that is, especially for countable theories, if you're no Ethereum and then you have to be a questioner, then omega-stables, maybe the natural question will be, I mean, maybe the remark I should say, so I should maybe thank Martin Hughes, who's actually sleeping, I think, at that moment. So maybe I should say that there are equational, countable theories. Theories, omega state theories, theories which are not plural, okay? And so the simplest one is actually the one that Martin Niels provided immediately. I mean, it's very difficult to actually be quicker than him because he talks very fast. And so basically, you have infinitely many. Infinitely many unary predicates. Okay, so these are unary predicates. And what you just say is that the theory basically says Pn plus one is properly contained in Pn. Okay? And so actually this theory, everything is unary at the end of the day. I mean, you have Booleanic anyway. All the formula happen to be either equality or different from equality or I belong to. Or different from equality, or I belong to some PN, or I do not. So it's very difficult to. I mean, there are not many instances which are relevant, hence the equationality. It's clearly omega-stable, and however, I mean, just by construction, it's not magnetary, because I mean, this formula is already bad. Right? So, okay. So, yeah, because there are not that many instances, yes. I mean, I don't. Right, so I guess now the natural question would be. So I guess now the natural question will be: do we have some theories which are nice? Not every theory is material, so then it's meaningful. And then the question will be, are there other relevant theories which happen to be material? I mean, do we know of any? And keep in mind that if we are looking for one, they have to be equational and they have to be omega-stable. So it's, I mean, it's really Really restricts a bit where we're looking. Okay, so then it already appears in the talk of Eliot, but for minimal structures, but actually, I think Pelfairs already were mentioned there. But so what we can consider is, so we have the language of B is going to be the language of rings together with. Together with um a unary predicate. And then what we are gonna define is a theory, which I'll call it ACFP. Okay, it's just an LP theory. And basically a model of ACFP. What it says is that K is algebraically closed and D of K, I'll call it E, okay, is a proper. Okay, is a proper algebraically closed subfield. Okay, so this is the theory. It is indeed the theory of delta, of algebraic closed fields. And this theory of ACFP is complete once we fix the characteristic of the field. And moreover, it's omega steel. Okay? So it's already very good. Actually, a franc omega. Franc omega. And so, right, so a couple of years ago, Martin, Ziegler and I proved that this here is an equation. Okay, so this is maybe a candidate to now try to see whether or not this ocean has relevant. Okay, so there. Okay, so there we uh it's a factor maybe is that uh ACFP is equational equational with respect to the family of pain formula. And these words are awful. I mean, I know they are not very. I mean, I know they are not very sexy, but anyway, so tame, we call them tame. What is tame? So, tame are very specific formula. So, we say that t of x y is tame if it's given by finite conjunction, finite conjunction of what we call linear formula. So, what's a linear formula? A linear formula says given sub-polynomials are P or E linearly dependent, okay? Where E is the interpretation of P. Does it make sense? And hopefully, you see that one can write this down, right? I mean, you just have to say there exists a tuple that, you know, that. Yeah, the tuple belongs to B, is not the zeroth tuple, and the sum is zero. Okay? So this is what a linear formula says. Right, so the parameters are going to be when we plug in the y's. I mean, so these are polynomials. So our i is just a polynomial in In x. Okay, this is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and then we'll get parameters once we plug in these points. Okay, so these were the formula that we used, and we showed actually that the theory is equational. Every formula can be written down as a full combination of such formulae. Great, and then maybe I'll say something about About a reason why this happens to be a true. Okay, so maybe a remark is an intristic zero. There is a particular model, there is a particular model of ACFP given by you take. By you take a differentially closed field, you look at E, the kernel of the derivation, the constant field. Okay, so this is a proper algebraically closed up field of K. And what we have is that this happens to be just a model of this field, because actually all these fields are getting common. So, and the interesting thing is that actually in this particular model, in this particular model, we have that all these linear formula. All these linear formula are already giving, I mean, they give they have the TCC. Okay, and why is this? Because there's something which is probably known by everyone here. So it's that if you have elements here, they happen to be linearly dependent over the constants, if and only if they satisfy the Brushian matrix. Matrix happens to be singular. And this is the matrix in which we so what I'm saying by this, this is the terminators, okay? Okay, so it's mixed. So we just look at the tuple, we apply delta, we apply delta square, and we apply delta n minus 1. This is an n times n matrix, this is a regular matrix, and this happens to be. So if this determinant is 0, definitely there is a linear. Determinant is zero, definitely there is a linear combination among the rows, right? Columns. Ah, these are the rows. Yes, sorry. Columns. Right? And then because of the way that the tuplus are built, it's very easy to show that actually the linear combination among the columns is actually, they all have delta zero. Okay, so that means actually that to check that some. That to check that certain things are linearly dependent is just in the particular case of a differentially closed field, it's just a differentially closed condition. It's just something which was here, I believe. Okay? It was there. So, okay. So, right. So, then as a corollary, what we have, and this was already observed by Eiffel. Eiffel Kune in a different way is that so that's going to be complicated. Kun, I, tin, no accent. Right, so this, he of, he did a different proof, but anyway, so A C F B cartes 6 0 is 9. No, I think. But of course, I mean it'd be nice to so every formula here is a finite conjunction of these things, okay? Which are saying some polynomials have to be linearly dependent. This, in the differential case, in the particular model, in this very particular model, this happens to be a This happens to be a culting closed condition. The colching topology has the TCC, so in that particular model, we have the TCC, and I mean by choosing a saturated enough model, if that model is great. So that's the proof. But of course, I mean, it'll be nice to have a proof which does not rely on having to use derivation. Because in catalystic P, we're not going to be able to produce anything like that. Okay, so in catalystic P, we can't. Capitalistic P, we cannot use derivations in order to produce a model of ACFP. Okay, so, right, so then theorem, this is a theorem you together with Martin Ziegler, and it should appear. What is it? In Nova Bolfa, there seems to be this, this is the trend, is it? I don't know. Wasn't there something like this? Plus or star? No, but something like this. So? Percentage. No. Ah, okay. No. Okay. That's also another issue. I would say, I hope, I mean, but maybe this is so it's 100%, but it's not written, okay? I remember the platform, okay? So the plastic is, I'm, I'm, anyway, what I know now. So, but trust me. It's true. Okay, so right. What do you want to say? Ah, yeah. Okay, right. What do you want to say? I have. Okay. So, theorem. Theorem, theorem. Right, so AC and P is a noetherian in all cartoons. For all cartoons. Without using just approve it themselves using actually the menu. So the same thing in the formula works for all. Right, so sorry, so with respect to the respect to taint formulae, so the same formula, okay? So what's interesting is these formulae happen to have no they are still there. Okay, so these formulae, they are still good, okay? Yeah, the second thing that we actually, which is maybe not very interesting, but needed, I mean nothing is. So anyway, so given a pipe p over a, what we Over A, what we actually were able to verify is that this is, I mean, this is not for the meaning of. So sorry, maybe let's just call it L, then L should be a subfield of K. Subfield. So this is the compositum, subfield plus the transcendence degree, and then I'm going to write something, and I'll say what that is. And I'll say what there is. Okay. Maybe he can clean it around. So I'll try to explain what this is about. At the moment, there is a paper of Poisar called Legalité au Q. And as usual, he writes lots of things which are very nice. He doesn't give proofs. But it doesn't. I mean, what he writes is very nice. Okay, so moment he talks, he says, yeah, blah, blah, blah. One knows it's obvious that these always hold. I mean, one knows that he doesn't give. I mean, one knows that he doesn't give any justification for that. I mean, so I wrote at the moment this formula and I was in the audience. I mean, so he did not seem to like that. I mean, some of he was very upset anyway. So we took the opportunity to verify that indeed it is true. And maybe what's more interesting is that actually if L is at zero saturated, and then I'll say what these numbers are, then Then the model rank of P happens to be the foundation rank of rank of the minimal formula, phi, the minimal formula. What is P? P is the right, and this is the composite. Okay? Question: Do you assume L the join up equal? So for the ranks, we don't need it because actually this formula already takes care of that. So that's the point of it. You could, but so these, in the formulas or mono, right. What you need in order to make them finally close, and this is for what Zoe was aiming to, is that so technically when you have elements of L, they may satisfy linear combinations over E. Okay, and what you need to do is you need to choose, these are what the elements. To choose, these are what the lambda functions are doing. The lambda functions are choosing the coordinates of a minimal expression of a linear combination of a tuple in L. Okay? And so this is the field which is generated by all the possible values of lambda functions of tuples in L. And this is done the same way. If you want, actually, this is going to be in the case of lovely pairs. This is basically encoding the canonical base of A over Base of A over L of A over D over E. Okay, this is what is. Anyway, so yeah, so I explained this, and maybe I should say what the foundation prank is. So now that we have a notion of notariality, we can talk about irreducibility. I mean, as in any normal notarian topology, we have irreducible components, and then we can say that an irreducible formula is going to be, will have rank larger than alpha plus one if it contains a proper. One, if it contains a proper subinstance of rank at least alpha. Okay, and this provides a rank which is well defined, and this is the foundation rank. This is what we notice that actually the formula of Poissar also can be computed in terms of the minimal formula. And maybe I'll just write down something else which we have proved. Okay. Okay. And it's that free, every imaginary alpha in ACFB is equivalent, is interdefinable with the canonical parameter of some tenth. So, actually, these same formula are going to be, because of the materiality, actually, they are going to be enough to understand imaginaries. The reason for that is that at some point Amin Sopil proved, he provided a geometric determination of imaginaries in the case of algebraic pairs of algebraic closed fields in terms, I mean, these are in terms of orbits of group actions or varieties, at least generic group actions, and then. Generic group actions. And then Gareth actually was able to improve his result to show that you get weak elimination of your magic groups. Instead of geometric, you get weak. Okay, so now we get something better, but worse, because there are no groups here. I mean, this is just these are random things which still we don't understand. Maybe this is the next project. Maybe. So, yeah. Okay, good thing but not linear. Okay, good tame but not linear to it. No, so the yeah, so linear, so tame I'm line, I mean I'm I'm line, okay. Thane are defined differently, but we showed that they are equivalent to finite conjunctions of linear, but you need finitely many, so to say. One single linear formula is not enough. Okay, so right, so I think maybe what I just wanted to say is that, okay, so we have a proof which is Materiano characteristics. Right. So I have to give a proof. Someone told me, I mean, there is not a good talk always has to have a proof, right? I mean, like, even if the audience is already about to die. But, right? I don't know. No? Never heard of that? Yeah, so. Right, so I'm trying to think which one of the proofs. Right, so why don't I prove three because it's short? Okay, and then we can go. I want to go. I'm fine. Okay, so I actually want to, I prepared one, but I'm not going to do it. Okay, so right, so proof of three. Well, so suppose that alpha is just hidden by some imaginary, okay? C dot A, I don't know why I said C, maybe it should be A. Okay? So. This is not E. Okay, so this is not easy anymore. Ah, ooh, okay. Twizzle. Twizzle, yeah. I don't know what to say. Is that a curly? I don't know how to make curly. Epsilon? You're saying I should make epsilon? I thought the other one. So, right. So we have an imaginary, and what we can do is now look at the definable set. This is a definable set, okay? And as a definable set, we know that we can look at all the possible instances of 10 formula which contain this definable set. We know at least there is one. Hence, we can choose the smallest. So this is, so to say, the closure. If you want, it's actually the closure in the topology. Okay, this is what it is. So this is the smallest. And maybe I didn't say it, but actually, this pain formula. I didn't say it, but actually, this dainted formula happened to be closed under finite disjunctions. Okay, I didn't say it, so that's why we don't have to go to finite disjunctions of the formula for the topology. This is enough, okay? So, this smallest tainted formula containing it, containing the class, and then what's clear is just by definition, what is clear is that the canonical parameter of Pxp is definitely. Of Pxp is definitely definable over alpha, right? I mean, if I fix alpha, I fix the definable set given by the class. So I also fix the smallest formula. So this is definitely definable over alpha. And then what we only need to show is that alpha is definable over this canonical part. Okay? And so the point is that if you had an atomorphism F, Is that if you had an automorphism F, an automorphism sigma? Suppose that sigma fixes these kind of different parameters, then sigma of alpha is alpha prime, which is going to be given by some other class. So what we will have is that these two classes both happen to be dense in the closure. Okay, this is actually the closure of the topology. Okay, this is actually the closure or the topological closure. They both happen to be dense in this topological closure, and then there is a result which is very simple to prove that in a no-eterian topology, you cannot have two disjoint sets, which are both dense in the same closed set. Okay, so because the topology that we have is noetherian, this is closed. If they were different classes, would get a contradiction. So that follows that these two classes happen, I mean, they must. I mean, they must have non-empty intersection, and hence alpha is equal to alpha. So I think this is a short proof. So, okay. Still acceptable, I would say. So, yeah, great. So, yes, so right. Maybe I'll try to say a word. So I try to say a couple of words about no, a few words about one, okay? So what's the idea in one? So for one, it suffices to show the following, which is actually funny. Probably it's obvious, but it's funny. Okay? It suffices to show. But it's funny, okay? So fast to show the following. If you have a type P, say over L, any random type, and let's just maybe assume that L contains all these values of lambda functions, okay? Every, for each, for P, there is some L P formula. contained in the type such that for every tame formula or for every linear formula phi of xy and every a in L, what we have is that phi phi of xy belongs to p if and only if chi is contained in this defined object. Okay? So you're saying I'm actually writing the same symmetry? Simply? Phi of xa is this is a name. Yes. Sorry. Yes, this is an A. So it looks like I'm just writing down the existence of a minimal formula again. The only thing Formula again. The only thing that is different is that I'm not requiring Qi to be anything. She is just any random formula. It can be negations. There can be anything. Everything that I want to write, I'll write it down. If I'm able to prove this, or if we're able to prove this, a very easy compactness argument on the space of types actually provides that you have the DCC. Okay, so it's a very simple compactness argument, very simple, really, very simple. Very simple, really, very simple. But so, if you're able to find a random formula which somehow works, then apparently you have the DCC, and indeed, then there will be a formula in F which works. So, the advantage of that is that in G, you can put everything you want. You can put negations of things. You can put in G, for example, things which are going to say certain coefficients cannot be zero. You need more information, etc. And the idea at the end of today is that what we want to show is that. Today is that what you want to show is that if you have some polynomials which are linearly dependent, that for now this must be true for every realization of G. Okay, and the idea is you have these polynomials and you try to reduce modulo Kroeppner basis using the fact that you can put in G, for example, the information that the coefficients of the Kropner bases are not going to be zero. Okay, you can put everything, you can put lots of information. So actually, this triviality is a very simple remark. This already gives This already gives an algebra free proof of the notarianity of polynomial equations without using Hilbert's basis theorem. Because Hilbert's basis theorem is much more stronger. I mean, it contains a lot of information. Every idea is finally generated. But if you only want to show that there is no infinite descending chain, actually, you can use conditions which say, for example, the polynomials that I need to do. for example the polynomials that I need to divide with have non I mean the leading coefficients are not symbols and this also gives the same proof that for example the Colchian topology is going to by a same similar argument doing some reduction without having to worry about separands and which is you are very brutal okay and so this is the idea the idea is that somehow we use this very trivial remark and then we can prove it I thought it was great actually at that moment after four years of working on this I thought yeah we made it but then I thought, yeah, we made it. But then Martin did not seem happy about that. So then we decided to keep on working for another year, of course, to try to actually find an explicit formula. And this is a bit more complicated because then we have to use what I call Hilbert polynomials of homogeneous ideas. So it's a bit more annoying, especially because it's written always in the language of schemes. I don't know what a scheme is. So yeah, so it took us a long time to translate. Oh, yeah, so it took us a long time to translate everything into our correct ways. Okay, I think it's a very good moment to stop. Thank you. I apologize. Okay. Public announcement, I apologize, yeah. So is there so how specific are the proof tool this year for the for for the For the for pairs. For example, build pairs of equational ideally or strongly more procedure. Yeah, so we are actually using, we are using very algebraic theory. I mean, what we're doing is division with rest in the polynomial ring. This is what we're doing. Okay, so that's why we don't know how to do that in other theories, even if the theories were Noetherian to start with. Suppose that you start with an omega-stable theory, which happens to be Noetherian, and then. Stable theory, which happens to be Noetherian, and then somehow you look at Belbert for whatever reason. I don't know. I actually don't know because the proof, at least what we're doing, is very we really pay division with rest, I mean with remainder in the polynomial ring, but I don't see what could be the replacement of that person here. That's where you want to define the canonical base of the tuple. So, okay, so the canonical base of the type. Wait, you mean the canonical base? Okay, the actual canonical base. Okay. So I would say the canonical base. So I would say the canonical base is probably given by the field canonical base of A and the lambda functions over, I would say, but I haven't checked it, but I would say this is the canonical base. Actually, probably this is. Actually, Pride, this is what you brought. In the lovely pairs theme. I think maybe actually they've already noticed this. That it's interdefinable at this or interbounded. Sorry. I mean, just on different question. Atros, do this I is there any connection between uh network reality and NFCP? So, I mean, if you have a network. NFCP is the bottom one function. Right, but if it's Notarian, does it have the NFCP? This is I think I was mentioning this about pairs of Notarian and I thought I don't know if this is true. So I don't know. Actually just because it was a bit quick. I mean lots of parts of the uh tool make would make sense in an for an albatross. Yeah, I mean in particular MollyRack is also a foundation rack. And if that always true If that holds true. So, okay, so this is true. This is unrelated. So, this is unrelated to fields. The only thing that we need, however, is a condition that the Morley rank can be isolated or witnessed by a formula in our class. Okay, so we need this. And if we have that, this is the first thing we have to prove. What we have to prove is that actually the Mori run can be isolated by an instance of a formula. Isolated by an instance of a formula in our class, and once that we have that, actually, this is just a comparison of ranks, so this is not complicated. But we need to... Yeah, you can have an Ethereum family that does not have... I don't see in general a reason why in order to isolate the type, you don't need to have some negations. I don't know, Claude. Maybe there is not an Maybe there is not a reason why you should have negations, but I don't see why you cannot have negations. Does it make sense? So I don't I mean it's clear that you're gonna have it by a constructible formula, but I don't see why it has to be a closed subset. I don't know. I don't know. Three or a mark. Three is true for any single theory, right? Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What about well pairs of PCF0? Good point. Also quite nice, right? Yeah, indeed. How do you interpret that in CF? I would to say the proof should work, except maybe the division algorithm is a bit more complicated. The division algorithm is a bit more complicated because then you will have to choose also a so we're choosing a Gropner basis, so we're already making a choice of polynomials, but then for the division algorithm, then maybe we'll have to do another step. But actually, yeah, if it should work. Actually, yeah, it should work. But please don't tell us. I mean, I eventually I would like to publish something. So maybe after you publish again. Yeah, then maybe yeah, maybe make the kitchen, right? Because otherwise Let's take them up again. Today. I'll get what? All right, so I think that's where I'm going to be able to do it.
