Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the invitation. It's really a shame that I'm not able to be there. I would have liked to be there, but yeah, life is as it is. I hope you are having a great time. I'm sorry I cannot join all the talks, especially the ones that are very late for me in the afternoon. Me in the afternoon. But anyway, I'm going to talk today about Corkola supernovae, understanding gravitational waves from Corkola supernovae. So first of all, let me explain very rapidly what are corkular supernovae. So here we are talking about the collapse of the core of massive stars. And massive stars, by massive stars, I mean stars between 8 and 100 solar masses approximately. Solar masses approximately. I'm going to focus in most of the part of my talk on non-rotating progenitors because they are expected to account for probably more than 99% of all the progenitors of producing this kind of events. And those should be observable in gravitational waves with In gravitational waves within 10 kiloparsecs or so. Okay, so they are supposed to be galactic events from the gravitational wave point of view, which makes them relatively rare because they are only one or two percent within our galaxy. Okay, so regarding fast rotating progenitors, I think I think this will be addressed in the talk by Bergham MÃ¼ller later during the week. So I will mention them a bit later, but most of the talk I'm going to talk about non-rotating progenitors. Okay, in those cases, what happens at the end of the evolution is that the iron core is so massive that it collapses under its own weight. And the high densities that you reach at the center produce a fair. That you reach at the center produces a phase transition to neutral matter. So, all the nuclei are disintegrated, and you just end up with just pure nuclear matter, so just nucleus, mostly neutrons. And those form a protonitrostar, which is at the very center of the star, and a shock which initially spans. A shock which initially is expanding but very rapidly is stalled, and it's stalled because you have mass accreting from the rest of the star which is falling. Okay, so you form this system of a proto-neutrostar with a stall shock and an accretion which may last for a very long time. Okay, so this system stays in this way for about one second, half a second to one second. During this time, what you have During this time, what you have is a lot of neutrino emission, antineutrino emission from the inner part, from the proton neutron star. And you also have a lot of instabilities going on, like the shock instabilities in the location of the forest, which becomes deformed, and the convection, for example. So, what is going to happen is that a very small fraction. That a very small fraction, about 1% of the energy emitting neutrinos of the cooling proton introstar, is going to be deposited behind the shock, and this will produce eventually a supernova explosion, okay, a corporal supernova explosion in most of the cases. In a subset of the cases, if the energy is not sufficient, it won't produce an explosion, which means that the continuous Which means that the continuous accretion will make the proton-electrostar collapse to a black hole, and this will produce a black hole at the end. But for the point of view of the gravitational wave emission, the features of the signal are very similar because the important part is the time when you have the system, a proto-neutron star, which is continually excited by the convection and the shock instabilities. And this part is common. instabilities and this part is common regardless of if you have a supernova or a black or formation of a black hole okay yeah so how does it look like the the gravitational wave from uh from those events so the the very first uh few milliseconds or few milliseconds uh right after bounce uh so the the formation of the protein star what you have is the is the bounce signal. If the bound signal. The bound signal only appears for sparrotated progenitors because it's the result of the deformation that the core has due to rotation. And when the core bounces, then it produces this gravitational wave signal. If the core is not rotating initially, then it won't produce, it will be just spherical core bouncing, which won't produce any gravitational wave signal. So this feature is very clear. So, this feature is very characteristic of rotating models. Then, during the first, say, half a second or one second, you have the post-bounce signal, supernova signal, which is everything which goes between the bounce up to the onset of the explosion or the black hole formation. And during this time, what you have is the typical features. I saw here a spectrogram from one of our papers in which you see this characteristic. Papers in which you see this characteristic post-bound signal of increasing some features with increasing frequency. And finally, after the onset of the explosion, if there is still a protonutron star, this is cooling down and is convectively unstable and it can be convectively unstable for 10 to 50 seconds. And during this time, it will produce a gravitational wave signal from convection and will totally. Front convection, and we'll talk later about that. So, what is producing the post-bond signal? So, as I said, the most compact part of the star is the protonetrostar, and this is continuously being hit by the different instabilities going on around. So, these instabilities are acting like some kind of hammer, which is hitting continuously the proton neutron star, and by heating. And by hitting the protoneto star, it's exciting the internal modes of the protonetostar, which is emitting gravitational waves at some characteristic frequency, which is a feature, it's just the eigen mode structure of the oscillation modes of this protonator star. So the gravitational wave itself, since it's produced by all these random excitations. All these random excitations due to all this instability. So the gravitational wave signal looks very stochastic. It's indeed highly stochastic. So it doesn't have a very clear pattern when you look at in time. But when you start doing spectrograms, you see that also numerical simulations are showing these characteristic features of raising frequency patterns that are, as I said, related to modes. To modes, oscillation modes of the protonetron star. So, what information can we extract about this mode? So, the idea here is to do protonetron star astere seismology. So, just try to understand what are these modes and try to extract information. And for that, first, we have to understand what are the modes that are observed. So, when we see the rising pattern, what is this mode exactly? And if we see an additional feature. And if we see an additional features, what are these additional features? The second will be how the frequency of these modes that we can identify relate to properties of the proton interstars like mass and radius. And we are going to talk about universal relations. And finally, can we extract, so once you put all this into real detector noise, can we extract any information at all from Any information at all from that or not? So I'm going to try to answer these three questions. So regarding mode identification, we had a couple of papers on this issue. So what we are doing is just we run multidimensional simulations. We have an example here. So for the multidimensional simulation, what you usually do is you compute the waveform. The waveform, typically using the quadrupole formula, and from that you compute the spectrogram, which was what I was showing you. But alternatively, you can do something in parallel. So you can, from the simulation, for each output of the simulation, so you are doing at the regular intervals, you are doing outputs of the simulation. So for each output, what you do is an angular average. An angular average. So, what you get is 1D profiles for each time. So, you get an evolution of the 1D angular average. And then once you have these 1D profiles, these systems inside the SOCs are approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium. So, what we can do are studying linear perturbations of this 1D background. And in particular, we can compute the We can compute the L equal to eigen modes of this 1D background. So we can get all the eigenmodes or oscillation eigenmodes for each profile which corresponds to one time. We do this for all time. So what we get at the end is an evolution of the eigenmodes, in this case eliquato eigen modes. Okay, you get this kind of diagrams, which I'm going to show in more detail. So they are in general. So, they are in general complicated and it's difficult to classify the modes. But if you look at our paper, we have more detailed explanation of how we do that. But essentially, what you get is that what you have in the upper part here, all these things are P modes related to pressure waves. What you have in the lower part are G modes, which are related to gravity waves, are produced just by wire. Gravity waves are produced just by buoyancy because you have buoyantly stable regions. And this blue one will be the F mode, which is called the fundamental mode. Okay, it's kind of the fundamental P mode, if you want. It's the ground state of the P mode. Now, you can compare both the spectrogram now with the modes that we can compute and now try to identify one with the other. I see one question. Hi, yes, I have one question. And in your simulation on the FPG mode, you fixed the difference time and for this for fixed the equation of state and you found the fundamental PHG mode. In some sense, your simulation is stationary. Is it stationary for different time at different temperature? You found the PFG mode, or is it dynamically? No, it's a dynamical multi-dimensional simulation that we run, a typical simulation of corkola supernova, which produces actually this waveform and this spectrogram. So it's a full supernova explosion. But what we do is a post-processing in which we take snapshots and consider that each of these snapshots. That each of the snapshots is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium because the proton introstar is evolving slowly. So, then for each snapshot, you do the linear perturbation analysis for which you consider that the background is just a background which is not evolving in time. What equation of state do you use? For those ones, I think for this one in particular, it was Latimer. I think for this one in particular it was Latimen's 220 but we have used other other I will show later results with other equation of state. So yes so when when you put the eigenmodes that we computed on top of the spectrogram you you see that in fact there are for example this mode here sorry this G2 mode coincides with this feature in the spectrogram and this G3 coincides with this one. Concides with this one. Maybe the F mode coincides weakly with some barely see thing here, but okay, this is more dividable. But the main thing is that the G2 mode is the main feature in the spectrogram. And if you now repeat this for multiple models, what you see is that systematically the rising arc that you are seeing in all corkular supernova simulation is related to this particular model. To this particular mode. So essentially, we have identified what is the mode which is contributing more to the gravitational wave signal in these cases. So just as a note, we call this mode G2. Some authors call it F-mode or in different ways, but it's always the same mode. It's just a naming convention and there is still some discussion on how should you leverage this. Know how should you label this mode, but regardless of the level that we use to name it, is a particular mode that we have well identified. Okay, so now what can we do with this particular mode? So what we did here is take a set of 26 1D simulations. Using among these 26, we use two different codes and we use six equations. And we use six equations of state. Two of them contain hyperoms, so that you see that they are clearly different things. And we explore, we use eight different progenitors, just to explore different progenitors. So what we use is you take all the simulations and you take all the times from all the simulations and you compute the eigenvalues and you extract the frequency of this particular mode, for example, the G tune, and you plot. G2, and you plot all these points all together in one single plot. So, all these points are for all the simulations, all times. And what you see is they are in a very narrow region, which means that they follow a very universal relation, which is independent of the code, the question of state, approjectors. This means, and also the time of the simulation. It means that if at a given time of the simulation you observe some feature, or this feature, Some feature or this feature in particular at one kilohertz, for example, it means that it will have this value of the mass over radius square, the surface gravity of the plot-notostar. So by measuring one, you measure the other. And by measuring the time evolution of one, you measure the time evolution of the other. Okay, and you can do similar things also for the F and B modes, although they are more difficult. P-modes, although they are more difficult to observe in simulations. And in this case, the P modes depend on the square root of the mean density inside the shock. So what you can do with this is try to do inference. So essentially, you have an observation which provides you, for example, this pattern here is giving you some particular mode that gives you this frequency as a function of time. Frequency as a function of time, so using the fundamental universal relation to link the frequency with the surface gravity, you can measure the surface gravity with the infusion of time. So, we did that with a particular example in this work. First, what we do is we track the frequency versus time with some tracking algorithm in the spectrogram, and then we use the track that we obtain to That we obtain applying the universal relations to obtain this inferra value in red with a confidence interval in gray. So now since this we are inferring from a numerical simulation, we can compare with the true value and you can see that the true value really fits very well within the 95% conference interval. So this means that so So, this means that, so that means there is, we have inferred the value just from the gravitational wave signal of a simulation which was not used to compute the universal relation, so it's independent. And just using this information, we can recover the true value of the surface gravity of the proton intrastar so far of time. Okay, so now we have tried. So now we have tried to do this for different detectors at different distances, and we can see that we can actually do this analysis. So extract most of this tract with high confidence for current detectors up to 10 kiloparsecs or a few 10 kiloparsecs and for next generation, third generation detectors up to hundreds of kiloparsecs. Hundreds of kiloparsecs. Okay, so this is feasible. If we are able to detect the signal, we will very likely be able to do this analysis and extract what is the measure, what is the evolution of the surface gravity of the protoneutron structure. Okay, so, but can we use these tracks, this structure of the tracks to To help us detect better the gravitational waves. So, what we did is to try to use CNNs, convolutional neural networks, and train them with patterns which look like these rising arcs to try to detect gravitational waves. So, for that, we build a set of phenomenological templates. These are parametric templates, which depends on a number of parameters. Depends on a number of parameters, but that allows us to create random realizations of gravitational waves. So, for example, this waveform here is not a real waveform from a numerical simulation. It's just a phenomenological template, and it takes milliseconds to just create one of those. So, you can create as many as you want, and you can change the different parameters. For example, are the shape of this arc, so you can make it steeper or So you can make it steeper or to reach higher frequencies or lower frequencies. You can play with how broad is the spectrum and different properties. We have calibrated the amplitude of the waveform to 3D simulations so that the amplitude is realistic in the sense that the distribution that you will get just making realization, random realizations of this parametric trend place will be. Of this parametric trend plays will be similar to those of 3D simulations. That allowed us to create a training set of 70,000 waveforms that we are going to use to train our convolutional neural network, which is, I'm not going to enter into details, but it's a modification of Inception ResNet. We call it mini inception reset because it's a much smaller version of the, so it uses the same building. Is the same building blocks, but just a few of them just to make something which is much, much smaller. So, with that, the deficiency that we get when we use the CNN on what we call the blind set, which is an additional set of 60,000 phenomenological waveforms, which are different to the ones that we use for the training set. For the timing set is this one. So it's the orange lines as a function of distance and as a function of the signal stimulation of the signal. But we also tried to use this CNN, which was trained with phenomenological waveforms, to try to detect real or waveforms from numerical simulations. In particular, we made 65,000 injections of 10. 5,000 injections of 10 numerical relativity waveforms, which are the blue lines. And you see that the feces is slightly smaller with respect to the blind set, because you are trying to detect something which you didn't use. I mean, it's slightly different to what you use for the training. What you use for the training was purely phenomenological, it was nothing related. It was nothing related to it didn't contain any numerical relativity waveform, but now here you are trying to detect numerical relativity waveforms, but still it can detect most of these waveforms with high confidence. This means that the phenomenological waveforms that we are using are really, I mean, kind of a good approximation to the real waveforms and really can be used to train this CNN because the problem. Because the problem is that if you want to train a network and waveforms of numerical simulations are very expensive to compute and you can only have a few of them. So you cannot really train a network or if you are going to train the network with just 10 waveforms, it's going to be strongly biased towards these 10 waveforms. So in this way, we are adding more bias. So in this way we are adding more variety to the things that the CNN is seeing and I think it's more flexible when later is trying to identify, to try to recognize signals from real simulations. So now, so as I told you before, rotation, one of the characteristic of rotation was the bound signal, which is very characteristic. Is very characteristic. Here you can see a typical waveform from a rotating model, and I'm going to focus just in the very beginning of the waveform. The rest of the waveform is stochastic and it's very similar to the ones that I showed, but the very beginning, the first few milliseconds are this very clear peak, which is very universal. So all the waveforms always look approximately the same. So, the nice thing is that the shape of this waveform can be characterized, these bounce and the first few oscillation can be characterized only by two parameters. One is the amplitude, so the peak-to-peak amplitude of the waveform, and the other is the frequency of this oscillation. Here, the first few oscillations, they have a peak frequency oscillation which is currently. Frequency oscillation, which is characteristic. And then the nice thing is that the research et al. show that the amplitude of the waveform is related to the rotation, actually is proportional, at least for a very wide range of rotating progenitor, actually the ones which are not extremely rotating. So if you can measure one, you can measure the amount of rotation. The amount of rotation is measured. this the auto rotation is measured here as as t over w is the ratio of kinetic energy rotational kinetic energy over potential energy so it's a measure of rotation okay and then the peak frequency is related to the square root of the mean density so if you measure the peak density you can measure the central density of the of the of the proto-hydro star or the mean density of the proton star okay so we have interest So, we have interest in measuring this tune. So, now what we did is using this car, some kind of using this template, which only depend on these two parameters, we made the injections in Gaussian noise, for a three-detector network of two LIGO and one Virgo. And what we can do is try to with using BILBI, we Using Bilby, we were able to recover the properties of these bounce signals. In particular, we are able to measure the peak frequency and some combination of the amplitude with the distance and the inclination angle. So, if we had one of these signals, probably will be detected in electromagnetic waves. In electromagnetic waves and most likely in neutrinos. So, we will be able to pinpoint the location in the sky and give a measurement of the distance. However, it's more difficult to get the inclination. So, if we are going to do these kind of things, probably we will have some problems disentangling what is amplitude and what is the inclination of the source. Uh, so what we have seen is that you can do this analysis. Uh, so here essentially, you should look, for example, at the solid lines. Solid lines is if you are able, is the distance, yeah, is the fraction of injections in which you can't recover F peak with an error smaller than 10 percent. Okay, and you see that the you see that well above, I mean, well above, well above 10 kiloparsec, we can do this analysis. And similarly for the combination of the amplitude and the inclination angle. So it's very interesting to see that for a galactic supernova, we will be, I mean, if it is rotating, we may be able to measure the rotation and infer additional properties of the proton hydrostar just from the peak frequency, for example. For example. So now the last thing I'm going to talk is gravitational waves from the long-term evolution of plotron neutron stars. So as I mentioned at the beginning, after the supernova's plausion, the remaining neutron star is cooling down, but it's still very hot. So it's convectively unstable and it will emit gravitational waves for tens of seconds, 10 to 50 seconds or so. The problem is that the The problem is that these simulations are very long and very expensive to perform. I mean, you cannot do three-dimensional simulations lasting for 10 or 50 seconds because this is extremely expensive. It's already extremely expensive for one second, which is the typical corporal simulations. For 10 or 50 seconds, is impossible right now. So instead of that, what we have done is we take a 1D simulation. We take a 1D simulation which lasts for tens of seconds. I think it's seven seconds per month, right? And then we take snapshots of the simulation, two snapshots, one at 0.2 seconds after advance and one at five seconds. And then what we do is we use that as a background to run an elastic simulations. And elastic simulations are much cheaper computationally because they filter sound waves. They filter some waves essentially, but the problem that they have is that the background, so to say, has to be static. Okay, so what you do, what we do here is just take these snapshots and try to measure how is the convection, so to say, at 0.2 seconds or how is the convection at 5 seconds. And we are doing this with an MSD code, which is called MAGIC. So it's not only includes convection, but we are also... Includes convection, but we are also going to include magnetic fields and rotation. Actually, this code, many of these simulations have been used recently to prove that it's possible to have proto-neutron star dynamos in fast-rotating proto-neutron stars. So, this is a summary of what we get. So, here, depending on the angular frequency of the Of the progenitor. Here, what I'm plotting is the RMS, HRMS, the RMS value of the strain at 0.2 seconds or at 5 seconds for a different set of, I mean, each point is a numerical simulation. And so you can see that right after bounce, the signal given to convection for non-rotating model is about ten to minus twenty-four. Is about 10 to M minus 24, which is below the level that have the typical proton-interstar oscillation. So this signal won't be seen because it's hidden by the proton-introstral oscillations that I was showing at the beginning. And in a time scale of size seconds, it's decreasing in amplitude down to 10 to minus 27. However, in the case of fast-rotating progenitors, this branch here, you can Okay, this branch here, you can see that when it's sufficiently rapid, rotatively rotating, the strain starts increasing and you can see that we can get relatively high signals that could be observable with current or future detectors. So, how does So, how does this gravitational wave signal look like? So, I'm going to show here the spectrum. So, this is the spectrum normalized to the overturned frequency. So, the characteristic is well, first is the spectrum of gravitational waves is produced by a stochastic convection. It's just complexity stochastic and it has a broad spectrum which has a mass. Which has a maximum around the overturn frequency of the convection. So, what is setting the frequency is how fast are the motion of the convection overturns. Okay, so these are four slope rotations. So, if you go to the fast rotation case, what you get is the appearance of inertial modes. Okay, so all these peaks here. And the frequency of these inertial modes scales with the The inertial modes scale with the rotational frequency. So, in principle, if you are able to measure the inertial modes, you may be able to say something about the rotational frequency. Actually, you get a particular pattern of inertial modes. You see all these modes here. And the spacing of these modes is related to the shape of the convective layer. So, it's related to the properties of the convective layer. So, in principle, it's difficult, so we don't know exactly how to do it yet. So, we don't know exactly how to do it yet, but in principle, by looking at the spacing of these peaks and what are the features, we could say something about how large or what is the location of the convective layer. So, I'm going to conclude now. So, gravitational wave signals from corkolar supernovas have offer multiple possibilities to infer properties from prototypes. To infer properties from proteinetron stars through G-modes or P-modes, or using the peak frequency at bounds for fast-authority progenitors, or using inertial modes, as I just mentioned. But I mean, even if we cannot extract anything or just a few things, just the observation of these features, just the observation of this arc pattern that I have visually, you it will confirm the corkola supernova model because. Corpolar supernova model because the appearance of this pattern depends very deeply on the fact that you have a protonitive star of a certain size, that you have matter at certain density. So just observing these things at this characteristic frequency will tell you there is a protonitive star there. It's a direct evidence that the core collab supernova models is correct. However, it's still unclear if we are able, for example, to measure Are able, for example, to measure surface gravity from the predominant star. Beyond the fact that we know the surface gravity, it's unclear what else can we understand. For example, can we extract some information about the equation of state just from the measure of the surface gravity or not? And for that, I think there is still much more work to do to try to understand these kinds of things. And with this, I'm going to finish. Thank you very much. Phoenix, thank you very much. Thank you very much, Pablo. Any questions from the audience? Yes, we have questions here. I have a question. Pablo, those phenomenological waveforms that you talk about, are they available for use, or did you think about Did you think about, for example, using them for the O3 replay and so other machine learning methods or other, you know, we could try to detect them with CWB or do a MDC. Yeah, so they are not public available. I think we never did them public available. It's explained in the paper how to compute it, but in any case, I can set it if. In any case, I can share it if anyone asks. I'm happy to share or collaborate or anything. Currently, I'm working in a so these waveforms that I showed are for so that don't include polarization. So I'm working now in a more sophisticated version, which includes polarization. And probably I will write a paper and it will make sense to make them public available or something, yes. Public available or something, yes. Yeah, I was thinking, yeah, I was thinking that, for example, one could try to use coherent wave bursts of X pipeline and see since they seem to have a common pattern, maybe one could devise some cuts, you know, for coherent waivers or something like that to improve the search, make it more. Search makes it more. I'll take a look at the paper and see how they are completed. Yeah, that will be interesting, yes. Dick, go ahead. Yeah, thanks. Great talk, Pablo. I was wondering about the generation of the waveform. So, one basic question is: when you use your CNN to generate the, so, as a generative model. As a generative model, are you using that only to generate, like, to exactly simulate the waveform, or are you generating data? So that is, you know, you train your sample on, you know, injecting waveforms in some sort of noise, and then, you know, you train your network to produce, you know, signal with noise. I was curious about that. So is basically the waveform generator, is your CNN acting as a waveform generator essentially? Oh, no, no. So here, no, no, it's not that. Sorry. So here we have two separate things. One is the wavefort generator, the phenomenological templates, which is just some simple algorithm based on a harmonic oscillator. And with that, we can generate as many waveforms as we want. And the CNN is. And the CNN is what we are training the CNN for detection. So we are using, we are generating spectrograms and we are passing the images of the spectrogram to the CNN to train it to recognize the typical pattern from corporal supernovae, so to say. And once we train it, we can use it with spectrograms from real simulations just to see if it is able to detect. And we are injecting this signal. Are injecting these signals, we are injecting them in noise. Yes, yes. This is a with three detector noise, yes. I see. So or I see. So your waveforms are, you have a bank of templates, and then you pick that, you inject it into Gaussian noise, and you're training your CNN to pick out that signal given data. So then I'm wondering, so then So then I'm wondering. So then with Bilby, so then, okay, I'm a little confused now. So with Bilby, what are you inferring on? Because I thought that initially you were using your CNN as your waveform generator, essentially, and then you would potentially sample on some hyperparameters of the CNN, but that does not seem like if you could explain that bit, yeah. No, the BLB project is a separate project, it's unrelated to the Is unrelated to the CNN. For the PLP, what we use is the fact that this part of the waveform scales with the amplitude and the frequency. So you can scale all the, I mean, we have a set of thousands of waveforms from numerical simulations, just from the bounds, okay, that you can scale. That you can scale with delta H and the frequency. So you can create a master template, just averaging all the templates. So we have, for this case, we have a single template, which depends on two parameters. And this is what we are using in Build B. But this project doesn't use the phenomenological template nor the CNN at all. It's a different project. Sorry if I went too fast. Okay, no, no, it's okay. Thanks. That's clear. That's clear. Pablo, I have a couple of questions. The first one is about the G-mode. So maybe you comment this in the talk, but maybe I got lost. So what I want to know is what can you infer from the spectrogram and with the G mode after you detect gravitational weights, what do you? weights uh what do you what can you infer about the source about the supernovae so what you infer so well yeah the frequency depends uh yeah the frequency of this mode depends on the surface gravity mass over radius square of the proton interstar so if you measure the frequency you measure measure this quantity so this is what you do at the end Is what you do at the end. So, your measurement will be the this inferred variable value, the red curve, which is the time evolution of mass of the protonetostar over radius square of the protonetrostar. So, you get the evolution of that in time. This is for a single supernova explosion. So, you will get something like this for each event. Okay, okay, I see. Thank you. Okay, okay, I see. Thank you. My other question is related with the CNN detector. So I have two questions there. My first question is about the working point. So you have a false alarm rate at some signal-to-noise ratio. So my question is: how do you compute that with the CNN? And the other question is: if you compare performance of this. Compare performance of this detector with other pipelines? So, the first question: So, what we do here is we make injections with signals and we make injections with noise. And this is just a ratio. I have to remember now what is exactly the definition of this one. It's in the paper, but it's essentially the fraction of false alarms. The fraction of false alarms, essentially. Okay, it's number of false alarms, the fraction of false alarms over all the. Now I have to remember if it is over all the injections or but it doesn't change too much anyway. So there is some fraction of fractional false alarm. Okay. Based on events which are noise but are detected. Noise, but are detected by a signal. Okay. Regarding the second question was whether comparison. Yeah, that will be very interesting. I will very much like to do this because a comparison, we haven't done it yet, but that will be very interesting because I mean, otherwise it's difficult to know how good or bad is this compared to other. Bodies, this compared to other things. And this is something that I would really like to push it into the future or the next work that we do in this, just make a comparison, for example, with coherent wave art. So for this work, I think the most interesting part is the fact that even, I mean, that phenomenology, you can train with phenomenological templates, and then you can detect real waveforms, even if you train with phenomenology. Even if you train with phenomenological, and that I think that's interesting by itself. But yeah, it needs more work just to try to compare with other approaches. I mean, the current approaches using the collaboration. Thank you. Thank you very much. I see now that the false alabright is the fraction of the false detected errors. Thank you.
