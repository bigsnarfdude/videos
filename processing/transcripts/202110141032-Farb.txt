Thank you to everyone for coming, and thank you to the organizers for inviting me. I'm glad to have this chance to give a talk. It does connect, actually, with a lot of the themes of the conference, even though it's not directly about the cohomology of roots, the cohomology of lattices, although that actually occurs in a bunch of the proofs, which you may not see today. See today, but so what I'd like to do today is to present a new series of conjectures, which are really a single guiding principle that produces a lot of conjectures that can be solved with the methods of geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology, and algebraic geometry, and several complex variables and other related things. That's what I like about it. And what the general setup is, is that you have an algebra geometric construction. Yeah, it's like a Thurston student doing algebraic geometry, and that's what this really talk is about. So you have these miraculous algebraic geometry constructions, which unfortunately I didn't learn about until 15 years ago or 10 years ago, one amazing one after another. And you can view an algebraic geometric construction as giving you a morphism between two moduli spaces. We'll give lots. We'll give lots of examples, or sometimes it'll be like a section psi of some bundle or covering space of moduli spaces. And the deep guiding principle that I've been developing, and there's lots of proof of it, is the size of miracle. That's the mathematical official mass guiding principle. Guiding principle. And so, what I mean by that, let me give two instances of what I mean by that. One would be called holomorphic rigidity. So, you have these remarkable maps, and it's very much in the style of kind of Mosdale, Marbola, superigidity, Yale, rigidity theorems. It's that this map, if F is any non-constant holomorphic map between these two moduli spaces. Between these two moduli spaces. So we're given this psi going from n to n. If you take any other non-constant holomorphic map, it has to just equal your given map. So it characterizes that map. That's the unique miracle. And there's one more version I'll give you. You could, of course, have morphism rigidity. You can have rational maps. And there's many generalizations that are actually really interesting. And they're all different. And the topological rigidity. Rigidity. And let me just say this informally. If you have any continuous map, and now let's say we have two families of varieties parameterized by positive integers, m sub m and n sub n, nontrivial and continuous. Then, for example, what you say is that this only occurs in very specific dimensions. Dimensions. And of course, you don't have uniqueness of maps anymore. If you're just doing continuous maps, you can prepare one, but optimotopy, your map is unique. You're really classifying. You're trying to kind of classify the miracles. And the reason, the guiding principle, this guiding principle produces many conjectures and in some sense, it encapsulates a lot of other. It encapsulates a lot of other previously known rigidity results, like more ballistic rigidity and things like this. And these are mostly open. So this is really a call to arms for people to attack these. And I'll say one or two things about it. Firstly, you'll see this gotting principle has already been successful. I started this stuff in maybe 2016. I started telling people about this, and there have been a few. The principle has actually produced stuff. The principle has actually produced stuff, produced theorems, and a number of different people. And the real reasons to kind of my motivations are, firstly, when you prove a virginity result like this, it's a way to actually, you don't just say, oh, there's no other example, see, we're going to go home. All virginity theorems I view as you're understanding the miracle better, you're understanding the map a lot better by proving, like giving characterizations of it. Secondly, you can view it as like a systematic Can view it as a systematic search. Classical people have constructed these maps, and it's like a systematic search for new ones. And we have found, not me, but others have found new ones based on these things. And today, I'll just give three examples. Three reasonably elementary examples. I'm going to start with very easy things and show you that these really easy things are already incredibly rough. These things are already incredibly rich. And I might not have time for the methods, but so far the methods used are like non-polymer curvature, geometric group theory, Thurston normal form, cohomology of arithmetic groups, as cohomology as obstructions to solving problems, and a lot more. But let me get into the mathematics. Questions? That's just the general setting. I'd like to start with something very classical, resolving the quartet. So let me start with a clue. Here's something that we learn as undergraduates. Here's a proposition that you learn in undergrad group theory text. One symmetric group surjects onto another smaller one, let's say n bigger than m bigger than 2, if and only if nm equals 4, 3. And the proof of one direction is just direction is just a n is simple for n greater than or equal to 5. So when you take psi of an and you look at the kernel, you see that it has to have some kernel. Just by a number of elements is too big, it has to have some kernel in your simple group. So the kernel is everything. And so you factor through Sn mod A n, which is Z mod 2, so you can't surject to the symmetric group, because M is bigger than Q. The other one. The other one is more miraculous, and the way I learned it was: here's a map, you look at S4, and it acts by permutations on the finite set, which is just this conjugacy class in S4. 1, 2, 1, 3, and 1, 4. So you act on this conjugacy class, right? And you can check it. It obviously acts transitively. So it surjects, and that's isomorphic to S3. rejects and that's isomorphic to S3. What's cool is that you could say, well, why don't I S4 act on another conjugacy class? Or why can't you do S5 act on one of its conjugacy classes? You definitely get representations and permutation groups, but you're never going to get one that's surjective. And I'll do a smaller degree of thing. So that's a cool thing. So questions? So I always thought that was cool and this like weird ad hoc thing, but in mathematics, there's no... I made up a phrase, a cigar is never just a cigar in mathematics. A cigar is never just a cigar in mathematics. There's never some cool thing that's not true for some amazing reason. But let me just give a: if you take the Bray group on n strands, so pi 1 of unordered configurations of n points in the complex plane, it has a homomorphism onto Sn that, of course, you know, you give me a grid, it has a well-defined homomorphism, well-defined up to conjugacy by relabeling, and you get a permutation here. And you get a permutation here, like the permutation 1, 2. Right, so this is reductive homomorphism. And here's a proposition that's not hard to prove. I'm not sure who this is due to. Maybe Lin, but it's not hard with Thurston, if you know, sort of thirst in normal form. n greater than n greater than 2, if and only if nm equals 4 third. And I'll just give you what it is, the homomorphism from B4 to B3. B4 to B3 is you take the standard thing that flips the first two, that's sigma one, and also sigma three, and you map it to sigma one, and then sigma two maps to sigma one. I believe that's it. And you satisfy the relations. It's a little ad hoc. Should there be a sigma two on the right-hand side somewhere? Oh, yes, there. I think. Yes, I think that's it. So, thank you. And I just want to say there's this community. And I just want to say there's this commutative diagram: B4 to B3, S4. So this is at least sort of explaining the S3 thing, something more general is happening. But then why is this happening? And here's like a lift of the left. If you take polyn to be the space of monic square free polynomials, so z to the n plus a1, z to the n. z to the n plus a1, z to the n minus 1 plus a n square free. So no repeated roots. The first thing is that polyn is isomorphic to unordered configurations of n points by just taking a polynomial p to the set of roots. And by the fundamental theorem of algebra, you get a full set of roots. Square free means by definition you're distinct. means by definition you're distinct and of course z1 to zn you just get the polynomial z minus zi okay so those are isomorphic algebraic varieties they're diffeomorphic spaces so pi1 of the space of square free polynomials is bn and in fact it's a polynomials it's a k bn1 so this is the very close relationship between polynomials and the grade group and Ferrari in 1545 In 1545, they were really interested in giving formulas for solving polynomials, and he did something called resolving the quartic, which was a way to solve quartic polynomials in one variable by reducing them to qubits. And I'm going to rephrase what he did as producing a morphism of quasi-projective varieties. I'll call it fur for Ferrari. I'll call it Ferr for Ferrari, poly 4. And it's an amazing thing to poly 3. And I'm going to write this down. It's taking, I'm going to think of a polynomial as its set of four roots. You're given four unordered points in a complex plane, and you have to come up with four distinct unordered points, three distinct unordered points. You can't just say forget point number four, there's no such thing, they're unordered. And so, how do you do it? By the way, exercise, give me a geometric way to do this, just with pure geometry of the plane. So, Z1, I'm going to write the formula, and it has, just because it's cool. He figured this out. And the amazing thing is that the points, if Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are distinct, Then these points are distinct. That's what you have to prove. Now that I told this to you, you can prove this. And that's a morphism, and it's induced map when pi 1 is a surjection. And it's the usual, it's that map. So this is the reason why, when I learned as an undergrad, S4 goes to S3. It's this miracle map. It's this miracle map in algebraic morphism. It's resolving the quartic. That miracle in geometry produces the B4 to B3, produces the S4 to S3. And people, of course, tried to resolve the quintic and do similar things, and they failed. When you try to do the same thing for quintec, the same recipe, you get a degree six polynomial. And there's a theorem of Lin. There's now shorter proofs, like I know how to prove this in a much shorter way. To prove this in a much shorter way. But Lynn did this beautiful thing in 2004. If you have any max from polym to polyn, n greater than n greater than 2, suppose it's non-constant, that's a silly thing. I think you've scrolled off so we can't see what you're writing, Vincent. Uh-oh, it should. There. You got it. Non-constant and holomorphic. Thank you for telling me. And holomorphic, thank you for telling me. Then, one of two things can happen. It can be sort of trivial, and I'll just say this. It's f factors. So if you take a square foot polynomial, you can take its discriminant, because these are the guys who have discriminants, not zero. That's a surjective map, actually, to C star. And then you can just include that into polym in any way. This corresponds on the brain group side for Bn surjecting to Z. For bn is rejecting to z, and then you can stick z inside anything. Or mn equals 4, 3. And your mystery map is the Ferrari map. So Ferrari found the only miracle, given a polynomial, to get a smaller polynomial. And I'd like to propose the problem of classifying. Of classify all continuous, of course, that's going to be up to homotopy, holomorphic, algebraic, rational, et cetera, maps from polyn to polyn for n greater than or equal to n. And let me just say a few comments on this problem, which I find to be very interesting. There exist maps. Interesting. There exist maps that take n distinct points to n plus 1 that are continuous. You can just send an unordered n tuple of points. I have to add a point in a well-defined way. I just take all those points, and I'll just add one, and to make sure it's not any of those, I just add them all up, take the F value and add one. So you might say, well, does there exist a holomorphic woman? There does not exist such a holomorphic. Exists such a holomorphic math F, notice that this is not a holomorphic. And if you replace it with like z squared, then you don't get distinct points anymore because it's complex numbers you're squaring there. So Trevor Hyde, who's a postdoc here, and I think Lynn did this as well. You can't add a point holomorphically if it's adding a point, meaning. It's adding a point, meaning, in other words, the point you're adding, sorry, intersect Zm plus 1 is not, is equal to M to set. So it might be the case. It's an open question. Can you produce a polynomial? Given a polynomial to be n with n distinct roots, is there a holomorphic way to produce a polynomial where n plus 1 points? That's it. Else. That's it. They don't have to have any relation to the original points. Maybe there's some unrelated polynomial. A miracle to be found. We don't know. But I just want to point out there exists many maps Bn to B2N. And I'll just say you can do these like tabling constructions where you put a braid inside here and a braid inside here. And there's this work of a lot of people, but I'll just mention, yes, it's true, I mentioned them because they were like. True, I'm assuming because there were like two of the three of my students. And do these correspond to holomorphic maps or algebraic maps is what I'm curious about. And Margolita has an amazing conjecture to try to classify all representations of the ray group to bigger ray groups. Sort of amazing, but I don't have time. Any questions? Okay, so that was the first thing. All these open questions here, even the most basic things, from n points to m plus 1, as a whole. M points to m plus one, does a holomorphic math exist? Even though continuous ones exist. Is the obvious continuous one homotopic to a holomorphic one? And classify all the... I think you can classify all the homotopy classes because everything is a k pi 1. And I think you can classify all the homomorphisms of the ray group, b n to b n plus 1. It gets really hard once you hit 2n. All of a sudden, there's tons of stuff you can do, and amazingly, marketly. He can do, and amazingly, Margley has like a list. I can't think of any more things, any more homomorphisms that are on his list there. Okay, so let me go to the second example, choosing points on cubic curves. So I'm going to look at smooth cubic curves in the plane. Cubic curves in CP2. Everything's over the complex numbers today, although Everything's over the complex numbers today, although really interesting over other fields, that's the whole thing, but this is the closest to topology. And I'm only doing qubit curves, so it's the easiest possible thing. I can do degree D hypersurfaces in PN. The questions are all open. But I'm showing you that even in this case, it's incredibly rich in the very simplest Lauderdale case. So here's a question that I started asking in like 2016, among many other questions. Among many other questions, which reminds me: the references for this talk, there's three of them. One of them is a paper on the archive called I forget, global rigidity. I'm forgetting. It's my last paper on the archive. It's just by me. Number two, there's a handout with a bunch of extra examples of the guiding principle and the conjectures it produces. There's a handout on the Beaver's website. On the Burger's website, on the VAMP website. And three, I guess I'm writing a circle of paper with all these things, but unfortunately I'm not finished with them. And my question is: does there exist a way to continuously, respectively, holomorphically, algebraically, rationally, you know, with a rational map. Choose a point on a smooth cubic curve in CP2. So just the solution set of a cubic polynomial, homogeneous cubic in three variables. I.e., the way you say that more formally is, does there exist a section of the bundle? So I'm going to let C. So I'm going to let C be the modulation, the set of smooth, the parameter space of smooth cubic curves in P2. Okay, that's just, yeah. And then now I'm going to give pairs a curve, a point, where P is in C and C is a curve. And I have the forgetful map, pi, pi of c, p. Of C, P is defined to be, you just forget that you chose a point, and of course, the inverse image of C is the fiber in C. So this is a fiber bundle with fiber, a cubic curve, which is a torus. They're all homeomorphic to it, different torus. And I'm asking for a signal, a section signal. It can be smooth, holomorphic, whatever. And more generally, I can ask for an N-tuple. Can you choose an N-tuple of unordered? Can you choose an n-tuple of unordered points, an unordered n-tuple? There's many variations on this, but I'm just going to do this of points. And so, what I mean there is it's the same thing. There's another bundle, I'll call it E sub N, over the parameter space of smooth cubic curves. It's a curve equipped with like an N cubed multiple points, P1 to Pn, where the Pi are in the curve, and then they're distinct. Or in the curve, and then they're distinct. And the fiber over a curve C is just the space of unordered configurations of endpoints on C. And there's a forgetful map, and I'm asking for a section sigma. And I'm going to call this, if this is star up here, I'm going to call this an N multisection. It's just a section of this different bundle. So, are there any questions? Because this is the key concept here. So, I'll stop for questions. And since there's some activity in the chat. Okay. If there's something that should be read, can somebody just make an executive decision? I fear I guess I can. There may be some proposed sections. Um of what? Okay, well, okay, I can't uh let me unit to the section. Yes. I'm going to try to end on top. I will end on time and get the top. Okay, so that's the question. Can you choose a point? Very basic question. And I just want to recall, any smooth cubic has nine distinct complex ones. This is one of these miracles. Flex points. This is one of these miracles. Very classical. In other words, the intersection multiplicity is at least 3. Those are flex points. And so this implies that there exists, and they vary, you can check from the formula, you compute these flex points by computing a Hessian and intersecting with your curve. So there's an algebraic, so there's a morphism of varieties. Bray. So there's a morphism of a variety. Sorry, what's going on? Come with some chat. It's better off this denying multisection given by the set of flush points of C. So my very first thing was, conjecture was, there's not even a way to choose fewer than nine points. But see, there's lots of other sections. There's lots of other sections. And let me just say, there's multi-sections. Let me just give, so I'm giving more examples. But this is this amazing thing. Every smooth cubic curve comes with a canonical nine points. Canonical meaning it's varying algebraically over the moduli space. And if you pick a single point, this, so as you know, a cubic curve gives you a group once you pick a base point there. The base point there. So it gives you an elliptic curve. And once you have a group law, so it's just the tortoise, you can set the set of k-torsion ones. So this implies that for all k greater than or equal to 1, there exists a 9k square algebraic multisection. So that's pretty amazing. You write down this. You write down your cubic polynomial in three variables, a homogeneous cubic. You know, x squared y minus pi plus e z cubed. And there's nine k squared points that come with these nine k squared points. And nine k squared, just because I don't have a single choice of a base point of like what's the origin, what's the identity in my group, but I have nine possible points. So if you look at all of the So if you look at all of those, and all of them, you get a group law. I can't choose one of them, but for all of them, I get k squared. You check that they're all distinct. So there are 9k squared. That is well defined. And you can add multisections. And maybe because of time, you can work out the numbers you get and multisections. Banner G and Chan worked out these numbers. All the ways to add all these case-squared forms. So these are the numbers: 36, 77. There's a formula. And let me tell you what is known. So what do we know? So my general conjecture was like the only algebraic multisections are torsion constructions. So I'm calling this torsion construction. It's adding up these k torsion sections. These k-corruption sections. Okay? And what's known is I conjectured they were the only ones, and Kurt McWullen solved my conjecture in 2021. Every algebraic n multisection is a torsion construction. So not only Not only are there no holomorphic multisections at all, effectively. Oh, healing it algebraic. So you couldn't prove that the holomorphic. Anyway, not only aren't there algebraic sections for n not equal numbers on this list, but even for n equals 9, there's only one way to do it, and add towards it. Wei Anchen in a beautiful paper, which he wrote, I think he was still a grad student here. I think he was still a grad student here. That a continuous, how about just a way to choose one continuous? And multisects only when 9 has to divide n. So that's sort of evidence that the only continuous ones should be homotopic to these torsion multisections. But on the other hand, but no, or, for example, AT. Or, for example, A.T. And this is Ishan Batterjee, who's still a grad student of mine, and then Wean Chen. And just in terms of continuous ones, let me say for n equals 9, any continuous, I'm just giving you a flavor of results, 9 multisection, the only way to choose 9 points is homotopic to the flex section. To the flex section. C goes to the set of flex points. C, that's a theorem of Wei and Chen. And here's this amazing thing. Again, it's Banerjee Chen. There exist smooth, many, many smooth multisections and multisections. And multisections not from the topic to any holomorphic one. So all of a sudden, and the smallest is n is 216. They did this by a lot of these things where you do homological obstructions, and then you try to match that up with examples until they all match. Their obstructions vanish for n equals 216 with the small n. And so there exists some section, but it must have meaning. Exists some section, but it must have meaning. So, my question is: why 216? Where is that coming from? They can't answer it, because they just know there exists one, but there must be meaning to it. So, that's a new miracle right there, I believe. I mean, there could be just a random thing. And I just want to say the methods used, there's a lot of methods, but I'll just say homological instructions. And open questions, there are many, so many open questions in this directory. Many, so many open questions in this direction, but I'll just mention you can take degree D hypersurfaces in PA. So we just did the case D equals 3 and N equals 2, and it was all that stuff, that cool stuff. And I could talk a lot more about it. Another one is like, can you choose points on abelian varieties? So I've been able to show that any way to choose a point when an abelian variety is like the obvious thing, but for end points, The obvious thing, but for endpoints, it gets more interesting. So maybe I'll end there for example number two, and I'll stop for questions. And this be my last example, it will last 10 minutes. Which, by the way, I do have 10 minutes, and I've still gotten 45 minutes. I just, I don't want to go to work. And oh yeah, this is the title of my paper on the archive: Rigidity of the Period Matter. So you can see my paper on the archive. You can see my paper in the archive. So here's the third kind of miracle. Again, please see the handout. There's tons more types of miracles that are of a different flavor than all these that I just gave on the handout. They just don't have time. And they're producing a lot of what I think are very interesting injectures. Okay, so let me just remind you. Suppose X is a smooth G and S G curve. Let's just say G greater than equal to 2 curve. Curve, and you have this embedding from the first integral homology to you take all the holomorphic one forms on x, and you take its dual space of linear functionals. And then a cycle gives you a linear functional by sending theta to its interval. You just integrate it over the cycle. These are the periods. And you define the Jacobian to be the quotient. To be the quotient. The image. And this is a complex torus, C to the D, model lattice. And in fact, it's a principally polarized abelian variety. If you don't know what that is, that's fine. It's just a complex torus that's also an algebraic variety, and it's equipped with like a symbolic. And so what this produces, this construction due to Riemann, and it's been studied intensely since Riemann. And it's been studied intensely since Riemann. It produces a map from the moduli of genus G Riemann surfaces to the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties that takes X to the Jacobian. And for people who don't know, this is a locally symmetric variety, locally symmetric space. So it's non-possible curved. And in fact, we're going to use that. And this is called the period map. Like I said, it's been studied since Riemann. And what I want to tell you is that you can. On and what I wanted to know, I mean, let me just say two things about it. Uh-oh. The thing is frozen. Whoa. Oh, there we go. And it's injective, and it's a morphism. And the injectivity is a famous theorem called the Turalism. But that doesn't matter for us today. But this is a morphism of quasi-projected varieties. So they're not going to. That they're not compact. And my question was: Is there another way to get from a GST curve other principally polarized ability varieties? The answer is yes. I could take a curve. I could take its mod P homology cover and take its Jacobian. And you do get a map from Mg to some huge AG. But can you do it in? But can you do it? And here's my theorem. Let F go from Mg, and I'll write with n marked points. You can even give me n marked points. It's not going to help you. Take H, T greater than or equal to 4, T greater than or equal to H greater than or equal to 1, B non-constant and holomorphic. So what I'm asking is: is your Asking is, is there a way, different genus G curve, to come up with an H-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety? So a variety that's smaller than dimension H in a way that varies more working with it. That's not stupid. You assign constant math would be assigning the same abelian variety to every curve. So I'm rolling that out. And I'm even giving you, if you want, n points. And the answer. And the answer is no. If that exists, then h equals g, and our mystery map is the period map. And I want to give you a flavor, and maybe I'll just give you first open problems before I do this, and I'll end with like a flavor of a proof that might have done, because it uses a lot of different kinds of mathematics. So one of the things would be classify, of course, and all the maps from MG. And all the maps from mg to ah for h bigger than or equal to g, are they all covers? I think Kurt McMullen asked me if they are, you know, that's what he thinks, that they're all covering from kind of covering instructions. But here's a really interesting one that's an open question that I'll show you how it creates questions like in geometric group theory. So let PG be the space of curves equipped with a two-sheet cover. So that's the same thing as an L. That's the same thing as an element of H1, a non-zero element, of H1 of X with F2 coefficients. Okay? This maps to Mg by just sending, but forgetting the fact that we chose the 2G to cover. Okay? And this is this morphism. It's a covering map, and it's 2 to the 2G minus 1 sheeted cover, right? Because it just does one homology class. And there's a prim map. This and there's a prim map that's a remarkable map. So you give me a curve equipped with a two-sheeted cover, and it's going to produce a G minus one-dimensional complex torus. And here's what you do. You take the two-sheeted cover, I'll call it X theta twiddle. You take its Jacobian. That's some huge dimensional thing. The order characteristic goes up. The order characteristic goes up a lot. It's a two-sheeted gummer. But then the original Jacobian is sitting inside that by transfer. So you bought out, and you do the number, and it goes like this. And my conjecture, a first conjecture, I mean, these are like the easiest, quote-unquote, easiest ones, but it uses a lot of deep math even to prove the first one. If h is less than or equal to g, If h is less than or equal to g and g is greater than or equal to 3, non-constant holomorphic, now new things can happen. Then h is g minus 1 and psi is the prim representation. Or h equals g and what psi is, you have the prim, it covers mg, and then that maps to ag. And you map that. And this brings up a really interesting question. The first step of proving such a thing is you figure out the fundamental group of this space, and it maps to SP2HZ. And this is a subgroup of the mapping class group, Pi1 and Pg. And my student, current student, Carlos Cervan, ecology PhD, by the way, PhD in ecology was. Ph.D. Ecology, who's now my math student, has sort of classified what happens on the fundamental group level. And I think using the methods of my paper, we'll be able to prove this conjecture eventually. But great, so I have three minutes. So maybe I can do a cartoon of proof of the theorem, by which I mean you're given Given a math, holomorphic, non-constant. And I want to show, the goal is to show that F equals J. And I just want to say two things about this, because I'm basically running out of time. I have two minutes precisely. You have the Orbovolt fundamental group, the Orbivold fundamental group of AH. So this you do with. So, this you do with geometric group theory because this is the Mapass group. The symplectic group you use first to normal form. It's work of many people. It uses work of Corkmaz and others to show that F star equals zero or F star equals J star. So say F star equals zero is easy, you're homotopically trivial, holomorphic, you're going to be constant. So say F is homotopic to G. Is homotopic to G. And this already uses a fact that we take for granted, but it's deep, is that mg and ah are rational k pi ones. Great, so you're like, I don't get it. It's two holomorphic maps, and they're homotopic. But of course, they don't have to be equal. And that's most of my paper is devoted to that. And what I'll just said in a cartoon, because there's a lot of things here. Because there's a lot of things here. There's like a Hodge theory proof, but here's the cartoon of the proof. I have F is homotopic to J. I restrict it to some curve sitting inside Mg. Okay, it's holomorphic mass. And you have a homotopy of J and S. Here's a homotopy. And here's the map. And here's the math F, and here's the math J. I think we cannot see what you are drawing again, Benson. Do you not see it? Is it have I now? I can see it. Yeah, we can. Sure, I can see it. Yeah. Oh, my double. This is a homo joke. I'm just refrigerating to a curve. This is holomorphic. This is holomorphic. I use non-positive curvature of this moduli space and convexity and vertex inequality. I have to do an energy estimate. I have to do an energy estimate. And this was always my fantasy to use the vertebrate quality, some theorem about holomorphic submanifolds. I'm using it as a holomorphic detector to make all these at time t polomorphic. So I prove that if you're homotopic, let me just restrict to a curve, you're homotopic through polymorphic max, then you can bump that up to algebraic max. So now I have families of abelian varieties and deformation. Families of abelian varieties and deformations, and then you can apply deformation theory of like Cyto and Vaultings to show like there's a rigid curve. So now my things at least agree, like two maps are equal, at least on this one curve. And that's a good start. So it's those kind of arguments. So let me conclude by saying the summary is just the guiding principle gives many other such problems, and please see my handout and hopefully upcoming. Coming paper that I'm currently writing for many other such problems. And with that, I will stop. Thank you. Questions for the speaker. I think you can speak either on chat. Sorry, you're welcome to speak over Zoom or type in chat or speak if you are a live audience member. Speak if you are a live audience member. Hey, Benson? Yes. So, okay, you explained how there's like lots of sort of topological ways to map a braid group to a bigger braid group. So does this kind of analytic argument have a chance there, like sort of trying, I think, to show that maybe you can't deform those topological maps to algebraic maps? Like what happens if you try to. Right. So there's two different problems in these kinds of rigidity things, and this sort of harks back to rigidity type results, holomorphic rigidity results of like yeah and sue and those people. Although I think this is a new method, my method of like getting your homotopic through Petsu, new method. But so there's two different questions. Given two holomorphic maps that are homotopic, when are they equal? Great? So is a holomorphic map unique? So is a holomorphic map unique in its homotopy class? But then there's what Jordan is talking about: existence. Given a continuous map between two complex manifolds, is there a holomorphic representative? The first problem is not easy, but it's much easier than the second problem. Showing whether or not you have a holomorphic representative in a homotopy class, there are obstructions to it. But to actually prove one exists, One exists. I, you know, you can't. Sort of is one at the boundary, you know what I mean? I sort of feel like there sort of is not exactly a holomorphic map, but there's like, so to speak, a map to the boundary, and you could show that that's the only one. Maybe. Let me say this. You can get harmonic maps when the target's non-positive curve. And then jumping from harmonic to holomorphic is incredibly hard. That's like what Sue's big thing is. That's like what Sue's big thing is: these Bachner formulas and Kevin Corlette kind of stuff. It's very hard. I guess for Sue, some of the things are like 10 pages of PDE estimates and stuff like that. But maybe there's another... Yeah, but just to deform something to a holomorphic map, it's just tough. For example, I don't know of any criterion, if you give me a continuous map of a surface of genus B into some Surface of genus B into some into MH, into a model space of genus H, when is that homotopic to a holomorphic map in any holomorphic structure, in any complex structure? Even allowing you to change that? Yeah, I just think that's a great question. Tough. I don't know how to do that. And I don't think anybody knows. Where where in your theorem do you use that G is at least four? And are there any exceptional examples in lower genus? So I don't know exceptional examples in lower genus. I just used, I used genus at least four. The theorem could still be true, but it has to do with when you really get down and dirty with the details, you have to deal with. You have to deal with the fact that everything I said is like a slight lot because you have to deal with the fact that these are orbifolds and like what is a holomorphic map between orbifolds? I'm like really careful. And I needed to produce certain curves with certain properties, but I didn't want them to hit the orbifold locus. And in genus 2 and 3, somehow the orbifold locus the locus of curves with symmetries in Mg for genus 2 and 3 is too big for me. Is too big for me. So probably, these theorems are probably true, at least for genus 3. Genus 2 is always, it's almost a break group, and so. So I have a question, Benson. So in the last step, you know, you said, so you've gotten these things so that they're, we know that these two things agree on every curve in C and V. Is there like some kind of density result at that point? Like the curves that are, they're not dense, of course, but like. Dense, of course, but like how you didn't say they're equal. Yes, by the way, I realized I made them this. Anyway, I think I only went, I went like five minutes on. Anyway, there's no. And now I'm going to stop for five minutes. No. So there's a theorem, and again, there's a Hodge theory so there is a Hodge theory group, but it's funny, the Hodge theory proof uses like stuff of Schmidt, but then Schmidt used the same theorem that I used, so it's not really an improvement So it's not really an improvement. Basically, you can use the work of Borrell and my former colleague Narrisim to show that these are, because the target is a symmetric space, to show that if you have these two holomorphic maps, you just need them to agree at one point. And then they're equal. Ah, so just one curve is a point. How hard could it be to show that two maps agree at one point? Show that two maps agree at one point. And it's like, but the problem is, there's counterexamples. There's, if you have like your mapping into like a product, then obviously, I'm just saying, you can, there's just homotopic holomorphic maps that are not equal. Like, you can map into a product and just, you know, do anything. And so getting one point to be equal seems super duper duper hard. And then this is how I did it. I found one rigid curve, and I realized that's where it beat. So the So the point is that you get a curve in Mg mapping into AH, that's a family of Jacobians. And I need to define a rigid family of Jacobians. That's rigid, even as an abelian, as a family of abelian variants. That's where you use Sato and Faultings. And it's a fundamental group. I just use the criteria. It's a fundamental group thing. It's a fundamental thing, so that's where I started to need genus forward higher. But then you show that this deformation, a homotopy, is actually an algebraic deformation, but this thing is rigid, and therefore this homotopy is constant, and therefore F equals J just on this one little curve, this one-dimensional thing in this 3G minus 3-dimensional. 3G minus 3-dimensional thing. But those one point, you get, that's what I get by one point. And then you quote Borrell and Ariston. So I hope that answers your question. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, maybe I should have mentioned first Borel and Aristotle, but it's too much that you've got. Because it sounds easy. You just have to get one point being equal, but it's like, yeah, you don't get to deform anything. You're given F and J. Are there other questions? Uh I I have a question. It might be the the same question as Jordan's, or you might get the same answer, which is there are these maps of mapping class groups from smaller mapping class groups to big mapping class groups. There's exotic maps by Heremo, and a line here, Soto. Do you know that those are not all more big? Do you map them? It's really interesting. No. And when I talk to When I talked to algebraic geometers about this, I sent my paper to a few people. And one of the things they wanted me to do was people like Sam Krushevsky, who started like the PRIM representation, and there's variations on it. And I mentioned this because that has a lot to do with these coverings and what you're talking about. They said, boy, we're always trying to find. I mean, this Prim map was named so by Mumford in like the 60s, but Prim. In the 60s, but Prim found this 100 years ago, 120 years ago. They're looking for other Prim maps. They found a few, and they said, tell us where to look. In other words, we're going to get homological obstructions or group theory obstructions. And I'll say, okay, Sam, here's what I can show doesn't happen. So, you know what I mean? It's like a way. So that's one fun aspect of this, I think. It's like the 216, I think. It's like the 216, I think, is the question of the day with the smooth cubics. Thanks. Any more questions for Benson? I'll get her questions later. And Ben, which paper has the 216, degree 216 section in it? Oh, yes. That's a paper by Eshaw. Paper by Yshot. Here I'm going to write it down. It's a unique paper. You can go to the website. Whoops. Wei Am Chen is at Tsinghua. And Yishan Battery is now in Chicago. That has the 216. And there's lots of open mysteries about when continuous maps still exist or not. Choosing points like GMAP. I remember when I said this, like, yeah, Daniel was like, immediately went off. Immediately, he went off. He goes, I don't care about the master stuff. I want to do the G60. Should we? So I don't know. Should we thank Benson again and then have informal discussion? Thank you, Jenny. Jenny posted in the link the file. It's under Ben Super. It's under Bensoon form, but it is me. It's more conjecture than this. Yeah, there's more. You'll see. Great. Let me repeat that before I stop the recording for anybody listening to the recording. Under the public files link on our workshop webpage, you can see Benson's handout. So take a look. And with that, I will stop the recording. And the
