So I would like to talk about the dynamics of vertices in Boson's condensing. So first of all, there is a brief introduction to the Boson's condensation, and then I'll cover some contents about what is in two-dimensional B. Vertices in two-dimensional BECs and also vertices in atmometronics is still a two-dimensional system, but with a particular function. So in the last, I would like to say something about storage is in three-dimensional percent condensates. Okay, as Runzo just mentioned, Guenzo just mentioned the Bosnian instant condensation is a valuable macroscopic quantum phenomenon in physics. So at very low temperatures, below some critical temperature, the atom will occupy the same quantum states as in the momentum states. We can see that with decreasing temperature. Decreasing temperature, there will be a peak at momentum zero. So in 1924 and 1925, Boss and Einstein just makes the idea about the Boss and the condensation. After 70 years with laser cooling techniques, it can be It can be achieved in experiments and many Nobel Prizes related to the boss and standards. So fortunately, the system of the many body system can be described by a single wave function, single particle wave function. So we So we have a non-linear Schrodinger equation, which is called the GP equation. That's the dynamics of the condensates is well described by this equation. This is a kinetic term and we have a trap to make it trapped and confined in the trap. And this is track and this is interatomic interaction with which is a mean field in the frame of the mean field theory and related to the bulk S wave scatter lens between atoms. So the form of the 3D interaction is like this and And so we can just change the shape of the trap by using different ratio of frequency in different directions, so which it is easier to get a 2D form of the GP equation and as well as one D form equation. So experimentally is a very good character, which means by Character, which means by changing the magneto-optical trap, the shape of the geometry of the trap, so you can get 3D, 2D, any shape, any geometry you like. So which makes the boss and syncation a very good platform to study excitations such as vertices. So because the nature of the silver fluid of the silver fluidity of the bosons currencies, so there is a phase, if there is a phase singularity in the phase space, so you can get the phase difference around the singularity point. The singularity point is from zero to two pi. So this is a point vortex, there is a vortex core here. 2D, for 3D, this is schematic view of the velocity field, which is the vertex line here, and is the velocity field around the vertex line. So now we enter the vertices into the bosons condenses. Sense currencies. So in 2D, so I mentioned it's just a vertex core here, that's two-dimensional vertex. Experimentally, you can achieve that, you can guess the vertex excitations by many methods, such as you use a laser beam to just disturb the BEC, and then you can get a vertex, such as you use a spoon. Vortex, such as you use a spoon to stir the coffee, you get a classical vertex. And also, you can just rotate the system and you can get different vertex lattices. So, except for a single vertex, the vertex staples are very important. In experiments, and so this is the dipole system achieved in experiment. So that means you have a vertex and anti-vortex, which makes a pair. So this is a trajectory of the system. See, they just for a single vertex, it will move around. Will move around the equipotential line of system. And for a dipole system, they will go the semi-circle movement around system. This is two regimes. One regime is a semicircle, and another one they just pair up with a straight movement. So, there are many experiments talking about the vertex staples because you can just put it located in different places in the system and then the dynamics will be completely different. So, theoretically, you can get some equation of the motion, and then you can. Motion and then you can get some equilibrium point, and you can just describe the vertex point just symmetry located in the system, and you get different moments. And if you just put it away from the center, and you get some complexity. Complexity movement as well. And if they are far away from each other, they just move as individual vortex. Okay, so the vertex pair can also excite it by the decay of dark solitons. Dark solitone is another topological defect in both sense. Uh, defects in both sense condenses. That means if you get two condenses and you get different phase relative phase between them, yeah, it's from there is a phase jump from zero to pi. So there will be a dark solitone excited in the system, but the dark soliton in 2D is not stable, so it will decay. Decay through the snake instability and because of the conservation of the topology, and so there will be vortex pairs excited in the system. And we found that the vortex The vortex excitations in this kind of system is very sensitive to the initial phase difference in the interaction dominating regime. That means that if the relative phase between the two parts of the condenses just divided by the dark soliton, When the relative field is larger than 2Ï€, there will be a vertex pair in the combined condensed system. And we also found that the vertex excitations deprives the density modulation of the system. So, after the So, after the vortex dipole, so we can just thinking about some more complex system, such as the vortex quadrupole. There are four vortices, the places placed in the system, and there are three dynamical regimes will happen. This is the recombination. Means the quarter circle of the system. Originally, we can see through the face diagram, these two are paired, these two are paired. But once they might in the middle and go through that direction, so these two, these two will pair and these two will pair. And these two will pair, yeah. Uh, so for the exchange uh regime, so the vertex will meet at the center of the current seat and there is a disappear and a revival process. Yeah, so they will combine with each other because of the interaction between the vertices. So So there will be a soliton, a soliton excited, and then the soliton will decay into vertex pair again. So that's a revival of the vertex pair. And also in the annihilation regime, so the four vortices will decay into sound waves and will never come back again. And this topic. And this topological excitation, the structure is very robust. And after we just add the quantum fluctuations into the system, the trajectory will last for a long time. And this is the parameter regimes with dirt X and Dirt Y, which means. X and dirt Y, which means the locations of the vertices in the system. So you can see that the recombination and exchange, the annihilation area is a very narrow parameter space. So now we are talking about some useful Some use of the vertices in atomronics. So, for atomtronics, it means the manipulating atoms through macro circles generated by macromagnetic field or laser field. Yeah, and different from the electrical. From the electrical circuit. So the carrier in this system is neutral atoms, which makes some advantages in some cases. So this is a classical electrical circuit, which we have a power supply by battery and we have a By battery, and we have a PN junction here, and so the carrier is electrons. So, for the atomtronics, the system is filled by the code atoms, and there is a structure similar to the PN junction, and the atoms can go through from one. Can go through from one reservoir to another and to just complete some function. And also, this is a photo well take effect caused by the artificial gate field. So you have two wells, two potential wells, and the atoms. This is two reservoirs from left and right. You can just apply. You can just apply some artificial gauge field, and then you can just mix atoms go through from one side to the other. So, this kind of system is a mesoscopic system. The length scale related to the device is usually small or equivalent to the inelastic mean. Inelastic mean-free paths between atoms. So it makes some novel quantum mechanical effects, something like quantum conductance and quantum circulation and so on. So this is two reservoirs with code atoms and connected by a channel. By a channel where there are some defects and which makes And localization of the two-dimensional transport of atoms. And here is a thermoelectric effect of code forming atomic gas. And here is an example of the context conductance in the transport process of the In the transport process of the new two atoms. So we can see that the two parts are connected by a very narrow channel and the conductance will show some beautiful plate steps, which is similar to the quantum Hall effect. So, the basic structure is a superfluid oscillator circuit, which means that atoms will oscillate in the system from one side to another. So, we can just define the number in balance with eta, and this is the number in y. Number in one side minus number in the other side and over the total number of system. There is a critical imbalance is eta C is about 5%, which means above this value, the vortex pass will be created in the system. Created in the system. So, this system can be modeled by an acoustical model and which is similar to LC circuit. So, in the electrical sense, this is the energy, and this is the omega, that means oscillation frequency. Uh, oscillation frequency. Uh, and this can be mapped into an acoustical model with the relevant factors are the area of the sector of the channel and the volume of the reservoirs, and also the distance between them. Between them. And this U is the velocity of the atoms just travels through the channel. And we can see at below this critical imbalance, so there will be no dissipation of the system, which gives you a perfect oscillation of the system. Of the number of atoms. But if eta increase above the critical value, and the dissipation will appear in the system, and you can see a large drop of the amplitude of the system. So the oscillation character of the The oscillation character of the superfluid circuit depends on the length of the channel and the width of the channel is shown here. And so which means with the increasing length of L, there will be more vortices excited, which means the decrease of the Decrease of the frequency and for increasing width of the system, that means less vertices are excited, and so the frequency will increase. So, how about the relation with dissipation? With dissipation. Yeah, so we designed a system that's similar to the experiments. And we have a left reservoir and right reservoir, which this is trapping potential of the system, which there is a potential step between these two initial potential steps between these two. Step between these two reservoirs. Under the Thomas Fermi approximation, there's a critical value of the potential V, and so which means above this potential, there will be a current go through the system. So we can also define the number imbalance here and And we can just use this 3D form of the frequency to get the 2D form of the frequency. And for small eta, which is a very good causing function. So, here C is a sound wave of the system, and there is a DC, which means the critical width of the channel. Below this width, that's the current, there will be no current in the system. So, the only unknown parameter is delta. Parameter is data. That data, we found that we use a fitting parameter data. So we can get perfect fitting by using this equation. So here we see by using different, by giving different initial number imbalance of the atoms, so we can get the oscillation. So, we can guess the oscillation of the time evolution. So, for this case, we just make a shift to make the starting point zero, so make all the results comparable easily. So, here we can see some drop after the first drop of the data. First job of the number imbalance. That means we found that means the vertex pair excitation occur at this point. So we can say this is an example. And this vertex pairs excited in the system, but if the width is With is very, very narrow, and we can only get the solid excitation. There's no vortex excited. So the oscillation of the system will not affect it by this kind of excitations. So we also. So we also examined that the amplitude of the oscillation and the maximum current of the system. So with different V, that means different eta, which is equivalent. So you find just this system, they have much. Have maximal A and maximum I. And after the vertex excitation, there will be show zigzag form of the line. So we just we can define we can define d as eta zero, which is Zero, this which is the initial number imbalance of the system. This A is a maximum number, and we can see just there is the D is the dissipation of the system is not continuous. Yeah, it turns into the zigzag form again, which means so it's interesting that the this B C D E steps that's just corresponds to the one vertex pair, two vertex pairs, three vertex pair, and more vertex pairs, excitation. Excitation in the system. So the system, we can just use a quantum current regulator to just to model the system, the original system, which gave you the perfect match of this number imbalance evolution. Okay, also another function is persist atomic current. Yeah, so this is very important in atomatronics. So you can just get it by rotating a laser beam in the system to make it rotate and you get a persistent current and also you can. Persistent current, and also you can use the internal state manipulating to get persistent current. And also, physical imprinting is a convenient way to get this current. And also, we want to talk about the decay of a turbulence. You just put vertices randomly in the system, and after the decay of the vertices, After the decay of the vortices, so you can get some persistent current. However, these methods are not too good. Some of them just make the system highly excited. And others, you cannot get the persistent system, persistent system, current, persistent current with a high winding number. Wounding number. So we just designed a system which is a double ring shaped system filled with code atoms. And so we can do some different procedures to see what will happen in the system. Can we guess? Get persistent current in the system. So the trap is like this. It's two, R1, R2, R3, R4. Yeah, there are four. These four parameters just divided the system into the two parts, the inner ring and the outer ring. So in this figure, Figure, we show that the initial single ring-shaped configuration is quenched into a double concentric ring-shaped configuration, suddenly, abruptly. And so you can just after the crunch, that means we make this V0 here turned off. It turned off. Yeah. And so the atoms will go through the barrier, and then you can just get atoms in the outer ring. And during this process, not turned off, just decrease, decrease the barrier between the two rings. And to let the atom go through. Through. So, in this process, you get vertices excited in the system, and finally, we get a very stable system with vortex quadruple in the system because the total vending number should still be zero. The vending number is conserved. So in this system, we cannot get persistent current. And after that, we just tried to fill the two rings with atoms. And we just put 20 initially seeded vertices in the. See the vertices in the inner ridge and to see the evolution of the system. And you can see that in the barrier region, many ghost vertices are excited. You can see through the yellow one, the yellow one. So in this precise, we get 1D number. Wendy number from zero, I mean the microscopic vending number, not the vending number of the vertices itself. So we get some vending number here and after the vertex annihilation. And so, but the vending number is not too high. It's in the for the outer ring, it's The outer ring is only two. And for the inner ring, it's only five. So we got persistent current in both inner and outer ring in this case. And after that, we just try to use the initially seeded vertices plus a quench of the seed. A crunch of the system. And that means we have atoms in the inner ring initially. And then during the crunch, we just add 20 vertices into the inner rim, as what we did before. And so after some evolution, we see that. We see that the change of the winding number in these two rings. So this one is for the inner ring, the Wendy number is three. But for the outer ring, and we can see it's reach about 12 now. 12 now. So we just change the initial vertex number, and we can see that with increasing initial vertex number, the vending number of the auto-grain will increase. So this is the, I mean, the absolute value of the D number. So this is So this is a diagram of the vending number varying with D, which is distance between the two rings. That's the barrier width. And this is V zero. Yeah, the change of V zero. So it can be matched by two Gaussians very well. Uh, very well. So now we turn to the vertices in 3D BZ. So as Junzo just mentioned, so there are quite a lot of research about the vertex line and reconnection and dissipation. So because the vertex line Because the vortex line is a basic topological excitation in 3 dB seas. So we are thinking about how to use these vertex lines to create, to generate more complex structures of vertex excitations. Yeah? So because we Because we just covered that the 2DB is the course of a vortex dipole. We move the semicircle in the system, and they will be very close at the center of the system. And so we think about if the interaction between the vertices. Between the vertices is comparable or is a little bit bigger than the inter-atomic interactions. So then they will decay into solitons or other form of the excitations. So here we just use the vortex tables. You can see this is a phys diagram. Uh, phase diagram in the xy plane, yeah. So that's that's definitely the dipole, yeah. And so, uh, if you just give the proper distance between them at the initial time, yeah, so then they will join together to form vortex rings, yeah, with different geometry. Geometry for proper parameter, they can just form a perfect vertex ring. And this is the trajectory of the two vertex lines in different dynamical regimes. Here, so we can just use this guy. Use this guy to form a more complex structure. We just add a vertex line at the center of this form to see what happened. So for this kind of system, and because the vertex is not perfect, the interaction between the setment of the vertex lines and the vertex runs in different directions are different. So they will. So they will draw in together, and at some points they can just generate eight-shaped vertex line. And also they have some they can just the vertex ribbon can decay and join with the vertex. And join with the vertex vertex line, and the ring will just come into a line. So, and this is a perfect drain with a vertex line, and you can just make a hopes and structure, and the drain just moves along the line. So, for some research, just for Research just for proper chemical potential, this kind of structure can exist stably in the 3D vault. So also we just examined that the dynamics of the vortex ring in the Bosch-shaped condensate and to see the movement of the vortex. Movement of the vortex rim, if the movement of the vortex rim will affect the center of mass oscillation of the system, that's kind of the collective excitation of the system. So we just found that this is equilibrium, equilibrium. Uh, equilibrium uh point, which means that uh equilibrium uh radius of the vertex rim, which means that the amplitude of the center of mass oscillation is zero. Yeah, no oscillation. Yeah, it you can say that A0 is this line, and this is A with respect to the Thomas. With respect to the Thomas-Formy radius of the system and the radians of the vertex ring. It gives you different phi zero, phi pi, as you can see from this picture. And this equilibrium radius is very close to the equi. Equilibrium radius by using approximate by using the Thomas Fermi radius. So in a PRA paper in 2013, they just studied the radius of the gene with respect to the time, the time. A time, the time period of the vortex ring movement. And they just we found that they just cover a small parameter range because this range is this range in our figure, and the equilibrium point will be here. And we know that by adding the caravan wave perturbations, we can just slow down the movement of the vertices in a uniform background flow. So we think about just use the different, we just want to say the different caravan waves that's a planar caravan wave perturbation and the vertical. Wave perturbation and the vertical caravan wave perturbation, and the combination of these two. What's the effects of the caravan wave on the center of mass oscillation of the condensate? Yeah, and we found that the perturbations can surprise the Kerbin wave perturbations, can surprise the center of mass oscillation. Yeah, that means the movement. Yeah, that means the movement of the vertices is slowed down. And we found that the suppression depends strongly on the parity of the wave number of the camera wave perturbation. That means for the odd wave number and for the even wave number, the behavior are completely different. You can see from these figures, and you get These figures, and you get the amplitude with the wave number of the calorie wave, this kind of form. Okay, so more complex structures we know that it's nodes and the links. There are different Links. There are different forms, not with up to eight crossings and links with up to eight crossings. So we think about can we just use this vertex rings as a basic building blocks to create these structures? As just Renzo mentioned, that is impossible in the classical fluids, but it can it. It is possible in the quantum fluids. So there are many research about the decomposition of the vertex north and the vertex links. And here, so the movie is not working. Movie is not working. Here it's just, I think Runzo just use this as well. Yeah. So as a paper written by Carla Bargin, a major challenge facing the experimentalist is that it is easy to create structures which are topological trivial. That means lens. And also and also land or topological very or topological very complicated structures yeah something like this yeah it's used a 3d printed model to create trifoil in water so what is missing is the ability to create relative simple non-tributable Simple non-trivial topologies in a reproducible way. So that's what we want to do in BECs. So it can be achieved in optical vertex nodes as well. And we use a vortex ring, which is attached by Kerala wave perturbations. The wave function of the system is like. Of the system is like this. So we can just adjust the amplitude of the perturbation and the wave number of the perturbation in different directions. So here we can see just with one run with carbon perturbation, the system will undergo a leapfrog. Leapfrog movement. Yeah. And this is there should be a reference here. This is Peanut's paper in 2014, if I don't remember wrong. And so this is a two-run interaction in air. Yeah. So we just use just two rings with opposite. The opposite topological charge, which means they can move forward with each other. And so all of them are disturbed by the caravan wave perturbation. And so there will be a distance between these two rings. And the original radius of the ring is denoted by R. Is denoted by R0 before the deformation. And also, the important parameter is the angle between the two lengths you just put. And we can see that by using this kind of method, we can just create a trifle vortex naught with odd Kervin wave numbers. With odd Kelvin wave numbers. And we can also produce links. This is L4E1, Solomon Vortex link created by using this method. So interestingly, that's the old Kerbin wave number always produce notes, and even Kerbin wave number always produces links. It's a very good character. So, by using this method, basically, we can just produce the notes and links up to K9. And these are the final results. This is ideal vertex ruling links. And so, this is the time. So, this is the time evolution of the system, not only in the so we just tried different systems, not only in the harmonically trapped system, but also in the uniform background system. So it works very well. And I think Runzo just showed a movie that they can do this as well. Can do this as well. So, in this produce, in this process, there are many relevant parameters. This is number of the carbon wave, the wave number of the carbon wave perturbation, and the alpha is the angle between the two rings. And also, if we keep the radius of one ring. The radius of one ring fixed and just adjust as a ratio between the two lens. So that's R2 radius of another ring. And also Bxy is amplitude of the planar Kervan wave perturbation. And Bz is the vertical Kervan wave perturbation. I mean, perturbation amplitude of it. And also the minimal distance between them, the minimal distance between these two rings. So we just check all this parameter space and to see how long will the not all links, not all links will survive during the dynamical process. Yeah, so to get Yeah, so to get some optimal parameter space, and which we think could be useful for experimentalists to do the experiments. Even it's still hot. It's still hot, as Renzo mentioned, but probably we can shed a little light to the experiments. The experiments. So, in this process, the diverse topological transitions occur. And the units links, units links not. So, we find many topological transition form. And that's all. That's all of my talk.
