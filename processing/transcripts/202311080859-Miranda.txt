Please. The stage is yours. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me to speak here. And I'm going to talk about some new results we have. I have to thank Daniel Beraldasalas who put me in these uncharted waters. So we have been in the last years collaborating together. I am a geometer and have been learning a lot from him. This is where we got some. And this is where we got so far. So I'll finish with some open questions. And what is this bridge between geometry and fluid dynamics? Well, we have been seeing these equations quite a lot these days. We have classical Euler equations, and yesterday we looked at these equations from different points of view also in the talk of Antonio. And remember that the classical Euler equations where we don't say Euler equations where we don't say anything about a metric, but there is a metric which is Euclidean metric, can be understood from a Riemannian perspective. And then this expression here is just the derivative with respect to the Levitica connection, which is compatible with respect to the memory. So to have a solution to the earlier equations is to have a solution of these two equations. One of them is that the divergence of the vector field is zero. Of the vector field is zero from a geometrical point of view. Well, this corresponds to incompressibility. From a geometrical point of view, is preservation of both. So we have easy these equations, and as geometers, we're going to start with the easiest possible case, right? Which is in the case in which we don't have these terms. So what are these equations? If we don't have, these are stationary or steady Euler equations, which would lead equations up. Which would be the equations up there. And these equations we can understand them geometrically in the following way. We take, we consider a one form, alpha, which is defined just by duality from the vector field x. So alpha is just the contraction of the vector field x of the metric. And with this notation, we can understand We can understand does this stuff? Yes. Great. So, from this equation here, it can be translated to this equation. I will try to convince you in a couple of slides why this is true. And the condition of the divergence x equal to 0, we saw yesterday different recarnations in the talk of Anton, and they could be understood also in these terms. So we can understand steady stationary flows from a geometrical perspective at some Geometrical perspective as some forms being closed or some forms being exact. First equation would be the condition that alpha is this one form, the differential of alpha is a two form. When we contract with x, this is a one form again. And this is the condition that this one form is exact. And the function that makes this exact is the Bernoulli function, which is also linked to the metric because here we are using the norm of the vector field. The second equation, which is the The second equation, which is the divergence of x equal to zero, now becomes the some condition, mu is the volume form. If we are in the three-dimensional case, then the contraction, this is going to be a two-form, and that this is that this form is closed. So in a way, we can translate stationary Euler equations into some geometric form, the language of form, some forming exactly on the close. As a big class of examples of solutions to these stationary Euler flows are Voltronic fields. These are vector fields which are proportional to each curve and whose divergence is zero. And among the famous examples, we have the Hop fields that we saw yesterday and the ABC flows for Arnold, Beltrami, and Chalvers. So these ABC flows have been used quite a lot in KF. Flows have been used quite a lot in KM theory. So these are two classical examples of the drama flows. Now, what I want to do is to bridge these solutions really to geometry. Somehow I have started to play this game here by talking in terms of forms, but I have to be more serious about it. So this is why I put a cut. I have to be more serious about it. So if we talk about the geometry of forms, one, there is a famous old world. Is a famous whole world out there, which is that of syntactic geometry, which is linked to two forms. But today I'll talk about a need to consider just contact forms. And contact forms, we could think, is the all-dimensional analog. And indeed, I can consider it in general, but it's good for today if we fix it in dimensional tree. So in dimensional three, what is a contact structure? A contact structure is given by a form output. Structure is given by a form alpha, and I put it below because this is going to be a contact structure, spoiler, such that alpha is a one-form, the differential of alpha is a two-form, this guy is a three-form, okay, and the condition is that this three-form is a volume form. This condition, how should we understand it? In a way, we should understand it somehow opposite to this condition, which would be the Fafian expression of Expression of integrability of the kernel of our one. So, in a way, contact structures represent the opposite to integrability of the kernel of this one. There are many things I could say about contact forks, but I just say one, which is the definition of a red vector field. Red vector field is once we have this definition of contact structures, which in higher dimensions, Which in higher dimensions we just replace in order to have a top form. The volume form is going to be alpha, T alpha and a volume form. Okay, what is a red vector field? It's given by two equations. First one, the differential of alpha is going to have, from that definition, a one-dimensional kernel. And this is going to be in the This is going to be in the direction of the red vector field. But this gives me a whole direction of vector fields. And I want to pick one. The way would be to take a norm, but I'm just going to use alpha. So I define alpha of r equal 1. And there is a unique solution to these two equations, and that's the red. So what I'm going to do first. What I'm going to do first is to relate a red vector field to beltramic fields. That's going to be the first bridge. So, a particular class of solutions to the stationary Euler equation, which are Veltrami fields, we're going to be able to associate to each Veltrami field a repector. How are we going to do it? Who did this? Indeed, well, here I have, well, I wanted to show some nice pictures because I wanted to show some nice pictures because we are all waking up, right? At different places. So, well, this is a nice picture. Most of the pictures I use on my mid-journey. I'm a big fan. But this picture is really done by Helen Mee, who is Robert Grice, who gave it for free. So you can use it in your talk. So here we are. So this would be the kernel of alpha, where alpha is the standard contact form on dimension 3. Dimension 3. So, how do we see this non-interability? Interrability would be the dimension 3. Alpha is a one-form. The kernel of alpha, the interability of this kernel would be the existence of a surface such that for each point, the tangent to the surface coincides with the distribution at the point. So, this is contrary to, indeed, in this picture, you see that these planes start to go in all possible directions. So, if you try to read So, if you try to really draw a surface that is tangent to all the planes, it's going to be impossible. This is not incredible. And this is thanks to the fact that alpha x d alpha is a volume form. Here you have, well, two ways to look at it. One way is very simple, to compute this, you get the volume form. And another way to look at non-interrability is you compute the kernel of alpha, you have these two vector fields, then you want to know if this distribution is integrable, so the test is that you So the test is that you compute the Lie bracket, okay? And then just say what is the Lie bracket of these two vector fields. You said Fontana, Magnano. It is exactly. Quick. It's partial of Z. Yeah. Therefore, you cannot express it as a combination of these two, and this means that it's not. Well done. Okay. We should practice this before. We should practice this before the talks. At least tell me in the test. What? Or at least tell me in the fastest time. Exactly. We are all waking up. It's okay. Okay, so that's the classical example. And there is a theorem that tells you that locally any contact form is going to look like this. So it's not only one example, it's the example, if we think in local terms. Okay, since we are waking up, why is contact geometry useful? Why is contact geometry useful? Well, it's useful to park a car. So, indeed, if you think about parallel parking, this is also a science fiction, right? That you would like to do it. Theory tells you you can do it four steps. Reality tells you it takes you a bit longer. But there is a theorem in contact geometry proved by Emmy Murphy, which says that you can always parallel park a car of length L in any space. In any space of L plus epsilon. We know what happens when summer goes to zero. And well, indeed, how do you prove it? There is a context of structure behind this problem and voila. So that's something, that's a take-home exercise, right? You can really, you have applications in into control theory, etc. But I'm not here to talk about this, but we are waking up. That's good. Examples. Give me some examples of red. Give me some examples of red vector fields. One example: well, I'm going to take S3. I'm going to look at S3 in a very sophisticated way inside C2. And I'm going to take alpha, this form there. And if you compute with respect to this alpha, the red vector field, you get this expression here. But you can also look at S3 in a different coordinate. Indeed, if you're a friend of Daniel, you learn. Daniel, you learned that everyone should know that there are something called hot coordinates. And in half coordinates, okay, you can represent any element of S3 in this adaptive coordinates. And then what we saw before as hot field is indeed this expression here. So this is the same vector field with two different presentations, but it's the same vector field. One vector field. vector field. One vector field is the hot feel on the half in the half vibration. I had a very nice animation of this, but I don't want to play with Mac and animations inside a PDF. It was too difficult. You can look at it. Johnson has on his webpage nice animations of how can you visualize the three sphere as the hot vibration. So these are two presentations of the same object. Same object is the hot vibration. The same object. Same object is the hot field, at the same time is the Veltrami field. Well, this has constant coefficients. From this, we can see very easily that it's a Veltrami field. And the same vector field in different coordinates, we can look at it as a repertofield. So, would it be true that any electronic field is a repectrophil? Why would this be interesting? Because maybe we know more about repeptrophy. Know more about red vector fields than below vector fields, or depending, we can try to export techniques from one realm, the realm of contact geometry, to that of fluid dynamics or the other way around. So let's ask the experts. The experts look in the same direction and move their hands. Indeed, all these geometrical structures behind Fluid started with Arnold, but indeed Suleiman himself has a collection of talks where he Of talks, where he, in a way, suggested that this was going to happen, that beltramic fields can be seen as regimental fields. But who proved this was Edna and Greist. So Edna and Greist, they observed from these equations we have up here, which are the forms equations of stationary solutions, they prove that indeed this one form, alpha, here, is a contact form. Okay? I need to have some slides to prove this. I don't know why I put into slides. It's impossible. I have 30 indices. So I cannot make proofs, but the proofs are there, and the slides will be somewhere. So you can look at the proofs afterwards. So that's what they prove. They prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence. But the one-to-one correspondence is not exactly that the right vector field is going to be the Voltram electrophil. This happens in the case, but in general, you may need to reparameterize the vector field. The vectors. So, up to reparametrization, they are the same. And well, then you can do things with this. First, you can extend it to higher dimensions. This works well in higher dimensions. And it works well with singular contact structures, which can be useful. But it's okay. Let's stick to the three-dimensional case. Which applications, well, by the way, this, well, we have an image here. What is this image? Image. Who knows what is this Lake Louise? Ah, Lake Louise, you think. Is it true that this is Lake Louise? We will check this afternoon. What do you think, Peter? Peter is right. If you look, you can see when you check it that this is not exactly Lake Louis. But, well, I chose this one because it's in the area, but also because we have here like a clear mirror, right? We have a perfect reflection of the mountains on the left. Reflection of the mountains on the lake, and this is a little bit what this correspondence between REP and Beltrami does for you. You have a kind of you reflect whatever happens on what's the connection with the mountains and the red vector fields. Contact geometry has been a long time the language of senester mechanics. So, in a way, we have a nice reflection from contact geometry to fluid dynamics in a way. And that's the picture. And that's the theorem I. Picture. And that's the theorem I wrice. So, any non-vanishing, well, you need some conditions. You need the vector field, the rotomic field to be non-vanishing, and you need to have a positive proportionality factor. If the proportionality factor is zero, we are going to get to those in a second. And in this case, what you can prove is that the Voltramic field is total parametrization of a red flow. And conversely, any red flow. What can you do with this theorem? Flow. What can you do with this theorem? First, it's a beautiful theorem. It's nice. It's cool. But, okay, you may object to it because there is some dependence, strong dependence on the metric, right? When you move the metric, you move the contact form, and when you move the contact form, you move the metric. But people in contact geometry are experts in moving these contact forms and in parking cars. So let's see, what can we do with that? So, well, here there are some clues. That's a very good question. Indeed, a priori, it could be anything. And do you have examples of tight and over-twisted? I can give you examples of tight and over-twisted for this. Indeed, I can take a sphere, the example is tight, and then I can do this game that people call a geometry pool all the time, which is they put an overt disk, and then good luck with the computations. But then you know that it's... But then you know that it's, you can add an overt discounted format. So, well, I mean, there are the proofs here. I mean, you can prove it. Nice, good. You can prove it in coordinates, or you can use an almost complex structure to make a more elegant proof. And that's the proof we did to extend it to higher dimensions. But I'm going to skip proofs, okay? Giuseppe is here, so I have to show something we did with Giuseppe. Something we did with Joseph is to extend indeed this mirror is equivalent. So if you have symmetries on one side, the symmetries also go to the other side. So that's something we did together with Joseph. Now you have to be awake because another question will come up at some point. Okay. So somehow we have a mirror. What can you do with this mirror? You can do things. For instance, if you know that red vector field has periodic orbits, there is a conjecture. Has period recordings. There is a conjecture that has been proved in dimensional 3 2006 by TOPS, which tells you that any revector field at least has a periodic world. The status of this Weinstein conjecture has been evolving with time and now the conjecture has become like two or infinite number of periodic curbs. But indeed, Enner and Reist already observed that in the case of a Swiss sphere, Enner and Reist proved this in 2000. So the Leinstein conjecture in dimensional three was still. So, the Leinstein conjecture in dimensional three was still not proved, but it was known for S3, and the proof was by Hoffer. So, indeed, Edna and Rice, what they did is to export, in the case of S3, okay, the existence of periodic orbits to the existence of periodic orbits for Voltram fields. That's pretty cool. So, now we know that this Voltronic field, at least, is going to have one periodic orbit and two or infinity, and depending if it's tight or over-twisted, then we know that it should be infinity. That it should be infinite. So it's an interesting result that you can export. One thing that people in contact geometry used to do is to deform the contact structure. And they do it using the H principle. So that's one game we played a while ago with Danielle when we started to play these games, was to deform this H apply the H principle to alpha and this allowed us to prove a theorem which uh a kind of Rebenberry theorem. A kind of Reben-Bering theorem, okay, which indeed, at the end of the day, we could prove that any dynamical system we can embed it as a solution as a belt dramatic field just by the price of increasing the dimension of the manifold. And this increasing the dimension of the manifold used some tricks of the H-bridge. That's something we did with Robert Cardorna, Daniel Terata Salas, and Fran Presas. And Francresas, and was very recently published, you know, pandemics, five years. But it's okay, it stands. With this game, one thing we did was, for instance, you can apply some, you consider some IR-preserving diffeomorphies of the disk, and using a red suspension, we could construct some universal three-dimensional Turing machine. And that was something we did after. Something we did after the universality result, which was published before quite quickly. And this is our result with Robert, again, Daniela, and Fran. So you can indeed, that was like an interesting consequence of this association of a Turing machine, which is universal, to your fluids, is, because of the halting problem, is an undecidable problem, is the existence of undecidable paths. Existence of undecidable paths. This was an interesting consequence for fluid dynamics. So, these are some applications that you have of this mirror. Other applications more into this idea of celestial mechanics is that the existence of escape orbits, that we may look at these escape orbits in celestial mechanics. Well, escape orbits that are already close to infinity, what is infinity? What we do is that we come. Infinity, what we do is that we compactify this infinity at the price of adding a singularity to the contact structure. So we can detect escape or it's a singular point of some. So it's not, this red vector field, of course, from this definition is not going to have any critical point. But if we extend all the machinery to include singular forms, then it can happen that it has singular points. And this singular point. Singular points. And these singular points, counting the singular points, is equivalent to counting skatefords. So with some basic Morse theory, we could count and we could give bounds on the number of skatefords. So we had a kind of result of 2 or infinity in the same diagnostics. And, okay, did you have some applications of the mirror from the other side? Yeah, that's some open sound we did with Daniel. We could apply some results of full MBEC about genericity. About genericity properties of eigenvalues of Laplacian, indeed to prove the existence of scale coordinates. There is a difference between here and here, which is a condition on non-degeneracy, which we don't need to assume for the second. So we have some applications of this mirror. I have another question. Yeah. What is the magic mirror doing with global surface of sections? Ah, that's a good question. I didn't think about this. But that's That's interesting because, of course, well, I mean, you can apply theoretically the results to the mirror without thinking, but it would be interesting to see this. I don't know. I have to think about this. Good question. Okay. So we were here and you know, contact, blah, blah, blah, blah. Can we do something else? I have five minutes, oh my god. Okay, so from a geometrical So from a geometrical, there's a lot of words in this, but from a geometrical perspective, if I could collect all the contact forms in a box, this box, you can see it, right? This is a three-dimensional perfect box, it's pink. And I have all the contact structures inside. What happens on the boundary of this box? So what happens is that I'm going to lose this condition here, and the degeneration is going to give me integrability. Generation is going to give me integrability. So, in a way, now I want to look at the case in which we do have interability. And this would be the case in which alpha, let's say alpha, is zero. And in dimension three, indeed, when we have, well, if we are in dimension three, okay, just in dimension three, this gives me a for each of my surface. This gives me a polition by surfaces that, if everything is orientable, we know it's symplectic. So we have, indeed, the object we have in front of us would be cosymplectic structure. So indeed, if we just forget about the syntactic structure, now imagine that we have the condition that the alpha equals zero. You can always find an equivalent alpha, just that the alpha equals zero. So you have a syntactic Fourier given by a two. Symplectic foulation given by a closed form, how does it look like? Well, Tiglar theorem tells us that it's a vibration over S1. What happens if now I consider some symplectic form on the leaves? Indeed, this vibration is a syntlectic vibration, and you have a Poisson structure in use on this. And indeed, this, what is the manifold itself? Because you have a codimensional one volume, and you get overexcited, but it's And you get overexcited, but it's just a vibration. And indeed, in the symplectic case, you can prove that what you have, if your manifold is compact and one of the leaves is compact, what you have is a symplectic mapping torus. And you prove that this is a symplectic mapping torus just by taking this orthogonal field, which is like the red vector field. It's often called the red vector field. If I look at these objects from the perspective of the vector, If I look at these objects from the perspective of contact geometry in the limit, I would talk about red vector field. But indeed, if I think of this as a pausal manifold, then this is a modular vector field. And then I take the flow of this modular vector field and look, this is going to be back to the same leaf, but maybe not to the same point. So we have indeed a machine torus, a segregated machine torus. That's the condition. So now I have this geometrical object, which is a three. I have this geometrical object, which is a three-dimensional object on the boundary of a three-dimensional contact manifold. And I want to understand if there is some interpretation of this geometrical object, if there is some mirror for this geometrical object. So I start to think, indeed, the definition of cosymplectic structure, which I have just introduced in a three-dimensional case very easily, in higher dimensions it works very well, is given by a It works very well, is given by a pair of closed forms. One is a one-form alpha, and beta is a two-form, okay, such that the differential of alpha and the differential of beta is zero, and such that alpha wedge beta n minus one is indeed a volume form. In dimension three, the condition is alpha wedge beta is a volume form. So this is indeed really on the boundary of the contact condition. Boundary of the contact condition. And as I said, the geometrical interpretation is this one form gives me a symplectic variation, and the symplectic structure is given by the form. Okay, indeed, in one of the videos of Suleiman, and I trust, where is... Oh, you're here. I didn't, I was looking yesterday night until midnight. Midnight. The exact sentence in which Suleiman says that harmonic vector fields are a particular solution, and I didn't find it, but I trust you will tell me which video it is. Okay, so according to Paco, this was already proved by Sullivan. So if you have, well, here it's not only a closed form with respect to alpha, but it's an harmonic form. So I need this form to be closed with the differential of alpha and also with respect to the Hodge. With respect to the Hodge. So if I put the differential and I combine it with the Hodge operator, I have the two conditions. So I have, I take an harmonic one form. Oh, no, that's a good problem. So I need the differential of alpha zero and the differential of alpha zero. From this condition, indeed, we can look at Condition indeed, if you look at the equations that I show, you can see that the first equation is satisfied. And with the second one, combining it, you can check the two equations that are satisfied. So harmonic forms give me a particular solution to the other equations. And now the question is, can we relate these harmonic forms with these cosympletic structures? In dimension three, that's the the connection. And in higher dimension, indeed, I mean, higher dimension indeed. We need to generalize the definition of cosymplectic. I'm not very happy with the quasi-almost weak vibes, but I had to make a choice. Almost cosymplectic was already taken. Quasi-cosymplectic, I don't like it. So it's weak co-symplectic. So a weak cosympletic structure is given by a pair in which now, instead of taking, in the cosympletic case, I take a two-form, here I already Two form. Here I already take my manifold is all dimensional, so I take a form of degree 2n that is not necessarily beta n. It could be, that's the... I would be tempted to call this almost, but it was already taken. And the condition that we require is that these two forms are closed and that their wedge is a bulk. So, oh my god. Yeah, 30 minutes. Okay. 30 minutes. Okay, just to finish. Peta to the power n above. Peta, so why did I make an error? You're absolutely right. What a disaster. You're right. I mean, no, great. You are awake. Great. Okay, okay. Thank you. Yeah, it's better with this notation because we need a top form. Thank you very much. Okay, good, great. So, just to finish. So, just to finish, that's the theorem we proved. Indeed, when I advertised this talk, I talked about joint work with Angelo Janes Pietro, Angel Peralta Salas, and my 30-mirror. But indeed, Soren, where is Sorin? He's not here. Ah, you're here. Okay, Soren is here. I thought Soren is here. So, Soren now joined the team. So, I have to say, this is also joint work with Soren. And we proved that there is a one-to-one course. And we proved that there is a one-to-one correspondence between pairs of harmonic vector fields, which are dual to harmonic forms, okay, and weak cosmic vector structures. And you're going to say, I don't believe your proof. But the proof fits in one slide. And you're going to look at it. After all, what can you do with this? Ooh. Well, one thing is that you can construct neutrally complete Euler flows. OLR flows. And you can associate to these harmonic vector fields also Turing machines that are incomplete. So you also get the invisibility associated to them. One thing you can try to do is to look at the conjectures that are open out there. So there is the term Hamilton conjecture about existence of metric minimizing the energy functional. And indeed, this is something that we have already proved that in the cossimplectic case, in dimension. That in the cossimplectic case, in dimension three, there exists a compatible metric for which the revector field is killing. So, in particular, the killing case is a particular case of minimizing, so there exists minimizing metrics. Is this true in general? Indeed, for the contact case, it was believed to be true, but there is already conterexamples that are not in, and you're going to be in the archive soon, soon, the next week or. Soon, the next week or soon, and to this term Hamilton conjectures. So, this is a counter-example by Mitsu Matsu, Daniel Peralta-Salas, and Slovak. So, in the contact case, they gave this counter-example and they characterize in terms of tightness, you are going to like this, when you have this rule misinformation. I know, yeah, sorry, this this is untimely. Sorry, this is not typo, but this G, so you have a volume and then you integrate this. Okay. Yeah. So, of course, this is something we are working on. I mean, we are all of us working on. So far, we know there is this mirror, and we are trying to look at applications of the mirror. So, all the applications we did formally, all periodic coverage, blah, blah, are going to go through. And we are looking for new applications. And one was addressing this sort of Hamilton conjecture. Projector. And then, what else can we do? And with this, I have to finish, and that's my last slide. Do we have new mirrors for new structures? So is there something between contact and cosymplectic? And the answer is yes. It's a configuration case in which we admit that, for instance, in dimension 3, that we have a one form such that this is equal or equal to zero or Equal to zero or a volume form. And the conflagration theory, it's a very sophisticated theory, but we still don't know how to make the mirror work. One way would be to try to use approximations by contact forms, but these approximations applied by Eliasberg are not good enough because they are C0. So this is some new mirrors that we are trying to work on. So can we extend on So can we extend all this theory to find other sorts of solutions of this equation or some other equations? Some PDEs. Okay. So that's the end. Thank you very much for your talk. Are there some questions, comments? Or other questions and comments? So in your original like early on in the slides you were talking about beltronic fields with a function that's the multiplier for the curl. Yeah. But I think in your examples it's mostly some. Constant. Yeah, indeed, yeah, yeah. That's what we call, they call a strong beltrami equation. Yeah, you are right. It's mostly the examples I have is constant. And indeed if it's not constant then you can somehow If it's not constant, then you can somehow, if this function is positive, you can eat it. Indeed, what do you mean? You can eat it, you can absorb it in the compact form. So it still works. In the original statement of N-analyzed, f could be any function, which is possible. But it's true that actually we work with a strong beltrami, and if it's not a strong bald drama, then you can absorb this function in the. There is again here all the proofs that are hidden in the slides, which is good because we can. In the slides, which is good because we have the first proofs. Then you can somehow absorb the function, you can divide by adapting the metric somehow. So you can absorb this term. It's not a big deal. So the general result that takes you from read fields. Is in general. So that's for any function. Yeah. But which doesn't vanish. It's very important that it doesn't vanish and that it's positive. Sorry? I was wondering, so this theorem about harmonic fields and we have finite dimensional space of harmonic fields, but the metrics form apparently in dimensional space. That's why you have kind of in the dimensional space on the... Is that how it works? Yeah, well the thing is that you are pointing in the right direction, right? The term Hamilton conjecture was indeed trying to make some sense of which metric. To make some sense of which metric, compatible metric to choose. You have many compatible metrics, and the question is: which one makes sense to choose? And then in the paper of Cheryl Hamilton, they suggested that, oh my god, where are you wearing them? That this should be the one that minimizes the energy functional. And then they said that this minimal metric always exists. Their paper is in the context, not in the cost-effective one. And so what Daniel did is to find out that it's one. In our case, in dimension three, it's very easy to see that the cosmic medique somehow this is easier to handle and we could find that the answer that the connector calls. I was wondering about the former slide. Yeah. So dimension three, by the way, this weak thing in dimension three uh is the same, so it's cross-symphlectic. In higher dimensions you need this weak one. In higher dimensions, you need this quick one. And yeah, you are absolutely right. You have the set of harmonic forms is given by H1, and then the thing is that you have. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In this game, it's very important, thank you very much, that the correspondence, and sometimes when I state it, I forget, because I'm very obsessed by the vector field, but the correspondence goes with the metric. Okay? That's very important, as in the content case, I think. That's fundamental. Thanks for giving up. Are there other questions? For Calabia, how many folks? There are mirror many forex, but I guess this is a completely different mirror. No, that's a very good question. Indeed, we got this question also from Jan Ke, and we didn't think about this. Because of course, when you have, I mean, these are odd-dimensional objects. So, to feed the canaminia, this you can play by replacing this foliation, you put a structure. And indeed, this. The structure. And indeed, this is how we proved that in dimension 3 this works as well. Because in dimension 2, we can put a compatible, almost complex structure, I mean it's complex abstraction. So we have Calabar in our side, and this is how we put it in dimension 3. So this Calabi Dao could be good for us when we explore the higher dimensions, and we put this abstraction on the leaves. Maybe you add another dimension to the Calabi-Au and the dimension. To get all in there. Yeah, exactly. So, we need somehow to make some sense of this. So, thanks for this question. We are, you know, we are looking at this kind of things. Also, the almost contact condition also makes some sense here, and we are working on this different recarnation, geometrical recarnation, see what you get. So, it's quite exciting. No? Sorry. So, was Calabillao in our list? Not yet. It was, because you were not there. It was because you were not there. Yeah, it told us. But put it on the list, on the notes. Okay. Are there other questions or comments? Let's say we can speak again. I want to say hi to Isaac, who's there. And who will be working on the Calabila maybe?
