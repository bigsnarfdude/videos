Thank you very much, Maya, and all the organizers for inviting me. I'm very happy to have this opportunity and I'm also happy and thankful that they organized this meeting because I know that it's very hard to a lot of work going into organizing something like this. So as the title suggests, I'm going to talk to you about a result in Landau damping. This is a joint work with Richard Hilbert. We live at the moment in Paris. And since I guess not everybody here in the audience works on Lambda damping, I'm starting with a short introduction on Lambda damping on the full space. So it's a little bit different from this classical Vilani Mo result. And I'll give you a little bit of motivation why this is an interesting question, what are the challenges, and so on and so forth, and give you a state-of-the-art. Give you a state-of-the-art of what is known in that case. And then I'll tell you about the Landau damping or the Vlassov Poisson system in interaction with a point charge, again, why this is model interesting and what are the challenges. And then at the end, I will present the result that Eichard and I obtained this year. So let me start with the Basid equation. So it's So it's a non-linear transport type equation for the density of a plasma. And we consider it as an initial value problem. And typically, so we are going to be interested in the case where X and V are in R D, so on the full space. And the Landodampic setting for this is that you're close to a For this, is that you're close to a spatially homogeneous state. So there's some spatially homogeneous state μ, which is a priori known, and you have a small perturbation of that. And this force field E is simply given by the convolution of the gradient of the interaction potential with the density of F. And I think in this audience, I don't need to introduce what the density. In this audience, that I want to introduce what the density here is. Okay, and so in this case, we will consider the case where phi, the interaction potential, is the screen Coulomb potential. So it has the Coulomb singularity at the origin, but at infinity it's cut off. And this is sort of an effective description of a plasma. Effective description of a plasma at an intermediate scale, the sort of Debye length, where it takes into account the Debye screen. So, this model here is an effective theory or an effective description on the Debye length. So it's a screening effect. And this Debye length, so the unit length of our equation here. Of our equation here is much smaller than what we would observe in a laboratory. So this is and this is the motivation why it also makes sense to consider a spatially homogeneous state, right? So a spatially homogeneous state has infinite mass and infinite energy. And you could ask, okay, why shouldn't it be cut off somewhere? But since this unit length that we're considering is sort of minuscule to what we're Minuscule to what we observe in the laboratory, it makes sense to consider the infinitely extended space. Okay, and this problem has been considered in a sequence of recent papers. One is by Vedro Sian, Masumudi, and Tumo. That was in 2018 and another. And another paper obtaining a similar result by Hank Wan, Nguyen and Wu Si. I think the paper was published in 2021. And recently this problem has been revisited for the Coulomb potential, not the screen Coulomb potential, under some stricter assumptions on mu by Josa Ber Joshua Bayer and Nidmeyer. And since I'm going to later discuss the screen Coulomb case, I'll mostly stick to these two results. And let's start with paraphrasing a little bit their results. So I'm going to call that a theorem with an asterisk. It's sort of a sketch of a theorem. It's not complete. Of the theorem. It's not completely precise as written. So if μ is a Penrose stable initial datum, so that means essentially that the linearized equation has some stability property. There exists a regularity coefficient s bigger than zero. Coefficient s bigger than zero and an epsilon zero bigger than zero, such that if this initial perturbation of our state is small enough and small enough in some W11 plus some weighted HS norm, then there exists a global strong solution. And they can control the following quantity. So if we define the functional n of t as the L1 norm of rho of H, so let me actually say, so this global solution F, we also decompose as a sum of our initial state, of our homogeneous state and a perturbation. Of our homogeneous state and a perturbation. Okay, and then the result is that we can control the density of this part of the function. And we can control it in the following way. So we have linear, we have conservation of the L1 norm of the perturbation, linear time decay for the L1 norm of the gradient, so this gradient in X. The gradient, so this gradient in x. And the L infinity norms are much better. So there we have a power d gain in time for the density of f and even more d plus 1 for the gradient of f in L infinity. So this is sort of bounded by a constant globally in time. Excuse me? Yeah. Now you have all. Now you have rho sub f and there you have some rho f bracket. Is it like you integrate out this velocity? That's it? Yeah, exactly. So rho of any function g is just integral of g x v dv. And when I write rho of f I apply it to the solution and rho of little f I write also as rho f and that's just sort of this, the density of this part. So I mean we know So, I mean, we know that the system will still have infinite mass and infinite energy, it's just the perturbation of the spatially homogeneous state will decay. And it will decay in this sort of algebraic way. Yeah, I have another question. The W11 space, it's relatively to X and V, and all the functional spaces are in X and V, right? So I think for the derivatives, it's enough to take only the X derivative. The only the X derivative you actually need. And the other one? Oh, yeah. The other one is the Okay. And so let me give you some intuition on where these coefficients here come from. So maybe I erase part of the blackboard. So, in this part of the talk, the philosophy is always that we want to show that, so these estimates in particular imply that the L infinity norm of this potential decays quite rapidly and is also bounded by epsilon zero, yeah. So it's small and decaying in time. Small and decaying in time. So, the philosophy is we're close to free transport. We can almost forget about this term E, about the force. So, in order to get an understanding of the equation, let's just pretend the E is zero and we consider free transport. And then you can actually get the result quite quickly. So, you just write the density of f. Density of f at time t, you just solve the free transport equation. So it's just f0x minus tvv dv integrated over Rd. And you do a change of variables. y is x minus t v and then you get t to the minus d integral f0y and then okay I might make some sign mistakes. might make some sign mistake, something like this should be here. And now you see that if sort of if the supremum f nu y nu integral that is finite, use underserved integrability condition. This can be just bounded by a constant. Condition, this can be just bounded by a constant and we get this d to the minus d d k that we have for the L infinity normal flow here. So free transport gives us sort of what we want and is underlying the intuition. Okay. So let me talk a little bit also about the idea of the proof. So the idea is motivated by precisely By precisely this computation, we want to be close to free transport. So let's solve the backwards characteristics. So let's consider this equation. Of course, this depends on the solution itself. Okay, so we solved the backwards characteristics and the dependence on our solution is hidden in here. And we're saying, okay, this should be close to free transport. So what we could do is we take the solution and we expand around free transport. So we're saying XST of XV, so the backward characteristic from time T to time S, from a point. time s from a point from a phase space point xv okay that should be x minus t minus sv if we're following free transport okay and there will be an error y st xv okay so far i'm just defining y essentially and i do the same with the velocity so if we're close to free transport the vst should be just v plus a small perturbation V plus a small perturbation VST XV. And this is very convenient to do this argument because you can actually, this Lagrangian perspective actually allows you to close the loop. So what you can do is if n of t is conserved, then if this really is up to a time where this is bounded by a constant, I have some decay for the L infinity norms. Infinity norms. This gives me some control on these functions y and w. So they are small. If they are small, I can use the free transport estimates. And then I can use a bootstrap argument to close the proof. Of course, there is more technology behind this, but this is sort of the idea behind the proof. So it it has the external electric field, but if we say that that if you assume the perturbation decays in L infinity, but the mu doesn't give any contribution to the field, spatially homogeneous, I mean if you plug, because there's a gradient in the definition of the force field, right? In the definition of the force here, right? So that one doesn't give any contribution and the other one decays. So we're sort of close to the. Thank you. I should have pointed that out. So the mu doesn't give any contribution to E. The E is really only a function of edge. Okay, now so this is sort of what is known on the screen. The screen, the Coulomb equation. And now let's add another ingredient to this equation. So the point charge that was mentioned in the title. So we take the same equation. So far, everything is the same. But now we add a point charge. A point charge. So there is another force field. We still put the plasma initially simply at this homogeneous state. Okay, and this additional force field that we have here is generated by an external particle. So a particle that is described by its phase-based coordinates. is described by its phase-based coordinates xt and dt and it satisfies simply x dot is v and it changes its velocity by interacting with the with the plasma. This is a common model for an ion passing through a plasma, so something that is a little bit bigger than the electrons or the other components of the plasma. Of the plasma. Of course, there are some parameters here that I'm hiding, setting them all to one. But this is sort of the model. So we have a combined system of this point-charge and this plasma. Okay, and these kind of models have been investigated a lot. So let me mention a couple of names. So these point-charge models in the math literature. Models in the math literature. There are a couple of groups that have worked on this. There's Caprino, Cavalloro, Matiro Chen Wei Jang Clipper Rigabui. And I'm not gonna, I mean, I could continue here now for a bit. So, this model has been studied a lot, but mostly for the well-posedness and a priori estimates. But what this model is actually used for a lot in physics. A lot in physics is in accelerator physics. So you imagine you have a very fast ion that you shoot into a plasma, and then you solve this equation, and what they observe, and they predicted also before theoretically, is that this point charge will actually slow down through the interaction with this plasma. So it's sort of a Landau damping result that you expect for this point charge. And that hasn't been studied so far. So the first prediction of this behavior was made by Niels Bohr in 1915. So that would be nice if he was still around. What he essentially predicted is that the behavior of the velocity of the particle is essentially there is a friction which because Which becomes stronger and stronger when the particle slows down. So, this is for sufficiently fast particles. So, in other words, I mean, let's assume the V0, the initial speed, is very, very large, then that means that we expect a deceleration or slowdown when the time becomes of the order Of the order of V0 cube. Okay, and I mean, there have been a lot of computations and results, experimental observations actually confirming this in real experiments. And now the challenge is to prove this. This effect is also called the stopping power effect in plasma physics. And let me also remark that this friction is actually related to the friction coefficient in the Bales-Coulinar equation. So let me, it's in the Bales-Coulinar correction to the Landau equation. Okay, and this, for example, has been studied by Meteor De Wings and myself last year, where we proved the well-paulness of that equation. And that is actually how I was motivated to study this problem because I wanted to understand where this friction came from. The question. Just about the model, is this a time scale where collision Is this a time scale where collisions are negligible, or would it be interesting to include a collision term also? Yeah, so you wouldn't expect the collisions to matter on this time scale. So there is, of course, some stochasticity because the plasma is a little bit granular, so you have some random deviations by that. But if you imagine a particle slowing down, you wouldn't expect that on that time scale to matter. But you could include a small epsilon and a lambda or something operator. But what they typically Something operator, but what they typically do also in physics is just considered like this. Okay, and so what are the features of the equation in comparison with what we discussed before. So, first of all, the main problem with this point charge model is that you have a macroscopic amount of mass that has absolutely no dispersion. Because the point charge, there is no, I mean, it's just one velocity, right? So you have no dispersion. And all the problems essentially follow from that. Okay, the second problem is that back of the envelope computation with free transport reveals that this perturbation that we will, I mean that the F will be later also equal to mu plus some perturbation. And if we again pretend we are close to free transport, then the back of the envelope suggests computation suggests that actually the L1 norm of our perturbation Of our perturbation will grow as t divided by the velocity of the large particle. So on the relevant time scale, v0 to the cube, that is actually very large. So we cannot really argue as the other ones did before, because we have sort of a large perturbation in L1 and also in the other spaces. We cannot use the smallness. You cannot use the smallness there. And the maybe most annoying problem is that the characteristics are actually not close to free transport. Maybe let me keep this. Maybe let me keep this and so why are the characteristics not close to free transport? So, what you can do is under some assumptions of radial symmetry, this point charge will just fly on a line, let's say our first coordinate axis. So, this is x of t will never leave the e1 axis. But let's say we have another particle colliding with it. So, we look at the backwards characteristics. So we look at the backwards characteristics starting at some point here, and let's say they get close such that this time duration is sort of t half, and this is t half, and t is of the order v0 to the q. Then what happens is that this deviation here will be small, but if you take the distance here from the rectilinear trajectory, this will be much larger than. This will be much larger than 1. This will be something like V0 to the cube divided by V0. It will be again very, very large. So you cannot use that here close to free transport. So it seems that all the features of the argument that we discussed before are breaking down, but in the end you can recuperate some of it. Okay, so before I go into how one can still do something, let me first say One can still do something. Let me first state another asterisk theorem. So dropping some results and maybe also claiming some plainly wrong statements to simplify matters. So first I go on a shopping tour. I make assumptions that make life easier. So in our case, mu will be compactly supported, radially symmetric. And Penrose stable, of course. This interaction potential of the ion, we will take a smoothened version of the screen Coulomb potential. So this phi here is not equal to phi. It's also, let's say, smooth decaying. It's a little bit better than that. But for the argument, let's say that. And it needs to have positive Fourier transform. Positive Fourier transform, and that's actually sharp, otherwise, the result is not expected to hold. Okay, that's what we need. And then what we can say is that there exists a large velocity, or yeah, a large velocity v bar and some coefficients a min, a max, such that if we start our large particle with a velocity v0, Velocity v0 bigger than this v bar. Then there exists also a time t star such that we have a solution. So we have a solution f in c1 0 t star to c 0 r six intersected with c zero t star. T star C1 R6. Okay, so far that's not very impressive because I haven't told you what T star is. It might be arbitrarily small. But we can also say the following. First of all, we can say First of all, we can say such that on this interval 0t star we have the following inequality. So the velocity of our particle can be explicitly bounded above and below by this power law behavior that Bohr predicted. Okay, so we have this stopping power law and we can say that T star satisfies one of the following conditions or more than one so there's A the particle The particle just slows down to our critical velocity v bar. And that would be the perfect scenario. That's sort of slowed down to finite velocity. Below a certain threshold, this is anyway not expected to be valid. Then the Then the other condition would be the velocity at time t star is a logarithm of the initial velocity. So this would be slow down to a log. That's also still good because it tells you at least it's infinitesimally small compared to where you started. And the last one is it reaches the speed, so the thermal. The speed, so the thermal velocity of the plasma. So we have that the ball with the radius of the velocity intersected with the support of mu complement is non-empty. So it just means essentially the velocity enters the support of mu up to a constant. Okay, so we can continue. Okay, so we can continue the solution until one of these three conditions or more are satisfied. Is the log of V bar, right? No, it's a log of V zero. So that's actually much better than the log of V bar because you expect that V bar, V zero is much, much smaller than, I mean, it's really, in these accelerators, they start with something almost of the order of magnitude of the speed of light, and it slows down to a finite to a two. Down to a finite to a tool logarithm of that, so that's really pretty. Can I just, when you say smooth decaying, can I just ask you what you mean by that? You saying you've got the singularity, your potential or yeah, so it's a C2 with an exponential decay. I mean, you could give some kind of mock justification because the ion has a radius where things are different, but it's really a technical thing. I want to justify it. A technical thing. I want to justify it physically. And it would be actually interested to remove that. Okay, some remarks on this. Maybe how much time I have? A couple of minutes? Okay. Maybe let me not erase the theorem, but also I don't want to erase that. So the remarks are A is indisposable? So, I mean, if we are not at least, if we don't have a perturbative parameter, like if we don't have some, if we're not allowed to take some large speed that we are above, there's nothing we can do. And actually also in physics they don't expect it to be true. So this condition A we cannot remove. So, this condition A we cannot remove. For the condition B, so this logarithm, that is to do with the logarithm that also Bedrosian, Masmudi Muho, and Han Kuan, Nguyen and Rousseau observed in their papers. And there's a very interesting paper by Wang Nguyen and Zhu this year, where they were able to remove. Where they were able to remove this logarithmic divergence by using better spaces. So essentially, they went to Besov spaces, where some endpoint inequalities don't have a logarithmic divergence anymore. And there's some hope that this could actually remove, I mean, we would be able to say the same without the condition B. So perhaps. I mean, it's not really suited to our setting because we don't work in these kinds of spaces, but perhaps the argument can be adapted. And actually, the last condition we believe our technology. The last condition we believe our technique also would be able to remove it. It's just that we would have to go from sixty pages to, I would say, 120 pages. So this is more of a technical thing. I don't think the method that Lichard and I have employed here is really an obstruction to that. Okay, how much time I have? Should I say something? More than 10 minutes, yeah. More than 10 minutes, okay, perfect. Okay. So then I can tell you also a little bit about the You also a little bit about the ingredients of how we are approaching this So the ingredients are the following First, you have two time scales So there is the first time scale, sort of of order one, where the F adapts to a traveling wave solution around our ion. Okay, because the velocity of the charge will change in this longer time. Change in this longer time scale, V0 to the cube. And that is the second one. So there is when times of order V0 to the cube. So here the V of t is constant, approximately, and here V of t changes. And you have to make an argument that respects these two separate time scales. So what happens on the shorter ones, maybe not so difficult to understand. So we have this point charge flying in Flying in one given direction. And then you have a plasma around, and if you wait alone, but time of order one, a perturbation in the plasma will form around it. And it's initially spatially homogeneous, but there will be what the physicists will call cloud around it. And because of the, let's say, you have an attractive interaction, because of the movement of the charge, there will be an excess of. Of the charge, there will be an excess of particles behind the moving charge compared to the front. And then you have an attractive interaction, so that exerts this pulling force, this friction force. So this is sort of the very naive understanding of why you have a friction in this system. And actually, how you compute the, you can almost, by linearization, you can almost compute this cloud here, and you can compute the friction. Cloud here, and you can compute the friction coefficient. You call it traveling wave here? Well, in the sense that if you artificially, I mean, you set in the whole equation V dot equals zero, then you just have a moving frame with the ion, and if you center that frame, you will actually converge to a fixed solution, at least for the density. So it's sort of a traveling wave with a frame given by the ion. Um okay, and uh okay, so then let me let me introduce the other ingredients also of the of the proof. So we see because of this problem that the L1 norm blows up in the relevant time scale, we cannot just work with L one, HS or whatever spaces. We have to we have to do something different. And what we do is that we use the collision geometry. We use the collision geometry. And what, I mean, now we have a collision in this plasma. What do I mean by collision? Again, let's go to this picture of the point charge moving along the line. And let's say it's here at time t, moving from left to right. And then when we look at a particle in the background, they undergo sort of a collision with the ion. So I can look at these backgrounds. I can look at these backward characteristics as before. And now it turns out that there are three relevant quantities that describe these collisions. So let's say there's the first one, so dtx we call it, is just the distance in the first coordinate, but the positive part is sort of how far you are away. Here there will be a lot of perturbation behind the particle, but if you're Behind the particle, but if you're still in front, you're away from the perturbation, and that matters. So, if this is, for example, a point A, then at time t, this would be simply dt A. Then there's a second ingredient, which is the time t, or tau x1. This is sort of the, if we're given a point on the axis, that just gives you the time when the point charge passes. Point charge passes that point. So it's the minimum of t such that x of t is x1 of t is x1. Okay, and starting from that, we generate a second quantity, t check of a point, and that is just how much time has passed. Has passed since the point charge was on our height. So here, the point charge hasn't reached this point yet. So the ion is still here, I'm still away from it. So for this point, this tall check would be simply zero. But if I'm here, let's say in a point B, then this tall check TA would measure so. Would measure sort of this distance, but in a time. So it would be the time that passed since the point charge was exactly here. And there's the last one, which is easiest to understand, is simply x check, so that's the orthogonal projection to the x1 axis. That gives me just in some sense, this plays the role of an impact parameter in this condition dynamics. Okay, and then the trick is to work in function spaces that are generated by these quantities. So we work in some in function spaces with some regularity and some weights, and these weights depend on. Weights depend on this tau, d and x orthogonal. And that's so far remarkable as that means that the function space that we're working in is generated as the solution is created, right? Because these, I mean, where the particle x is depends on the solution, and our function tau and d depend on that. So we're doing. On that. So we're doing a bootstrap argument that's sort of in a function space that is built up as the evolution goes. Okay, and then let me maybe finish with a little bit of intuition why this is helpful. And maybe I take the picture above here. In some sense, maybe I already mentioned it. So here in this Here in this area, if I'm here, I'm sort of safe because there is no perturbation ever reached that zone. So the D just measures how far I'm away from the mess and I'm fine. So the relevance of D, I think, is the easiest to understand. This X bar measures the impact parameter, and if we expect some decay away from this axis, Decay away from this axis. I said before there is no closeness to rectilinear trajectories, but if the impact parameter gets larger and larger, then you expect that the perturbation is actually also smaller and smaller. So the further we move away our particle from the E1 axis, we actually can use some closeness to the free transport trajectories. So this impact this measures This measures sort of closeness to free transport. And then there's the last one. Why is this weird time appearing here? And that's actually quite easy to understand because the particle will leave some perturbation here, some kind of mess. And of course, we want to use dispersion again here after the point charge has passed. And there's no dispersion in this direction. And there's no dispersion in these directions, but whatever perturbation is here can perfectly disperse away to the other coordinate directions. And since we're working in 3D, once the point charge passes here, we get some localized perturbation in a certain area around the E1 axis. And then as time passes, it disperses around. And we get a gain on the L infinity norm of the density of the perturbation and thus on the field and so on and so forth. Field and so on and so forth. Okay, and if you carefully wrap all of this into one, then you get some bootstrap argument that you can close and you get the theorem that I now erased. Thank you very much. Thanks so much for the great talk. So coming back on my previous question, I guess how essential is the screening? So until this year people weren't able to solve the problem without the point charge. And now there is this result by Rosader and Wiedmeyer for the There in Liedmeier for the Coulomb potential. And the problem is that that essentially uses, I mean, that's only valid if μ decays like a fourth power of V. So it must have very, very slow decay, which is counterintuitive, but it has to do with the singularities of the dielectric constant in the Coulomb case, right? The singularity is stronger and stronger the more the decay. Singularity is stronger and stronger the more the decay is. So they want a very weak decay to have a relatively regular inverse of the dielectric function. And while we can get rid of the compact support assumption, it would be very hard to actually go to something that decays as slow as that. I think we would want some more fast decay. So I mean, let's see how this evolves. So on the assumptions on your potential, the exponential decay is really key to. No, exponential decay can I mean you can do substitute by a large power law, but I don't think I can go as far as x to 4, maybe. I mean, this was more or less for convenience, as also the assumption on this potential capital Phi. So you can relax a lot of the assumptions, it's just that it was already a mess. So we said, okay, we take more than we need. We have a lunch break now and we restart at 2 o'clock.
