Questions and theory. But I like to live somewhere in there. Due to time, we have to kind of speak through the acknowledgements, but thank you all for this fantastic meeting already, all the hard work, all the individuals who contributed to it at various kind of components and stages. And really already having an excellent time. So, for those that don't know, we got a little bit of a brief introduction during that game in the morning about who I am. I think we could kind of recapitulate who I am and what I do scientifically. Who I am and what I do scientifically, really here is kind of what are the forces that shape and constrain disease dynamics. I work kind of at all scales from the kind of molecular level all the way to the kind of structural and social scale. But today what we're going to do, like I discussed, is we're going to talk about how, and really in the scope of as we think about a scientific society, what its priorities are going to be and the way it's organized and why, right? Really, what I want to do is introduce some things that we think about where we kind of use epidemics as an instrument. Epidemics as an instrument for contemporary, I think, important areas that overlap with some of the things you've already heard and will continue to hear. And I think, in particular, you're going to hear about three ideas today. We're going to spend, I think these are about exponential in terms of how much time I'm going to give the cab. We're going to spend most of the time thinking about mutation effects. And there's a lot of, I think Troy are talking about that. I don't think he has several talks about that. So hopefully, this finds some resonance with some of those conversations. We're going to spend a little bit of time. Conversations. We're going to spend a little bit of time on the evolution of virulence, which is an idea also that people in the room have worked on, right? And I think maybe isn't classically considered within the canon of population biology, but it is. I think we'll kind of talk about some things I think about there. And then importantly, and very, very briefly, this question, I think Aline mentioned really, really a great kickoff talk with Mountain. Acknowledging the undergraduates as you're thinking about a scientific society, kind of the way you have to build an industry for communication into it. I think that's kind of a really, really important part for any theoretical exercise. So I'll briefly touch on that. But again, we're going to talk about this kind of now dirty term. I think we can all roll our eyes together, right, with regards to how context dependence has kind of just driven its way into theory. And I think I'm guilty of that, right? You take a canon and you kind of tweak a few things about it, say it's a different context. A few things about it, you say it's a different context, and all of a sudden you've said something kind of original. You really haven't most of the times. The theory really, really does remain intact. You just kind of added a little bit of the bell and whistle. But the problem with the context dependence framework, and the reason why we continue to hear it and people continue to publish on it, and we think that we're doing something original, is because it's true. It's because it's true. I mean, I think a lot of the theory that we've been built on, of course, there's debates raging back decades on this point. But I think, again, I also heard an important, I kind of But I think, again, I also heard an important kind of idea this morning that I think is a better analogy for what we need to do when we're thinking about these sorts of kind of theoretical canon, right? And that's this. Now, the reason why I like that as a very subversive analogy, and I mean this very, very seriously, I find that as a subversive analogy because that's precisely what spices do. They can amplify some effects and they can diminish others. And invariably, the most effective ones kind of give a surprise, right? And that's really what we need to be thinking about with regards to theory. Need to be thinking about with regards to theory, right? And what I hope to reveal in the next, I guess, three minutes, where I don't have any time I have left. So let's talk about this spice, right? What is this and what are some kind of ways? So we can think about it. My research program thinks about it at multiple levels, going from the very, very, very, very small, from the protein level. And again, right, when I talked about us rolling our eyes at context dependence, well, I mean, look, from here you see a protein that actually does different things at different temperatures. That one isn't artificial. It's very, very real. If you want to understand something about the way this protein behaves, If you want to understand something about the way this protein behaves, you better understand something about the temperature. That's kind of a very, very vanilla one. And then, of course, we can go kind of a little bit higher to the host parasite scale where we think about problems like this, right? And here, this is New York City, my hometown. And I mean, the act of influenza infecting these individuals is a very, very context-depeted experience. That's not artificial, that's very, very real. And of course, a lot of people in the room have kind of worked on how to theorize this. And of course, even on a level higher, right? And then, of course, even on a level higher, right? I think when you think about where people live and how they live, this has profound consequences for how kind of infectious disease dynamics work. So, on all these different scales, there's all these different spices that are influencing the evolutionary dynamics of our systems. How do we kind of carefully consider them? How do we responsibly build new theory to do so? And I can't offer all the solutions, but we'll hear through a little bit of things that we've worked on is how I begin to broach this topic. And we'll start with mutation effects. So we'll start kind of really with the press, which is very, very important, right? I'll ask this question: how do we discuss mutation effects when we're thinking about them in the epidemiological context? Okay. Now we're out of the right and wrong context. I think these are all correct. I think this is good. I think that Z614G mutation is important. I think describing kind of the LET mutations individually is important. I think this kind of framework that from the New York Times, where it was describing That from the New York Times, where he was describing the individual mutations and what their phenotypic consequences were, is true. I think those are very obviously have kind of strong phenotypic consequences. And we actually can look at it this way. This is a bunch of variants of concern here. We can see these kind of mutations, and then this is kind of, these are folded into mutations. Vaughan Cooper, who some of you know, wrote this really, I thought, excellent article and a good example of how leading scientists can try to clarify. Of how leading scientists can try to clarify things for us wrote this really excellent article about how there's a lot of convergence for a lot of the variants concerned. They're locating the same kind of sections of protein space, if you will. And I think that's true. But we can also say something different, right? There's also a lot of differences as well. It depends on how you want to talk about this story. The random concern shared a lot of mutations, which are almost certainly responsible for some of the shared. Certainly responsible for some of the shared phenotypic consequences, but they also had a lot of things that I think maybe we didn't appreciate at the time. And so, when we think about how to tell this story, certainly these individual kind of disappear, here you have right this mutation we described, we have E48, these are very, very popular. We saw these in every news story, and I think understandably so, should you see those mutate in a particular way, they should draw our attention. But there's another story to be told about compound. They all think many of these individual variants of concern. Many of these individual variants of concern identify different conclusions. And this is great again about the narrative. And so, for example, now we think, I think we can correct me, but I'm reasonably up on how the literature works. I think the kind of prevailing kind of hypothesis for how Omicron involved was that we think maybe potentially an immunocompromised individual. In an immunocompromised individual, the spike protein can search a wider expanse of protein space. It can locate and fix new. It can locate and fix mutations that were inaccessible in an immunocompetent individual. And conceivably, via epistasis, you can locate different, you can claim pieces. This is conjecture, but it's not crazy. I think this is one of the hypotheses for how we got on the crime. A lot of people I love, right, were in the news saying that SARS-CoV-2 is writing out of mutations. We remember all that. I don't know if you were guilty of that, Carl. All that. I don't know if you were guilty of that, Carl. I'm just kidding. No, when I mean people I love, I mean people I love. We're like, we're running out of patients. Then Omicron just came and just shocked everybody. It had a new suite of mutations, and it had a transmission invirulence phenotype that was higher by most measures than anything that we had seen. So the idea here is we needed a different narrative to describe the way that these mutations were arising, but they were doing. And you know, every paper I've read about this, I think that you know, I kind of rely on this kind of definition just to kind of keep us, just to ground us. Obviously, there's different definitions and conversations we can have about this and how to consider it, how to think about it, we can argue about that, but we're going to go with this one for the next minute and a half or whatever much I have. And 10 minutes about that. But I love this because I think it also works well with the spice analogy, right? This is exactly what we mean when we talk about. When we talk about what contexts are doing, what context clinics are doing to mutation effects, there are things that are happening that, and I think this Omicron example, right, is one that works with this framework. So what we did is we kind of just took a scholarly approach first. We're like, all right, well, we know what's happening in the SARS-CoV-2. We know we have this framework and these methods. We've worked on epistasis, but how are people actually using this in epidemiology? Like, what's the status of what it really is? So, my outstanding graduate student, Swati. Outstanding graduate student, Swati. She examined how epistasis has actually animated a lot of different literatures in the HF, basically some of the great pandemics in the last century or so. And basically, we just used a meta-analysis framework. And we're going to speed through this because part of this, some of what I'm going to show you is obvious, but we still didn't know it, right? And the idea here is that, right, a lot of people are using epsilons a lot differently in different systems, and you're getting different sorts of understandings. So here we have, these are kind of all the studies that have. We have, these are kind of all the studies that have looked at epistasis in influenza. Right, obviously, you're going to see about you have biases by hosts, you have kind of obviously these two kind of loci, and we can do something similar for other, well, we can do something similar for HIV, and there's a story to be told independently about each one of these. And we can do something very similar for SARS-CoV-2. And of course, this literature continues to grow. But the quick snapshot that we learn is given. But the quick snapshot that we learn is given the kind of inconsistency with regards to the way how biases are influencing our picture of epistasis in viruses, these are all viruses, by the way, what we can comfortably say is that we're in the infancy in terms of how to actually build this sort of language, the context dependency of mutations into epidemiology. I mean, I have a lot of friends in genomic epi, right? When I talked to them, I gave this lecture to a genomic Epi class and he said, quote unquote, this lecture broke my class. He's like the course talking about individual mutations. The course talking about individual mutations, and here I am now introducing this framework that you have to understand them to a degree of time and interacting in these surprising ways. And I think there's actually a surprising paucity of tools to actually be able to detect this in an epidemic. So we're at a point where this is an area where we actually need a lot more theory. And of course, this problem transcends limited technology, certain people who work on humans. That's another conversation to be had. So we've worked on various kind of versions of this in antibiotic resistance in terms of how to actually tell what Richard biography. To actually tell richer biographies of how mutations are working, not only interacting with each other, but the way they're interacting with environments. This is dihydrofoliproductase, where I've built a lot of my career, last five years working on. And basically, what you have is kind of like deviations from non-additivity in terms of the mutation. This is basically the fitness landscape here. This binary notation is the presence of mutations. And two would be paralyzed, three would be three-way. And basically, all you're seeing here, let's just take this mutation, right? Take this mutation, right, which is S108N, which is in malaria's dihydrophobic reductase. Really, all you're seeing here is that what actually, the phenotypic consequences, the epistemic consequences of that mutation are profoundly influenced by the drug concentration. It's very simple, it's all, right? But it basically shows you, right, telling a linear narrative about that individual mutation, even then, you need some environmental dimensionality to get the full picture of the story. But it's almost a graphical thing more than anything, but nonetheless, it is relevant. I've since kind of bought. I've since kind of gone into some other things now. So I think, so there's that story, which is kind of bread and butter, and there's kind of a little bit more hipster stories in epistasis that have emerged. Nice to meet you if you've heard of global epistasis. So this is right. So we'll get into it later. The way I think about global epistasis is one of the problems with epistasis is that it can feel nihilistic, right? Like, I have to understand every kind of possible combinatorial interaction, every possible mutation ever to understand any phenotype. It kind of feels worthless. But global level stasis tells us, no, there's real rhythm. Global lepostasis tells us: no, there's real rhyme and reason to the way mutations are interacting. There's rhyme and reason, and that you can actually the phenotypic effect of mutations well predicted by the phenotype or the background where it's at. So it adds some kind of like some rhyming reason to being able to predict how a mutation is going to interact with a given set of genetic background. And so a former shared postdoc of mine and a former department colleague of mine, of course, he left and then we started working together. That's the way it works. I've also anchored as one of my dearest friends. We co-taught theory together. Taught theory together, and we published a paper actually not very long ago. We actually looked at global question I just showed you here, but the global stasis. And you actually see a lot more rhyme and reason. And I'll quickly take you through it. This basically says, this is one of the mutations associated with resistance in malaria. This is kind of the fitness of the background to which it's added. I mean, it doesn't get any more red and blue than that. But here's the thing. So it's very, very, very, very profoundly kind of linearly associated with the background which with to which it's added, I should say. To which it's added, it's very specific. But look, when you actually get to this drug concentration, it flips. It flips. And we see this kind of, and again, this is only for one of the mutations. We have this data for all of the mutations. But again, right, mutation biographies, as I call it, right? You want to be able to tell individual stories. When you talk about individual stories, there needs to be more information with regards to the way those things are interacting with other parses of information. So, when I think about this, immutations. Mutation effects are doomed by stuff, right? And I think with careful understanding and consideration of how genomic and environmental context shape mutation effects, we can move towards better predictions. I think this is a kind of a frontier for theory on mutation effects. How much do you want to? You've got five minutes. Perfect. Perfect. Well, it's going to be perfect. All right. Next to the evolution of virulence. Now, and we'll talk briefly about what that is. Talk briefly about what that is. So, the evolution of variables, the way I look at it is: you know, there's a lot of definitions, you know, just like epistasis. We can talk about a lot of ways. A framework for understanding the constraints underlying why packages make us sick and how they might evolve. I think it's one of the most important pedagogical instruments in all evolution. I mean, it really, really is. There's a logic that underlies it. It's beautiful. It makes sense. It's intuitive to the person who has never understood evolution at all. I think the evolution experience is one of the canonical frameworks we use. I think it's been rigorous. We use. I think it's been rigorously applied, right, in biological systems. But again, Carl, people that I love, I don't know if it was you, but people that I love, remember when people were on the new saying, right? It was very, very unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 would get more virulent? Right? You didn't say that. She looked at me like, don't look at me. Look at me like, don't look at me. But a lot of people did. And I think they did that based on what our understanding of the evolution of vulnerabilities was at the time. So I did this. I did this pump. They did that based on their politics, but keep going. Well, that's a beer conversation. Keep talking about that. But people who knew what they were doing said it, I feel like. Some people, whatever. I vote for politics. I mean, the first one was just higher viral load. Output transcript, which is obviously advantageous. No, this is good. So, what I did was, in light of that, in light of the fact that we got that wrong, that prediction. In light of the fact that we got that wrong, that prediction were something, not wrong, that's not true, not you, obviously, but some people got this, not you, but some people got this wrong, some people got this wrong. The idea was, well, what do we actually know about the relationship between, what do people actually measure about the relationship between virulence and transmission? And my outstanding graduate student, Katie Kabengale, went in and did a meta-analysis of all the studies that have been done that actually measured the relationship between traits associated with virulence. Means traits associated with virulence and traits associated with transmission. Different colors mean different organism types, right? So, green is plants. I think red is phage. I believe blue is, I think fungus is here, whatever. The point is, what you're seeing here is, and there's some patterns. What you're seeing here is you're seeing a lot of differences. Like, it kind of just depends on who happened to measure that system at that time and measure it, how they wanted to measure it. It sounds pretty kind of idiosyncratic, right? So, the idea here is, right, the So, the idea here is: the specific biosocial relationship and the manner that virulence is measured profoundly influences the relationship between virulence and transmission, which means right there, again, you know, idiosyncratic and context-dependent. So we actually did this early in the pandemic before we knew what we were doing. We actually asked the question, if you had different relationships, we asked this before, if you had different relationships between virulence and transmission and the virus evolved, how would that actually shape the way the epidemic? Would that actually shape the way the epidemic happened? This is kind of a quirky theory paper we did, right? We said this is possible correlation, we had these values. And basically, I mean, again, it's kind of obvious in some ways, but based on what your understanding is about the relationship between variance and fear, you're going to get completely different consequences, right? So these predictions have meaning. When you get these things wrong, when the theory underlying it isn't strong and you're making predictions for the way a pandemic is going to happen, it actually has consequences for policy. Consequences for policy. This is an area where theory needs to step in. And so, lastly, what we'll talk about in this paradigm is this work. We continuing to beat this drum. I assigned this. This completely changed my life. This book in chapters. No, is it wrong? You want to tell me it's wrong? Now, because it's a peer review, it's about to get accepted. So, you better tell me now. Okay, but I assigned this book in this chapter for how to kind of understand the problem of if you have a The problem of if you have a virus system and you have an invader, they say it's an optimization, it's a game theory optimization problem, right? But you can do that on a dynamical epidemiological system. I think this chapter articulates that beautifully. And we've done that, but I think we've done that not so much for different relationships between virulence and transmission, but for simply different infections with different natural histories. So in this case, we have a direct transmission context. Here we have an indirect transmission context. This is based on a hepatitis C virus model that we've done. The C-virus model that we've done for indirect transmission. This is based on SARS-CoV-2. And again, obvious in some ways, but you get these kind of, you know, you get these, here you have indirect, here you have direct, here you have, what are the things that, what are the aspects of the model that forces VSS variables to go up, right? And they're very, very, very, right, based on the structure of the model, they're going to be very, very particular, right? You get particular kind of predictions for what's going to happen based on what the natural history of disease is. Again, unsurprising as a whole. As a whole, like that, that lesson wouldn't shock anybody, but when you dig on it, it's kind of like, whoa, wait a minute. I mean, there's bizarre things like, you know, you can get virulence as recovery rate. There's some counterintuitive and potentially alarming things that emerge when you start to study at this point. So we think about context that way, context could be, right, there's different types of things. It could be the different relationships between virulence and survival and transmission. That's going to yield kind of different predictions for happening evolutionarily. It could be. For happening evolutionarily, it could be different natural histories of disease that could be influencing things. And so, in summary, there, COVID-19 should have been a shining moment for the evolutionary. I feel like that was the moment that we were all working for when we were developing that theory, right? We have a live pandemic that is changing before our eyes, and we presumably have lessons and parameters and models that can tell us what's going to happen. And we got it wrong, and that's okay. I'm not indicting anybody for getting it wrong. Maybe I'm indicting the confidence with which we made the predictions. With which we made the predictions. But nonetheless, it's not about shaming anybody, even criticizing, I mean, myself more than anybody else. It's more about this is an opportunity for us to do better. This is a paradigm that we can actually use to develop a more rigorous room, a new paradigm for the evolution of symptoms, harm, host, response, whatever. Notice I didn't say virulence. I broke it down into the different things because virulence, like fitness, like you heard this morning, right, can be cracked open and it means a bunch of different things in different systems. We talked about. We talked about a bunch, and we're asking this issue about how to translate things. I've used this public engagement thing. Yeah, perfect, we're done. When you're ready. Yeah, we're done. We're done. We're done. We've used this public engagement thing because I think it highlights the consequences of how kind of muddiness in our theory has real-world consequences. And I think during the pandemic, I think there were a lot of people who did an excellent job here, and I think a lot of our colleagues did an excellent job here. And I think moving forward, this is the kind of thing we need to lean in on. This is the kind of thing we need to lean in on as we develop out a scientific society that wants to develop certain things. Thank you. You wrapped up much faster than I thought. Okay, so if you have some time for questions. I'm sorry. You know, so many people are still doing this question of after Omicron: is this it? Is the virus coming in? And one of the really The virus is going to get any. And one of the really remarkable things in this pandemic is just this two-phase kind of evolutionary process that you alluded to that within individual long-term evolution happening in probably hundreds of thousands of individuals, allowing lots of exploration as well as transmission. But that's where the deputational scan. We've got a lot to say what's going to happen nearby. How do we say anything about what's out there, what other fitness? But what other fitness peaks are just beyond reach? I think the DMS stuff is great. I think that's a great example. I think, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think locally, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that stuff. Yeah, I mean, part of what my solution is, I think there's a colleague of mine, Sam Scarpino, has a really great paper about something called permutation enthrony. And basically what him and his colleague argue is that when it comes to predicting epidemics, basically, again, it's kind of obvious. You really can only predict like a week or so in advance. Predict like a week or so in advance. After that, the parameters of an epidemic change, right? And they feedback and change. So, you're right. So, the idea here is shorter-term theory that makes better, shorter-term predictions. And I think at the molecular level, I think DMS does a beautiful job at articulating certain things. We have a good idea about how certain drugs will or won't, right? So, I think there's a lot of good that can come from modern technology. I think maybe it's tension with the time scale and scope of what our predictions is and the theory that. Of what our predictions is and the theory that informs them. Right, and I think what was surprising was that SARS-CoV-2 took what we would have thought would have been a long time-scale thing and did it quickly. That's right. No, exactly. Right. Yeah, I mean, when you were talking about contingency, when you first started talking about contingency, I thought there was something else that we didn't talk about. That's a bit of a tension here. I mean, I don't come from a normal epidemiological background, but I mean, in one sense, everyone's not going to be able to do I mean, in one sense, every single biological system is highly contingent, very individual, in fact. And in my career, I run up against people, especially in mainstream ecology, who will tell you that theory is worthless because you have to just describe every single system that you want. Okay, so there's this tension, right? There's theoreticians who want to be able to say something general. I mean, you were talking about generality becoming more specific in a sense, because you can still identify things that are not just applicable to one sense. That are not just applicable to one system, but they're wrinkles that we need to add to our general principles. But I think also we've got to make people expect fundamental contingency and not use it as a weapon against us. Very well said. You have your general principles. Very well said. But you need to take your species and say, okay, this species X is a combination of a short life cycle. Short life cycle, but it also has high levels of investment and information use. Contingency is not an indictment. There's a lot more definition for that than a short-term system with less information. The bottom line is that you're going to have to build a model for each system, in a sense, that you want to work on. But that still doesn't mean that you can't input into those systems general principles that we've sweated our asses off, you know, identifying as the preface. Densifying a stereotypes? No, I mean, I think you, that was a great question. I think you gave a great answer to it. And you gave a great answer to it. But I think this is one, again, like I said, this is not just an epidemics problem, right? I go to the conversations I had with Noah. This is the conversation, right, around polygenic risk. It's the same thing, right? It really isn't. So that's why I really do think this is a society-level question. And I think part of that third component about translation, part of us being agile with how we actually have that conversation. With how we actually have that conversation. That's as important as whether we're using ABMs or model this or that. It's being agile the way you were with regards to describing the utility and importance of theory, which I think we absolutely have to defend ourselves. On that very palpable note about why we need a society, let's just take a picture. So, chief photographer is going to lead us right outside these. Photographer is going to lead us right outside. He's waiting in the lobby. So we'll just go right outside the street. No, no, no, that was great. Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks for getting your support. I borrowed that spice thing. I'm going to coach you on that. We have to write a question about that. The spice thing. I'm into the spice. Professor, you ask hard questions too, so I'm glad you're going to be able to do this. No, no, I I just I love that figure you have with the the the the better analysis. The meta-analysis. And I think the thing to predict is the answer. I mean, what we just did, you know, I mean, I can tell you for me, my predictions were very simple. It's like, when there was no evolution, my prediction is there'll continue to be used as evolution. When alpha cameline has increased to vary, my prediction is it will continue to increase viral losses. When Omicron's cameline, I mean people say I remember stability, I think that's false. I think that's also something nothing happening on either transmissibility or the size of size. Either the transmissibility or the variance thing. And it's like, okay, so my assumption is that it will continue to be bicep.         With yourself, like the vaccine for a long time. Yeah, shocked to learn that that's what's the best scientist. How was he vaccinated? So it was sort of a funny thing, like this scientific information sort of dropping without context almost into the system. Yeah, that's like using it and being like to sort of pull it. You can see that okay. Yeah, based on their pre-existing position. Everybody's fucking it was a remarkable time to be at Lafayette, kind of isolated. And hard to not feel like a lost outcome. And then you had folks who had studied specific, one person I could think of specifically there's some impact of variation in connectivity in networks, like when you have oh, you know, and that would. And that produces, in some simple cases, there are not a lower hardening threshold, which was the pandemic is already still high. Of course, that wasn't the case for all kinds of reasons, but it became science battle because they felt just getting science well enough in the past, but then it was also a nice partial battle because that became picked up by substituting like public health. Yeah. Couldn't win in some cases. Yeah. Right, we had to all launch. Right. Oh, yeah. I think it's a little bit cold. I think we'll go with it. That's a module. No, they just like sucked into it. We have two perfect and then some might suck into like orange alpha as well. Yeah, like don't do time for it. You know, it's less actually attention. You asked. You asked me if we're fixing that changes that you just read. I don't surprise that. Yeah, that's a good idea. Do you ever see my hands go? I've just seen something. No, I never see it. But I think they don't have that on it. Eric, but I think it's a good idea. We have like a drive here. Oh, what they want to have. Oh, it's going to wait on this. So, what's the gist of the discussion going on?
