Thanks, the chair, for the introduction. And also, thank the organizer for the kind invitation. I'm very sorry that I cannot come on site this time due to that. This is week zero. I'm the someone in charge of the grade study. We need to welcome over 100,000 grad students to the faculty this week. This week. So I really miss you, all of you in Hangzhou. Hopefully, next time I can join you next time. Okay, this general work with a few people, some PDE, some computation. I don't read all of them in detail. For example, like a general from Fudan and a few others. Yeah. A brief outline of my talk. I will start from the motivation. What is Dipola? Is dipolar, both I can say obesity in short, and it's massive model. It's kind of a non-linear Schrodinger equation with a non-local interaction. And the ground state, which is a minimization of the anti-functional and the constraint, and some theory. The dynamics. Here, we also talk about some kind of reduction. The problem is, you know, in the three-dimensional. In a three-dimensional, but in experiments, the confinement is anisotropic. So you can reduce to three dimensions to from three dimensions to two dimension or even one dimension. We will get, so the square root of Poisson operator naturally in two dimension, which mimics the Coulomb interruption in 2D. And then for some dipolar both compensation and some future challenges. And some future challenges area. You know, this digital quantum gas comes from some typical one, including liquid quality three or digital quality four, and also both in short for bosons or fermions. There are one component, two component, or even spinal system, as well as both Fermi mixture. They share some kind of typical property, they always realize. They always realized in low temperature, like micro Kelvin or even auto-cold nano-Kelvin temperature. They are realized on the quantum phase transition, so from high to low temperature, and they are closer to non-linear wave. So this kind of gas, they are superfluous. They flow without friction. And typical signature is the support quantized versus. Quantized vertices. You can see here some kind of, you know, this kind of vertices, their circulation is a multiple of integer. And the particle interaction between particle could be contact, like informing local, or could be coolant, which is a non-local and isotopic. Recently, due to the dipolar quantum... The dipolar quantum gas, there could be non-local and anisotropic interaction. You will see later the internal kernel. Okay, so the experiment is the following. You suppose you have two molecule, an external either electric field or magnet field. The two molecules, they form a dipole, dipole like a polymer. There is an orientation. There's orientation. There are many, many depots. They are aligned in the same direction, aligned with external electric field or magnetic field. These are cooling them down to atrocity temperature and holding a magnetic stripe. They form dipolar condensation, or they call degenerate dipercolum gas. Because to realize this one, based from classical party interaction. The party interaction to a phase transition to get the condensed fluids. The first experiment by chromium-52 was done in 205 at University of Germany. And after that, there's a big wave in their study, like from mathematics, from physics. You will see a lot of interesting phenomena from this problem later. Okay, and then. Okay, and then 10 years ago, they also use this kind of DI164 to, you know, so this kind of, to do experiment. This kind of experiment can have a strong dipole interaction or DDI in short. Okay, here's the model. Here, t is time. X is special coordinate in R3. My wave function psi is a compared. Is a competitor wheel function. So this psi follows the gross Pinski type of equation. This is in Debian's form. So I dt psi equals this one. Here, this is Laplace. V is potential, is there potential? Beta and lambda are two constants here. Star means convolution. So here, again, this is V is harmonic confidential potential. Here, gamma x, gamma, gamma z are positive. gamma gamma z are positive constants and i have this beta is equal 4 pi n a s over a 0 so n is never dipole in your system as is as we have less could be positive negative a0 is diminished this space unit and the lambda equals m n mu 0 mu depth square 3 h bar square over a 0 this is called language interaction stress so m is Stress so m is the mass of the dipole, is the number of dipole mu is the so the dipole constant for vacuum and the mu dipole is this constant for this dipole and the h bar constant and h a zero is again the diminished dimension list so the spread unit normally a0 is like in the like an order of uh micrometer here i have this u dipole Here, I have this u typo, the kernel u type of x. So, you can see here this is one typo and the other typo the two position. And this type of orientation n is so-called fixed, is like a unit of vector in R3 or S2. And this is depth orientation. So, this angle theta is between the depth orientation and the segment links to depth. Connect links to dipole center. So u dipole of x equals 3 over 4 pi times 1 minus 3 n dot x square over epsilon square over epsilon x cube. So all written as 1 minus 3 constant theta square over x to the power 3. Here n is in the unit vector in R3. unit vector in R3 and the the the is the L norm is one and the theta is the angle between n and the the vector connected to dipole so this angle is theta so you can see this dipole kernel u dipole x is highly singular at the origin because formerly you can say when x equals double to zero this u damp x is at the order of figure o one over epsilon x x 1 over epsilon x to power cube, which is a highly significant Coulomb interaction. Okay, if so, formally, if the solution psi is through this equation, Trader equation, then the total mass is conserved. So, see here, psi is a wave function. The epsilon squared defined as load density. So, integral over R3 is equal one. Yeah, then the total energy, the kinetic energy, potential energy, the kinetic interaction, loading interaction. The current interaction, local interaction energy, and the dipole-deputy energy. So, this is conserved. And you can see the last term, even fixed lambda. This guy is the sign, different local position x can be changed. Since you can see the u dipo, this one is one minus three. Dependent value of the angle theta. So, this could be u dipole could be positive, could be negative. Okay, and as mentioned before. And as I mentioned before, this line originally in that dipole U-dipo is highly singular. At the origin, it's like a bigger O 1 over Îµ. And it's a free transform like a U dipole hat symbol psi, which is equal to minus 1, 3, n dot z square over epsilon square. You can see this certain term, when this symbol, free symbol psi, go to zero or go to infinite. This center term there's no limit. It's zero over zero type, but no. It's zero over zero type, but no limit. So, in computation or in analysis, for convolution, you will use a free transform. Then, if you're in computation, what they do is they just die of head when c equals zero, simply fixed user, you could minus one, the drop second term. Then they can they find observe that there's a numerical log phenomenon. This is your fixed domain. No matter your mass size, how small it is. Your measure is how small it is. The numerical arrow is at the order big O to the power minus 2 or minus 3. Cannot decrease it. You will see the reason later. Okay. So here we try to use a different formulation for the problem. We let r equal epsilon of x, roughly the radius of x. Dn denote the enter gradient, since n is unit vector. So dn you can get the So d n, you can get the directional derivative. And the d n n equals d n d n. There is a new type of x. When x is nine zero, you can check out straightforward. And when x equals zero, you can use the find the limit. So this u typo can be written as minus a dirac of x minus three dn one over four pi r. So you can say from this formulation, you can easily say. From this formulation, you can easily say the free transform of u diable is u diapo hydroc equal, you know, the direct function, the free transform is one, and you know, we take a dn, you take a free transform becomes n dotted n dot c, right? Then we know one over four pair r in three dimension, which is the fundamental search of men's Laplace operator. So that's where you end up with one over this. This epsilon set square. So, from this decomposition, you get the friction very easily. Then we plug this U dab using this one, get a U double convolve set square. You get the minus set epsilon square minus 3 d and n little phi. Then little phi equals one over four pi r convolve epsilon square. So, which in our three dimension, which is equivalent to. Three dimension, which is equivalent to minus Laplace phi equal epsilon, which is a Foissoux equation. Okay, now if I plug in this W interaction back into my original GPE, I end up with the following sort of couple equation in operator form, not in convolution form. You can see I get the I dt si equal this kinetic potential and the beta minus z square. So this is a combined term. A combined term minus three lambda d and little phi and a little phi is a Poisson equation. So you can think of this is a kind of gross PDS key direct person type equation. So with this formulation, the any functional can be written the following for like this kinetic part, greater than Z square. This is partial part, and then beta minus lambda over two, the epsilon set power four plus three lambda over two. four plus three lambda over two dn gradient phi square so you can see this decomposition from precisely from here you can see is a local non-local you can from this any form you can think is kind of decomposition is kind of repulsive attractive you can see if my lambda bigger than zero the second term which corresponds to this term is repulsive and the minus lambda set power four is attractive with lambda bigger Is attractive with lambda bigger than zero. On the contrary, if lambda negative, the second term, this one, is attractive. And minus lambda epsilon power four is repulsive. So this kind of decomposition can be seen as either local, non-local decomposition or repulsive, attractive decomposition. So after you have this kind of this formulation and then you know we can define the ground state. The ground state. Define the ground state. The ground state is defined as a kind of non-converse minimization problem. So I minimize the added functional E phi, which is given here. You replace the psi by phi. And for all phi, which is, well, phi is the set S. S is L to norm. This norm is L to norm equal one. Fulfill the constraint. And the energy is bounded. So phi G is kind of minimizer. So of course, if you So, of course, if you from this constraint problem, if we increase Lagrange, like L of phi mu equal E of phi minus minus the mu times some kind of absolute absolute epsilon square minus one. And then you do all of the linear equation, you end up the following non-linear eigenvalue problem and the constraint. So we find the mu and the phi together. The phi together. Well, they follow this equation. It's called time type equation. And the little phi follows Poisson equation. And the far field of phi is go to zero. And also, little phi L to normal equal to one. So here, this is mu, you physical chemical potential. You mathematically calculate as eigenvalue. So you can see if we know the eigenfunction phi, you get a mu can be chemical as mu equal this. As mu equals this functional, which is the antifunctional transitional term. So, here due to you can see due to the non-linear term, the non-linear term. So, here the eigenvalue, mu, which is called chemical potential, and the energy is they are not different. They are different. So, basically, roughly speaking, suppose you have a n particle system, the energy means energy per particle. Particle: the total of the total system divided by n is this e and the chem means when you want to add one particle or remove one particle from system, which is a called chemical potential. You understand the mu is a variation of mu of E to the number of particle in some essence. Okay, now the question is: given my potential V, given my beta and lambda. Given my beta and lambda, question is for this minimization problem, is there a minimizer? And also, is the minimizer unique? So you can since the, you know, this phi is for this one. So now, in general, the phi is not unique. So you can see if phi is a solution, phi times any complex constant c, well, the epsilon of c equal one is still a minimizer. Are minimum measure this all you know any function every step have absolute value so the uniqueness is not always so if phi solution phi times any like uh say phi times i or phi times exponential i is not zero is also a solution okay so for the existence we have following theorem suppose the v is bounded below graduate zero bounded below and v is a v's potential is confined at a far field And far field, v e go to infinite, which makes sure that the set S is compact. And then we show that if beta greater than equal zero and if lambda less than equal to beta greater than equal to minus beta over two, there exists a gross VG. Then the growth VG, the power ground is unanimous and ViG. constant is unanimous and feature is constant the feature can write at exponential i slash zero times epsilon of hg for n is that zero there's there is a slap zeros in r and then if beta less than zero or if beta greater than equal to zero but and lambda bigger than beta or lambda less than minus beta over two there are no grounds it means that i can find a sequence phi n we are which are in a which are in a set S, such that E of V n goes to minus infinite when n go to infinite. So in other words, this condition beta great equal zero and lambda less equal to beta equal to minus beta over two is sharp. So the proof is some keys. The key part is to find the dn grad phi little phi square, where little phi is for this Poisson type equation. is for this posing type equation. We observe that suppose if for any given function phi little this phi in s, you might set as l to norm equal to one. And suppose the little phi is the Poisson equation and the rho is the density. Then we can show that the dn grad phi, the L to norm, here is L to norm. Let's equal gradi grada phi which equal Laplace phi in R3, which equal rho to L part L to norm. L power the L2 norm, which you call little phi to power little phi L4 norm square. So remember here, this is the equity, the constant is one. So with this one, we can show that the E of phi, which could equal E of epsilon phi or equal E of square of rho, and denote as E of E tota rho, which is under the condition of this one, which is convex. Is convex. So basically, the E of squared of rho is a straight cover in terms of rho is condition satisfied. And the confirmed say that the set S is a compact. And if in terms of rho, the constraint is integration of row equal one, which is a convex constraint. So using the standard combination problem, you can prove the existence. And then 9 this is just choosing the this function test function phase. choosing the this function test function fee so you play with epsilon one epsilon two you can show the if and if if if this condition is not satisfied there are no ground state okay so we have with the business formulation with some if you're a numerical method i don't bother you here i just show you some result so you can see here we fix v which is a which is a like uh us isotropic uh potential which is the x square power yes got potential which is x squared y square z squared over two and the fixed beta 207 and we we plot that this is counter plot of ground state and different lambda the top one a is when lambda equals beta over two and the center one is with lambda equals zero yes this is this one the density the counterplay is a sphere and then this is lambda equal a quarter of beta half of beta three quarter beta and lambda equal beta because this case And the lamb nigga beta. In this case, the diamond interruption is at the stress is strongest. Then you can see the isosurface is like an ellipse and the length axis is aligned with a dipole orientation. Okay, so after a ground theory, one start dynamics due to this additional term. Of course, we know when not equal zero, the organ of maximum theory. Zero the organ of massive theory for different v and beta, for example, exist look existence of blow up when beta less than zero is two or three dimensions. Here, what study with this additional term, this dipole term. So, of some of that. And again, we can have this. Well, before us, this is the other group of people using convolution to do some analysis. We can say if V and the S0 set condition, so the look is this. So the look exists always there. And if they're granted, then they're global existence. Then we have proved that if beta less than zero or beta greater than zero, then lambda less than minus beta over two or lambda bigger than beta. And if v for this condition, I'm seeing if v equals zero or v equal harmonic, this is always true. Then we can show that if initial say zero for this standard condition, For this kind of standard condition, for Schrodinger type equation, natural equation with criminal nineteen, you know, the fine-time blow up. In fact, you can see the dipole-type term. We do the decomposition. It's roughly speaking like the cubic interaction in some sense. Okay, so here just show one result. You can see we started from a ground state. So, see, we choose. So, see, you will choose v of x with fixed beta, fix the lambda, fix the n. So, at t equals zero, we let n change from zero, zero, one, the type of orientation, from the following n of t to sign t over five, zero constant t over five. That means when t change, that n from zero zero one to one zero zero, you will see the see the the dynamics you can see the somehow the the the dipole the the condensate rotate along with the the the dipole orientation we try to use some kind of so the variation form to get us some like a pro solution for this one but not to succeed yet but you should proper understand in some sense but this this phenomenon can say here okay we also test the Okay, we also test the design about this numerical method. Here, we also test the so-called the collapse of the B of the B C with the DDI. Here, you know, you experiment to observe the clover phenomena. So, you start from a ground scale. This shows the counterplot of density at t by zero. Okay, again, at the t by zero, I have a ground state with a fixed v beta lambda. So at t by zero, I change my lambda from beta over two. From beta over two to two lambda, mathematically they're blow up. Of course, physics of simulation of physics is supposed to add a diameter term, quantity diameter to arrest blow up. So you see the dynamics looks because at first you do the attractions, the attraction is strong, they shrink. Then they do the anisotropic surface temperature interaction, they expand in. They expanding to show some clover phenomena, which observes experiment and also can observe from simulation. Okay, I have a few minutes. I just want to show some, okay, some kind of deep reduction. So, you know, this is the original model. The experiments, the potential V is anotropic. So, here, this is the three parameters, Y and Z. Y and gamma z, they are in different order. So suppose my n equals n1, n2, and 3. And one scenario is my gamma z, this is the confined z direction, it's much, much stronger than x direction. So you sound like, for example, my comma x, gamma equals one, gamma z equal 10 of 100. So if you are interested, if gamma z go to infinite, what happens? What happens? When you experiment the observer, when gamma z very, very large, the condensate is like a disk. So basically, like a seem like a 2D phenomena, two different phenomena. The other is from three different to one dimension. That means my suppose my gamma x is other one, y and gamma z both are large. So the start is if you suppose gamma x is fixed. We consider with gamma x, y, comma z go to infinite. Okay. It okay, I want to remark here that for lambda equals zero, there are some kind of formal asymptotics or even really proof for this refinement. Of course, I want to again from n-bodied linear shredding to this non-linear problem, there are many, there are also from also a lot of results, including L dots, shitty, and yaw from this embodied, like this mean field of prism. Here is what we study. Here is what we study is from three dimensions to one dimension. Okay, so the summary following. We suppose my gamma is gamma y is other one, can be different. Like a one is one that is two. And so gamma z is very, very large. So you know, my method, you know, something is going to infinite, not easy to do, but then we introduce epsilon equal one over square of gamma z. So when comma is going to be infinite, epsilon zero. So once that Epsic goes to zero. So I started with epsilon zero, what happens? So then I suppose my potential interpretation v can be composed of v 2 dxy plus z square over 2 epsilon power 4. Specifically, z direction is a strong confinement, which is, you see, this direction is z square over, okay, it's a 1 over 2, gamma z square times z square. So with this, you know, this term, then the F this term, then the linear operator, which is L, is minus one half Laplace plus V external potential X can be written as minus one half Laplace per the two dimension plus V 2 dxy plus L Z. Well, LZ equal minus one half dz plus one z square over two epsilon power four. So this one if interest z two equals epsilon z. So this epsilon L can be written can be written as one over epsilon square times minus one half dz dz tilde d tilde plus d t square over two so you can see the inside term which is a standard uh shredding operator with harmony oscillate potential we know this this one the eigenvalue order one so in other words the eigenvalue the the the smallest eigenvalue of l v is at one over epsilon square then the the Then the eigenvalue of the first two for these two terms is at order one. So in some sense, if you can say in this setup, my eigenvalue of this L can be spread into two terms. One term is order one, the other term is order one very square. Basically our observation, we can take n of the psi xyzt represent by exponential minus i t over epsilon square psi xy t times omega epsilon. T times omega epsilon of z. Well, we can say this one. This one is nothing but this L Z, the ground of this one. You can see when epsilon goes to zero, this omega epsilon z become a direct function in z direction. So you still need no match conservation. So you cannot assume sexy z t is in different of z. The order can be so self x x y z t will be in z direction will be become a direct function z direction. A derived function direction. So that the so that the right hand side, the left side and both right hand side, they are the integration over R3 is equal one. So I plug this answers into my equation here. You do some calculation. You end up the little sex white t, the 2dx function, we follow this equation here. Well, this little phi now is a convolution of. phi now is a convolution of u epsilon 2d convolution set square where u epsilon 2d is this one so this is kernel u epsilon 2d formula let epsilon go to zero you end up with u epsilon 2d will converge some constant times one over r where this r is in 2d because you know x squared with r is squared of r equal difference here so in other words if i let x equal to zero i end up this kind of I end up this kind of PGPE in two dimensions with this term here. Well, my little phi now is minus Laplace to power one half. See this one. So we will observe this square of Poisson equation in two dimensions. Straightforward from the debris reduction from 3 to 2D. If I know basically the interaction for the last equation, right? Maybe example the cooler interaction. Right, maybe example the cooling induction. We know cooling induction either in three dimensional two dimensions, it's a constant times one over r. Well, in three dimension, one over r times a constant is the fundamental of mass of plus operator. Well, in 2D, you know, one over r is the fundamental of the mass loop one half. In 2D, you know, of course, the mass log operator, the fundamental is log r, it's no longer one over r. Longer one over R. So this is. And then we can derive so-called the energy also to this one. And also for this reduced model, for this one, you can get the energy. Again, the ground is defined as so-called the minimum of this energy functional, and the little field is in L2. So you get some this result for the ground state. And we can also prove that, so because suppose. So, because suppose this psi is a solution of the original problem, and this little sexy z x y t is solution of this of this problem. And we can show that there are an L to norm, with epsilon zero, the linearly converges for finite time f t. Okay, I think I can okay, similarly can do from three to one d your one interest is interesting is so-called if m three square equal one half one over three and beta equals. One over three and beta equals zero, lambda equals zero, lambda non-zero. In three d is a non-linear problem. Well, in one D, the model is a linear problem. You can see here with beta equals zero and three n square equal one. You can see this and so lambda is non-zero. So this in 3D is a in 1D, the reduced model is a linear problem, which you can see like a superposition is a valid. Okay. And so my time is. And uh, so my time is over, right? Hello? Cannot hear you? Hello? Your time is just over. So, okay, just quickly just so we just take your time. Okay, take your time. So, experiment problem is the add minus omega L V. So, these three dimension is three dimension. Well, this L. dimension is three dimension well this l d is called the component angle angular momentum which is l d equal i y dx minus x dy this term so then you know the energy functional is no longer convex due to this term so in this case that's because the quantized what is like this kind of so this is a control plot this blue is zero so the quantum what is the generation so you see some very challenging like uh what is that python from this is like Is lettuce python from this is like a upper row of lettuce, which every in the center, every three neighborhood. What is it? They form a red triangle. However, if the there's a divergent direction, they form like a read or something like that. This is, we will show them because of the diagrams from the reptilot to this parallel vertices. Okay, I think a quick summary here we talk about this kind of Here, we talk about this kind of so-called dipole quantum gas, which is a gross potential equation in three dimensions with a non-local atisotropic interruption kernel, which got dipotential interruption, which is highly singular between the ground existence, uniqueness, and the non-existence. And for dynamics, and also we talk about the three-dimensional problem, and some, if the confinement and its. The confinement is anisotropic can be reduced to two dimensions or even one dimension. There are also digital problems here, for example, like if the potential V is random, then they become like a disorder will be generated. The other is due to vertices. One is, say, with the beta go to infinite, all the what is call size go to zero, you can get a particle model. Particle model one way from PDE to ODE system. And the other way you have ODE system, then you can by using some defense, some kind of direct mass, go back to PDE with a limit. The lot of like, say, basically the quantum versus pattern and the dynamics, some kind of kinetic model, a particle model. From PDE to the category model, or all this from party model for PDE, of due to this, when there, when there. When number equals zero, there's a lot of study. When is lambda? Even the what is it is no longer the density no longer symmetric. There are a lot of interesting problems that from PDE level. Thank you. Let's stop here.
