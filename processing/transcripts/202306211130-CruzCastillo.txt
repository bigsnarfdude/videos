In this presentation, I'm going to present calculations for the non-orientable Shure multiplier. This will be the part of the presentation that will be most elementary and we are going to prove every theorem step by step. So, take it like a little break. So first a little introduction and set of things. We are going to denote G, a finite group, CN, the cyclic group of order N, F2, the field of two elements, and D2N, the hederal group of order 2n. So we are interested in calculating finite generation for different types of finite groups. You remember the talcoferic. Remember the Talcoferic that there were these two groups of ISO two that were cyclic groups, the hedra groups, and there were also other type of groups, but it happens that they are just particular cases of symmetric groups or alternating groups. So what Carlos and Emilio did one year ago, did make calculations for the cyclic group, the heterogroup, the alternating and symmetric group. And symmetric group. But in this case, I'm going to pursue only the cycle and the heterogroup because, in the non-oriented case, you have to consider torus, climb models, and projective. So everything is more and more complicated. And if you remember the relations that Carlos showed in the later presentation, you know that you can reduce everything to projective. So one might ask, why not just simply consider? Ask why not just simply consider projectives and something interesting is that the torus and the clean models help to organize the elements and see better the group structure of the Odin-oriented shoe multiplier. So that's an algebraic reason of why to consider claim models and projectives. I did the calculations for the symmetric group, but I think that the claim models have a lot. Models have a lot in this group in order to think what is the group structure. So we are going to denote the non-orientable multiplier by this. And something that my friend Gustavo will talk is that this is isomorphic to the second homology of G with coffee in F2. And I remember that we were stuck in this kind of non-orientable hoffe formula. So I decided to make calculations. So I decided to make calculations before we know that. And when I make calculations, suddenly they appear some kind of direct zooms of Ceta2. So at the end, Gustavo came out with this and it verifies my calculation. So that was a really nice surprise. And just to remember, you can use universal confusion theorem to calculate the second homology with confusions in F2. So that's why. In F2, so that's why C datu appears. So just a little reminder: remember these seven relations that Carlos talked about. We are going to use these four relations most of the time. And now let's go. Let's make calculations for the cyclic group. So, for the cyclic group, you start by assuming. Cyclic group, you start by assuming that it's generated by some element x. And then something that happens, well, no, the first question is: what happens with the torus elements with entries in cita ns? All the elements are x to some exponent. And it happens that this is equivalent to one. And this not only happens for the cyclic groups, this happens for every group if you have the same leather. Leather with different exponents. So, when you ask, and what happens with the clean bottles? The clean bottles, because of the relations that Carlos talked about, you can discompose this in two projectives. The first one has monodromy x to the i, and the second has monodromy x to the minus i by the protocol x to the j. And this is a key volume. And this is a key volume. Simply, you can group these two projectives and simply sum the exponents. So you will only get x to the j. And then you have these sequences of plain bottles, torus, and projectives. So because of these two things, you can simply think in the product of projectives and with the same. And with the same element with different exponent. So you can group them all and simply assume their exponent. So to this to belong to the Norienta Wassure multiplier, this has to belong to the kernel. So you consider the square of this. You have x to the 2k will be equivalent to 0 mod n. So you dbs in two cases. You have the case where n is even and the case. Where n is even and the case where n is odd. So, of course, if n is even, you can divide by two and you get one generator. And in the odd case, you only have the trivial element. So, a little summary. The non-ientable SURE multiplier for the cyclic group is zeta 2 if n is even and zero if n is odd. And the generator is this. So, the generators are projective. Generators are projectives. And now, what happens with the dihedral group? With the dihedral group, you have this really useful group presentation, the group with two generators and these relations. And you can think of the rotation by 2pin, simply the note this by c. And it happens that you can represent every element of the dihedral group by a product. Hero loop by a product of A by C to some exponent, or simply by C to some exponent. So while Carlos and Milio think what happens if you have torus with entries in the dihedra group, they show these relations. And what this relation to is that every torus can be reduced to only one torus to one exponent. And this exponent. To one exponent, and this exponent you can include in this in the in the monodromy simply by exponentially C. So now one asks what happens with the non-orientable things. And you have claim borders and also you have projectives, and you can easily verify these relations. Relations. For example, to show from relation 6 to relation A, you simply use the relation that is in the non orientable shear multiplier, this relation, and simply set x equals 1. And you will get that this is equivalent to this. And you can decompose this in two projectives, one with monodromy one and the second with monodromy. One and the second with model me AC to the J. And remember, you throw out to the trash all the elements that were just simply projected with a trivial bundle. So at the end, you will simply get this. And for the other relation, it's really similar, the process. And now for these three relations, it follows because you can group these two projectives simply by a product. The first is the first projected, and the second is. Is the first projected and the second is simply the product of these two elements. So you cancel the A because you can commutate these elements, but you only have to change the exponent of C. So you get AC to the I and the secondary will be C to the J minus I. And this, because of the seven relation, is equivalent to this. So nice. And the other relations. And the other relation follows very similar. So now you can reduce the claim models, and you know what happens with the product of projectives. So what happens if you have arbitrary sequences? It will happen that you can reduce everything to a sequence to an element of the form simply a torus by some exponent and the other element will be. And the other element will be simply a projective, with S is an element of the Hederal group. So, how you show this? Simply reduce everything to projectives. And if you reduce everything to projectives, you know by these relations that when you group two projectives, you get a torus and one less projective. So eventually, if you start from left to right, you will get one projective. Get one projective. So there is also an additional relation that I want to talk about. And if you use this relation and set X equals C to the I and J equals to A to the C to the J and Zeta equals A C to the K, then you have that this then you have that this should be equivalent to this. And when you are exponentially a letter, it simply takes the concuja in both entries. So in this case, in the first entry, you get this, and in the second, you get this. Again, you can discompose this into claim models. I say into projectives. And you can commutate C to the K. Commutate C to the K, the C to the minus I simply by changing the sign. So you will get A to the C K plus I. And then by the relations that I mentioned before, this is equivalent to this torus by this. Simply, this exponent is the same, and this exponent you simply take Um take is k minus 2i minus j plus 2i. So you will simply get k minus j. And again, use the relations of the last lemma and you will get this. And then you cancel these both terms and you will simply get this. This can be really natural, but the first time that I did use this back was with That I did use this pack was with this relation. I remember that when I started working in this project with Carlos, we write a lot of relations and there was this relation that talks about a quibarian client Teco FT. So then we reduce the relations to only seven because we think that this seven generate all the relations that we first write. But then I do. But then I do everything only with this relation and other simple relations. But then Carlos told me, this relations should be a consequence of these seven relations. And I try to do this, but I cannot see how. So if you are a bit bored or in the boss, you can try to show this relation with the first seven relations that I talk about. But at the end, I don't even need this relation. I just only need this one relation. Because if it was a consequence of the other several relations, then I should be able to deduce this relation, but only with the seven relation, and that was true. So I think that this relation helps to deduce, well, should be a consequence of this. So now let's suppose that n is at. N is at. So remember, all the elements were just simply a torus by a projective. And the projective, because it's a dehydrogruf, can be of this kind or this type. So for this to belong to the non-orientable shoe multiplier, this has to belong to the kernel. So you simply remember it's a torus in the delhedra. So is two times rotation, the monoramic. And then The monoramic. And then you will simply get this is equal to C to the R by C to the 2s. So it's simply C to the 2 by R plus S. This has to be equivalent to 0 mod N. And for the other, it's very similar, but these elements are torsion too in the Deherlog group. So you will only have 2L equivalent to 0 maten. L equivalent to zero matter. So, because any such the greatest common divisor of this is one. So, these two systems is simply L equivalent to zero matn and the other is R plus S equivalent to zero moden. So, all the elements are simply these elements. And because you can include the exponent in the torus by exponent in the first entry, then you get C to the N, and this is trivial. To the n, and this is trivial, so you will simply get ACI. And for the other elements are of this form. And now, because of the additional relation, all of these elements are equivalent to one, because this system has all solutions by visual identity if n is at. And now, what happens with the other type of with the other type of elements you can simply multiply by that type of elements and because that elements are trivial this is equivalent to this and then again use to lemma and you will get that this is equivalent to this so what this tells is that this happens for every m in the integers so all the projectives are related so you only have two elements the trivial one and these projectives and obviously this will be a generator Will be a generator. And now let's attack the if n is even. So again, you have these two cases that were that were also in the odd case, but now you have two additional cases because you can divide by two. So the elements are of this form, or this form, or this, or this. And if x is even, then these elements are trivial. In this case, this doesn't happen for all the. this doesn't happen for all the for all x because you are thinking if n is even so only the this this system has only solution if x is even so only that the even elements gets trivial and and these elements should be related to a by the same process that we did before and now what happens with the others if x If x, another element, and another element j is odd, then their sum should be even. So this implies again, you consider the product of these two elements and you use two lemma, group this and then use relation nine and then relation ten, and you will get this. And because this is even, this should be equivalent to one. equivalent to one. So what this tells is that this should be equivalent to the inverse of this, because one can easily show that these elements are of torsion too. So you get that all odd elements are related. And now what happens if J is odd? What happens with the projectives? You know that J You know that j plus one is even, so it should be related to a. So this should be equivalent to this product because a is related with ac to the j plus one. And then again by two lemma, this should be equivalent to this. And because the exponent is odd, it should be related to also this one. So this at the same time by the two lemma is equal to this and this because the other elements were related should be equivalent to this. And then so cancel A and you simply see that all the projectives if I is odd are related. And what happens if X is even? And what happens with the other types of elements? Happens with the other types of elements, then you simply separate these two projectives and you know that these elements are trivial, so this should be equivalent to this, and for exot, this should be equivalent to this by the same process. So at the end, you get A elements, and one can see that they can be generated by these elements, but also by only projectives, by this, this, and this. But I chose these generators because there was a There was a funny geometric interpretation about this generator. So, a little summary: you have that in-orientable Washure multiplier for the Dehedral group is zeta, is the direct sum of three copies of zeta2, if n is even, and if n is odd, it's only one theta2. And these are the elements in the odd case, and in the case, these are the elements. And finally, use a little group table. Use a little group table. And if I didn't make any mistake, this should be also the direct group table of the direction of three copies of CETA2. You can see that it's abelian, that all the elements are torsion two. And also that the elements that I talk are the generators. And these are the reference. And now my
