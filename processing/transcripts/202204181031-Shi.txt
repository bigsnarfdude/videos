Also, our localization for some almost periodic creators. So, you can think the floor is yours. Okay, thank you. First, I would like to thank the organizers for invitation. The title of my talk is the Large Morsel Ateration and Power Localization for Some Almost Periodic Operations. So, let's start with our main model. The model is a linear operator defined on the latest Z D. It has It has two parts. The T5 part is a tobacco operator with a simple file. The file has a parallel decay with s pollen minus s. The dialogue part di satisfies some non-resident condition that is a difference of di and dj has a power low bond in m minus j. This is just a different condition. This is our main model. This is our main model. Then, the main purpose of this talk is to show if S is strictly larger than top plus D and epsilon is small enough, we have the following. At first, if the long resonant condition is satisfied for a single sequence di, then there are another sequence di prime and the unitary operators Q, so that H prime can be reduced to the given dialogue operator via Q. Operate VLQ. As a result, H prime would have pupound spectrum with polynomial decay eigenfunctions, or equivalently, the power logarization. Second, if the long-resistant conditions is satisfied in a neighborhood with a sequence di, then the original operator H can be reduced to a new dialogue operator and then has the power localization. So, to prove those results, we will employ in the last. Results we will employ the Lashmorsel iteration method. May I ask a quick question? So, by parallel localization, you only mean the upper bound or do you mean the lower bound as well? It's up bound. I mean, it means up. Okay, so in principle, it could be faster. Okay, yeah, okay. So So for convenience, we will present our results in the setting of translation invariant Balah algebra introduced by Pusher. First, let B be a Balach algebra or complex sequence with the point-wise addition and multiplication. We also assume the sequence of identical Y is united with this algebra. Then we can define the translation sigma j only sequence algebra in a standard way. Algebra in a standard way, we call the algebra is translated translation invariant if the long is preserved and only translation. Finally, we define the long resonance conditions associated to this algebra given tau and gamma positive cause sequence pi is a tau gamma digital sequence if p minus sigma i p belong to the algebra and its inverse satisfy the power of upper bound. Power of upper bound. Obviously, this is just the defined condition. Next, we will define top list operator unless algebra. For the complex infinite matrix capital A, is case dialogue is defined as sequence A i minus key. A top list operator is just an infinite matrix whose dialogues are all in the algebra. algebra. Denote the side to all topology operators by the capital M. Since we will deal with power position, we can define a sovereign law for a topology operator via the following sum involving a polynomial width denoted by capital MS the space of all topological operators with the file as long. Finally, we also use dialogue operators in the following. So for operator A, we denote by out Operator A, we denote by outline either mid dialogue part or A. Analyze preparations, we cannot state our main result. The first theorem says that fixed positive data alpha 0, Tau, and Gamma assume that T belong to the space M alpha plus for delta with alpha being data with alpha being strictly larger than alpha zero plus tau plus seven data and di is a tau gamma distal sequence then there is some small epsilon zero so that if t is small enough then there are operator q and dialog operator d so that the original operator plus d can be reduced to the given dialog operator The given dialogue operator via Q. In addition, QQZ immers and D satisfy the following estimates. That means Q is close to the identity operator and D is a small dialogue operator. Finally, if both T and Di are emissions, then Q is unitary. This is our first main result. We make some remarks. Since delta and alpha 0 minus d over 2 can be arbitrarily small, we can actually assume t belongs to the s sublip space with s being strictly larger than tau plus d over 2. Second, the above theorem is in fact an inverse type argument. However, if we have a stronger non-resident condition, we will have Long residential condition, we will have the following director theorem. This theorem says that under assumption CMY and assume further the distal property is satisfied for a sequence in a neighborhood of di, then if t is small enough, the original operator t can be original operator t plus the dialog operator can be reduced to a new dialogue operator in the sublife space with. In the sublife space with similar estimates as in theorem one. Furthermore, if both T and Di are emissions, then Q is unitary. This is a direct theorem. Now, we will apply the bow two theorems to some concrete long-range operators. Consider now the operator T5 plus DI with the symbol Ï† has a power line. Symbol phi has a power law decay for some positive s. It is easy to see t phi belongs to the s prime, so left space if s prime is strictly smaller than s minus d over 2. Then we have the following query. Fixed positive alpha 0 top gamma and delta. If S satisfies the following low If S satisfies the following loan bound and di is the toe gamma distal sequence, then for t small enough, there is a sequence near di prime, near di so that it prime can have a power localization with the eigenfunctions f satisfy the polynomial estimates for any t and i. This is the so-called power localization. We also make some remarks. If in addition both dr and t are permission, then the spectral H prime is equal to that of the closure of DI in R. In the present, we have a low bond S strictly low. bond S strictly larger than D plus Tau on the hoping state. In contrast, in the NS model with the long-range hoping T5 by using a fractional moment method, Azima Michinov proved polarization with a hoping decay with S being strictly larger than D. Okay, next. As before, we also have a direct query on the power location. Direct query on the power localization for the original operator if the long-reson condition is satisfied in the neighborhood of DI. This is the application. In the following, we will introduce some almost periodic potentials which satisfy the aforementioned non-resilient condition. We first recall the limit periodic To recall the limited periodic potential introduced by pusher. Dilute by L the space of all complex sequence with pair to the power of n. I define L prime be the closure of L in the supreme norm, then L prime becomes a translation invariant of button algebra. In fact, Pusha has constructed in this algebra the sequence di and di prime, which are all digital sequences. Which are all digital sequences for L prime. Furthermore, di is dense in the interval 0 to 1, where d prime is dense in the counter site contained in the interval. This is pushes limp autic potential. Hence, applying our result to push the potential would lead to the existence of. To the existence of long-range limit periodic discrete operators that has power localization and of which the spectrum is either an interval or a counterside. For a more recent study of limited periodical shorting operates, we refer to the works of Avila, Dominic, Gang, Filmer, Lukic, and others. This is the limp periodical potential example. We then pass. We then pass to the quasi-periodic potential case. Typically, the quasi-periodic sequence is collected with certain functions. Since our main result is presented in sequence valuable algebra, it needs to make some changes to passing from functions algebra to the sequence one. So we briefly recall the abstract setup of pusher. We use the notation. The notation. Then let f be a translation invariant bio algebra of functions defined on some locally compact group or complex plane. The translation invariance is defined in a standard way. Now we can get a sequence translation invariant by hydrograph from F by the following. That is, A belong to B if and only if z is f belong to f such that ei is equal to f o a dot omega. A dot omega. The low-mo then can be obtained from taking the influencer F. This is a function color hydropro. Fellow, we can define a standard defining condition for the omega. This is just a standard defining condition. We then turn to the application of our previous. Then turn to the application of previous theorem in the function Bala algebra case. The query says that under the assumption query flow assume f belong to the capital F, the function Bala algebra, and satisfies the non-resented condition given by equation y. Then, for T5 is small enough, there is another F prime near F so that the prime near f so that the operator t5 plus m prime n omega has a power localization. If in addition the condition equation one holds true in a neighborhood of f, then the orange operator t5 plus f dot omega has popularization. As an application, we recall the example of Benniset, Lemma, and Scopola. Let HI be a space of all holomorphic functions of periodic one defined functions of periodic one defined on the strip dr or ysr with a standard algebra norm define further pr the space of meromorphic functions of periodic one and with the following estimates this is the function space of bandicide lemma and scopola it is important that the function It is important that the function in PR is stable and analytic functions perturbation. Moreover, it was proved both the complex exponential function, which was studied by Salak and the tangent function, which was studied by Grand Pier Fischer McBranch, belong to the function space PR. The tangent potential is also called the Merander potential. Calls a memory potential. So applying our result in each setting implies that the power localization with potentials in PI. Finally, we would like to mention that there are extensive study of marine type models. See, for example, the works of Figurine Pastor, Simon, Chitumoskaya, Liu, Katikovsky, Palewitsky, and Schutenbig, and others. This is our This is our example of quasi-periodic potential. Then, we turn to the discontinuous quasi-periodic potential. Hope correct. Let f dilute a set of all functions of periodic one and bounded variation with the algebra lump. Then the f becomes a translation invariant of balanced algebra. invariant balance algebra law. It was proved by Craig that a function x mod one belongs to this function space and satisfies the non-resent condition. So we apply again our result to this example and obtain the following. That is there are long range operators with potential near the x mod y function that has a power localization and function that has a power localization and of which the spectrum is equal to the interval zero to one. We should remark that an important generation of the model one function called Leipzig's monitoring function was provided by Jim Mosky and Kachi Kovschi. Surprisingly, they proved the all-long zero coupling and syndicalization for one-dimensional shorting operator with such potentials. Those are our main results. In the following, I will provide the idea of the proof. The main idea of the proof is simply for that of crack to diagonalize the infinite matrix via KM tab iteration. Due to the loss of derivatives in the polynomial case, we employ instead a Lashmoso iteration method. Attitude method. As is well known, the KM method was first introduced by Dilabo Sina in the field of almost periodic operations. This method has been significantly improved by a lot of people, such as Chulawiski, Dilabo, Ellas, and others, to study localization for more generous most quasi-periodic potentials. For comparation, we recall the PM scan crack in the exponential long-range hoping keys. The exponential long is defined by representation. The key point is always proof is to find the sequence of Q key and dialog operator dk minus one so that the new dialog part plus t. Uh, plus t can be reduced to the given dialogue operator di plus a remainder r k. Of course, we expect that r k tends to the other and q k q k and the sum of dl tend to q and d respectively in the exponential log. The q k and the d k minus 1 are constructed iteratively. This is the correct scale. The correctness scale. Due to the small divisor at a step key to key plus one, one has a loss of regularity from Zhou K to Zhou K minus data for arbitrary positive data. Fortunately, in the exponential long keys, the super-exponential smallness of Newton's error together with the distal property of DI permit a loss of exponential small regularity. This design would Regularity. This line would lead to a positive low bond after infallitor iteration steps. As a result, the localization may be established. It turns out that the low of the remainder is super exponentially small. This is a scam, miss scam or crack. This is not the case for polynomial decay one in which a large most type activation is required. Large more step attitude is required. So, in the polynomial case, a bulky m procedure would lead to a loss of regularity from s to s minus top at each step for the fixed top. Now, we can imagine if we start with a regular regularity s, then it will lose all the regularities in some finite iteration steps. To over this difficulty, we first take a small operation on the operator T and then aiming to establish the reducibility of small operator, the sum of Ti plus deluged operators. Here, Ti is obtained from small synth procedure with small scale O theta i, which we choose to be exponential one. Of course, eventually we need the sum or small. Eventually, we need the sum or also the smallest of Ti converges to the original T. This is our scale. For the choices of scale of small operator, we would like to mention that the original small scale was large. See also discretization by Homanda is all powerload one with a exponent less than one. Musa used a silver exponent. Moser used a silver exponential one. The exponential scale was first introduced by Klema in dealing with the global existence of long linear wheel equation. This is about the smoothing operator. In the present of smooth operator S sigma seta is just is defined just from removing keys dialogues with key. Key dialogue with key is larger than CTA. It is standard. The other key part of the large moral iteration is the so-called team estimate. Team estimate in our setting is just the interpolation inequality of the polynomial log and its generation to product operation. This is our This is our team estimate. Precisely, that alpha zero is larger than d over 2 z for any s larger than alpha 0. x y belongs to a sublift space ms. The s long with a product is bounded by the right-hand side of where q0 depends only on alpha 0 and q1 depends only on alpha 0 and s. And S moreover, for any and the product of Xi is bounded above by a linear representation of Xi S, we should note that there is an extra exponential larger effect in the inequality, that is n times the nth power of C0. We remark that the similar law was previously used by Bert and Bully in a different setting, that is, construction. In a different setting, that is construction of quasi-periodical solutions for non-linear shorting equations. Later also provided a multi-scale analysis proof of power localization for random operators using properties of this law. However, all those proofs rely on Green's functions as the means via multi-scale analysis. Last we introduce our military. Next, we introduce our main iteration theorem. The estimates are performed in a regularity interval from alpha 0 to alpha 1. Intermediate regularity alpha is set to indicate the decay. So the main iterations since therefore t is small enough. They are WK, R key, QK, and dialog dk minus 1, so that the smallest operate plus a dialog operate can be reduced to a given dialogue operate with a remainder R key. Operates with the remainder R key. We also have the following important estimates of both operates with S in the interval alpha 0 to alpha 1. This is our main activation theorem. We should remark that the remainder R key is exponential small rather than super exponential small. Where the estimates are obtained in the interval, we prove the convergence of scam in the S long with S equal to alpha minus top minus SEM data. Then we sketch the proof. The proof is lengthy and only deal with at least depth. Since the time limitation, I will skip the details. This is our proof. This is our proof of the iteration theorem. A fair remark: We revisit the low bound on the regularity of the hopi. The bound could be explained as follows. The factor tau from loss of regularity due to small divisions, where the factor d over 2 comes from the Timu inequality. We think this log bound is optimal. So this. So, this is my talk. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much for this talk. We have time for questions. Does anybody either in one of the So basically, your distal condition means like absence of resonances. So your functions if for quasi-periodic case are like x mod one, right, or e to xi x. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And you just mentioned that you think your condition is optimal, right? Tau plus D, right? Yes, I think it is optimal. So, but do you have any results in the other direction? No, I haven't. Okay. Ah, wait, so tau plus G over two, I kind of mean that I saw. I kind of mean that I saw the theorem was top plus G, no? Because this is our abstract theorem, where alpha is larger than top plus D over two. If we consider top is operated with a symbol, then there is extra D over two loss. I see, I see, okay. I see. Okay. I see. Okay. Do you have any other questions for the speaker? I'm sorry. May I ask? I didn't quite understand. Well, first, do you have more information on top? And I didn't quite understand why it's D over two and not D. Could you repeat, please? Please, sorry, I didn't quite understand why this alpha is bigger than d over two and not d, because I thought I had seen some theorem where it was alpha was bigger than something that was bigger than d over two plus two plus d over two. This maybe explain as follows. Since in the abstract theorem, we assume t belongs to the term. Assume T belong to this space. But here, if we can see the T5, which gives with a simple phi, then there is an extra loss of D over 2. So finally, we should larger than top plus D. than top plus d in this case and top plus d over two is an abstract case in this case and um here to is something positive or do you do you have some um it can be anything oh you can uh you you to is just as a duty Tau is just the exponent in the defendant condition. Typically, we require tau to be is larger than the dimension d. It's a fixed is a fixed parameter in the theorem. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the question and uh let us thank thank the speaker again. Let us thank the speaker again.
