And I would like to tell you something today about some work that will hopefully appear on the archive in the next couple of weeks. And it is about relation between two single objects and in particular between TFTs. So, for topological, this is short for topological field series. So, in the series. So in the theory of topological field theories, there's one major result or conjecture that allows us how to construct examples of such topological field series or as classifies them, which is known as property known to probably many people in the audience who just call for some hypothesis. And this is extremely useful and I would like to use it today. To use it today, so I will recall it. So I think it's more accurate to call it still a conjecture, but let me still mention some names. So I think it was proposed by ASM Jolen, then there's a group sketch by Jacob During, then there are other works by Ajana Francis, and I think there's work in progress by Christian Macris. Christian Macris is a lot of like. And this result is extremely powerful in general, so it works for any symmetric monoidal infinity n academy. And um And the result tells me that I have an equivalence between space of symmetric monodal infinity n functors from a certain infinity n category called the n-dimensional border borders and category. You see and this category is equivalent to a subspace of my category. A subspace of my category, namely the space of so-called fully dualizable objects. These are certain objects in my category that satisfy certain dualizability conditions that are extremely restrictive and finite. We'll see instances of this in a moment. But first, let me comment a bit on this result. So, though, many of you have seen variants of this ballism categories. The idea is to put in this category has objects zero. This category has objects, zero-dimensional manifolds, and then morphisms, one-dimensional manifolds with boundary, which we think, and higher-dimensional manifolds with higher-dimensional morphisms. And the objects in here is what we call fully extended frame teachings. And so then, what this real life tells us, to put up, to create such a functor, what we need to study Need to study are the fully dualizable objects in our infinity n categories. So if we can identify what fully dualizable objects are, we get fully extended. So we don't necessarily know how to compute it, but at least we know that there exists. Okay, then let me start with some examples. So one example that is probably familiar to many of us who've seen one of the Probably familiar to many of us who've seen one-dimensional TFTs, is I first have to give you some target, namely the target of some symmetric normal category, which is given by the category vector spaces, which is using the product. And then one can ask what are the fully utilizable objects in this category? So when is the vector space fully realizable? And it turned out that in this setup, And it turned out that in this setup, this fully dualizability condition reduces to dualizability. And which is a standard fact in linear algebra is that a vector space is fully dualizable if and only if it has finite dimensions. So we see that this fully dualizability condition cuts down, it encodes some fineness condition, namely It encodes some fineness condition, namely all the dimensions rows of all the infidimensional examples. We will today talk about a two-dimensional example. So, first of all, maybe some motivation. Why should this have anything to do with two-seagle things? So, we have already seen this picture of triangulations that Toby mentioned and Walker have drawn in this talk. And there are also designs in these directions, state-sung constructions by Luka. State-sen constructions by Lukarov Bakranov and also constructions open TFTs by Work Skirmin. And so there are already results of two relations of two-dimensional GFTs between two single objects. Moreover, there are also some things that hint of a relation between these two single objects and maybe even three-dimensional CFTs that are extensions of these two-dimensional examples I will discuss today, namely. Will discuss today, namely one example of a two-sigl object that has not appeared today, or at this conference, is that I could start construct a two-sigil set from any semi-simple monoidal category. This construction is called the Gordon nerve. And the semi-simple monoidal categories feature prominently in the study of three-dimensional TFTs, so what you are virus limits. So one might guess that there is some relation. So therefore, let me give you some target. Let me give you some target category. This is some general constructions which construct two-dimensional symmetric monodic categories, which is called the Merida category. And this construction case is input as a sufficiently nice symmetric monoidal one category. And the example I choose, I denote by this symbol and the particular And to complete this, I also have to give some products. So, what is this selective number one category? Its objects are finite C-linear abeyan categories. So, it's C-linear Abbey categories, which are equivalent to categories of modules of fine-dimensional algebras. And the one-morphisms are given by right-exact factors. This is one category, it becomes symmetric monoidal with the so-called lean-tender product. And for this, And for this, for this one cat, for this semantic model of one category, I can form this Gurita construction. And I get. What is that symbol? What is that Tinder product? That's the box tender product. Like the what you usually write in. What is the superscript? F for finite and rex for right exact. It's PD citation. Rex form? Right exact. So morph isn't a right exact finite. Right exact, so morphisms or right exact functors between the categories. So finite cold map preserving functors. Okay, and this then becomes a symmetric monodel 2 category. And so, what are the objects? Objects are not the same as the object. Um algebra objects in this semantic monoidal one category are plugged in. So these are particular examples of monoidal categories. Then the one morphism between two such algebras is not is not a Is not an algebra morphism, but if you take two algebras, we think of a bi module, an AB bi module, as giving us the morphisms of A to B. So M is an AB bi module, again in this category. And further, we need to specify what the two morphisms are. Are between two bimodules, and the two morphisms are that are bimodule homomorphisms. Are bimodules pointed? No, they're not. So they're not easy, or they're just bi-modules. But they're not easy or they're just bimodes. They're just bi modules, yeah. Um and um And I mentioned some relation to three-dimensional TSTs. One could enhance this construction to give me a symmetric model three category by using that this category I started with can be enhanced to a symmetric model two category by studying, by adding the natural transformations. So this is naturally two category, but I've forgotten some structure to get to end up with this new two category. New two category. That how the two category roughly wood set what's the symmetric product? The symmetric male product is just the point-wise product. So it's just the bias product to hydrogen to hydrogen is here. Want some sort of a condition for module to be projected on this module? Sorry, Amazon AB module win In this category, so it's a biomodule object in this one in this schematic model one category, what do you mean? Okay, any other questions? Now, since I have defined what kind of two category or two category the game will play in, I need to tell you what are the reliability conditions. And to formulate them, I need to introduce some definition, namely what it means for an object in a symmetric model, for an algebra to be rigid. So there are, and you might have heard it from the And you might have heard it from the name of a category when a category is rigid. If every object has a left and right dual, this is the same thing, but it turns out that this is actually a two-category notion, which I will now define more. So we considered B some symmetric number two category. And this symmetric monolith 2 category has an underlying symmetric monolith 2 comma 1 category, sorry, by forgetting non-vertible two morphisms and then And then an algebra A in D is called, let's say, D rigid. If first, so if you don't like arbitrary symmetric one or the two categories, just think of the two symmetric. Two categories, just think of the two symmetric model two category of categories. This is totally fine. So, then this algebra would be the monoidal category. But this algebra comes with a multiplication, which I denote by mean. And the first condition that I demand is that this multiplication has the right adjoint in the symmetric model by. In the symmetric model, like as you can read. And then these algebra objects also, because I consider them in a 2,1 category, are not strictly associative, but they come with a datum of an associator. And for this notion of rigidity, I need a further condition on these writer joints to be. These LiDAR joints to be compatible with the associated. So this will give me the second condition. So I have this associativity square. So I can either first multiply and take the identity on the second component and multiply them. Or I can do the opposite. And this diagram commutes up to an associative indeed two isomorphism, which tells me that this tells me that this commutes. And then whenever I have such a square, so this is again the multiplication, where some of the morphisms, like in this case the vertical morphisms, have both right adjoint, I can construct an associated square. Can construct an associated square by looking at the right agenda. And it's not clear that this associated square again commutes. But there exists a canonical choice of a two-morphism which could describe me the commutativity of this diagram, which is called the vertical back-Schibali transform. Similarly, there is the same, I could do the same with horizontal morphisms and get a similar construction, and then I would get what is called the horizontal fiction. It's amazing, yeah, but it's amazing, yeah. So let me introduce what the so the So, the vertical vector value transform for the violet diagram is constructed as follows. So, we go along this route and we would like to end up along this route. So, we start with mutant identity on A, compose it with pre-composed with this writer joint. Then we would like to end up, say, down here with mu r composed with mu. So what we first do is we use this adjunction and use the unit of this adjunction to end up here. Sorry, I think I'm a bit lost in the dialogue in particular since I'm so far away. So the MR composing with mu is rare. Sorry, it's not a mu R, it's a right-to-the-mu? Yes, but the downstair thing where you want to go is the red if it's too much. So if we go along the violet, so we go first up here. Violet, so we go first up here and then we go along this way. Yes, this is this is this morphism, yes, and we would like to end here, which would be then this composite. Ah, thank you. And yeah, and now I describe a canonical way how we get from here to here by a two-morphens. Thank you. So, yeah, this now is already our Russian diagram, so we can use alpha to So, we can use alpha to do an exchange, to exchange this part. And I now do two steps at once. So we would get a copy of identity A tensor mu from alpha, but I use the properties of the functority standard product to pull this together. So I directly have the entity paid and the And the view of those views u r. And on this last factor, we can now apply the co-unit to add up here. So this is the co-unit of the one junction of this unit. And this composite two morphism that looks down here, this is called the this is what we call the vertical vector electrons. This is what we call the vertical backshaver transform. And you can use a similar analysis with the right adjoint horizontal morphism to get the horizontal back shearing transform. And there's a condition that we... Let me suggest that. Someone over Zoom is. It wasn't just this office, was actually a sticker. Can you hear us? Yeah, yeah, I missed the job to like say that I'm missing out. I just want to. I just want to look at your number under. While this has happened, do you mind if I ask a question? We'll just talk over this. So in case D is in a two category of categories, right? Then algebra objects should be a minoidal category. Yes. What do you have an example of a rigid minoidal category? What does it mean to be rigid in a single example? Like I'm having trouble imagining what a right that joint is the multiplication minoidal category. Thank you. Like, I'm having trouble imagining even what are right at points, usual political math. Okay, there's standard examples are cureable when you assume that demonetal are somewhat presentable. For example, if you take vector spaces and your tender product is tolerant-preserving, then you always have a right-hand joint that exists. And then these are standard examples of things that are rigid, but then they are usually rigid in this context of a B and categories. Context of the B and categories. The more natural context we consider this rigidity structure. And that really boils down to the statement that your objects have left and right ones. Wait, sorry, so can you say that again? So in case, so you're saying what the category of vector spaces? I mean, the category of vector spaces has a code of preserving. So the tender part is called it preserving both entries, right? Yes. So it has a write-it job. Ah. But then, okay, I guess maybe I'll think harder on that write-it testing. Write it to a testing. You can write it down in terms of certain cohens if you like, in this case, but yeah. Thank you. Yeah, so this is what we call rigid. Sorry, you wrote down something about vertical and horizontal back chevalier, but the conditions that the back chevalier, vertical and horizontal, are true, I assume. And And then the result that we have is a theorem by Douglas John McPries and Snyder. And Snyder, which tells me that an algebra pain in this category of finite V and C L categories is two dualizable, or is fully dualizable, I mean. In this Morita category I've mixed observation. Let an algebra A be rigid, sorry. Um, be rigid, sorry um um then it is fully realizable in the real time. So we learned from this theorem that to understand this full-diasability to get two diabetes. This full diasporability to get two-dimensional TFTs, we just have to understand how rigidity works for certain monodic categories. And how now two single objects come into the play via categorifications of this Hall algorithm construction we saw yesterday. We have seen instances of this many times. They have two single objects. Many times that two single objects are algebra objects in span. So we can use monodial functions to transport them to other categorical contexts. For example, we have a functor which is monoidal, which goes, which I denote like this, where this denotes small, this is small, v denotes a category of five-dimensional vector spaces. This goes from the category. This goes from the category of spans of finite groups, essentially finite group rates, as we had yesterday, to this category of finite tilinear categories. And this functor is monoidal. So, what it does, it associates to such a group weight the category of functors into vector spaces, and if I Vector spaces, and if I have a span, I have to tell you what happens to the one facing lag and to the other facing lag. So, first, I have to turn one morphism around. This will be done by pullback of functors, and the other one will be given by left-card extension. What's happening? So the punchline is we can use this functor to transport two single objects in this setting and ask if they are too dualizable in this category. In this case. We need one of the legs to be finite. Yeah, I assume that all appropriates are finite. But then you are under the category, you understand here what it means to be rigid, this notion of having duals. And then you have to do algebra to understand maybe under which conditions these objects are rigid. But it turns out that this question is somewhat hard and subtle, and it's hard to find an answer this way. An answer this way. But there is a way around this, namely, there's a theorem which tells me that there exists a lift of the above functor. Two a symmetric monod of the two functor. So we first write down the result. This is a serum by Morton. And that's And this now goes from this category of file spans, which is a two-category that Toby talked about in the discussion section a bit, of finite group reads, to this two-category of, to the natural two-categorical structure of finite light exact sinearing categories. And what do we learn from this? So, as I said, rigidity is a two-category. rigidity is a two-categorical notion. So it's a notion in a symmetric model two category. So what I can do is I can, it's preserved under any symmetric model two functor. So instead of asking when is the category I obtain the algebra obtained from the single space when is this rigid, I can equivalently ask when is the single object, when is the two single space rigid in this category. And this reduces the problem of doing algebra to Doing algebra to the problem of understanding spans and doing calculations with single spaces, which is much more tractable, at least for me. And this is a result I want to present, that I have, I've studied this. So this is now in the context of an arbitrary infinity category with limits. And X is some two single object in C. Then the result is rigid in this category of by spans of C. So I have to check conditions that I get on the spans, that certain two-morphileness will be equivalences, which give me three. Equivalences, which give me further conditions. And it turns out that these conditions are nothing abstract and that don't appear, but it's something really strong. Namely, this two-single object is rigid, if and only if this implicit object X is already the group read object. So if you've seen seven So we have seen several instances of being Siegel, two Siegel, higher Siegel, but being a groupback object is the weakest of all. That is the strongest condition of all. Because we have pullback diagrams for a lot more decompositions. So what this tells us is that from the perspective of TFTs, that if you want to understand, that if you want to construct the study two-dimensional. The study of two-dimensional fully extended TFTs from these two single objects. We originally wanted to have examples coming from Hall algebras or something, Kaliberfa and Hall algebras, which are really interesting and all the structures. But it turned out that these are not the examples you get. The examples you get are really all coming from groupweight objects. So the instance that I was not able to solve this algebra problem was not was not a coincidence, but it was a structural result. Instructional result. Thank you. Questions? So I think I'm missing two things which similar in flavor. So you said, let's say for the things which are still on the board, you said to study the rigidity, I can as well study the rigidity on the left-hand side. Those sides in originity on the left-hand side. But I think the question is: isn't there some kind of secret definition which I didn't understand? So if you start with something rigid, for sure you get something rigid, but you could otherwise. Yeah, that's true. It's more like we're... So this answer is more conceptual. It's more conceptually that it should be. So it's more natural as we originally hear and then spoil it over. That's my perspective. It over. That's my perspective. But there could exist, maybe in some cases, examples where this is true. For this particular example, this is not the case. You can show that there's no abstraction. This is an only in this case. But you can play this game for any symmetric monodal two-functor or infinity two-functor. This all works like if you replace abelian by stable and so on. This is the same story. And then it's not completely clear to me if this is any. Not completely clear to me if this is raised this theorem by Douglas, Champa Pries and Smeyer I think. And it said also if you have something bridge it then it's fully dualizable. Once again is it if and only if? No, that's not an if and only if because being fully dualizable is a condition that is invariant under the equivalence system by two character and the notion of being rigid is not. And the notion of being rigid is not. But all examples we know come from something rigid. And also, all examples that I know in the literature that describe rigid monolithic categories that come from such convolution structures that arise from truce objects are also grouped objects. So if I have in mind like a linear So if I have in mind like a a linear category, for example, you gave the example of BECT. Uh so if I look at the you know like Uri's picture then uh what I say to the point controls everything. So you're saying that basically in the linear case if I say something that looks like a provenius algebra, like a group point algebra, that totally determines the theory in dimensions. Is that the right way to see it? Like if I think one particular thing. In one particular important thing, yeah. If you go to the you wanted to do with algebras? Yes. So, yeah, there's also Lumuit Academy for vector spaces, then objects are algebras and vector spaces. And then these are classified by semi-simple algebra. So if you give me some semi-simple algebra, you can construct it. Finally, whether I have a space X with G actually and I have Ruby construction. Yeah. Half groupway construction. Uh that's a path category construction of a category to get one signal. And it's a group light object. Uh what do you get? Uh which which category do I get? Yeah, so you get some rigid object on the right-hand side. I have to think about your particular example more more deeply. I didn't fully get what you meant, so if you yeah. Fully get what you mean, so if you yeah, we could have to worry about it. But these examples are just like truncated version of local systems categories. So what you would get are the local systems categories with some kind of way where you, like if you take some rookie object naturally, what you get is you start with two local systems and then you just push forward one, you push forward. Push forward on the you push forward on the ecosystems. That's excellent. Yeah, and as a similar result or what I should say yes, let me use it on buttons. I don't think this is worked out by the scope of this feedback. So for example, if you study frame TFTs, you get semi-simple outputs or frame-dimensional TFTs and vector spaces, or the wet-calculated vector spaces, you get semi-simple fine-dimensional alphabets. My dimension has political objects. They don't have to be provenience. You only get provenience if you demand them to be oriented in the soft spot. So, I mean, still presumably a rigid object can, let's say, counting. I understand what you're just being. Okay, so that's where the field actually to the application that has anything to do with the existence of tables. Right? Because it's not a problem. And you can define the functions. And you want a left or a right angle. So how do you construct it? Use the right terms of the notation. And then Right, because he wants Because you want to take the smallest problem. So, right, you want to say that the hong A letter B X. What this can mean actually is the hong structures A and B as just a pair of different categories to whatever it is. And I guess if it's from A tensor A to A, everything seems to be the same distance, right? No, so now this is common. Right, so yeah. So if you don't make that. So let me try that. That sounds like So new part which should be just a six part subject. So we're actually going to start with the Gamma. Wait, it's also not like the 16th. So this is definitely true. Everything inside is a category. So if I'm asking for this to go write at once. Asking for this to develop radar points, I'm asking for a mathematical standard.
