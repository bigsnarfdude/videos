And that was a great round of questions earlier. So I'll let you take away Julie with part two of PSB and Module AF Purpose of Development. Thanks for yeah, thank you. Okay, so part two. So in the first part, I was giving some general ideas of like how people think about these things and construct them. I guess what I meant to say, what I wanted to say, is that often Often, new constructions of singular surfaces rely on understanding just the old constructions of smooth surfaces. So, for example, if you're considering a surface in P3, then you modify the equation of the surface, right? Or so there's some really nice examples of all of this. Nice examples of all of this for, I want to say, these things called ice surfaces. And so, if you're, I mean, this is sort of a heads up that two people are giving talks about ice surfaces this week. So we have some good talks to look forward to. Okay. All right. Okay. So I'm going to start the second part of the talk by just stating the main theorems. Just stating the main theorems. Sorry? Oh, thank you. I surfaces. I could say what they are. K-squared is one. PG. Why am I blanking on this? Help me out, you guys. Thank you. Why I? What is I? It's Dr. H. It's supposed to eight synthesis before. Which we're going to talk about today. Which we're going to talk about today. Okay, so if you came to my Agnes talk, a good chunk of this is going to be the thing. So a good chunk of this is going to be similar to my Agnes talk that I gave in November, but I'm hoping there will be some extra time to go into some more details again in the talk. So what I'm going to do is start by just giving you our main theorem. Main theorems. And to do that, okay, so first, let me just talk, tell you, we're considering, I'm going to write hk squared. This is really just mk squared for a particular type of surfaces. I'm putting this here. Okay, so what are we considering? We're considering surfaces that are on the midter line, which satisfy this. Okay, these are all these surfaces. These are all these surfaces living along here. Okay, so this is known as the moduli space of Huricara surfaces. Why Horikawa? Well, because he completely described this moduli space for all the values of k squared. Okay, so we have results about About this moduli space and the compactification of this moduli space for all invariants, that's for all invariants along the Nasdaq line. I'm going to illustrate them just with an example, but just know that this similar construction works everywhere. So, okay, so what we've got, did not give myself enough room. Okay, I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't write down. Okay, is this okay? I'm gonna do this. I don't like to do that, but I'm doing it. Okay. To do that, but I'm doing it. Okay, so classically, the moduli space consists of two components. Okay, so I'm going to give it for 32. The moduli space where k squared equals 32 consists of two components. They are both 140-dimensional. Can you see this chalk? That's a terrible color. Especially for like red cream. Pray for your money, folks. Yuck. Okay, let's try that again. Is that better? You know, I don't think different colors are actually distinguishable. You might as well just go white and try and use notation. It's not really that distinguishable? Yeah, the different colors are not distinguishable. Blark, okay. Okay, okay, mine as well be white. Okay, alright, so this is the classical. Maybe what I'll do. Ooh, okay, alright. Okay, alright, okay. What am I gonna do? I'm gonna do this. Does that work? Okay, so what we constructed are, what we showed is that the clap, let me step back. The whole color thing threw me off. Okay. So classically, Pori Pawa showed that this module is basically consists of two disconnected components. Okay? So big question, are they actually secretly connected? Like secretly connected. We answered that question in the affirmative. They are secretly connected. But not only are they secretly connected, they're connected in a divisor D, which is not normal crossing, a general point. And we showed that there's some hidden components of higher and higher dimension in this moduli space. That was terrible. Okay. So this is So this is 100 and I think this is correct. 147 dimensional, 155 dimensional. I'll tell you a little bit more about what these components are. Okay? This is our theorem one is that they intersect. Theorem two is that we have these additional components and it is generically non-reduced. The moduli space is generically non-reduced. The moduli space is generically non-reduced in these components. Okay? This is the compact material. So the white. Okay, these additional bits here are in the compatrication. So maybe what I'll do, so this is like page 32, and maybe I'll put like this little something like this to make it clear that we're looking at the compactification. What we did not show. We did not show that this is the complete compactification. There could still be stuff floating around out there because this is the KSBA world. But we get these extra larger. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sort of trying to make it. The bar is white and the A. No, I mean the D. Yeah, the dot is in the compact. The D. Oh, this is a D. Is it the compactification? Or the inside? In the compactification. That's right. That's right. Okay. Is that clear? Yes. This is a very general question. Is the KSBA modula known to be connected? No. It is not known to be connected. Or sometimes it's known to be disconnected, right? It is, sorry? In the finite cases, do we even know that it's disconnected? Yeah, so like up here, along here, you have. Here, along here, you have just like rigid. Sorry, going to the boundary, the fundamental group can become smaller. But you have the fake projective planes, where you have single points, and then single points can be components. Okay, yeah. Zero dimensional places. That's right. So everything along here is just a little bit more. And sometimes we have components where we know that this is the full component and there will be other surfaces out there which are not the components. Surfaces out there, which are not components. So, disconnected is for sure. But in your picture, everything is connected. So, this is what I'll say is this is contained in this. Right? But probably not equal. I mean, you enter some extra components. But is it a connected component of that? It is a connected component of that. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So there are no other deformations of these. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Let me clarify. No, this is not a connected component of this. No, no, no, no. Sorry. It's not known to be a connected component. That's right. There could be some other stuff in here that I'm not showing you. Yes? Does that make sense? Yes? Okay. Okay. What's that? I said, my God, we know nothing. My God, we know nothing. That's why you should work on this so we know more. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so, um, okay, so what do I want to tell you about? I want to tell you about constructions of these things. And I want to tell you about some deformation theory. So that I can tell you a little bit about why it's not normal crossing there, for example. Can you also comment a little bit about why 32? Why 32? Y32. So, so, okay, so here, generally, we're just talking about surfaces on the Netherline. Okay, so our work works for everything there. When k squared is like 2 times an odd, I believe, then it's actually connected, the moduli space. Is this right? Am I getting this correct? It's disconnected if it's divisible by 8. It's disconnected if it's divisible by 8. It's disconnected if it's divisible by 8. That's right. So that's why we're considering a case where it is 32. Yes, sir. Okay. Good. So if I want to tell you about these examples, I need to tell you about the classical Florida college constructions. I would like to know my audience. I've played with the, I've seen the Hori Tawa construction of a surface before. Oh. Of a surface before? No. No. Okay, I've seen double covers of surfaces before. Thumbs up or thumbs down? I've seen double covers. Okay, all right. Good. That's so hard. No, no. No, okay. So I haven't seen. Okay, so these are from 1976. Okay, so here are the two key examples that we will discuss. Here are the two key examples that we will discuss. So, with the first, we take the Hertzobrook surface. Okay, it's just a quadrant. But it's the great Hertz-Brook surface. Okay, we're going to take a double cover of this, branched over. I really want colors. Okay, that's alright. It's okay. I'm just gonna pretend like you can see these just for my own. I don't really need to. You don't really need to. Okay, so branched over a curve in the linear system 6 gamma 1 plus 20 gamma 2. So we have two fibers, vibrations going this way and going this way, and this is what a curve looks like. So 3, 4, 5, 6 going that way, but then it crosses horizontal ones at 20 points. Make sense? Okay, so we take a double cover here, and we get a surface here. Here, this has k squared 32, kg is 18, 0, if I did the math correctly. And yeah, so okay, so that's one construction. Okay. And then another construction is we do something similar, but over the Heretzebrook surface, F10. And And in this case, the branch divisor breaks. So it looks like this. So, and this is the negative section. So we take a double cover of this to get some sort of a surface. Branched over B, which is in, well, it's got the negative section, but then. But then something in 5 sigma infinity plus 50 gamma. Okay, so this is how the surfaces are constructed. I just, I want to make sure that we do understand what double covers are. So because it also, I think, illustrates kind of what makes. Illustrates kind of what makes surfaces of general type. Excuse me. Is that the risky decomposition of F10? Is this a risky decomposition of F10? What do you have would be? So I've not made it. Okay. I mean, it's not. Okay. Okay. Okay, so if we haven't played some with double covers, I just want Some with double covers. I just wanted to. So I wanted to tell us what double covers. It is. Okay, it is. Thank you. Thank you. It is. All right. Okay, so let's talk about double covers. So the second construction has the same kind of numerical invariance? Yeah, so the claim is that both of these have the numerical invariance that we want. In a minute, I will write down exactly. I will write down exactly Jorge Kravo's theorem, which tells us that everything here is kind of like these, but the heretover surfaces allowed to change. Okay? Yeah? And the two different components are distinguished by whether the branch locus is connected. That's right. So this will correspond to one of the components and this will correspond to the other. Yeah? Okay. So I just want to. I just want to, I mean, I think that it's just really nice because we can to visualize this. So, geometrically, especially for those of us who haven't played with it before, I mean, we should think of double covers as exactly what a double cover is, right? For every point down here, we have two up here, except for the branch divisor. Right, so we have this special branch divisor V. Can you see that color? Yeah? Yeah? Sorry, could you clarify the linear system in the bottom there? It's five times. I think it's 330. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so geometrically, you should be thinking, okay, over every point here, I have two points except where I have this Branch divisor. Can you kind of see this picture? So here is my branch divisor upstairs, and I have two points living above a generic point down, a general point downstairs. Yeah, this is what a double cover kind of looks like. Okay? You can define this algebraically, and there's a reason I'm doing this because Doing this because our construction is like nice, it's got like actual equations. So, this is how you want to think about a double-cover algebraically. So, you have your downstairs. Yeah? You have your branch divisor, which is given by some section sigma b, yeah. Yeah. And so you take what you need, you need OB to be twice some line bundle, and you take the total space of that line bundle. This is the total space of the line bundle L. Yeah? And then, um, okay, so then what do you have here? You have the tautological section. You have the tautological section. This is like coming back. Graduate algebraic geometry. Yeah. Okay. And to define your surface in here, right, you take, well, you have your topological section Z, and you take an equation, right? So this is just Z minus, this is a math P. Map key to pull back of your equation for your branch divisor downstairs. So you get like, sorry, that's crucial because otherwise that would not be a double cover. Thank you. Yeah, so you have a surface up here, right, that's kind of like this picture in here is actually inside this line bundle here. Does that make sense? Okay, I just think it's like useful. Useful to kind of have a visualization of what's going on here. So, all right, so this is kind of an aside, but we'll come back. Okay, so what I want to just point out here: right, these are double covers. So you can use remote cover. You can use Riemann-Hurwitz right here. So you have like this vibration here of IP1s. And what do we see? Each vibration intersects the branch locus in. Six points. Yeah. So under this double cover, we get a vibration over here by now genus 2 curves. Right? And so this is like, I mean, one sort of starting way to think about surfaces of general. Starting way to think about surfaces of general type is that you have, like, this is not true for all of them, but some of the nice constructions are fibered by genus II curves. Right. Okay. All right. Are you ready for a definition? Yes. Yeah. Yes? Okay. Okay, so, I mean, the idea of, like, the idea here is that. The idea here is that we want to take this construction and modify it in some way. That's what we're going to do. So we need a definition. So standard, stable, or surface of type M is just a double cover. So it's going to be a double cover. So it's going to be a double hover F next to F M. And it needs to be branched over something so that it gives us this genus 2 vibration that we want. So B is going to be 2 inside, sorry, 6 sigma infinity plus 2a gamma. So what you can see is that right when you intersect this with gamma, your fibers. This with gamma, hit your fibers, right? Then you get six points. And so when you take the double cover, you get this GS2 vibration. Yeah? We need ample canonical class, and we need X to have semi-log canonical singularities, because otherwise, why are we calling it stable? Yeah? So, what do we do? So, what do we do? Like, we just define what we want. We just say, oh, well, right. So, of course, if B is a smooth branch divisor, then you just get a classical Horikava surface. So, the real question is, how singular can be? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay, so it's going to be classical if it's. Okay, so it's going to be classical if it just has canonical singularities. Right. Which is what the branch locus or known is, or could it be worse? The branch locus has for ADC alerts, you get. Oh, maybe like any point. Crossing transversely parallel points points to it? No. No. Just nodes. No. Just nodes? Wait. Yeah. There's ADE nodes which are simulators. Just ADE simulators. So, yeah, so the curve itself has an ADE simulator. So the branch cover will be an ADE surface. Thank you. And those are considered in the original Orikawa module space. So the theorem, I mean, we'll just state Orikawa's theorem for k-square 3. Theorem for k squared 32, this is Forecall's theorem is that, I mean, okay, is that the moduli space 32 chi, okay, so that's 19 consists of two components, H1 and H2. This is this statement that we have here. This statement that we have here. It has these two components. Where oh, did I jump the gun? I jumped the gun. Right. Okay. What do I want? I want to say that H M K squared, this is the subset, like this is the set in the moduli space that consists of these. Okay? Um. That consists of the classical ones. Okay, so he showed that it consists of these two components, where H1 has, so five pieces. Right, so this is H two, H three, uh, four, thank you. Uh four, thank you. Uh six In other words, this first component is all double covers of hereto brook surfaces of these types. Yeah, and H2 is just one type. Okay, so this is the generic point, this is like the general point. Point, this is like the general point here. This is 140-dimensional. This is also 140-dimensional. And the dimensions decrease here. I think this is correct. Yeah? So, yeah. In your definition of Bob, I maybe missed it. What's A? A is so what do we need, right? So, what you need is for the branch. So, what you need is for the branch divisor to be twice something. Right? You need it to be like 2 times L. And so, this is just saying that it's twice, it's like 3 sigma infinity plus A gamma for some A. And when you change A, when you change A along with M, then you get different surfaces. Oh, that changes K squared. Sorry? It changes K squared. A is a positive integer. A is a positive integer. So you were asking. Yeah, yeah, but but this this I guess the because I was looking at the the thing Hm k squared but I guess changing a changes k squared so that's sort of where that yeah where that appears in that because I was like that doesn't immediately depend on A, right? Okay, yeah. Is first union here like a stratification of something that's compact? So no, it's like really too the big union. Oh yes, yes, yes. Yeah, just a stratification of something that's connected. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah? Yes. Yeah, yes. And are all of these on the Nother line? Yes, thank you. So all of these surfaces, let's see. Yeah, all of these surfaces are on the Ntherline. All of Horikawa's original surfaces are on the Nakata. But even the ones, I mean, yeah, I guess this is just like this for that. Okay. Are we doing okay? Sorry, we have a basic question. Yes. Sorry, so the curly age does not parameterize the one. Is not does not parameterize the ones in the above definition. Yeah, that's right. So, I, yeah, so I sort of skipped ahead, right? So, what we're going to do is call this the non-classical ones. So, the classical and stable fun thing to say. You know, incidentally, the surfaces in there are known to be homeomorphic to the surfaces in there, but there's Homeomorphic to the surfaces in there, but they're thought that they're probably not diffeomorphic. And if you want to get famous in a certain world of format, old topologists prove that those two are not diffeomorphic. It's been a hard problem for a long time. So that's what got us on this problem to begin with. Oh, good. Is that we thought, well, maybe if we can connect them up here. So if you can connect these up with these cyclic quotient singularities that I was talking about, then you can get famous. Right. Probably not going to be off. Yeah. Well, who. Yeah, well who well who knows? Who knows? Okay, good. Okay, yeah. This is what I ask about the risky decomposition is because the way you have it, so you move a non-fixed component, right? So you get some of the modulated. How many do you get? Do you get them all or no? From this, you get 100%. No, right? From this you get 120 dimensionals. Yeah yeah, but uh you just get them by moving uh. Is that the dimension of the system? Yes. Well, presumably there's a GIT portion of the entire business of partsbooks. Yeah. Good. Okay. All right. So let me tell you what's inside this D maybe I will arrange. Oh yeah. You have a working definition. Oh yeah, never working definition for SLC surface isolated singularities for isolated singularities of type SLC. No no no yeah but if you have like a formula like numbers that you mean a classification It's roughly log canonical plus normal crossing. Yeah, okay. That's the definition. I was thinking, there's no. Okay, sure. Thank you. Yeah. You know, the other ones, you know what they are. Okay. Okay. So you have to check it case by case, that's what I'm saying. I mean, okay, so there is a list of all SLC singularities that we were asking? Yeah. Yeah, there's a list of all possible SLC singularities. All SLC singularities in the original paper Michael Arsha preparing. Yeah, and they include, yeah, so they include the sixth potion and these ones that I'm going to describe to you. Yeah, okay, so you have to check them. Yeah. All right. You're not going to need them all. No. There is a lot. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I want to show you what sentences we found in B. What am I doing here? Okay. All right, so what is done? All right, so I mean it makes sense, right? If you want to come up with something new, you deform this further. And Horikawa couldn't do this because you would end up with non-ADD singularities, right? So it's just like really quite natural. What do you do? Well, you pull off an extra copy of the negative section. Pull off an extra copy of the negative section. I keep trying, okay. Right, so instead, you pull off a copy of the negative section. So you have two sigma infinity instead, and you take a double cover, branched over something that is linearly equivalent to what you had before. So if this is F10, right, then you have like B is in 2 sigma infinity, linear system 2 sigma infinity. Well, it looks like. sigma infinity, well, it looks like 2 sigma infinity plus some v prime, where this is in the linear system, 4 sigma infinity plus 50 gamma. Right? Okay, so what does it look like? You can show, so you have one, two, three, four, and then you're going to have ten intersections here. Can I do ten approximately? Yeah, so this is what the branch divisor looks like. Okay? Okay, so because of this because of this double section here, what you get is something that's no longer normal. So you get something that looks kind of like this. This, something like that. And this is the non-normal locus that's over. That's over this. And because the branch divisor also intersects in those additional points, you end up with 10 hinge points along here. Okay. Yeah. The intersection of the branch value is transverse to the sigma n picture? Yes. Regular pinch points. Regular pinch points. That's right. Yeah. Okay, so that's what a general surface. Okay, so that's what a general surface in D looks like. Okay, so if you're wondering how to sort of deform here, right, I mean, obviously like from here to here is pretty quick, right? You just deform the branch locus, right? So from here to like this sort of surface is exactly what you think would happen. From here to here is harder. From here to the general From here to the general double cover of F0. Because you have to both deform the branch divisor and deform the underlying surface with it. So there's some extra tech, like deformation. There's some extra work that you need to do to get to this. Okay? So we had both of these, and then we talked to Coughlin and Pinga. Coughlin and Pignatelli, and they introduced us to Tauric bundles. Okay. So I think what I'm going to do is just tell you essentially how the Tauric bundles work, and then in the interest of time, I will give you a little bit about the deformation theory. That stuff's really just fun. Okay? Okay. Toric geometry, Toric bundles, okay. All right. All right. Okay, so what do we need? What we do is we look at this fourfold. Okay. So we want something that sort of represents our here-to-brook surfaces downstairs, but we need to change the here to brook surface as we go. Adhere to grow surface as we go. Okay, so we consider this graded ring. So here's the grading. Z needs to be minus 23. Okay, so inside this, you can see, like, for example, if you ignore y0, and just Y0, and just look at T0, T1, and X0, X1. This is a vibration. These are vibrations. This is like your P1 cross P1. Okay? The Z is the same Z as in the picture I erased. It will give you your double cover. So, what did we show? We show that inside the Toric bundle that's defined. The torque bundle that's defined by this picture, right? We consider equations of this form. So y 0 side z. So this is kind of uh right uh okay, I'll just tell you. Lambda y0 is T1 to the fifth. t1 to the fifth x0 minus t0 to the fifth x1. So, okay, so we have a fourfold and we have like cut out right two equations, but depending on some parameter lambda. So this should give us like a changing family of surfaces inside this fourfold as lambda changes. Okay, so when lambda is equal to zero, right, what do you get? Right, what do you get? Well, you can define a new variable, x0 over t0 to the fifth, which is the same as x1 over t1 to the fifth, right? Just from this equation, that's what you get. Okay, plug that back up into here, and then you actually get like an, right, you get which one? First one? Tempting. Not quite. Almost. Okay. In this case, what you get is the second one. Why? What you get, if you look at, if you, okay, what you get is essentially a torque bundle with these weights. You can check. Minus five, one, minus fifteen. 1 minus 15, 1, and negative 23. And so this is a heretical Brook surface F10. Here's your vibrations. Okay. This Y0 is your positive section. Y1 is your negative section. Okay. So we get a double cover of that here at Sprox F10. Yeah, you okay? Are you okay? What's that? I confuse X0 with Y0. Ah. Okay. So that's what we get. And then whenever lambda is non-zero, right, so this is like my 2 to 1 over F10. When lambda is non-zero, we get a 2 to 1 over F0. Okay, so maybe just what I'll say here is that, you know, like what Know, like, what is it in this picture that forces me to really pull off two of those, like an additional negative section? And that really comes from the fact that, that really comes from this degree here. So when you look at the degree of these monomials, what you're forced to have xi, this second degree here, and xi. Here, an xi needs to be at least two. And then when you translate over here, you get at least two y ones. So it's really pretty because it's like really concrete. You know, it's really nice. You could just like grab and draw this in. Are we okay? I would really like some questions. We have questions. Or like a thumbs up. That's cool too. Thumbs up. So these ones. So these ones you're all constructing as these double covers. Is there any sort of when you degenerate these things further to things? Like something that doesn't. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, so maybe that's a fair question. Because you're looking at like the generation of the base here. Yeah, we're really considering like we're really considering deformations of the cover and the And so there are other pieces that are like additional spot. Like living out here? Yeah, I really do. I really think there's going to be additional stuff. Okay. All right. So maybe, okay, this is what I'm going to do. I just think that deformation theory is really where it's at. It's so cool. And it's another of these kind of places where, especially as a graduate student, you know. Where, especially as a graduate student, you know, somebody just gives you a bunch of numbers and you sort of try to compute them, and you can really forget the geometry. So I want to just take the last few minutes here to give an idea of how you prove this. It's not normal using some deformation theory. So, okay, so what I'm going to write down is like, okay, so what we want is So what we want is to understand the deformations of x. This is really what we want. Yeah? So deformations of x are going to be controlled by like the tangent, right? Like some cohomology groups of tangent sheaves and things like this. This is sort of like standard information theory. The thing is that X comes with this double cover. Double cover F10, right? And so if you go back to where you call it in original services, original papers, how does he describe this? Well, he digs into the deformation theory and actually studies deformations of the surface. Sorry, studies deformations of this double cover where you're allowed to fix the base or like, yeah, or you're allowed to fix the base. Where you're allowed to fix the base, right? Or where you change the base but leave x alone, right? So, in this, we had to really think about changing both of them, yeah. So, the picture is with some work, we get this exact sequence. So, I'm going to write out what it is, and especially you should start by saying that doubling this is the t. Thank you. That's really helpful. Okay. So. That's really all. Okay. So this is the kind of picture that we get. So these are all like step over W. Am I running out of space here? Yes, I am. I'm going to go on to the next piece. That's okay. Okay, so philosophically, like more, morally speaking, this is kind of how you interpret these things. Okay, so I say that morally speaking. I say morally speaking, but I think that especially if you haven't played with this stuff before, it can be fun to just like dig into this and try to write down what does something in here look like. But the philosophy is that here we have automorphisms of W. Here we have infinitesimal deprivations. Right? So here, deformations of the map where you fix the base. Here is deformations of the base only. Here is deformations of the map where the base and X are both allowed to change. And then at the end here are obstructions to extending these deformations. Right. Right. So, okay, so a good chunk of the work is actually interpreting these things, right? So, but they are exactly what you want them to be. So, if I allow W to change, what am I really looking at? I'm looking at global sections of the tangent. Global sections of the tangent sheaf W, right? This is what I'm really looking at. If I allow my function, like my double cover to change, I'm fixing the base. If you think about this, this is really just saying that the branch curves change. So this is like local sections of the branch curve. So that's really what this is. Yeah? This one put, this is like hard. This is not obvious what this is. Some of the hard work in our paper was to show that this is actually equal to deformations of x. So every deformation of x comes from a deformation of the map. This is right, so local deformations here. Again, we're talking about H1 of the tangent sheaf. H1 of the tangent sheaf. Okay. Here again, we're talking about H1 of BB going over there. Okay, and so what do we get here? Right, this is again D2X, and this maps to, so classically we know that this is equal to zero. Okay, so deformations of here-to-brook surfaces are unobstructed. Okay, so that's the whole. Okay, so that's the hard work. So the real challenge is if we want to understand how big this thing is, right, and how, like, locally, what this locally looks like, we need to understand this. Yeah? And if we want to say that it's not normal crossing, what we need to say is that the dimension is greater than 140. Right, sorry, not greater than, not just greater than, but equal to 141. But equal to 141. If we wanted it to say, sorry, it's greater than 141. That's what we would do. That we're not normal crossing. Do we agree? That'll only be two branches. Because there's only two branches. Yeah. So that's what we eventually would like to show here. So computing both of these things is not too bad. But can you say that inequality? Yep, I could write a data too. That would be. Could write it bigger too, that would be okay. So, what we want is to show that the dimension here is strictly greater than 100 folding. That's what we wanted. Okay? We actually didn't want this. It would be really cool if it were normal crossing, but it's actually really cool that it's not, too. So, you know, what's cool is that we can actually compute it. Okay, so what do we do? So, this is just automorphisms of W. So, this is classically 15-dimensional in this particular case. Case. We can also compute this. This is like 155-dimensional, right? And so coming into like this map into here, right, we get 140 dimensions coming from deforming the base. Sorry, deforming the curve, leaving the base alone. Yeah? So what we really need to understand then is what happens over here. Okay, so over here, we can also compute this. This is just eight. This, this is just eight, okay, yeah. But then some work shows that this is actually nine-dimensional. Okay, so let's see if we can count this up, right? So we get 140 dimensions from here. It is possible that maybe this map here is a surjective map, right? Which would mean there's just like you know that X has at least one obstruction. Unless wait, you could try to study this, right? This is also really hard to get your hands on, right? So, what you, so what, so, right, but like, you can see that, like, things are super tight here, right? If this happens to be a surjective map, right, then this is really exactly what you want to be. And that does make sense from this perspective. If this is a surjective map, then the obstructions are zero here. Maybe. But that's impossible because the model is not. Okay, sorry, sorry. Yeah, okay, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. So it's not actually going to be zero. It can't be the, I mean, sorry, it can't be, yeah, okay, so this is not going to be zero. So anyway, the point is that this would be one-dimensional, and then it would be normal crossing, right, if this were surjective. Isn't that right? Anyway, here. The point is here that if this is our surjective map, then the kernel here is one-dimensional, and then we get normal crossing, which is not exactly what happens. So you really, it really comes down. So you really, it really comes down to studying this map. And the nice thing, I mean, the fun thing is that then you dig and do some Czech homology computations, and that gets really hands-on. And you actually compute this. And you show that, in fact, this map is the zero map. But it's the zero map. Which means that there's way more going on here. It's not just like one, it's like this is 149 dimensional, what we get. What we get. So it's not just a little away, but it's actually quite obstructive. Yeah. So similar arguments give us the same kind of picture over here. Go ahead. So you know. Okay, so showing that it's zero is certainly a proper result, but don't you know that T2 is non-zero because the model space has two branches, so it's singular, so So it's singular, so at least one dimensional, so yeah, but this could still be projected onto the kernel or something, right? So the kernel of that map would be two-dimensional, so it tells what it took. That work? You're right. We don't need to compute the actual map in this case because we know that. Of course, if you know it's zero, you get four. Playing the sunlight before it works. You know, you're at the board that, like, how do people subtract? I don't know. Okay, yeah? Okay, in any case, we managed to prove that this is actually the zero map in this case, and we get that this is, you know, really messy. Okay, so I think I will stop there. Are there any questions? No questions so far, but more. For the other extra component, you mentioned that if it is generic with unreused, could you just briefly describe how Yeah, so let's see for these first of all the construction is really similar, right? You get the same kind of shape of surfaces. What you get here is that this is this different. This differs even further, like it's even further away from what you want to be. So this is something like one plus, what am I saying? Yeah, the point is that you do a similar argument like what we did here. You do the same construction here. You can actually write down what this is, and it's even bigger than, like it gets bigger and bigger. Then it gets bigger and bigger, it gets worse and worse as you get bigger. Maybe the point is that, I mean, you see geometrically, because the family is just bigger, the general point cannot deform, I mean, it cannot deform to a smaller one, to a to a smaller character. And but infinitesimally it can, because the map is uh has a kernel. So it can infinitesimally infinitesimally So it can infinitesimally want to form to one of these smaller ones, but there are not enough of them there to import this D, do you think that this X has a higher T3 than T X? Sorry? This X has a has a T three or T 4. All the surfacing these are the. Oh oh yo all the surface Esk looking up. Episodes. Can you recap? Ha y you said that all the deformation of X come this way, right? Can you recap that from this? Can I explain why that's true or just yeah? Yeah, so okay, so I mean I mean if if you think about this it's not too unreasonable. If you think about this, it's not too unreasonable. What this is really saying is just that local deformations of X come from deforming the base, deforming the branch locus, or both, essentially. Right, so that's really what this is saying. But it is hard work to get this. I mean, like, it's not, it's like, it's hard for me. I don't know. So you're saying it's hard. You can either fit it in a similar commodity sequence and then you have to compute the two C0. Or you could argue geometrically in this case that I mean we are talking about the canonical map, right? Canonical map is the double cover of a smooth surface. I mean at least this works for the smooth surfaces than for the for the singular ones you have to improve the colour colour. Have to improve the curve.
