Okay, so our next talk today is by Veltra Lenela, who's at UC Levan, and where she's been for a couple of years now. And she's going to talk to us also about Neritan's group and almost automorphisms. Thank you, Voltra. Well, thank you, George, for the involuntary invitation to speak. It's very happy. Very happy, it's 10 p.m. here for me. And well, thank you, Rachel, for your previous talk, where you essentially gave half of mine already. So I can go a bit quicker through the things that you already know, I hope. So I started off really basics, maybe to tell you what a tree almost automorphism is. I should tell you first what a tree automorphism is. So a tree automorphism is a bijection between the vertical. Morphism is a bijection between the vertices and the edges that preserves adjacency. So means that if means that if two vertices B and W are connected behind an edge E, then also G of E and G of W should be connected by the edge G of E. G of E, that's a tree automorphism. And a tree almost automorphism is just the almost everywhere version of that. So again, it's a bijection between vertices and edges preserving adjacency outside of a finite set. And we do not care what this finite set is, and the way it And the way in which we don't care is by making an equivalence relation. This forms a group, the group of almost automorphisms of a tree, namely composition works just by composing where both are defined. So basically, we compose the bijections there where it makes. Bijections there where it makes sense, and other, and the rest is a finite set, so whatever. This is a totally disconnected locally compact group with a natural topology. I think Rachel did not mention what precisely this topology is, namely the automorphism group of the tree. Tony's endowed with this permutation topology that has been mentioned a few times now. Mentioned a few times now, is an obvious subgroup of the almost automorphism group of the tree if the tree is nice enough. And we require that this is an open subgroup. So this is giving us an open neighborhood of the identity. And that is defining then a topology of the whole group, provided we want the whole group to be a topological group. Be a topological group. Namely, we can translate this basis of identity neighborhoods just everywhere by left multiplication by group elements. And it is something that one has to check that this is actually a well-defined topology on the whole group. So, this is this group that can also be viewed as acting on the boundary. Acting on the boundary. But this is not what we will, not really what we will do in this talk. Again, this is a subgroup of the homomorphism group of the boundary of the tree if the tree is more reasonable. And if the tree is regular or almost regular, and this is what we will actually also assume in this talk, that the tree is almost regular, then the group is called Nevatin's group. Is called Nevatins group and it was defined by Neretins in the 90s. He thought of it as an analog of the diffeomorphism group of a circle, somehow piadic analog. He was interested in their representations. And why we people in TDLC groups love to look at this group is because, as Rachel said, it's the first example of a simple, compactly generated group that does not have. Generated group that does not have any lattices and is non-discrete, and those properties were proven by Capujan and Higman-Thompson, Padel, Kapaskel, and Domoses. And I should add here the foreshadow to the next talk, if I'm not mistaken, it has no non-obvious invariant random subgroups proven by its saying. So that was also a question. So that was also a question that people had for a while: whether there are any of those. I saw veterinarians group could be an example of that. And yes, indeed. So this is why we like that group. And now I want again, now I want to go into conjugation. So, what we want to solve in this talk is the question: given two elements, G and H in G and H in Narratin's group, are they conjugate or not? That was the question that Gil and I, so everything I'm saying is Troy worked with Gil Goffer. This is the question that Gil and I were asking ourselves and were solving in the end. And for that, we go again back to the three and so three automorphisms, as you probably know, come in. As you probably know, come in three different types. There are elliptics, fixing the vertex, there are inversions, flipping an edge, and there's translations, which are translate along a by infinite line. And then Gavron Nekrashevich and Sushansky proved when two elements of the Of the automorphism group of the tree are conjugate, namely two translations are conjugate if and only if they have the same translation length. In particular, the conjugacy class is open. And to elliptic elements or to inversions, elliptic elements are just, and the inversions are somehow both similar. Both similar. They are conjugate if and only if the labeled tree. So you take the tree that the element is acting on, and you take the quotient by this group generated by the element. And you label a vertex in the quotient by its cardinality, so by the number of vertices in the orbit under the action of G that G had. And like that, you get a labeled tree. And if two elliptic elements or inversions give the same labeled tree, then they are. They are conjugate and vice versa. So that's the solution of the conjugacy problem in the automorphism group of a regular tree. And so, okay, the other slide, this label tree is called the orbital tribe. And we want to do this for the almost automorphism tree. First, I'll First, I'll talk about elliptic elements just very shortly because the main focus of my talk I want to be on hyperbolic, I mean, on other types of elements. So elliptic elements can be characterized in several ways. First, it can be represented by an almost automorphism. An almost automorphism to forest isomorphism where you cut the same out tree, where you cut the same tree out twice, or as Rachel denoted it, it would be a triple, she said, I think. T oh she had AA, T T Phi or A A Phi. So the important thing is that you have the same tree on the left and on the right. And if you remember her revealing triples, it will mean that every change. It would mean that every chain is a periodic chain, or some power of the element is an elliptic triautomorphism or inversion, I should say. Or G is not a translation. So this notion of a translation was also defined by Lebudek and Belsulek. A translation would mean that there exists an element. Exists an element that exists, a vertex such that one power is a descendant of it. Or in Rachel's language before, in the revealing triple, there is an attracting chain. So, elements in Neratin's group, elements. In Neretin's group, elements that satisfy those three equivalent properties are called elliptic. And what we showed is that the Gavoro-Nekhashevich-Sushansky theorem from before just translates if you throw in a few almost. So two elliptic elements are conjugate if and only if they're orbital types. You can define the orbital type of precisely the same way. The subgroup generated by G act. Generated by G acts on this finite forest with only and such that every vertex has finite orbit and then we can make the quotient forest and label every vertex by its orbit length. And this thing, after cutting out a After cutting out a finite set is a complete conhigger invariant of elliptic elements in the Eratin's group. So if you have two of these finite labeled forests, I'm drawing this very horrible, then if they are the same after cutting out a finite subforest, then the elliptic elements are conjugate. Elliptic elements are conjugate. That's it for the elliptics. The hyperbolics are in some sense more complicated, in some sense easier. But okay, I'll tell you later what hyperbolics are. First, let's go back to the easy way where we have the tree translations in odds t have a very easy north-south dynamic. Easy north-south dynamics. So if this circle here represents the boundary of the tree, then there's one attracting point, one repelling point, and everything else when implying powers of an element G is traveling from the repelling to the attracting point. So very easy. So, exactly one attracting point, exactly one repelling point, all points except the repelling points travel towards the attractive point. In the almost automorphism group of a regular tree, we have considerably more complicated behavior, as also Rachel explained before. We can have several orbits of attracting points, we can have several orbits of repelling points, and we can have areas varied. Can have areas, varied looks, even if you would be short-sighted and wouldn't see the rest of the boundary as if you're acted on by an elliptic element. So it's really more complicated. And to understand this more complicated behavior better, Breen defined special representatives for Hignan-Thompson elements. Thompson elements, and which, as he proved, exist for all three almost automorphisms. And these are called revealing pairs. And I just wrote the definition here, very hand-wavy, and I'm really happy that Rachel explained all in full detail. So, a revealing pair is a representative such that I deny. Representatives, such that dynamics of the element is nicely visible. That's what I say. So you see precisely how many attracting and how many repelling points there are in the boundary. And also this example we saw before. You should have coordinated us. So yeah, here you have the Here you have a periodic chain. Yeah, I don't know what to say and to not repeat too much, except to mark this one as well. So, yeah, that's how. So, yeah, that's how here we see how we represent such a tree-almost automorphism. So, the element one goes here, and therefore this would be an example of something dysfundering. And the element two goes here, so it's an so the image of two is a proper ancestor. Ancestor of itself. So, this here is a repelling vertex. You can see here that you have two attracting neighborhoods, sorry, two repelling neighborhoods. And okay, so you can see the dynamics really nicely in these kinds of tree pairs. And in the boundary, we want to define, we want to give a name to this area where it looks as if you were an elliptic element, and we call it the stable area. So it's all those. It's all those points in the boundary that have a neighborhood such that for every neighborhood, there exists a for every neighborhood, there exists a neighborhood inside that under some power of the element gets back, gets mapped back just on itself again. So, this is called the stable area. It is a clopen subset of the boundary, and that is clopen is actually shown via the existence also for revealing pair because it's precisely those points of the boundary that somehow lie under vertex of the periodic chain. And we finally the definition of hyperbolic that a word I mentioned a few times and is heavily overloaded in mathematics, of course. We call an element of the almost automorphism group of the regular tree hyperbolic if it acts trivially on the stable area. So, in particular, all periodic changes. particular all periodic chains have length four have length one and also there's no and also funny nothing there's so if we have for example this element and one three two that would be not hyperbolic because here we have a periodic chain Periodic chain of size two. And here, in order, I mean, it's anyway not hyperbolic, but a hyperbolic chain would not be allowed to permute anything down here. So that's the definition of a hyperbolic element. It acts trivially on the stable area. If it looks as if you were elliptic in the neighborhood, then you're actually. Then you're actually fixed and can't move. Okay, then an tree almost automorphism has a unique, nice decomposition into an elliptic and a hypolic element. Namely, you just see for the element G, where is the stable area? Area and the hyperbolic factor is just the G set to identity on the stable area, and the elliptic factor is just the rest. The elliptic factor is just G sets to identity to the non-stable area and left as it is at the rest. So every elementic home. So, every element composes very nicely and in this way uniquely into a product of two commuting factors, one elliptic, one hyperbolic. And we showed that whether two elements are conjugate or not can be proven, can be separately on the elliptic and the hyperbolic. The elliptic and the hyperbolic factor, namely G, the element G is conjugate to H if and only if the elliptic part of G is conjugate to the elliptic part of H. The hyperbolic part of G is conjugate to the hyperbolic part of H. And there's some non-triviality condition, namely either both G and H are supported on the whole boundary. Supported on the whole boundary, or none of them is supported on the whole boundary. And I will show on the next slide an example that this condition is actually necessary. Namely, if you look at these two elements, then here and here. Is that sort of the hyperbolic part? It looks the same. And also here and here, it looks the same. Here, you just have a flip. But then you see that this second element has Element has also this three that is fixed, and the first one doesn't. So these cannot be conjugate, even though they would satisfy the first two parts of the theorem. Okay, so we solved conjugacy for elliptics. We showed that how elliptics and hyperbolics work together when solving conjugacy. And solving conjugacy, it's left to look at the hyperbolics. And like I said, the solution of elliptic conjugation was generalizing work by, or say adapting work by Gavalon Suschatsky and Nekashevich. And in the hyperbolics, we will adapt. Next, we will adapt and use work by Belg and Matucci. They solved conugassi in the Higman-Thompson group V that Rachel also mentioned a few times. Yeah, usually that V comes with a few indices. I will just cheat here, pretend it's just one, even though it's a different one, depending on the regularity. Different one depending on the regular, it is a fear almost regular tree. And an appropriate Higman-Thompson group, and with the appropriate labels here, is dense in the almost automorphism group of an almost regular tree. And for the following statement, we denote by this curly L of T the set of leaves of the tree. Of leaves of the tree. And we showed that if two hyperbolic elements are sufficiently close, then they are conjugate. That's the first step. And sufficiently close means they have the same revealing pair. Their revealing pair is defined in a way that. Revealing pairs defined in a way that you're just only looking at the finite part of the representative means that the elements G and H restricted on the leaves look the same. So if I can write both of them with the same diagram here and Diagram here, and just they might do something else down there. Then they have the same relay pair, and then we show that they are conjugate. In particular, the conjugacy class of a hyperbolic element is closed and it is open if and only if the support is the entire boundary. Is the entire boundary of the tree. It's not difficult to see that an elliptic element can never have an open conjugacy class. So in order to have an open conjugacy class, the element must be hyperbolic and have full support. Okay, now I want to give you some intuition. You some intuition. So Berke and Matucci solved the cognogasic problem in Thompson's V by introducing certain diagrams and then reducing them in a certain way. And I'd like to give you some intuition on that. Maybe a better readable color. Better readable color. So let's look at this element here. Okay. Okay, maybe like this. So, first, if you look at this, you can think that every one of the edges actually represents a clopen set of the boundary of the tree. And when it splits up, that means we are partitioning this clopen set of the boundary. And now, what we want to do is draw the second tree upside down. And then we connect every vertex to its image. Okay, so remember every Every edge represents a clopen set. And in the second tree, yeah, two is basically a partition reverse, right? Here we have where it splits up thinking upwards. Okay. What happened here? We are in the Hingman-Thompson group. What happened here? It split. What happened here? It splits up, and in the image, it goes together again. There's in this part of the diagram that I drew here on the left, there's zero information. You can just erase that. That's reduction number one. We can just erase that. We could have just in our original pair here, we could have just erased this part and made the first element shorter. Then, okay, what happens if we? Okay, what happens if we if we multiply, let's say we have this element and multiply it to what we had before, that works as follows: you're just drawing the diagrams one after the other. I think it was like this, right? And now here you see the clopen sets here. You see the clopen sets are going together and splitting up again. No information here. Going together, splitting up. We can just as well let it be split up. Okay, and erase this here. Oops, it was too big of a rubber. Ah, where's the back button here? So, and now again, here, it represents some cloak and setting the boundary going together and apart again. No information here can split, can split it up. Let me deride it. Let meteoroid in red can split it up. And after we are done with this process, we'll have a new diagram that would be the product of the almost automorphisms that I started with. That's intuition number two. So if you have something like this, then yeah, redundant information, we can replace it by something like this. Intuition number three. Now, if we want to conjugate, so let's say we have again this element. Okay, sorry, I should I should draw. Oh, I should draw this smaller so that everything fits. So we will. So we will put this element, we will put the one from before, even though I forgot how it looked like. I think it was like this. And again, at the inverse of the one that we are conjugating with, I hope I'm correct that the inverse is this one. Okay. And now we're doing something funny. We're connecting here. And remembering those different types of reductions that we had before, this goes to this and the other one is this one is going to this. To this, remembering these two reductions, we could we could do them in this area and end with the product and this funny line here that you don't yet know what it's for. Don't yet know what it's for, or we could do those reductions here. Start with the big line that I drew newly, do a few of those reductions. It's like the multiplication handling, just somewhere else. And this is a result by Beck and Matucci, end up with the same. With the same process here, doing this and these reductions, and the third one that I'm going to talk to you about later, doing these reductions eventually terminates and it's irrelevant of the order of reductions. Supposedly, that's obvious if you know something about abstract rewriting systems, I don't. And that's the intuition for. Yeah, right. If you would do the reductions here, then because you have one element, because you have one element and it's reversed, these would just go away. If you would do those reductions only in this area, you Only in this area, you would just dissolve this element again. We have to think a bit to see that. And this is the explanation why this is a conjugation invariance, these funny diagrams. But let me become not much more formal. But here we have type 1 reduction, type 2 reduction, type 3 reduction. Sorry, I will drew those for different three irregularities. Type 3 reduction. Type 3 reductions is because we have here the identity element. And if I do a type 2 reduction here or a type 1 reduction here, I should end up with the same thing. But if I do a type 2 reduction here, I'm ending up with this. This and if I do a type one reduction here, I'm ending up with this. Sorry, this is a central hole, and this should be the same thing. So that's the three reductions. And Belkant Matucci used those to describe really an algorithm to determine in the Hignan-Thompson group whether two elements. Thompson group, whether two elements are conjugate. Namely, it's just what I said: take a representative, then draw T2 upside down below T1. Connect every vertex with its image, make yourself a central whole, connect the roots. Connect the root, enclosing the central hole. Do your reductions until none are possible anymore. And this is important, always keep track of something called plane order. So if you would have this diagram, which comes from the Which comes from the element one, two goes to one, you would not you would have to keep this quirl here. Always keep track of the plain order. The reducing diagram they call the reduced BN diagram for the element G, and it fully determines the conjugacy class of G, G being a Hignan-Thomp. T being a Higman-Thompson group element. Now, this theorem by Beck and Matucci essentially is true also for group of for elements of Negertin's group for hyperbolic ones. Remember, hyperbolic elements are connected. Instruct close to another, for example. Ah, yeah, here's an example. Okay, let me do this example. So draw the tree upside down. One, two, three, four, one, three, two, four. So one, three, two, four. So central hole. I hope you're not disturbed by this that I just drew into this image. Now we do a type. We do a type tool reduction here, then we are getting two edges and oh, so I should take a different color and I have to copy this here inside. It splits up. This is the split. This is the split. Then this split is here. Here I have another two splits. And let me connect it back together. One, three, two, four. And I can do another type two reduction. Now I have three of those. I see my space management is pretty bad. Here, this one, this one is this one. This one is this one, and I think that's. And I think that's almost everything right in here. There it goes. No, oh, sorry. I screwed up. Go back. This goes here. This goes here. And this goes there. And is that reduced already? I have something too much. And date, this one is supposed to go. I don't find where this one is supposed to go. To go okay, let me draw a new one to ask for new okay, so and had the green carrot. It's easy. The third one third one is closed. It goes to the green carrot. Ah, yeah, this one goes here. That one goes here. So now I got it. So I got it, and you see that here we have one closed loop, and that is corresponding to periodic behavior, that is corresponding to the fixed vertex 2 here, and everything is actually directed. We have one Oh, yeah, here another edge. And actually, the numbers of closed directed loops are connected to the number of attracting, respectively, repelling points. And the number of times they wind around the central hole is now one for every loop. loop gives you the the the orbit size of the corresponding chain extractor or repeller chain in the revealing pair so you can actually read off all the dynamics from just this reduced pn diagram but But now let's go back to Nervitzen's group. So I will tell you what is the difference between cognogasi in V, Hydemann Thompson group, and hyperbolics in odd T. We have to, when drawing this whole diagram in Thompson, we have to start with a revealing pair. And that's because of this proposition that I mentioned earlier: that two hyperbolic elements having the same revealing pair. Having the same revealing pair are conjugate. If no type 2 can be done anymore, then we can do type 1 star. It's actually essentially the same reason as before. Because type, because these kind of nots at some point just tell you about the elliptic sub-behavior, just tell you how. Sub-behavior, just tell you how sub-trees are permuted when being mapped to another sub-tree. And well, in open conjugacy classes, that doesn't matter. Or yeah, or in, let's say, amongst hyperbolic elements. And in the end, when we're done with everything, then we forget about the plane order, namely, these two. Namely, these two diagrams represent different conjugacy classes in Thompson's V, but same conjugacy classes in the Aratin's group. So, the result of all that we call the star-reduced BN diagram for G. For G. And the theorem we prove is two hyperbolic ge automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have isomorphic and same star-reduced BM diagrams. And a nice application is we can show how we can show precisely which elements are conjugate to hyperbolic automorphisms, three automorphisms. Automorphisms, three automorphisms, so to translations in odd T, namely, if and only if the star reduced BM diagram looks like this. There's precisely one directed circle I mean two directed circles. I mean, two directed circles, and then the one-to-one correspondence between the vertices and a few edges going from one vertex of one loop to in the other to the other loop. Okay, to summarize everything, the conclusion. Everything, the conclusion, we get algorithms, shouldn't call it like that, to determine congassi classes. First, check whether the support is everything or not. Second, calculate the decomposition into the elliptic and the hyperbolic vector. Third, form this almost orbital type thing of the elliptic vector. Fourth, find the revealing pair. First, find the revealing pair for the hyperbolic factor, then determine the star-reduced BM diagram for this revealing pair. And that's the end of my talk. Thank you. Thank you, Valtral. Are there any questions? I have a question? Yeah. Yeah. The hyperbolic part in Eritance group that further decomposes more or less uniquely into like a bunch of elements that pairwise commute. The hyperbolic? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you could make it simpler. Yeah, you could. Yeah, but I meant to ask, like, can you actually identify them somehow? Identify them somehow in the BM diagram or do they like correspond to something obvious? It should be connected components. It should be the connected components of the VM diagrams, yes. Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions? Right, well, if not, let's uh let's thank uh Rochard again. Thank you.
