Thank you very much. It's my great pleasure to be here. Yeah, I guess this work is not directly related, but it's finished during my annual chat at Wisconsin Madison. In this time, Kimo was a mentor and the chair and so on. He was very supportive and flexible, helpful. So I really thank you, Timo, for being such a good. Thank you, Timo, for being such a great colleague and church. So, this is based on joint work with Ilya Tevirev at Edinburgh, based on this paper we recently posted. It's about Jan Miels, and Jan Mios is from physics. So let me just give you the physical background. So in physics, a model usually defines by action functional. By action function of s. For phi here, phi can be say trajectory particles or magnetic fields and so on. And in classical physics, we want to minimize this action functional, and this usually leads to interesting beliefs. Quantum physics is often formulated by pass integrals or functional integrals with respect to such formal measures which look like the exponential of an action function now. Of action function now. Of course, everything is formal here. And then physics wants to understand correlation functions and so on for this function. And then there is a different formulation which is called stochastic quantization. This makes things to stochastic DE. It's just a gradient flow of this action functional plus space-time Y noise. This is a dynamic such that the formal measure is formally invariant under this dynamic. Okay, it's just a Okay, it's just a stochastic gradient slope. So, yeah, so by choosing different models or action functionals, we get many interesting singular SPDs. So, in this talk, this action functional is going to be the Yang-Meus action, where the field A is going to be a Lie algebra value one form I define in the moment. So, I'll first define the Yang-Meus model, namely, I specified this. Model, namely, I specified this action functional s. And then I introduced a class of lattice Yamius models. They share the same sort of symmetry called the gauge symmetry as a continuum-Young model. And this is why they're also called lattice gauge theories. And then I'll briefly recall our earlier work with the Chandra-Thaberef higher. We construct two and three-dimensional construct the status quoization. And then I state and prove our main result, which is a universality result, which says the dynamics, all those lattice models converge to the same limit. That limit is the same as we talked about before. Okay, this involves proving convergence and identify the limit. Time of permits, I also talk a little bit about the environment measure. Okay, so what is Yami's model? So, what is Yamio's model? So, here we have a D-dimensional space, like Rd or torus to dimension, on which we have a field called A. And this A is so-called, okay, so in this model we have a Lie group capital G and the Lie algebra little G. And this field A is a Lie algebra value one form. What this means is the one form, so it has D components. Each component is a function taking value in the D output. Okay, so this is going to be my field. And then the Yamios action functional is the L2 of the curvature for this A. And the curvature defined to, okay, curvature is a two-form, and the ij component is defined to be dA plus the b bracket of a i aj. So here by L2, I just mean, you know, we do a square sum over all the ij and then The ij and then okay, so on the Lie algebra, I also have some inner product, so I do L2 over that, and then I finally do an L2 integral over the underlying space. So that's called a Yang-Mill section. If you pretend everything is scalar, pretend A is a scalar, then basically the curvature F is like DA. And then in that case, this action functional is like theoretically formal. It's like the integral of DA. Theoretically is like an integral of DA squared. That's the corresponding PD, just PD equation. So this is just a kind of non-linear or non-abelian generalization of that. There's an important symmetry here. This is called gate symmetry in this model. It says taking any lead group value function g, then I apply this function to this field A, I get a new. field H, I get a new B algebra value one form. And this transformation, gate transformation, you can check leaves the action functional environment. This is just a half-page calculation. So this is very important. Actually, this is infidimental symmetry because this is a function. You can choose any function to do this transformation environment. Okay, so that's Yango's model. That's Young-Nels model. Gay symmetry. As I said, the quantization, passing into a quantization, means you look at this formal measure, but then this formal measure is completely... For example, here I write a DA. It's kind of formal, a big measure, but it doesn't exist in infinite dimension. So on the other hand, you know, this, okay, this measure is formal, but there's a class of lattice models. There's a class of lattice models called the lattice case theory that physics introduced. These are well defined, just like the easing model on finite lattice, well defined. And physics can use this sort of model to probe various properties of young mills, like do simulations, for example. What's important here is these lattice models also have gauge symmetry. So how do we define that? Okay, suppose we have d-dimensional. Define that, okay. Suppose we have d-dimensional lattice, and then if you want to have one form, right, so must have d components, then these variables must live on the edges instead of lattice sides, because edges you have d directions. So the model defined like this, every edge I associate a d group element. So now the field take value in d group, not the algebra. Okay, and then I look at this measure. Here the DUXY is a high measure on the DQ, the translation measure. And then, so this is the product measure over all the edges. And here I have this measure where the S is defined as following. So I look at a unit square, P, consisting of four sides, X, Y, Z, W, and then I have a And then I have four u's on the four edges. I multiply them, and this whole thing is a B group element. And then I have a function s which maps this to a number. This function is chosen to be conjugate invariant. So that's the model, right? So if you compare with the easing model, for example, here I also have steams like U, but this is like nearest neighbor interaction in some sense. So, what's the gauge symmetry here? Now, the gauge transformation is defined like this. Again, I take a g value, the group value function of the lattice side. I do this transformation. This looks like a conjugation, but it's not because x, y are different. x, y is edge. Now, the action is invariant. It's invariant analysis because you can check, right? So, you multiply the uxy. you multiply the uxy by uh gy inverse on the right and multiply uyz by the uh gy on the left and then they cancel right. What remains is the gx here and the gx inverse here. But the function, yeah, it's s in. Okay. So this is a big class of models because you know s you can choose s, right? So there are some connotes about it. Fame as policies. Wilson defined this trace, and then there's a Villain model defined by heat kernel on the Leaf root, and then there's some Manten model, the Lie roof distance from identity square. So all this satisfy this problem. Okay, this class of models. And now what we do is I consider the stochastic gradient flow for this lattice model. First of all, the configuration space of this is the product of a Lee group over all the edges, which is a huge Lee group. And then I consider the gradient of this action on this huge Library, perturbed by Brownie motions on the Liboo. Okay, you can define Brownie motions on the Liboo. Eventually, I'll just send the lattice spacing to zero and prove the universe. Lattice spacing to zero, that proved the universality result. But even if you just fix the unit lattice, just look at this diffusion on the V group. That's already very interesting. Actually, with some other collaborators, we prove results like log-sub-level inequality, orbiticity, uniqueness, and mass gap for strong coupling, and so on. Okay, only by looking at this lattice dynamic. But what I'm going to do now today is to take a continuum limit. Is to take a continuum limit. So, yeah. What is the notation in the last vertical map time example? So, on the lead group, I fix a binary metric. So, I can talk about distance between two elements in the league group. And that's the distance. Yeah, so distance between from the identity of the right, so continuum limit. So, let's first recall our early. Recall our earlier construction in continuum. So look at this. Now we're in continuum. We're on two or three-dimensional towers. We look at the gradient flow plus the Y-noise. And if you write down this more explicitly, it looks like it's PDE, heat equation, non-linear term, B brackets, and this is the Y noise. And there's a renormalization term. There's a renormalization term CA, just like the normalizations in TZ equation and so on. So we prove that we have a local solution for that using regular structure. But more importantly, we prove that you see here this renormalization constant C, if you do a finite shift, then we have a different solution, right? Just like Ito-Sanovi's kind of correction. We have one parameter. Kind of correction. You have a one-parameter family of solutions. But there is a special one which has gauge covariant property. This means the following. Okay, this is in picture. Imagine we have a huge infinite dimensional space of field A, and then we have infinite-dimensional gauge group acting on this. So these are the orbits under the gauge transformation. In other words, these are the gauge equivalent classes. So any two fields. So, any two fields on the same curve, they are gauge equivalent. So, what is gauge covariant property for this flow, for this dynamic? It means if you start with two gauge equivalent initial conditions, okay, and solve them, solve the equation, okay, then at positive time t, the two solutions are still gauge equivalent in law. What this means is that the dynamic doesn't care about the representative element from orbit. Element from orbit is truly a dynamic over the space orbits. It's really dynamic in the quotient space. And there is a special choice of such C, which such that this is true. Okay, it's just like in stochastic analysis, there's special choice which makes the solution to be martingale. That's the e-toe. So this work raised two questions. So this work raised two questions. The first one is whether this process on the space of orbits in some sense is canonical, universal, is there an inverse principle at all? So we show that in two dimensions it's indeed a universal limit of the dynamic, all those discrete models I discussed earlier. Exception about the environment measure. Actually, in Nike, there are a group of people who construct a two-dimensional Who constructed two-dimensional Yamius measure? And is it really an invariant measure for our dynamic? So, in this paper, we answered, both questions have answered yes. And actually, part two relies on part one. Because unlike its environment measure, you can explicitly check the environment and so on, and then you pass the limit. So that part requires. So that part requires part one. And by the way, there's a corollary which allows us to prove universality of 2D Young-Mills measure using the universality of the dynamic. Okay, basically, we prove that the dynamic has a unique invariant measure by obedience theory, and then all the limits of such 2D Younger's measures, there must be. Youngest measures, there must be environment measures for the limiting dynamic, therefore, must be limited. Okay, so for the rest of the talk, I just focus on the universality result, which means I want to show discrete dynamic convergent continuous dynamic. So what do we do? Of course, the first step is like interacting particle system converge to take easy equation, where you should first try to rewrite the discrete model into a form which looks like a discrete version of the limit. You know, discrete version of the limiting equation, plus remainder error terms, and then showed error terms go to zero. That's the philosophy. But here, the difficulty is that a discrete model looks very different from the continuum model. Discrete model, the field take value in Li Gu, but in continuum, we take value in Li algebra. The heuristic here is that under suitable scaling, the discrete dynamic will be closer and closer to the identity. And closer to the identity of the Lie group eventually becomes an infinitesimal perturbation of identity, which is element in Lie algebra. How to make this precise? So this is our lattice dynamic. So each edge we have a running motion of the group. Our strategy is the following. So between the this is the edge set of edge, right? Between the Between the algebra and the V group, there is an exponential map. In neighborhood, I identify this as a bijection. So now my dynamics here. Okay, first of all, here I have a, I fix a remaining metric with respect to which I talk about the gradient and the Brownian motion. My Lie algebra is just a linear space with a bracket like it doesn't have a remaining structure. What I do Remaining structure. What I do is to use this exponential map to pull back the remaining metric on the Lie group to the remaining, to make the remaining metric on the Lie algebra. Okay? So if I do that, then the, you know, in neighborhood identity of the Lie group, the Lie algebra and the Lie group are isomorphic as two remaining magnitudes. Remaining magnitudes. Okay, now my Lie algebra is not just a linear space, but now it has a remaining structure. And then I compute, I also pull back the action from the Lie group to the Lie algebra and compute the gradient and white noise and so on on the Lie algebra. That's the rough idea. And after many pages of calculations, we show that the We show that the dynamic, right, so we take the log, inverse, sorry, the log satisfy discrete equation which now looks closer to the SPD in continuum. So it looks like this. Okay, so that's equation one is the equation in continuum. And this is what we get on the lattice. We get on the lattice, epsilon is a lattice spacing. So, of course, discrete equation, we don't have a renormalization constant. We are not allowed to change the model, change the discrete model. We don't have a renormalization, but we have error terms here. For example, one of those error terms looks like lattice spacing its own time something. When we send the lattice spacing to zero, you might think this disadvantage, right? So you might think this vanish, right? This doesn't vanish because this thing is singular. So like if sometimes something blows up by like one or if someone, right? So actually we can show that all the error terms in the limit contribute to such terms, like some constant times a. Okay, so what we can show at this moment is that in the continuum limit we get a We get a limiting equation, limiting solution, which solves equation one with some constant. That constant would be the sum of all such small constants, maybe 50 of them. And by the way, this is similar with what Marty and Jeremy did earlier, his KBZ equation, earlier terms. Okay, so now the question is. Okay, so now the question is: you know, of course we don't want to add up all those 50 constants. But how do we know that this limit is the same as the first limit we constructed early? So how do I identify this limit? The idea is the following. The discrete models preserve gauge symmetry, so we somehow know the limiting dynamic must be gauge covariance. Dynamic must be gauge covariant. And if we can show that there is a unique choice of that C such that the dynamic one is gauge covariant, then the gauge covariant dynamic, the gauge covariant limit of the detailed models must be that. So we argue that there is a unique choice of this constant C such that one is gauge covariant. The argument involves some sort of topology. Involves some sort of topology. So let me explain. In the abelian case, now this U1, everything becomes linear and very simple. Okay, so actually I even talk about this in my SPD class with constant. Abelian case is very simple. So it's just a heat equation plus a constant plus binoise where A is like A1, A2. And there are A2, and there are two decoupled equations. Now, the gate transformation in abelian case just shifts A by a dgg inverse, where g is a u1 value function. My claim is that this equation is gauge covariant, right, which means it satisfies the property if you start with gauge equivalent initial conditions, positive time they're still gauge equivalent. If and only if this constant is zero in this ability case. In this ability case. There's a unique one. Okay, so how to prove this? I need to introduce something called a Wilson loop observable. So take any loop in the underlying space, and this is loop integral, line integral of this one form. What's important is that this was loop observable is kj variant. It's gauge invariant. If A and A prime are gauge equivalent, then they have the same Wilson-Loop observable. To see this, under this gauge transformation, we get this term, but this term is always integer multiplied of 2πi, so the exponential doesn't see any difference. The reason that this must be The reason that this must be integer is because now g takes a value in the circle. So dgdj inverse is like the infinitesimal angle. And now I integrate all these angles along the loop and come back, right? So I get a winding number of a circle, which must be an integer. Okay, so that's what's the loop. Now I prove this claim. It's easy to check that when C is equal to zero, the dynamics is indeed gauge covariant. It's like, you know, suppose A bar zero and A0 are gauge equivalent initial conditions, then I can show that the solution are gauge equivalent, whereas the gauge transformation says I have certain DD. This is just a check-in, a tablation. What's non-trivial is that when C is not zero, how do you know it's not a gauge covariance? It's not a gauge equivalent. For this, I just need to cook up one example, right? You have one example of two initial conditions, they are gauge equivalent, but after time t, they are not. So the particular choice we made is this. One initial condition 2 pi i dx1, the other is just 0. They are gauge equivalent because now gauge equivalent just means the shift by dgg inverse. Is the shift by DGG inverse? G is just that. Since the equations are linear in a billion cases, we just solve them, right? Key kernel convolves a noise and the initial condition. The other one, the initial condition is zero. Okay, t is key kernel. So now I'm going to show that they are not gauge equivalent for positive time t. And to do this, I just need to show their corresponding Wilson loops are non-equal. So this is just, you know, this is just Gaussian, like linear operation with y noise. But then this is a constant. So if you have a Gaussian, the expectation of exponential, of course you can calculate that. So the difference between them is that term. So this is like the exponential of y integral of that term. Turn and if I choose the loop in the torus to be the loop which winds around the torus, then this line divorced is 2πi. So if c is not 0, t is positive, then they're not equal. But this argument strongly relies on the fact that for torus, we have a non-trivial first co-homology. And this argument actually, on the entire plane, for example, for Entire plane, for example, for any C, the dynamic is a gauge covariant. Okay, so this is abelian case. Non-abelian case is much more complicated. I don't want to basically we show that for small t, we do some other estimates to control the non-linear effect, non-abelian effect, show the effect is secondary. And then for generally we need to find the curve in the algebra and then. In the algebra and the group, which satisfy some particular property. We did this using sub-Romanian geometry. So I still have five minutes. Okay, so maybe last five minutes I can yeah, so at this moment we we show the convergence and then we identify the limit uh to be the same limit we construct earlier with. Earlier with construct earlier. So, and then I wanted to speak a little bit about the environment measure. We also showed in this paper that there's a unique probability measure, mu, on the space of orbits, on the quotient space, whose Wilson loops agree with earliest construction by the V, Bruce driver, and so on. And also, this measure, mu, is a unique. Measure μ is a unique invariant measure of this dynamic of a construct earlier, okay, in two-dimensional. So, how do we do that? Okay, on the lattice, this is why we really need to understand the lattice approximation. On the lattice, everything is explicit. You can check invalid measure and so on. Of course, in the end, we want to pass a limit to get some uniform bound over epsilon. This relies on famous work by Jean Braguay. By Jean Burgundy. So, Jean Burgundy is studying environmental for deterministic Schrodinger equation, but this is also applied to singular scarcity. For example, still many work in this direction. So, basically, Burgundy's idea is that you split into two cases, right? So, you want to get some uniform bound. And then, if the initial idea gets something, you can basically control, but then you want to understand. But then you want to understand the probability that the initial condition becomes large. If you start initial condition, you sample initial condition from the invariant measure, then once you have some moments found on the invariant measure plus Markov inequality, you can found this. So this boils down to moments found on the invariant measure. Moments found which are uniform in the lattice spacing. The problem is. Okay, the problem is that in Young-Mills model, if you want to bound the field A, say movements bound on the field A, it's not bounded. You have to choose suitable gauge to attend such moment bound, to bound the field A. A is only bounded in suitable gauge. This somehow goes back to very early question by Tyran Wuhlenbeck. This is a very, very influential paper by her. You know, influenced many deep results. You know, influenced many deep results by Donaldson and so on, spatial geometry. She said if the field A is in some sense small, then you can find the A by the curvature in a particular gauge called a Coulomb gauge. And then she figured out some continuity argument to piece together this kind of local bounds. What we do is different, but kind of similar. What we need to do is two scales. What we need to do is a two-scales argument. So, at large scales, we fix the actual gauge. And then we just go down the scales. At certain point, the A is reasonably small. And then we start to fix Coulomb gauge to get sharp bound on the moments of the field. Okay, so this kind of idea is already in the earlier paper by Chevrolet, but we need to sharpen such bounce Such bounds to get the important input to the gene for kinds argument. So I guess I'll just stop here and hear some references. Thank you. So what goes wrong in the last argument with 3D? Yeah, we need general machine learning because there are too many terms. I know there's a so-called VPXC moment bound on all the elements in regular structures. We don't have a discrete version of that. In 2D, we can just do everything by hand. And then in 3D, there are maybe a thousand error terms. We need to develop some systematical stuff. But 3D, right, no essential obstacle. If you go from the torus to the full space, what happens? We don't have a uniform blank at the moment. So it's just like, you know, I guess same kind of difficulty in like a nonlinear PD, I suppose. When our boundary domain is easy. Yeah, for nonlinear equations, especially singular nonlinear SD is infinite volume, it's um it's uh It's a case-by-case study in some sense. People ever consider other boundary conditions than periodic? Imposing some sort of boundary condition on it? Yeah, yeah, that's what we want to do next, actually. So eventually I want to make some connections with geometry, the Yamius model and fiber bundle connections and so on. So So maybe the first step would be say you have a just have a torus, but non-trivial bundle. In some sense that the field A is now a connection in a non-trivial bundle over torus. But then non-trivial bundle means when you go from this side to the other side of the torus, you get some weird boundary condition because the fiber have to be twisted in order to get a non-zero topology. That's the yeah, first step. That's the first step. And then, you know, you can also maybe, I guess torus would be the first step, because the the space is still flat. Manifolds would be harder. For any questions, then
