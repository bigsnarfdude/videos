Completely spontaneous. She was just describing what she's doing. So it seems a natural question to ask: does Oshiel do mathematics? And is the Haider hat a mathematical object? And the really question is: when we say the word mathematics, what do we really mean? And I wouldn't be surprised. mean and I wouldn't be surprised that each of us understands this term somehow differently so what I'm going to do in next few minutes I'm going to offer you some possible way of thinking about mathematics and that was promoted in the 1980s and I'm going to start with this quote about mathematical knowledge there are Mathematical knowledge. There are from my analysis six fundamental activities, which I argue are both universal and that they appear to be carried out by every cultural group ever studied and also necessary and sufficient for the development of mathematical knowledge. So six fundamental activities. And those are counting, locating, measuring, designing, and playing and explaining. And this is from Bishop. This is from Bishop's article from 1988. About this time, a Brazilian mathematics educator, Ubertan di Ambrosio, published a quite influential paper about ethno-mathematics and its place in the history and pedagogy of mathematics. Pedagogy of mathematics. And there is a Canadian connection here because probably at least some of you know that for the learning of mathematics is actually Canadian-run mathematical mathed journal. And so what Diambrosio did, he divided ethnomathematics, he divided mathematics kind of in two streams. One was academic mathematics that he describes more or less as mathematics that we have. Describes more or less as mathematics that we learn in school. And then he describes ethno-mathematics in the following way: that is, mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups. And he gives some examples. And as you could see here, he also mentioned particular professional classes and groups. And he explained. And he explains this in more detail in the following way: that for him, mathematics that engineers do also fits in this idea of ethno-mathematics. Mathematics that is practiced by a cultural group. And for us who teach calculus, maybe this will resonate as a good or a bad idea, I'm not sure. I'm not sure that the idea how we teach calculus is also ethno-mathematics. Because he argues it is not really strict pure mathematics that some of you study in mathematical analysis or whatever. And he was apparently particularly familiar with this Silvanes-Thompson approach to calculus, and he puts that as an example of ethno-mathematics. An example of ethno-mathematics. But also, he goes in the opposite direction: that he says that mathematics is also, or ethno-mathematics is something that is practiced by builders or bell diggers or shark risers in the sums. About the same time, another Brazilian mathematician added to this discussion, Marcelo Borva. Loborba. He said that mathematics should be understood as referring to cultural groups and not the concept of race. And he also goes to explain actually what is the essence of mathematics. And he is listening here, ciphering, measuring, classifying, ordering, inferring, and modeling. And modeling. He also adds that even mathematics that is produced by professional mathematics in this way is a mathematics of a particular cultural group. And as such, it fits into this idea of ethnomathematics. He gives, so he published his So he published his paper also in the for learning of mathematics journal. And if you are not familiar with this journal, if you are not familiar with this journal, please find time and look it up. It for now, for decades, really provides quite insightful articles about math education. Borba also gave a visualization of ethnomathematics. In his view, ethnomatics is a forest in which each tree would be considered as a different expression of ethnomathematics. And that made me ask one of my former students to create this image. No, at the mathematics of the forest, with trees of any shape, any size, and any color. But I would like to connect this with another concept, and the concept that's been promoted for now about two decades by Elder Albert Marshall for MICWAM Nation. Mikwab nation, this nation, in what is now known as Nova Scotia in Canada. And he promoted so-called two-eyed seeing, as a learning to see from one eye with the strength of indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, and the other eye with the strength of Western knowledge and ways of knowing. Two-eyed seeing. Again, if you have a Again, if you have a time, and look on the internet some videos in which Elder Marshall gives more details about this concept. That could be a good use of your time. But this particular idea about two eyes seeing inspired this drawing that Nicola. Uh, drawing that Nicolo Ishii, my professor, my former student, and I put together. So there is this ethno-mathematics as a forest, but those trees are interconnected and they share these nodes and they come from the same source. And I would like to try to illustrate this idea about. Try to illustrate this idea about two-way seeing by going back to the Haida hat. So, in the description of the Haida hat, SFU Museum of Archaeology gives this quote. And really, if you look at design a little bit closely, you see the change of pattern. But also, the quote mentions diamond patterns. So, what if you use GeoGebra and try You use GeoGebra and try to make those diamonds more visible. And I would like to use Geogebra to show you two examples of this two-I seeing. The first example   And another example using GeoGebra.   But this comes with the warning. This comes with the warning. So, what I try to demonstrate with those two examples is really that this Haider hat as a mathematical object really passed to call them a simple test of modern technology, geogebra in this case. But this comes with the warning, and I want to show you this quote by Kathy Sparrow from the Haida Nation. That was, she stated this. That was, she stated this in a different context, but I think applies in this case. That we shouldn't pretend that we cannot fully understand the cultural system. And this can go wrong so easily. So, when we are talking about these cultural stuff, we should be more careful. And also, there is another warning here, and that is by By Marcia Asher, an American mathematician and a leader of ethnomathematics. And she warns us, she warns us that when we analyze work in ethnomathematics, what we see can express ideas of our own. So I see that Haida had as a Hide a hat as a mathematical object with the symmetry, and I see that shape of one sheet hyperboloid because those are my ideas. That's a warning here. But there is a fact that if you accept that my ethno-mathematics as mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups, then that ethno-mathematics also reflects sociology. Reflects societal changes in that group. And I want to illustrate this with another example. And that example is this beautiful graphic, actually, by Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas is only 34 years old. And he's an indigenous artist from my part of the world, here from he spent all his life in Victoria. He spent all his life in Victoria or Vancouver. This is him in his own words. Buddhist and Hindu religions have done these beautiful paintings. They're always geometric patterns, and they're supposed to aid in meditation. And they're always kind of use geometric kind of optical illusions and things like that to like aid. Things like that to like gain your focus, and it's what it's supposed to be: the entire cosmos from a human perspective. So, I was on the internet one day and I came across all these beautiful mandalas. Right away, I saw the similarities between some of the mandalas and some of the traditional spindle worlds. Because Salespeople did a lot of floral designs that were also using geometry to design them. And so this was my first kind of cross-cultural piece. And I really think that that's a cool way to go now because, like Randy was saying, the world's getting tiny now. So you can study all the other cultures, art forms, and kind of mesh them together now. This is the first piece I've done, but it's definitely a direction I want to go in the future. And I've been taking a look at other, like kind of branching off into all sorts of other arts and seeing how I could use that and mesh it with. That and mesh it with my traditional sailors work. And here, so he explained actually what he meant by his exploration and inspiration outside of the Salish culture. And here he And here he explains his actually interest in Asher. When he finished his training with Rande, when he was confident enough into his skills as a sellish designer, he was still to try to do something in Asher style, tessellation. And And he claims that the problem was that he didn't have any further education in mathematics after grade 12. And he spent a few months staring in Asher's work before he felt confident to create something on his own. And this was published actually in 2011 in the Journal of Mathematics and the Arts. Dylan. Dylan Thomas and Doris Scharzchneider co-authored a paper about Dylan Thomas' work. And a big part of that paper is actually discussion of this graphic. And Schart Schneider describes in detail using mathematical, I'm trying here to highlight that. I'm trying here to highlight that mathematical language of Thomas Dylan thinking. And if you look at this quote here, you see that actually a quite complicated mathematics was behind this creation. Schart Schneider published this relatively recently. Published this relatively recently in a book about art and mathematics. So back to this try to make a visualization of these two ideas about ethno-mathematics and to right seeing. I think that this example of Of work of Dylan Thomas is showing that this goes both ways. Both ways. We look at indigenous piece of art and we are trying to recognize mathematics in it. That is one way. The other way, this talented indigenous artist is looking at mathematics elsewhere. Etnomathematics elsewhere to create a piece of ethno-mathematics that is a part of his own culture. So when I look at this image, I'm not which eye is looking above the ground and which eye is looking below the ground. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. That was very excellent. Do we have any questions or any comments for Vasily? Oh, Vasilyn, it's Susan here. And it's really interesting to think, there was a talk at CMESG way back in 2008 or something like that. George Escher, who was that. George Esher, who was M.C. Esher's son, lived in Nova Scotia and was an engineer there. And he talked about when his father came back from visiting the Alhambra in Spain just on the eve of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. And he similarly spent months and years just pondering sketches that he and his wife had done there. And he all, Escher also didn't. And Escher also didn't have very much formal mathematical background. And gradually, he started to understand how the patterns worked and be able to work with them, just as Dylan Thomas did with Escher's work. And Doris Schatzchneider was the link between, she was one of, she and Coxeter were the only two who took up on Escher's pleas to mathematicians saying, what am I doing mathematically here? And so she's one of the two people who talked to him. And now she's. People who talk to him. And now she's been talking to Dylan Thomas about his work. So it's a very interesting. Thanks, Justin. And I mean, one of the things that always strikes me about that is that you'll hear almost every mathematician, like professional, you know, research mathematician say, oh my God, I get all these letters from Crank saying they figured out how to square the circle and so on, and I just file them straight into the garbage can. I never even bother to answer. And I'm sure that, you know, it gets tiresome to get a lot of To get a lot of correspondence of that sort. But think about if Schatzchneider and Coxeter hadn't bothered to talk to Escher, there would have been a great loss to the world. Thank you. Other comments? Questions? I'm not an expert here, I don't know that much about this, but among these different groups of indigenous people, also are there kind of dialogues between their arts and the understanding of
