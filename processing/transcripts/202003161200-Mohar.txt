So, as the number is not changing, at least not rapidly, let us start. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I think it's an interesting idea to have a virtual conference, although, of course, it's not the same as It's not the same as being at the same place at the same time and having mutual interaction. And this especially holds for problems. So we're gonna discuss some problems. We didn't collect any thoughts in advance, so I don't know how many people will contribute problems, but I hope. Contribute problems, but I hope it will be lively. And then hopefully, some of you, some of us, will work on a couple of these problems by yourself, by your group. And of course, you should always contact the proposer of the problem to discuss if you have any progress on that and then make. And then maybe later in the week we will try to ask also for some of the feedback if you actually got somewhere with any of the proposed problems. So I will ask everyone to state your name once you start speaking, although we see most of the names on Most of the names on the computer as you logged in. And the rule for presenters would be you can either just start presenting a problem if there is a long enough silence, or you can volunteer through the chat. There is a chat button at the bottom, at least in my computer. At least at my computer, when you press it, I think you can enter and then just whenever you feel that you will propose a problem, you just enter this in the chat and then I will call you after we are deciding for the new problem to be presented. So let us start. Let us start. Who is the first one who wants to? We just had 25 problems in the previous talk, but I hope there will be some more presented right now. So who's the first volunteer? Nobody. Okay, we have the first volunteer is Nicholas. He said he can try and And please, Nicholas, go ahead. You just unmute your computer, so there is a red microphone. You unmute it and then start speaking. So, Nicholas has a technical difficulty. Just Can you hear me now? Yes. So here it is. You consider a grass. You consider a graph that can be partitioned into three clicks. And you suppose. Nicholas, can you turn your video on? Yes. Here, can you see me? Yes. So you consider a graph that can be partitioned into three clicks, and you assume furthermore that there is no C4 as an induced C4. There is no C4 as an induced subgraph. So, this is a class of graph, and the question is: can you color them in polytime? And there is a motivation for this problem. And I give a talk tomorrow normally, so we give more motivation about it, explain why it is. Explain uh why it is possibly uh of interest. Uh there is a question by Nina. So the vertices, the vertex set is partitioned into three clicks, and of course you may have edges between the click. It is a complement of a graph with chromatic number three, if you want. And if you if you don't exclude uh C4, it it is known to be uh It is known to be an incomplete to corrosive. So that was the problem. You have another question in the chat. I don't have the chat. From Jacob Fox. He asked if you do we need to color with the minimum number Need to color with the minimum number of colors. Yes, of course. The problem is finding chi. You want to? Yes, I want to color the graph in polynomial time. Yes, with ski of G colors. Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. Are there any Thank you. Are there any additional questions or remarks about this problem? So tomorrow we'll hear during Nicolas' talk a little bit more about the motivation and other and known results related to this problem. So I'm waiting for So, I'm waiting for the second problem. Yeah, okay. I'm wrestling with the Zoom here, but I'm trying to make myself visible and audible at the same time. Can you? Same time. Can you see me? Yeah. Good. So I'll tell you a problem then. This came from Dominic van der Zeipen sent it to me a few days ago and it's about colouring and I thought it was nice. If I take an ordering, if I order the vertices of a graph, if I just put the vertices in some arbitrary order, then you can greedily colour. You just start from the left. You just start from the left, and so this verdict would get colour one. You give it every verdict, you give it the lowest possible colour. So he'd get colour one, he'd get colour two, maybe he'd get colour two as well, and then this guy would get colour three and so on, and he'd get maybe he get colour one and so on. You can work from the left and just give everyone the lowest possible colour, depending who is adjacent to it. Depending who is adjacent to it, that you've already coloured. And this doesn't always give you the best colouring. But what about ordering the vertices so that it does give you the best colour? Yes, you can do that because look at the best colouring. Say the graph's four colorable or something. Then you just run through all of these first and then you run through these and the greedy. And the greedy colouring just automatically colours with the correct number of colours. These would all get colour one, and then everyone else would either get colour one or two here, and everybody there would get colours one or two or three. And that would be fine. So no difficulty here. But what he wants to do is get an ordering so that also every initial segment is connected. So assume the graph's connected. Can you find? And you find an ordering of the vertices that gives you the optimal, so the greedy colouring gives you the optimal colouring, and all the initial segments are connected. And I mean, he thinks it's false, I think it's false, and neither one of us can find a counterexample. So please settle back. It ought to be easy. Anyway, that's all right. That's the problem. Thanks. Okay, thank you. I have a couple. I have one comment and one question. The comment is just that these are usually called first fit coloring if you fix the ordering. And the question is, this connected condition, was there some motivation behind it? Keeping it? He was running a pass through the vertices and one rather pass, but a walk. Not a path, but a walk through the vertices, and he was coloring the ith vertex would be colored according to its neighbors earlier in the walk. So that's the same as first fit, except you want to keep the graph connected. Okay, thanks. Okay, I believe some people may have worked on this problem, so it's uh Mart, have you worked on this before? There are some results maybe on this already or not. Okay, Mark said not that she doesn't know. Okay. Any other questions or remarks? Or remarks about this problem? Okay, thank you, Paul. Please, we need a few more problems. Yeah, I have one. Yeah, please go ahead. Okay, so if you have a graph on n vertices in which all maximal All maximal cliques have size at least linear and n, so at least some constant times n. Can you find a set of vertices of sublinear size that hits all of these peaks? Would you be kind and maybe just repeat once more? I haven't caught everything. So, all maximum. Got everything so all maximal cliques are of size linear in n? Yes. Is it possible to find a hitting set, a transversal for all of the maximal cliques, which has size which is sublinear? This is an old problem of Paul Erd≈ës. Yes. Any partial results known about this problem? One approach I've had on this problem is to try to look at a random set, and I haven't been able to see how much that helps. But I think it's an interesting approach to try looking at a random set and see if it's a hitting set. And an instructive example for a random set is to think about if you take the complement of a perfect match. you take the complement of a perfect matching like take a complete bipartite graph and then take the no not sorry just the complement of a perfect matching so then um so you'll right um you have very small hitting sets but uh you're not going to find it's it's not clear how you would find them in a random way right you can assume for this that um uh uh So I'm trying to remember. Is it in the complement? There's something about the degrees here that allow you to. So if a vertex has few non-neighbors, as in this example, then you can use that vertex and those non-neighbors as a hitting set. And so you can assume that every That every vertex sees, misses only little o n, has only little o n non-neighbors. Otherwise, you're done. And so there's some assumptions that you can do ahead of time like this, and then look at a random set and hope that that might work there. But yeah, it's a great question. Thanks for sharing. Thanks for sharing. Okay, there was a remark by Nina Kamcho saying you could do it with any click size A. And then the question was: can you have a little of n divided by A heating set? And And so, is this known, or are there some counterexamples known to this? So, instead of linear in A, you can ask just clicks of size at least A, and then if you can do it with a heating set which is smaller than which is smaller in order than N divided by A. Than n divided by a. Yeah, so I guess you can think about triangle-free graphs and trying to hit all edges, right? Right, so you're thinking about independence number in triangle-free graphs. Okay, I guess this would would answer, right? So this. So, this yeah. So, also just a disjoint union of cliques. Take a lot of cliques all the same size and take the disjoint union. Then, hitting them, you have to have one from each clique. And that is N over A. That's N over A, right? Not little of N. Yeah. So the robots uh uh the robots could There was a question in the chat if Paul could repeat his argument on this note. Paul? Me, what do you want me to do? Well, in the chat appears a question from Carla. Not his question. Not what his remark, his question from earlier, if you could repeat his question from earlier. Repeat his question from earlier. Oh, the question, yeah. Okay. So the question is: is it true that for every graph, there is a way to order it, order the vertices, such that the greedy colouring you get from that ordering is an optimal colouring, and every initial segment of the ordering is a connected graph. So, I actually reviewed a paper related to this, and that's not the case. It can be at most. Not the case. It can be at most one more. I can send the link to you if you like. Oh, okay. Yeah, put your video on. I don't really know. It's by the mute button. Yeah, okay. There we go. Hi. Say it again. So yeah, it can be at most one more. You mean it cannot be more than one more? Yes, it can't be more than one more than the actual number of colours, but there are examples where you always need one more for the colour. Examples where you always need one more for the connected case. So I can send you the links, and there's a bunch of work on this. And yeah, we yeah, there are some nice questions related to this if you want. So one question which I quite like related to this is, so you have this connected order assumption, and now you have the minimum number, and now you can also ask about the worst case. So it's kind of like the Grundy equivalent, but then for connected. And now, for the normal chromatic number and the Grundy number, you can also achieve all the things in between. So, there is an order which achieves any sort of for which the number of colours you use is something in between. And this, for example, is not known for the connected. So, if you want to have a replacement question, then all right, thank you, thank you. Okay, thank you. Now, the following remark came from the chat, from the participants. Actually, it would be nice if everyone could write his question and so we would be able to email it to all participants after all. May I just ask everyone? May I just ask everyone who has or will be presenting problems during this problem session to email me or Paul the statement of the problem and then I'll collect that and email to everyone maybe tomorrow. Boyan, it might not be necessary because this video is visible on the BERS website. Be is visible on the Burrs website anyway, right? There, if we want to read the problems, if we want to hear the problems, we can just watch the video. Would you rather have it written down? Maybe, yeah, that's uh, that's easier. I'd rather have it written down. Yeah, all right, make this work. Okay, so uh Okay, so Marth has commented that she does know some results in concerning Paul's question related to what Carla said before. Mart, if you want to go and explain, please go ahead. Okay, if not, we'll just proceed with I have two more volunteers. We'll go with Sergei Norin for the first for the next problem. Sergei, please go ahead. Okay, hi, everybody. So, this problem is related to Luke's talk. It came from Luke's talk. It came from our attempts to extend our results on Hadwegus conjecture with Zisha. And it might be very easy. And if it's, well, let me just state the problem. I also wrote it down behind me. Does there exist Least some positive constant, possibly small, so that if we have a graph with kinetic number k, we can always find a subgraph which is well connected, epsilon k connected, and on top of that still has decent enough chromatic number, still has chromatic number at least epsilon k. So, if you just want connectivity, this is easier. But not losing kinematic number seems hard. I'm afraid there's an easy counter example. But if there is an easy proof, that would be very useful. So it replaces coverability. So it replaces Kavarabayash's result about minor about graphs which are critical with respect to minor and kinematic number, about their connectivity, but much more generally. So that's a problem. And you're just asking for a subgraph, not an induced subgraph. It's the same connectivity and chromatic number go up. It's equivalent by I mean deleting deleting ages doesn't you said this would be very useful. What would it be useful for? Well if we want to prove equivalent our result for odd minus If we had this theorem, we wouldn't have to work. Otherwise, we have to work with an awkward result which is kind of like this, but not as good. So, let me understand. So, the point was you need epsilon small? No, no, the bigger the epsilon, the better. I want connectivity. So, I have a large kinetic number. I want to gain connectivity. I want to gain connectivity without losing too much of the chromatic number. Okay. Do you know it with some slowly growing epsilon? Sorry, slowly decaying epsilon? No, I don't. I know it with an awkward notion of connectivity. Okay. Does it really have to be the same epsilon for connectivity? And well, it might as well be choose a smaller one. Sergei, do you? Sergei, do you? So it's true for minors. Would you be happy if it was true for odd minors? Is that, I mean, we already proved the result for odd minors. I want somehow a universal tool which it's a lot of work to do the odd minor one, and so you want to I mean it's it's a few pages. Yeah. Few pages, yeah. I don't know about odd minus, but I mean, it would be it might be nice, and we might know the answer, but I need to think about it. Okay, thank you. So, any other comments, Paul? Uh, just wondering: what's Sergey proving about odd miners? Can you do you have an analog of your? Minus. Do you have an analog of your theorem for odd miners? Or would you, if this step is done? Yeah, so it's already there's a pre-print out. So the proof translates to odd minus. So you get T force root log T? Yeah, pretty, I mean exactly what looks. Yeah. Okay, good. Okay, do we have other comments? Okay, do we have other comments uh or questions? Okay, then uh we'll go we'll go on with the next problem. So I have uh so far I just have one one more we would like to have more of you to offer to present problems. So now Present problems. So now, Jacob Fox. Jacob, could you go ahead? Yes. So in general, we know very little about triangle-free graphs. So there's a famous question about the Ramsey number of a triangle versus a clique, which tells us something about the independence number. But there are many innocent-looking problems about triangle-free graphs. Equivalently, in the complement, we know very little about. We know very little about independence number two graphs. And we saw a problem of this sort earlier. This is the problem of Paul Seymour to prove that they have a clique minor of size n over 2, which would follow from Hadwiger's conjecture. And the best known is still of the form a third plus little o one times n. So I want to just mention another problem that was motivated by the Yerdish Heinel conjecture. The Yerdish Heinel conjecture. And so it says that if you have a graph on N vertices of independence number two, then it contains a complete bipartite graph where one part has linearly many vertices, some constant times n, and the other part has some power of n number of vertices. Power of n number of vertices, n to some constant, and these constants are positive. This is a problem that some of you know well, but if we could answer that and some generalizations of this that seem like they would likely come if we understood this problem, it would improve the best known bound on the Artish-Heinel conjecture. So we'd have to prove several generalizations to get there, but But it would lead to better bounds on the Ardish Heinel conjecture, and there's been some work on this recently. And I think it's a nice question. So Liana mentioned that her internet was having problems. So I'm going to repeat the question. If you have an independence number two graph on Number two graph on n vertices, then it contains a complete bipartite graph where one part is linear in n size, so a constant times n, and the other part is a power in n size, some n to the n to the some constant, which is positive. So something like n over a thousand versus n to the one over. n to the one over a thousand and can you find such a complete bipartite graph in any independence number two graph okay please some more comments or questions about this problem Problems. So I can make one of the generalizations of this asks if you have for any graph H, so in this case, it's a triangle. A triangle. But more generally, if you have an induced H-free graph, does it necessarily have two sets, one of linear size and one of power of the number of vertices size, so that they're complete or empty between them. And the constants here depend on the fixed graph H. So this is a weakening of something known as the strong error to show. Weakening of something known as the stronger Heinel property, which may be true in this generality. Thank you. Yes. I don't have anything to say. Okay. Anybody else raised the hand? So, yeah, one more question, Sam here. I think I asked. I think I asked this question last year at Barbados to Paul and then later they so Paul and Maria and Alex worked on it and then they said that they proved it and then later they said their proof was incorrect. I don't know the status. The problem was that you forfeit the fixed tree as an induce subgraph and also you forfeit Indu subgraph, and also if we fit the half graph of a certain size, are they chi-bounded? And so you forbid the tree and the half-graph. So half-graph is do you remember, Paul? Yes, I remember. It was a bit embarrassing. We thought we had this wonderful. A bit embarrassing, we thought we had this one level proof and it was just nonsense. Uh, but yeah, it's a nice question. I'd forgotten about that question. Yeah, it's still open as far as I know. Okay, so what is half graph? It's uh so you have a two, so it's a it's bipartite. I mean, it's not really bipartite, you have a pair, pair of, so you have two n vertices where first vertex on the left is a j. Where first vertex on the left is adjacent to the only first vertex, second vertex is adjacent to first and second on the right, third vertex is adjacent to first, third, second, and third, etc. But you don't care edges between the left-hand vertices and right vertices, probably, right? That's the person. Okay, yeah, yeah. So maybe, maybe that's a good problem to work on. Any further remarks or questions? Okay, if not, I would be willing to close up this problem session and thanks everyone. Thanks, everyone, participating, and we invite you to come back tomorrow. I do have a chat question, which says that there is some existing material on Look Posters question. And you can see that in the chat. So, look, you can just by you face, I guess. So, we will not no need to discuss this. So, let me just, in closing this, ask Paul if he has some further announcements to make. And thank you all very much for the nice problem session. Uh, nice problem session, okay. Yeah, no, thank you, Boyan. Uh, no, I don't have anything else to say. Uh, thank you all for coming, and we'll do it so tomorrow morning at nine.
