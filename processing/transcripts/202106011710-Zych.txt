So, our next speaker is Magdalena Sig. Magdalena, the stage is all yours. We cannot hear you. Martelina, if you're speaking, we cannot hear you. Okay, yes, I've been speaking. Okay, yes, I've been speaking, being muted. Thanks. So good that I started with asking some questions. I realize there is some problem. Okay, so if can you can you see my screen and the slide? Everything is fine. Okay, perfect. So yeah, since time is short and I tend maybe not to be fastest, I will try to get the show on the road. So yeah, I'll be talking about So, yeah, I'll be talking about clocks and detectors and how we can use them to try to characterize or construct some notion of quantum causal structure. Maybe I'll just highlight I really enjoy our backward in time information channel because I'm giving this talk that happens on the 1st of June, on the 2nd of June. So, yeah, here's. So, yeah, here's okay. Magdalena, can you put it in slideshow mode, please? Uh, okay, this it looks like slideshow for me. Not to me. I see from Fabio. No, that's interesting. So, you do see my speaker mode, and I see your slideshow mode. Yeah, I've seen this happening. You can deshare and reshare for. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do, I do like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do I do like this. I'll share again. Maybe. I'll start the presentation before I share, and maybe that's gonna help. So, oh, okay. Much better. Much better. Um, I'm not sure whether I can actually change this slide. Okay, I can. So, I mean, luckily I'm giving this talk after many relevant presentations, so I don't have to really motivate much. So, let me just very briefly go through some of the touch points. So, this talk and the research comes from the perspective that in general relativity, The perspective that in general relativity, space-time is part of the dynamical systems. It's a solution to dynamical equations. And in quantum theory, in general, physical properties are non-classical, by which we mean, for example, they are not fully describable by some local predefined variables. And so, of course, we are all interested in the question what happens when we have both quantum and general relativity relevant. Relativity relevant for the description of all degrees of freedom. And there are different directions in which people think. Some people consider that quantum theory must break down if you would be in a regime where a metric would require to be assigned a quantum degree of freedom, be somehow quantum undefined. Then there are, of course, works that investigate the opposite, that in that case, what you would get exactly would be some quantum. Exactly, it would be some quantum notion of a causal structure. And yeah, there is the framework that has been developed by Julio and people in Vienna, and since then, many other people, for example, Kavan in Monash, that works with so-called combs or process matrices. And there has been an intuition that this framework can be relevant for quantum gravity because it speaks about. Speaks about quantum information in the absence of predefined causal structure. And so the questions I will be addressing, maybe I'll just put all these, would be whether we can give some explicit construction of a quantum and gravitational causal structure, so something that comes So, something that comes from both quantum and GR, how it may relate to the process matrix framework. I hope to be able to touch on the role of quantum notion relating to coordinates, so not quantum reference frames, but more quantum relations between coordinates in setting these up. And then I will describe some results that we recently got with Recently, I got with Rob and Joshua, who is here a PhD student. And I'll just highlight some specific aspects where we looked at some phenomenology of quantum states of space-time that are given by superpositions of metrics that are not diffomorphic invariant, which we think are genuine superpositions of space-times rather than superpositions of metrics that are diffomorphic. Maybe I'll have time to explain. Are diffomorphic, maybe I'll have time to explain why I think there is a big difference there. So, yeah, let's see how this goes, especially how I fit with time. So, we are taking operational approach to events and to characterizing space-time using quantum systems. And so, Alex has been talking about describing composite particles as clocks, so I don't have to talk much about. Clocks, so I don't have to talk much about this, and one can describe such a system using Hamiltonian, where you have some internal energy that describes internal states of the particle that can keep track of time, and some external degrees of freedom that can describe how this particle moves. You can use Hamiltonian, Lagrange, or mixed framework. I'll not be talking about these other two, but just to highlight there are various ways to use these names. Use these dynamics. And some results that you can get if you consider such a particle in a fixed background is to consider such a particle, a clock, that moves in superposition of different word lines. And so therefore, intuitively, one would say ticks with different proper times in superposition. And so we set up on this sort of quantum twin paradox of its 10 years already. If it's 10 years already ago, I cannot say anymore in our recent paper, and then investigated various scenarios where the superposition of paths and proper times is because of special relativistic effects. So exploring, for example, motion of an electron or motion of atoms. So there are some references to those works. And also, we've looked at analogous effects where you use position on a photon. Use position on a photon of a photon on a path. And this was a joint work also with Tim Ralph. So, for those of you that followed Philip Walter's talk, I don't have to explain much because they are trying exactly to probe this kind of effect and situation. But so in this talk, I will be interested in going beyond this picture of quantum matter on a fixed background. On a fixed background. And I will particularly be considering just some aspects of such scenarios, namely that relate to causal relations between events. And so just to remind ourselves how in JIRA we could define events in a meaningful way, for example, taking some physical systems like clocks and defining events relative to those systems. So a particular proper time of a particular So a particular proper time of a particular clock can define an event. And so here there is a situation where a third tick of clock A defines some event A and third tick of clock B defines event B and these clocks are initially synchronized. Now if in absence of any matter these clocks are identical and are synchronized on some hypersurface as you move forward in time they will remain synchronized and so those events those third clicks would remain spacelike while if you Like. While if you prepare some state of matter in the past of the region of interest, you can time delay one clock relative to another. So, if you bring a mass closer to one of the clocks, you will slow down it ticks, and you can make it such that you can, in fact, exchange a light or even non-faster-than-light signal between those events, so those third ticks. And in this way, you can prepare a different causal relation between. Relation between those events. So you can prepare by preparing a state of a mass in the past of the region of interest, you can prepare event B to be in the future of event A. And of course, if you put the mass in a different configuration, you could arrange conversely that event A will end up in the future light cone of clock B. Now, I'll give a reference in a minute where you can find all details of. Where you can find all details of that. So, this relies on the fact that usually when we describe a metric, so here given by line element, we like to put the, so for example, some post-Newtonian metric, we like to put the mass in the origin of the coordinates. And then a coordinate that appears in the metric would be position of a system that you might be interested in describing, position of some event. But in fact, what Ami-Wan is actually doing is describing a relative position. Is describing a relative position of the system to the mass. And so nobody stops you from considering coordinates, according to some observer, who assigns a particular coordinate to the mass as well. And then you can have metrics that are produced by mass in different configurations that would have different coordinates relative to matter. And so you essentially here we are unpacking the fact that one is always talking about some relative coordinate. Always talking about some relative coordinates, and you can change the position of the source mass of the metric as much as you may want to change a position of some test particles on the metric. So, just a brief description of what are all the elements here, but it's in fact not so crucial. If you do that, of course, you don't have to accordingly describe your energies also in the Describe your energy. So, also in the Hamiltonian, you would use appropriately both the coordinate of a clock and the system. So, now these are the coordinates relative to some, in this case, distant observer. And they describe the same situation that you would describe fixing the mass to window region and just using a relative coordinate. It's just in this way, you have explicitly coordinates on both systems. On both systems, and here, apologies for a bit change of notation. So, the internal energy just swapped to omega. So, the importance of this is that now we can assign quantum states in this sense, effectively quantize various degrees of freedom. We would typically quantize matter on top of the metric, but here we could quantize the position of the mass, and in this case, effectively describe. Describe metrics that differ by translation, for example, by choosing different positions R for the source mass. And that's what we're going to do. So we'll consider these two configurations that I described, or to each of them we can assign some quantum state to the configuration of the mass, and we can in principle consider superposition of those. And if we consider now that we have some. Consider now that we have some additional system, I'll call it target, at which some operations are performed at the events defined by the clocks. Then depending on the configuration of the mass, we can end up with those operations applied in a different order on this target state. So, this is all very conceptual. And again, I'll refer you to the paper for all details. They will not be really crucial to. Be really crucial to follow the main arguments. So, here the point is essentially that by recognizing how you can describe quantum matter relative to other matter, you can quantize the scenario such that you'll produce quantum configurations of the metric, effectively, that would lead to different time order of performing some operations. And this, those of you familiar with the COMS, the process matrix framework will recognize immediately as a quantum switch. So you have some quantum degree of freedom that controls the order of applying some operations on the target system. And so this is the first result that I would like to highlight that by considering this picture of relative coordinates, you can construct a gravitational vertical. Version of one of the processes from the process matrix framework. So there is the first hint that there is indeed some link between the framework and some quantum gravitational effects or aspects. Now, if you take two pairs of clocks and two pairs of these target systems, you can end up entangling the order between Up entangling the order between events B, you have some pair of events B and pair of events A, and you can entangle their order and show that it will violate the Bell theorem that is formulated for time order of events in the analogous way as standard Bell theorem is formulated for local classical variables. And so, this is the reference where you can find all the details. So, this is to say that one not only can give some heuristic description of some way to To use quantum in gravitational effects to construct some scenario that looks like non-classical space-time, but you can actually provably show that you'll end up with the so you'll end up with probably non-classical causal structure of events that are defined operational in that scenario. So you'll end up Operational in that scenario. So you end up with a temporal order that is probably non-classical in the sense of violating some Bell theorem. Now, the interesting thing here is as follows. So we've been considering some coordinates of clocks in source mass, and we've been considering a situation where we prepare some different configurations of the source. Different configurations of the source mass around fixed word lines of clocks and how it would lead to some entanglement between order of events. And I think hinting, you know, we are constructing some non-classical space-time in that case. Now, you could really rephrase all these, all the probabilities that arise from this scenario as coming from. As coming from a process in which the mass is fixed, but you prepare some entangled configuration of all your clock systems. And I will not go through the proof. You can find it in a reference that I will highlight in a moment. And so, what happens here is that the causal structure of events is still non-classical. It still violates the Bell theorem. But one, maybe you'll be prompted to. But one, maybe you'll be prompted to say, well, that space-time is classical. And so, one of the insights, I think, that one can gain from this rephrasing is that whenever you have superposition of metrics that are related by some coordinate transformation, by some default homomorphism, you can always rewrite the whole scenario in a way that you have fixed metrics, so, in the sense, fixed configuration of a source mass. Of a source mass and some appropriately mapped, possibly complicated, but still just quantum state of some probe systems. And so you can see a proof for that in this archive paper with Tim and Fabio. And the proof there is very generic, so it doesn't specifically talk about just translations or specifically anything about this particular belt scenario, really. Particular belts and are really very, very generically linking cases where such a mapping exists. And so the question is, obviously, if there is any way or if there's anything that distinguishes the case where we have superpositions of metrics that are not related by any coordinate transformation, where you cannot play this game of This game of relabeling method that it looks like it's on a fixed background because the two metrics you are superposing are generally different solutions to Einstein equations. And I will swap gears here a little bit. Maybe Akim, you can tell me how am I tracking with time? You're at the 19 minutes mark, so you have six more minutes. Okay, I should be able to get. I should be able to get to my main point. And luckily, Edu just introduced and talked and talked about all the relevant bits about Androidavid detectors, because the second part of my talk will use an Android detector as a system to gain some insight perhaps about those scenarios. So I'll really just maybe put up this slide just to remind you: we are talking about About in this case, a two-level system that is coupled to a field. And usually, we consider, well, by saying we, I actually say you, people that worked on many different aspects of the physics related to Android detectors. I think until recently, one can fairly say that usually one was considering those detectors on some fixed classical trajectories, and there has been really just. Really, just recently, works that were looking into cases where one includes the dynamics of the center of mass degree of freedom of this detector. And so, yeah, I hope I didn't miss any relevant reference. I guess Akin can point out if I missed anything. So, these are works of Akin and Nadine and their collaborators. So, what we So, what we use to gain our insights is to consider a situation where we use some quantum degree of freedom that correlates with some particular aspect of the detector. So we don't include the full dynamics of the center of mass, but rather we quantize, for example, trajectories of the detector. So, this is similar in spirit to considering a Mark-Zender for an atom, where you consider superposition of two semi-classical trajectories rather than. Rather than double slip with an atom where you include the entire dynamics and all paths, so to say, of the center of mass. So I want to add some additional control degree of freedom to the Hamiltonian, and if it correlates with the position of the trajectory of the detector, it can be seen as some model for the quantization of the center of mass. And here has some references for. And here has some references for results that have been obtained with this particular control. And with Laura, Steven, Just Alessio, Rob, many other people, we also looked at what happens when you assign quantum control to the switching function and how it To the switching function and how it can impact entanglement harvesting. And you've hopefully seen Laura's talk on that. So, in this talk, we want to consider this control degree of freedom that doesn't control anything particular about the detector, but about some parameters of the space-time in which the detector resides. And so, here's the reference and the approach. Approach starts very similar in all cases. It picks a mutual state, and just for simplicity, we consider always a balanced superposition of various different orthogonal states of this control degree of freedom. That's, of course, absolutely not necessary, that just some convenience choice. And so, in the end, we are interested in a state of the detector conditioned on a state of the control. And so, if you prepare and measure the control, And so, if you prepare and measure the control in a superposition, you will end up with your systems effectively being subject to different evolutions that are controlled by this degree of freedom. So some controlled superposition, quote unquote, quote, of channels. And we also work perturbatively, so we are looking at final state of the detector when you trace out the field to lowest order in the coupling. Lowest order in the coupling. So the main elements of interest are probabilities, excitation probabilities. And if you unpack everything, you will see that they are given by two types of terms, terms that come from the same amplitude of the control degree of freedom, which I have a classical interpretation always. It just means whatever degree of freedom the control is controlling, just fixing classical value for that degree. For that degree of freedom. And also, terms that we call non-local that describe terms that come from some off-diagonal terms in this control, where you have, for example, terms that come from different paths. And in this case, I'll talk about different interference terms between different properties and different parameters of space-time. So all these things are in the end. So, all these things are in the end encoded in Weitman functions, so correlation functions between fields. And we are working here with the sitter space, so just that it's a simple one with a constant curvature. Simple but not trivial, maybe like this. Let's put me like this. And so, the main in the end digging down the main physics, the main The main physics, the main interesting effects are in this geodesic distance between the trajectories tracked by a detector. And so here, maybe the important point, we are talking about one detector and these correlations are between superposed amplitudes of the detector. And they can be superposed because the background is in superposition or because the detector is in superposition. I'll try to tell you how that can be. So this distance. So, this distance from the particular space we are considering has this particular simple form. The sitter space can be parameterized and can be visualized as this carpebboloid, and you have curvature L, and Rd is the radial coordinate of the detector. And so these coordinates Z and Z prime are evaluated at the tau or tau prime proper times of the detector. All these details. The detector. All these details are not really important, just to give a little bit of insight into how this is all set up. Then you can parameterize this hyperboloid with some radial coordinate where your detector will be sitting in our case. There is the curvature L and some angular variables. And so the important thing I would like to stress at this point, and maybe I'll just make a little pause. Just make a little pause so that this will sink in. We are in the question time already. Okay, yes, I'll be, I'll be, I'm actually in, I'll just highlight here the results. So we again see that we have a, like in the case of the entanglement temporal order, we have, we see that what we can harness is that we can have a common parametrization for For not just different trajectories of a detector, but also for the different metrics. So we can use this parameterization for different L's or R's and thetas and phi's, and this works formally in exactly the same way. And non-local white mind functions would depend non-trivially on those different choices for the different degrees of freedom that we might want to put in superposition or in this subject to this quantum control. And so if you put curvature. And so, if you put curvature and the radial coordinate together as a quantum control, you actually can end up in a situation where even though your superposition describes superposition of genuinely different metrics with different curvature, by entangling your detector with this degree of freedom, you end up, from the point of view of detector transition probabilities, you end up in a situation that is In a situation that is analogous, I mean, equivalent really to cases on a classical background and even in flat space-time. If you just to propose or assign this quantum control just to the curvature degree of freedom and your detector sits in some fixed, independently fixed trajectory. In this case, there is. In this case, there is. I highlight whenever you have different curvatures, there is no diffomorphism that maps one spacetime to another. So, in general, you get different transition probabilities from the cases that would have some equivalence that I highlighted in the previous slide. But there is actually still a particular choice of parameters where such an equivalence will exist. And I find it interesting because it's perhaps less surprising for people. It's perhaps less surprising for people that understand well that white one functions, 2.11 functions give information about just some aspects of the metric. But from the point of view of the conceptual aspect, many people would say that one cannot even start describing physics when you have superposition of metrics with different curvatures. Well, here, not only can we give some characterization of what a detector would see. Of what a detector would see in such a metric, but we even find that it may be indistinguishable from a single classical space-time. And so, maybe I'll just put my summary up here and I will not go through it. The talk was, I think, sufficiently assured that I don't have to do it. And maybe there is still one minute of question. If not, I can take questions in the discussion session. And thank you all for attending. Thank you, Marteline. Yes, there is a minute of questions. Yes, there is a minute of questions. I think this all clappings so far, yes. Martelina, you also still had some business with Alex, right? That I interrupted you unfairly earlier. If you want to raise that issue again? Again, um, yeah, well, if there are no questions here, perhaps maybe I uh rushed a bit. I hope um there was anything that one could take um out from the talk. The question I had to Alex. Oh, maybe I can ask Meg Delina a question first about her talk and then to give her some time to discuss this. Yeah, or Flaminia, did you want to say something? No, no, I just wanted to say, are we moving to the discussion? Because I have to switch the recording, right? I think we can move to the discussion. I think we can move to the discussion and then maybe start with Magdalena's own questions and questions to Magdalena, and then from there move on to the broader discussions. So I think we can move this over and I think I hand over to Rob at this point.
