To data mine, for instance, the special correlation, the cross-species correlation, but also we want to then refine those estimates using the observation constraints themselves, right? So using a cross-validation method, et cetera. So looking at the performance of the forecast based on different assumptions on those correlations. Those are two complementary approaches. We need both a prior, but also probably a fair amount of observational. A fair amount of observational constraint because the prior information is clearly not enough. We can use proxies, et cetera, but there is a lack of data currently. Does it answer your question? For instance, the CO2M mission instrument we will measure jointly CO2 and NO2. So we will, for instance, use that also to provide constraint on the prior error correlation between the species. It's a kind of species is a kind of information we can use observation of observation we can use thanks yeah short question and then after that we switch to question for all especially Lori until N. Yes sorry Nicola it's not completely clear for me what is the cross-correlation model you use to so to reduce the You use to so to represent the cross-correlation species, it's not clear. The model, sorry, who is speaking? Sorry, it's Elijah Van Google. Okay, okay, so I would like to know exactly what kind of cross-correlation model is used to represent the correlation between spaces in your geometric. Oh, we read an explicit matrix. Matrix for this correlation. Now, we are looking at basically a correlation between CO2, CO, and CO emission and NOx emission. And so for this part of the matrix, just going to be an explicit representation of the matrix, as opposed to the spatial correlation, which is represented by a wave-legged basis, as you know. And for the temporal correlation, we'll be looking at Gaussian. Gaussian function basically to model the correlation. So the tricky part for the cross-species correlation is really not the model, it's more finding the right values because we have a very small dimensional B matrix in that case. And just sorry, Usha, I just have one point more about the geometry. Yes, and how do you specify the variance of the error variance for each species? Variants for each species. Yeah, just to clarify, I'm talking about the emission prior. I'm not talking about the state here when I'm talking about the correlation between NO2, CO and CO2. So I don't know if it was clear, but yes. Yes, but you mentioned that you use the dynamics to incorporate both information about the source in and the state. And the state. So is there any uncertainty given on the chemical spaces for the state? Uncertainty on what? Sorry, I didn't get that. On the chemical spaces for the initial state? Yes, the cycle. Yeah, we do have. So basically, the idea, this is not what we currently use, but what we are developing is also a way to use the ensemble approach. So the idea is a bit costly, but we'll come up to. So, the idea is a bit costly, but we'll come up with another posterior sampling approach, and that we will integrate that in a flow-dependent B. So, at initial state, we could have the correlation also across species. Thanks, Ferrari. Okay, thank you, Nicola. So, let's open the floor also for a question for Laurie. We have a few more minutes, also for Nicola, a few, but especially for Laurie, I think she didn't have enough time. Yes, Enrique? Yeah, it's a question for Laurie. It's a question for Lomi. I got lost with the ideas fractionating the thing with OH. I have only second-hand knowledge of OH, but what I know is it's very critical to measure. It's very dependent on the radiation and on the moisture, and that's not the full list of the problems. So, what is the idea? Getting better in one point by using something which is highly difficult to specify. So are you asking about why would we try to do isotopes if we don't even know the OH? Is that the gist of the question? Or isotopes? Yes, that's well understood, but just take OH. Well, I mean, we don't. Well, I mean, we don't have that much choice when it comes to OH, you know, because you're right, we cannot measure its distribution or its changes in time directly. What we have is chemical models, which give you information about OH and how it changes over an annual cycle, and possibly some trend information. But those are highly uncertain models. So, we usually use something like methyl chlorophore to Methyl chloroform to correct or scale the model distribution. And methyl chloroform is something where we've also measured that for a long time over decades. And it's something that we feel we know its emissions fairly well. And it's only destroyed by OH. And so we can back out a correction to the model climatology for using that way. But there are some caveats. Methylchloroform is. Caveats. Methylchloroform is regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Its concentrations have been rapidly dropping, and now it's approaching being useless for this particular activity. And so my colleague Steve Monska, who is the expert on measuring manufactured gases, is looking for species we might use instead to correct our modeled climatologies of OH. It is an unsuccessful. Of OH. It is an unsatisfactory situation, but we, you know, this is what we have to work with. In terms of the fractionation factor, that is something we measure in the laboratory. And I'm just saying that, you know, we should go back and measure it again so that we can figure out what the right number is. So does that answer your question? Yeah, to some extent. OH is species. Scavenging a lot. Yes. It's totally different depending, I guess, in gluten area than it is in a remote area, where it's maybe less competitors. Yes, I mean, remember though, that the methane lifetime is about nine years. So, yeah, so that helps us. But when you talk about shorter-lived species, I would imagine that the problem you're bringing up is much more of an issue. It's much more of an issue. Yeah, but how long it's passed, would it be 12 years or 10 years or so? It may pass different chemical scenarios. Yeah, there's no question that OH is a problem. Chlorine is also a problem for me. Or you, I suppose. Okay, so yeah, thank you very much. We will go to coffee break in just 10 minutes. And then after that, we have And then after that, we have time from 1.30 to 2 p.m. after the lunch, we can use for discussion. Good. And Nicola, you'll be back so we can ask you more questions. Pola? Yes, I didn't find the unmute button. Okay. No, no, yes, I will be here, yeah? I will be here, yeah? From 1:30 to 2, 1:30 your time. So, what's kind of late? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, 8:30, right? Something like that, I think. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. So, ESA is okay, so I can. Eastern is okay, so I guess it's in the UK. I mean, at some point, I will go to bed, but I think it's only totally fine. Are you in the UK? Are you in Parliament? I mean Bonn, actually. So one hour more actually late. Yeah. Yeah, we have we have three stations now. We have Bonn and we have uh Bologna uh in addition to the headquarters in Reding. I don't know if you're aware of the three. We I don't know if you're aware, but we with with Pete. Is it? Okay. So uh yeah, so let's have a discussion more uh from one thirty to two. Then we go for a short uh coffee break and then we come back at 10.50 with uh thank you I could see the next question.
