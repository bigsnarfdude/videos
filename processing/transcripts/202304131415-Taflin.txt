Okay, so our next speaker is Johan Petman from Burgoyne and he's going to talk about the bifurcation of complex oceans. Okay, thank you. So thank you for the invitation to talk here. So I will speak about the bifurcation of a complex core shoe from an analytic point of view. Point of view. So, for me, it's like a story of a failure. I work a lot on this problem, and I have a very few, a very small result, but I will extend the problem. So, well, first I give some definitions, technical ones. I I will say NAPS, but it will always be well not uh maybe a polynomial automatism of C two, but uh things of these forms. Things of these forms. So the important point is that the stable, you know, the unstable manifold is horizontal and the stable nanofold is vertical. And so from the work of Betforce, Smiley and also Julich, you have some measure, technological measure attached to such a system, and also you have a less deep experiment. So it's a hyperbolic measure, so you have a positive Yapin of excellent and a negative one. And they prove that the positive one is always greater than log D, where D is the degree of the mark. So this is quite standard. And also now you can look to that in families. So we consider families of such maps and where And where that means that when you have some map like that, where it is on morphology in both both coordinates, and well, in my case, M will be almost always the unit disc. So one dimensional family of N maps. And uh there's the difference family to the this function uh give you a permissible uh map on uh the parameter space. On uh the parameter space. And so uh when you do complex analysis, then you have such a map. So you you want to consider the well the first current associated to it and then maybe there is some dynamical information that you can obtain from this current. So I think it's a quite natural question and well that This nature is not in the literature, but I think a lot of people have seen the same thing. So I think the support of this current is you take the parameter where you have some operating tangency, you take the which unfold, I will explain it in the principle, and you take the And you take the closure of it, of this, and you obtain the support of the perfurtation current. So, homogeneous tangency, so just right. You take a saddle point, saddle point, and it's so you have a stable manifold, yeah, and an unstable manifold, and the looking tangency, just a point of tangency between the two. And the unfolding is just like when you move the parameter, then it's not persistent. So you have some perturbation when you have two points. In the real case, you have some perturbation where you have no points. But well, in a complex setting, you always have you still have two points here. So I will draw this this way. This way. Even if normally it has to be a graph. It's clear. And why not? So for the conjecture, so it's in fact it corresponds really to the right of the Mark 1 maybe about the support of the issue. The support of the defecation currents in for rational maps when you use also the result of magnitude of activity of base. Because when someone asked why meso method has to tangent sequence when it's really the same thing, when the you when you capture uh measuring the trap, you will have a you can in some parameter you have a promotion to just. You have the commodity to just. It's really the same. Not exactly the same application. It's quite close. And also in higher dimension you have a similar results in P scale. And well. And so bifurcation trends is related to bifurcations. And in the setting of phenomaps, it was studied a lot by the It was studied a lot by Java and Lubich. And in particular, you can extract from their results that you have this inclusion under the assumption about the modality of the I only only consider the converse inclusion and also Also, a remark that for rational maps to be able to study the difficulty and also the parameter space using harmonic function is really something important, in particular for some people. And it's a very strong tool to study the parameter space. So it's a good motivation to try to obtain these results. And so the parameters engine. So the problem is that in general it's not easy to prove that some current is not zero on some operators. So in the previous case, for polynomials for example, you have a very simple formula for the Lyapunov experiment using the mean function of the polynomials. So from this it's quite easy to prove the similar To prove the similar associate results. And in T1 and in PKI, you also have a close formula, not for the simple one for the lamp nuts, but for the DDC, I will not explain these things, but we have a close formula, it's quite easy to use. You can use it to prove the scenario. And you have also a close formula for the exponent of NOMAPS, so given by Betford and Fanley. So I will not explain, but this is the grade function, this is the Galilee, and just this is the critical measure, the construct. And to explain it, so maybe I can draw something. Joshua. So you have P2 like that. And you have at infinity, you have some attacking point, and you have some strong foliation associated to this attacking point. And if you take a generic point for the measure, so you have the The equilibrium measure, you can take a point, a general point, and you have the second manifold here. And you just count, well, you put the arc masses on the tangency between two tangency. You put the dirt mass on each tangency, and you, like that, you obtain some. Obtain some measure. The problem is that when you have defortation, shadow points for the measure will defort. So you cannot follow this information. So it's kind of... It's not easy to deduce the conjecture from the formula. So this is the situation. But well, some people are. Some people are able to use this formula. So you cannot prove the continuity of the Leopard exon using it. Well, just prove the lower, semi-lower continuity. But as it's a PA stage function, it's enough. So this is all for the inner math. So when you are not able to solve the problem in some To solve the problem in some setting, you can you try to do a larger setting, so no, so uh, NO-like maps is some generalization of NO maps. So, I will work on this setting, but after I will put very strong assumptions so that I'm able to prove one summarize it in the direction of the conjecture. So, what is So, what is in a pump? So, it's a complex innovation. It's not like the A1. It's just you take a B-disk, like that. And on the B-disk, you must there you have two types of boundaries. So, you have the horizontal type of boundary. Yeah this is the original number and the Haskell one and with this you can well first I define what is the horizontal horizontal analytics. An analytic set. So, what we call an analytic set, it's some analytic sets inside the V Disc such that it doesn't cross the boundary, the horizontal boundary, something like that. So, horizontal analytic set, and you can compute the degree, you can define the degree of such analytic set by Analytic set by picking some horizontal graph like that, like vertical one, and just count the number of points with multiplicity. And because it's horizontal, it will not because of the slide. And when the the two is one, I will call it a horizontal graph. So it's just uh it's a true graph. So horizontal graph. So horizontal math. So it's clear? I will I will use them quite a lot. And for example, so the definition of complex emojis, so it was very close. Well, very close or the same, I just remember. From the cross mapping? The same? Yeah, maybe I prefer this definition. So just take So you just take your your B disk and you consider a sense map of some neighborhood of the B disk and what you are asking is that you want some panelists so that the image of the V disc intersect itself on the V disc. And you want that the image of the Of the vertical boundary was outside the beginner and the always and one something like that. And this is the vertical the that's table. This is the this is some uh This is the this is some uh some um innovative map and uh you can define the delivery of such a map by taking some you take just one horizontal graph, you look to the image, so in by sixty something like that and uh after you take the intersection with the article one and you just count the number of. And you just print the number of five. And well, the obvious observation is that if you take an enormous and you take a very large B disc, it will be an enormous of the same degree here. But the degree here is the algebraic degree of the NOLAC. So it gives you. So it it gives uh so and uh almost all the dynamics will lie uh in this in the B D states. So it's study the NO maps or the associated uh NO light maps it's uh about this and uh so all the term of um the Betfords Meidi and Lubish was more or less general generalized by uh Jambo. So for example, it's exactly the same theorem. It's exactly the same theorem, except that we have no Lithuan bond on the Lyapunov exponent. So the importance. And also if you consider family, you have the same. So you can look to the same exactly the same project here and try to prove it in this setting. So wha when when Well when one uh one important uh fact is that uh your map is you can prove that your map uh gives uh some action on the set of curves so but uh for that you have to take some graph from some point you take uh some um horizontal analytics Horizontal analytic set, you take the image and you remove all the things which are outside B. And if you do that, you can continue the process otherwise. So you can take some, for example, you can take something like that. Like that, you take the image like that you remove the You remove the part this, and you take the image, and if this one is of the P2, then the next parameter it will be of the G4. The two is the degree of F and so on. And you can also have the you have the this you can extend this section on the horizontal currents and uh like that that's you can you have two two uh three currents. Two currents, like positive one and negative one, and obtain the equilibrium measure in the same way. So you have a special kind of inner light map called the workshop. So it's just a map where so you ask that the So you ask that the the image of uh horizontal graph is a so it's not a a single horizontal graph because uh it has degree D, but just that it's a pinion of the horizontal graph here. So it's quite easy to show that using some hydroxy for example to show that it's automatically hyperbolic. It's automatically hyperbolic and with regards with a controversial set and it's projected to shift. So you take some graphs like that. The image, so this is in W2. The image is the inherent of two graphs, and you continue rule like that. And if you do in the converse, you have you take a very You can take the three images, and it will have the same property. And at the end, you have a see the counter set. And so now I will work with two assumptions. So I was there some family of inner-like maps like that, with parameters by some complex reality. And I ask that I have a compact set inside my parameter space such that outside of it all the maps are on the offshoot. So and whatever, and I want some maps to be not the original in the develop, otherwise it's not very interesting. And so it's not that So it's not very difficult to see that this assumption will imply that the order of space is one-dimensional. And also it's very effective, but you still have several interesting examples. So for example, you can consider the full family, the full family, when you take all the polynomials of some degree and with some and with some Jacobian and you move the parameter with a very on a very large disk and so for example you should do this with a large disk so you have a you know map on the large disk it's a you know like map and you should take the point C here so the the critical value will be uh if it's far enough If it's far enough to be outside the disk and you will have some option, if you do the... Well, this will be the... So this is the component area of... So N0 will be this, and will be this. And on the boundary, near the boundary, I mean we only have four shoes and And you will here it will not be a penal like that. Shoebo on the left. Oh, sorry. But the squares in the middle is not anal like? No, no, but it's not anal like because if you take a graph like that, the mesh will be some horseshoe. Sorry. Sorry. It's not arshole. So sorry, it's not of yes, sorry, sorry. It's an alike. All this, it's a family of anol like maps. Sorry. It's a set of. Thank you. Other questions? In order for MZ to be map, you have to respect the values of the A. Not in the you can take any kind of you just take a very large piece. You just take a very large V-disc. It's okay. If you take a very large V-disc, it's okay. In the first assumption, number one of the first assumptions, we assume that M-node is a button. So you you can do the well here you can take well you fix uh you fix A. You fix A and you will move C. Yeah, it's one. What I say, but it will only work for one parameter family. So one dimensional family. So you fix A and remove C. But you can, it works for any kind of thing. And so when you have this, accurate the This actually, the conjecture is not easier in this setting than in the general setting because if you are able to prove that with this assumption the support of the location current is the homotopy tangency, then you will have it for the full family. So it's not easier, but wait. So another example. So another example, it's that when you here if you take a very small Jacobian, then you can find in the parallel space some loops, small loops, in the Archo notice with non-trivial uh well non-trivial uh uh loops. So it it was a conjecture of uh Ibar and uh so And so I don't hire proof, like you can have definitely many one such looks in the actual looks. And these pictures from the past this so I also give some features, but it's it's quite maybe less mathematical, but more beautiful. And you see probably you have a lot of looks okay and another example is if you now you prostare a map with a remote clinical agency which unfolds and from this you can create a familiar nano-like map with a good property. So how I will do that? So, how will you do that? Take a smaller rectangle like that. And you start to iterate. So, if you take some iteration, so the stable manifold will contract in this direction and the unstable manifold will expand in the direction. So, you have this something like that. And if you more attention, you will have this the image of. The image of a large power of your rectangle will be like that. And I remove the unstable manifold. And now if the instable manifold moves, you will have some parameter it will be some orchid, and for other parameter, it's not a so when you have a So you always when you have a the unfolding of some remote interfacency, you can always apply the same I will get, that's for a measure associated with this in monologue. So maybe what are the ah okay so before I give the statement um so first um I have to define some one number, well family sequence of number, so can explain it. So you have your family like that and have your disk and for example I will just define it for any just define it for n equal to one. If you take the horizontal graph, the image will be something like that. Something like that. And you can fix some fixed garage carryoff. And when the parameter changes, the this tenet set removed. Internet set removed, and I will count the number of parameters where I have a tangency between this vertical graph and the image of. And I do that for the first time, but I can also use it for any kind of size. And you have to take into account the multiplicity. So, one way to see that. So, one way to see that is to, when you have the family, you have some map from the parameter space time the disk, time the this is some sort of this is the project device of the tension space of it. So you have the You have a map like that, where it's just the density of the parameter space. You apply the dynamics on the on B and you apply the differential of the dynamics on the project space. And what? When you have some graph or some analytic set, you can lift it on this space just by everything. Just by thinking, well, you take x times the parameter space and you take the tangent space just the lift. If you remove the parameter space, it's just the the lift of this uh of this analytic set to the tangent space, and then you draw Drap the toilet with air. And what? And so this number is just an intersection number between the intersection number of in this case between the the lift of the vertical math with the image distance. And the assumption I put and the final ensure that the it doesn't depend on the choice of V of H. So just something like that. So for some parameter, well you have your image. Your image, when the parameter moves, you have some tangency and you count the number of tangents. And so the theorem is that there is a very simple and explicit formula for the under the assumption under family. You can compute explicitly this number, it's very simple. And also you can Uh and also you can uh you have a explicit uh link between the the mass of the delocation current and uh this distumber. And if you put the two together, you have that the mass is exactly the distance divided by d. And what I say is the simple assumption that some matter is not true. Uh, I'm sure that this. Ensure that this number is positive. So you have two different parts. And so the second one is something about currents. And in fact, it's not very difficult to have in a more general setting. But the first one, I really need the assumption near the boundary of the the parameter space. Otherwise I'm not able to to influence the the synonyms. Sorry, I'm puzzled. These two formulas are the same, but the right-hand side is different. What? What? The two formulas have different right-hand side. Which one? There's a constant missing. Yeah, it's add, yeah. There's a constant, yes, T1. Yes. There is a T1, yeah. So it's uh, I will give the proof of this. So it's just T1, and I say we have this, and so at the end you have a simplification, and the mass is uh so I cannot say where the where the the the the support is. The support is, but I have some criteria to prove that the current is not zero, and we have an explicit formula for the mass. Okay, so the proof, so I will try to explain the proof of the The proof of the first result, and maybe the second one, but and so it's some variation about one aspect of Giovanni Jubich in the study of differentiation of anomalies. So now if you take, I don't take a fixed analytic set, I take some family of analytic sets, horizontal or some horizontal or vertical, as you want. Horizontal or vertical, as you want, and I can lift it to the scales again, except that so now at each parameter you have the organized set and you have the tangent space above points. And this move when you move the point. So it's not exactly the same set. This is one family, and I give it for a fixed one just before. And now, if you have two things like that, horizontal one and the vertical one, you can consider this number, which is the number of tangency, well, the number of tangency between these two familiar phonetic sets. And as before, you can see it as the intersection number of these two. The intersection number of these two lifts. And so the proposition is that if you have two families like that, such that, as in my assumption, near the boundary, there are just union of graphs. So we can have something complicated. But when you are near the boundary, it's just a union of graphs. Fini finite union graph. graph, finite graph. And then you have some explicit formula for this number of tangency, like some sort of right-hand formula for the derivative. So you have the degree of the x times the tangency of y, but with a fixed horizontal line. Horizontal line, horizontal line, and after all you have the same, do we have fraud tangent C of X with some vertical graph? And with that, you can prove the formula. So, just to explain the assumption is that if you take a near the boundary, it's just pinion of glass, and inside you have a And inside you have a property things. And this assumption and the proof are quite easy. So first, the assumption I put on these sets and shows that in fact I can do different I can do differentiation of these two sets. I can do some P or things like that. In particular, I can compress, for example, the horizontal one, I can compress it a lot such that it looks really like a lot of vertical graph, a horizontal one, with some singularity buttons. And I can do the same with the vertical one. And after I just, and after I can move, I can put them where I want. And if I put them in a some proper way, I will be able to count explicitly the number of tangents. So I will give a picture. So this is the life standing moving with the parameter. With the parameter, but I can decide, so I can compress in this direction and in the horizontal direction for the x. And if I choose correctly where I put these two things, then locally you can see this. That when the tangency, when it's some singular problem, that's on the A point of ramification of the projection of the set is moving with the parameter, then it will cross a degree of y times partial lines. So like that, I can obtain this part of the, I will obtain a degree of i and the number of the tangent. Both the function C between X and Y. And this is when the modification of X pass through Y and I have the same thing when the modification of Y pass through X. In fact, I can compute it explicitly. Okay. Okay, fine. And now from this result, you can compute explicitly. Well, you will have some accuracy for you for this number, of tangency, which comes from the dynamics. So this number, it's just this, well, I can see it like this number, and it's invariant by. It's invariant by different morphists so I can apply the dynamics, well the inverse of the dynamics, and use the use the formula I just obtained, give this, this. And this one is very easy to obtain, it's D to the N. This one is also D to the N. And this one I can remove it on the other side. And so I can I know all this all of this I have this is D this is D to D N this is T1 but this is D and this is just T N. So I have some applicant formula which is very easy to sorry and uh this five I miss this second point Some of them now it's the end which is missing. Sorry, but I asked my students to go. So, well, by that I have to give you the proof of the first part of the semine. And for the semant one, so it's in two minutes it will be finished. And the second one is more with the And the second one is more with the it's not very hard, but just to give some idea. So you can define the green current of the map at each parameter. In fact, you can also define the green current in family. This is the one-one current, positive close one-one current on this pace. And you also have the measurement family, but this is not a measurement. Family, but this is not a measure, it's a two-to-part in a three-dimensional space. And so I have this, I say that this converts to the mass of the B flotation measure, the B flotation current. And so I say it's just some intersection number, and well, intersection. And well, intersection number is the mass of some current. So you can apply the dynamics like that. And because of the assumption, because of the assumption, in fact, I can I have a current like that. Maybe I quickly take it more than two minutes. So So uh for example, well I will explain it for this one. You have uh you have the the vertical graph and at each point you put the vertical quantum space. But because I can do uh deformation, I can well if I retract this kind to that, oh well to the That? Oh right to the so T plus is like that, plus like that. I don't know how it is, but I can just do some perfection. I can push this on fine and this mass will not change because I have the assumption of the value. So and I still put some this is the dark matter. This is the dark mass and the horizontal direction. And I do the same for this current. And I start to see the measurement. So you can see that it's not difficult to see that the action of this current is the three by action of this part. Of this part, and then it only acts on the tangent phase. So you have the this measure, well, this current times something coming from the Thompson dynamics. And you can see that this, well, this is the potential of this is the logarithm of the differential some formula from coming from. some formula from coming from the differential of the power of f. And as you are you wedge with the the majority family, in fact this is just the DDC of the function of this function and its run. Maybe with different with different value of A and B, we can prove that it will converge to the Yap nut exponent. It's the operator exponent. So, this is the bifurcation of our and that's all.
