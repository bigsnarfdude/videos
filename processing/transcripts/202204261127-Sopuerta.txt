For inviting me to talk about this. So, this is a work that we were doing while working on perturbations of black holes and other objects that are not black holes, motivated by trying to test the black hole paradigm with waves and all these things. So, we have to review a bit, look at the perturbation theory in more detail to understand how you decouple equations and all that. And sort of what I'm going to explain today. So, what I'm going to explain today is the outcome of this, let's say, site research that we did. So, the outline is I will first review a bit the physical processes around black holes that are interesting, that we can describe using perturbation theory. I will do some review of black hole perturbation theory focusing on non-rotating black holes. And then the concept of mastery functions and equations, how we derive them, and then I will. Derive them and then I will tell you about what symmetries you can see in these perturbative equations and what can be useful for. And I will end with some remarks and conclusions. Okay, so this is the work of the this work has been published recently and this is work done with Michele Denzi, who is a postdoc here in Barcelona. And these are the two papers where we have explained the results. The results. Okay, so there are several processes that are interesting that we can discover in perturbation theory. In particular, you can divide them into groups. One is a scattering of a black hole. So something is coming from infinity and then interacts with the black hole and then leaves and then you see some excitation there. In particular, if you are in a rotating black hole, you in principle could extract energy from this process. The other possibility is that things The other possibility is that things that come near the horizon, right? Like in the case of Hawking radiation, then in that case, you have some modes that are produced near the horizon, and then they try to leave and they have to go through the potential of the black hole. And if near the black hole, the spectrum is black body, then when they go through the potential barrier, then it becomes a Barrier, then it becomes a gray spectrum, so and we can then try to compute the gray body factors that produce that. And the other one is quasi-normal modes, so I'm not going to explain too much because the previous nice talks already talk a lot about them, but just to remind you that they are modes that are purely going at infinity and going into the horizon. And so you can see this as three oscillations of. Three oscillations of the black hole, and this is the diagram for Swarzil. So, but just to many people have talked already, the previous people have talked about what is useful from modes, but let me remind you that also one of the nice things about detecting quasi-man modes is the fact that if you detect a number of them and if you assume the Nocher theorem is valid, then Theorem is valid, then when you have more than two, then because both the frequency and the decaying times depend only on the mass and the spin of the black hole, plastic astrophysical black holes, then you can do tests of the black hole paradigm and even of general relativity by detecting them. But for this, we need a lot of synatronoise ratio. And there have been some recent work where they have tried to look at what are the capabilities. try to look at what are the capabilities of current detectors. If you inject, let's say you inject signals, well, you have modified the frequencies and damping times with respect to the GR values. And as you can see, we are still not at the time where we can make really strong statements, but probably in the future with third generation and also space-based like LISA, we are able to go beyond. We are able to go beyond. Okay, so black hole perturbation. The idea is that you want to study situations that are close to the extra solutions of black holes in general relativity. And this is useful in some situations in the case of binary systems, binary black holes, in particular in the case of high mass ratio and close. And close separation, where actually perturbation theory probably is the best option in order to model these systems, right? Because non-electrical relativity is too expensive at that time, and Posingtonia is no longer valid. So, perturbation theory plays a very important role there. And yeah, I spent some time working on this. So, then, okay, let's focus now on perturbation theory of swarthy black holes. So, we have here the well-known form of the metric. But well-known form of the metric, and we know that it satisfies Einstein vacuum equations. I put a hat to indicate quantities associated with the exact black hole with the background spacetime. And okay, so the physical space-time is the perturbation is just given by the background plus some perturbations, and this induces a perturbation in the Einstein tensor, which In the Einstein tensor, which with some algebra you can write in this form, where now the H-bar is this trace-reverse metric perturbations, H is the trace of the perturbations with the background metric. And then you have this, well, box is the typical D'Alambertian built with the background metric. And here you have this L vector, which is, you can see, is the divergence of the trace-driverse metric perturbations. So, which when you choose the Lorentz gauge, all these second terms cancel, and then you have a beautiful set of wave equations, which are coupled because the Riemann tensor of the background mixes in principle in general the perturbations, but at least they are wave equations, and you can do very nice numerics with this formulation and other things. Okay, so the fact that the So, the fact that the source black hole has spherical symmetry means that it has this work geometry, where you have a Lorentz, a true two-dimensional Lorentzian manifold with this metric, which is the TR sector of the source metric, and then you have the two-sphere, and the work factor here is the R-square, so the aerial-radial coordinate. And thanks to this, we can expand the performance. The perturbations in scalar vector and tensor harmonics. So, the scalar spherical harmonics, you already know them. And the vector spherical harmonics, you can build them by just taking covalent derivatives on the two spheres. So, you have two sets of vector spherical harmonics with even parity and odd parity. And, well, here, so we have used the volume element or sphere. And in the for the tensor, And for the tensor spherical harmonics that you need for the metric, these are the symmetric sector of tensor-spherical harmonics. So you have one that is basically the trace, so it's proportional to the metric of the two-sphere with the scalar spherical harmonics, and two other that are real tensor ones, and one is even parity, and the one is of parity. And just remind you that under parity transformations, even parity harmonics. Even parity harmonics peak a sign that is minus one to the L, and odd parity ones peak a sign that is minus one to the L plus one. So then in general, you can then expand the metric in as the stam over harmonics and over parity. So the odd parity part is here. So you only have the vector and tensor part, while the event parity, you have everything. So you have three, in general, you have three metric parallel versions for the old parity. Three metric perturbations for the parity and seven metric perturbations for the even parity, right? And then, if you put this inside the perturbative Einstein equation, then you can, by using the properties of the tensor harmonics, you can rearrange them in this form, right? What you see again, the scalar vector and tensor harmonics. So, basically, it means that you have seven equations for event-parity perturbations and three equations for all parity perturbations. Okay? Then the other thing that is important is in which gauge we do the computations in once in general you want to simplify things. And basically the gauge, what it means here is the gauge appears because you need to choose a way to identify the background space-time with the physical space-time, right? And there are many ways of doing this. So each way of doing this identification is with the ages. And a gauge transformation is then basically the composition. Then basically the composition of one of the gauges with the inverse of the other one, and these are the different gauges themselves. Okay, so then this more commonly is when people pull back everything into, for instance, the background space-time, and then you can see the gauge transformation that looks like a coordinate transformation, although it's not exactly a coordinate transformation, and where you can identify the And where you can identify the coordinates from one point to the other with a difference of a gauge vector, which is the generator of the gauge transformation. And then this induces a change in the metric perturbations themselves that looks in this form. So you can actually, given that the, well, you probably know the when you introduce all these perturbations in the Einstein equations, the perturbations decouple for each parity and they decouple for each harmonic of each parity. For each harmonic of each parity, so you can analyze the gauge vector, the gauge transformations for each harmonic and for each parity, right? So, here is how you can decompose the gauge vector. You have, in the case of even parity, you have a vector part and a scalar part, and in the case of odd parity, you only have the vector part, right? So, three components in the even parity, and one component in the odd parity. So, you have the four components of the gauge vector. Of the gauge vector. Okay, so and this is, and then you can compute how the end each of the harmonics of the metric perturbations transform and the undergraduate transformation. These are well-known formulas. Well, here I have introduced the covalent derivative on the Lorentzian sector, the TR sector of the background method. Similar with all parity. And then what you can try to do is to look for quantities, combinations of the metric perturbations and the derivatives that do not. And the derivatives that do not change under X transformation. So, for instance, in the even parity case, you have this tensor and a scalar that are X invariant. And in the other paradigm case, you have this vector. Okay? I introduced these definitions. Okay, so now let's look at the master functions and equations. So this started with the work of Regian Wheeler. Work of Rigi and Wheeler, who they were studying the stability of black holes, and because the Einstein pertures equations were complicated to solve, they tried to do something to simplify it, and then they found combinations that decouple the perturbative equations in terms of a function, which is called the master function. And actually, it turns out that these master functions are designed this simple wave equation that you use here. Equation that you see here, where box two means the Lambertian is this Lorentzian metric, and if you expand it with respect to the bug with the typical coordinates of sources, then you have this operator and with the typical Rigigwheeler potential. And it turns out that the Rigigueller, you can reconstruct the Rigi Wheeler master function in a Kitchen-Bendian way. Okay, so although they did it in a They did it in a particular gauge, which is the regular gauge, where you put to zero some of the metric perturbations in a way that you fix completely the gauge. And that's very useful. So you write it in coordinates, we have already seen in previous talks. This is a one plus one wave equation with a potential. Now in this case, it's in vacuum, where this R star is a top-to-ass coordinates that basically sends the horizon to minus infinity. The horizon to minus infinity, and here you see the potential that in a more in the usual form that you see in most of the literature. Okay, and this is the master function. So we had to wait until 1974 to find the same development for the eventality perturbations by Cerilli. I didn't find a picture of him. And here you see the potential. And here you see the potential is much more, looks much more complicated, although we see it's not so complicated. And then, and the master function is the so-called Serily-Monkrey master function. This is the gauge invariant form of this master function. And you can see it's a very similar equation, right, as the previous one for all variety developed equations. In the regular gauge, it has this much more simple form. So then the example. So, then the summary of master functions and equations will be the following. So, they satisfy this wave equation in one plus one dimensions. So, for the odd parity, we have the rigid well. And the other one that is independent and is a bit different is the Kernigan prime manglief, which is very useful in the case you want to do calculations of energy fluxes or angular momentum fluxes for gravitational waves. And in the MPIT case, we have the same. We have the self-imonkey function. Okay, and this is in case you write them in the typical coordinates. So, some important facts about this is that to remind you that the master functions are gazing variant. And it turns out that because of this, in part, all the physical quantities associated with the perturbations can be computed only in terms of the master functions. So, you don't need to reconstruct in principle the metric perturbations like energy flux, angle and fluxes, the ambient flux. Fluxes, linear momentum fluxes. All this can be computed only once you know the master functions. In central gauges, like in the region gauge, you can then reconstruct the rest of the master of the metric perturbations in terms of the master function. This is useful, for instance, when you want to compute other quantities, like for instance, the cell force in the case of stream mass ratio binaries, because the cell force itself is not x-invariant, but we need it to do the final physical computation. So you need. Physical computations. So, you need in those cases to reconstruct the metric perturbations. And all these developments, although we have been doing this in vacuum, in principle, if you add some energy momentum content, most of the developments here, you can follow them the same way. The only thing is that now you will have some source tennis that will depend on the type of energy momentum content that you put. Okay. So, then the question we asked ourselves was because we. The question we asked ourselves was because we wanted to do something similar but not with black holes. It was what is the most general master function that you can have and how you can derive this in a more systematic way. So by looking at the master functions, we realize that they are basically linear combination of the metric perturbations and the first derivatives of the metric perturbations. So we are, well, first of all, all what we have done is in a completely general gauge. So basically, what we assume. So basically, what we assume is that the Mojinal Master function is going to be a general linear combination of the metric perturbations and the derivatives, and that the coefficients, because in principle they have to be constructed from the background, and our background is static, it will only depend on the gradial coordinate. And then we will impose that this master function has to satisfy a wave equation of the same type, but we are not going to say anything about the To say anything about the potential, we are going just to impose this, use Einstein equations, and see what happens. Okay, so this is you do it in a computer general race, it's convenient to use computer algebra systems to do some of the calculations, although part of the calculations could be done by hand once you understand how things work. So, in the case of parity cases, the most general master function that you can construct has this form. You see, you have like nine terms, well, prime is ideal. terms where prime is is ideal derivative and dot is time derivative while in the in the polar in the even case it's a bit more complicated you have now 21 uh terms so it's uh um okay so then the idea here is to to to introduce this in the wave equation impose that this satisfies a wave equation and then eliminate uh all the possible second order and third order derivatives that you will get using einstein All the derivatives you will get using Einstein equations, okay, and then once you have eliminated all the possible derivatives, you enforce the divanishing of the subject terms, right? And in this way, you find all these coefficients in both cases. So, I'm not going to put any, I'm going to give you the result. So, the result is that there are two different branches of possible master equations. One is what we call the standard branch, which is because it's since Which is because it's essentially contains all the known results, almost all the non-results that you will see. For instance, in the OPAT case, it turns out that the most general master function is a linear combination of the Digiwedel and Canikam-Prime Monster master function. While in the even parity is a combination of the Celimon Criff and another master function that is new, we can find it in the literature. Find it in the literature, and you can also write in a covariant way with respect to the two-dimensional metric of the background in this way. While the potentials are in the old parity case, are the visual potential and the UVM case is the cellular potential. So nothing new about the potential is the same. Okay? But then there is another part. Well, something that is interesting is that the Kerrigan pipe mode, well, the Rigid Wheeler is the time they, sorry. Is the time sorry? The 10 derivative of the Canikampine Moncreef gives you the regular weather, and the 10 derivative of the Serine Moncreef gives you this new master function. So now it's like we have closed the circle in this standard branch. Okay, so the other branch we call it the Dalblue branch, and I will tell you later why. And this is a completely new branch in principle, although by some studies of people like Anderson and Price, we knew that this should be That they should be part of these branch, which were the most general master functions now can be written in this way. So, the odd parity one, as you see, is a combination of the near combination of the Kanigan prime moncret, and then something that is a function that multiplies the Kanigan price moncrife master function, and some other function that is not a master function, but is a function of the metric perturbations. I will tell you a bit now. Perturbations, I will tell you a bit now, and similar with the event parity case now with the ceremony. Okay, and this sigma out and sigma even are functionals of the potential. So the potential is not fixed. So in this branch, you can have different potentials. Okay. The only thing is that these potentials, the oct and even parity, the potentials, have to satisfy this differential. To satisfy this differential equation, this is a second-order equation, it's a non-linear equation where the delta v means the difference between the new potential and the potential of the standard branch. If it is odd, it will be the residual, and if it is the even parity, it will be the serial. Okay, so and x here is the tortoise coordinate. So, basically, this completes Completes, let's say, the phase space of possible master functions and master equations for perturbations of Swarzil in vacuum. So now let's analyze a bit this phase space, all these possibilities. I mean, what is the connection between them and why we have all these possibilities? So just to remind you that what we found, right, that we have this. what we what we found right they have this standard line so with the master function is a combination of the of the of the non-master functions setting for the even pi decays and the potentials and the non-potentials and the diabo lines okay well we we can we have freedom in in well we have set and freedom in in the in the potential given by by this differential equation so then we are going to see that this that the this master These master functions are master equations are connected by drawbuttal formation, and the first thing I'm going to tell you is what is a drawbut transformation. So in general, the drawbutter formation is not introduced in the time domain. So because here I have a wave operator. So in general, it's introduced for, let's say, a Sonicer type operators where you have passed, let's say, from the time domain to the frequency domain. But what we have seen is. But what we have seen is that we don't need to do this, we can do it also in the time domain. So basically, a double transformation here is if you start from the left, you have a wave equation for a function phi and a potential nu, or b. And then you go to another master equation with now master function psi and potential v and where. And when the master functions and potentials are connected by these two equations, then we say that these two master functions are connected by a double transformation. And you see, the transformation of the master function involves a derivatives of the master function itself, and the potential involves is just an additive addition of a function g. G is what we are going to call the Dalbu transformation generating function. Dalboot transformation generating function. And in general, if you just introduce the transformation and you force that this is a double transformation, then the generating function has to satisfy this Riccati equation, which here we call it a consistency equation. Okay. Then now this is the Carlos. Sorry, what was the C again on the right-hand side of the Dicati equation? Oh, sorry. I already got your question. Oh, sorry. Yeah, the C is an integration constant. So C is an emeritus constant. Sorry, I didn't say that. Okay, so then we have this landscape, right? We have the standard branch of parity, standard branch event parity, the blue branch of parity, and the B branch event parity. Okay, so we can connect, let's say, We can connect, let's say, the solutions of the odd parity in the standard lines with the non-parity by this generating function, which, as you see, is the difference between the Serilli and Regiabulli potentials integrated with respect to the torque plus coordinate. And this is an elaboration of a result that already Chandrasekhar knew because Chandrazeka already found the transformation from the regi Guiller to the Selili equation. Equal to the Salili equation. Okay. Okay. So then, but now let's look at the other, how the other sectors are connected. So now what you can see is that in the case of the from the standard run to the Davo branch, in the Opal D case, or in the event party case, it's the same. You just need to do the same, a similar uniting function, but now instead, now is the Function, but now is that now is the difference between the new event parity or odd parity potential and the non-parity and even parity potential. So this is very similar and this generates, so from this generating function, you can pass from the equations of the standard branch to the Winds. So basically what it means is that all the landscape of master equations are connected. Are connected via the Talbot transformations. Okay, so as I said, already Chandra Secret found this transformation in the 80s. And recently, Gran Pedakis and collaborators, and Eurov also, they also commented on this work. They realized that the transformation is a double transformation. And now we've found that all this, the whole landscape of master equations and master functions. And master functions. Okay, let's now look at the same thing, but in the frequency domain. Okay, so we have been working in the time domain picture, but now let's consider a single frequency mode, right? But making this decomposition. And then we have this now Seldinger operator or Selinger eigenvalue problem. So, and let's consider an eigenfunction of this Zinger operator with a given eigenvalue omega. A given eigenvalue omega. Then, what you can see is that by taking the logarithmic derivative of this eigenfunction, you can construct already a generating function that generates adorable transformation. That is the Riccati equation, this consistent equation is automatically satisfied for this when you make this choice. Okay, so what this means. Okay, so what this means is, and this means essentially is that you pass from a Schrödinger equation to another Schrödinger equation, but that has with different potentials, but with the same eigenvalue. Okay, so and this is the way in which already Chandra Secretar at the time showed this spectral character of star formation. And this is why the spectrum of Cosina Malm. The spectrum of cosinomal mods of the odd parity sector and the retirement sector is the same, right? So you compute the cosinomal modes with any of the potentials and then you get the same thing. So now, well, this is also an interesting comment. Is that the actually the button functioning function that connects the Function that connects the Rigibull and Seli-Moncree master equations can be generated by from one of the generatical special solutions of the Rigibuller equation. I mean, that you can see here, but you have a purely imaginary frequency. And in this case, we have an analytical exact form of the Law Jettian function. And then you can see by hand that this transforms from one equation to the other. So it's very simple. Very is very simple, okay. So, actually, uh, another interesting observation is that the rigulia and the Cerilli potentials can be written in this form. Well, basically, as you see here, although when you see the expressions, they look very different and the Cerilli looks much more complicated than the Cerilli one. In reality, you can write it in terms of the generating function. And the only difference between them is the sign in the gradient of the generating. It's a sign in the gradient of the generating function, and then alpha is this constant here. And this is a reminiscent of what happens in what people call supersonic quantum mechanics, where you have a degenerated description of a quantum system. Well, you have two potentials that gives you the same spectrum, but the potentials can be written in terms of this, let's say, superpotential. Let's say superpotential G, which in our case is the Labour transformation generating function. So, here there is a connection between what we, the Labourer transformation generating function, and what people in supersymmetric quantum mechanics calls the superpotential. Okay, now, so then let's look a bit at consequences when we have a problem, a scattering problem, where let's say that a solving equation. Let's say that the Schrodinger equation has a well-posed Struliubil problem. And in this case, because the potentials are positive everywhere, then we don't have a discrete spectrum. We only have a continuous spectrum, so we only have scattering states. Okay? So, and these are not normalizable states. So, let's see. To show you that there is a connection with the this is a big of a jam with the Corte-Véde-Brigg equation that you know appears as you know that appears in the description of solitons. So basically the solutions of the of the questions, some of them, the ones that describe solitons, the shape of the solutions do not change in time. The solitone is localized, so it indicates at infinity or approaches are constant. And one thing that Kruskal, the same Kruskal of the social extension and Sabuski realized by doing simulations is that although this is a non-linear equation, after the interaction, non-linear interaction of solitons, after that interaction, let's say that the final state of the solitons was Of the solitons was very similar to the shape and form of the initial ones, right? So then, this is when they started the study of this equation and all the methods of invest scattering methods and in the system were derived. Okay, this is a question you can find it in other physical setups, in particular in plasma physics, which is what motivated the Which is what motivated Sabuski and Kruskal to study this equation. So now let's go back to our Zödinger equation and let's consider now a deformation of the equation. So we are going to introduce a deformation by an extra parameter, which I call it tau. So we change the potential, let's say the wave function, and the eigenvalue so that we have a new question where the So, that we have a new equation where we have this tau dependence, uh, and we are going to assume that the wave, the wave, the wave function evolves according to the following operator, so that the sodium operator and this operator form a Laxper, which reproduces the Corte-V-Dev equation. So, this is a typical construction in which you can derive a number of interesting equations in numerous scattering theory by constructing this. By constructing this square. Okay, now with all these ingredients, you can see that the deformation introduces the following condition that is telling us that if the potential is the form, so the potential of our master equations is the form according to the cadre following the cadre equation, then we must have that either wave function, when the wave function If the wave function want the wave function to be different from zero, that the eigenvalue, the frequency, is independent of the deformation. So, basically, what is telling us is that this cadve flow is preserving the spectrum. So, in this argument, in particular, we can apply this argument to the quasi-normal mode frequency. So, under this transformation of the potential following the flow, the quasi-moment frequencies will not change. Will not change. This is very interesting. So, already, and this has a very nice number of interesting results, which there is a whole literature about probably many of you know about them. In particular, I'm going to quote some results that Lax already showed: that in the case of equations that can be written as a Lax spa, then you have an infinite set of integrals and. And actually, Gardner showed that this first integral is associated with symmetries of the Calibri equation. So, there are infinite symmetries of the Caribbean that makes it a completely integrable system. And Takharov and Fadeyev showed that actually this Hamiltonian formulation of this complete integral system admits canonical angle variables that can be constructed from the scattering data of the Zodinger equation. So, there is a deep connection between the Srodinger and the Kaleider. The Zoding Galaxy and the Cadet equation. So now let's consider, let's go back to our scattering problem in our case. Let's consider the typical static behavior for minus infinity at infinity. So we have, let's say, a package that comes into the potential from infinity. Part of it will be reflected and part of it will be transmitted, right? And A and B are the typical volume of coefficients from which you can compute. From which you can compute reflection and transmission coefficients of this. So you can show that under the Cadillac flow, they evolve in the following way. In particular, the coefficient A do not change, and this generates a transformation law. And actually, this transformation law, if we go write the wave function in this asymptotic form, where then the coefficient A can be can be recovered in this limit. In this limit. Following a result of Tajarov and Fade, they show that the logarithm of this coefficient can be expanded for large frequencies as an inverse power series. We can see that then this conservation law brings us an infinite number of conserved quantities, the quantities that Gardner and other people already found. And the important thing is that. And the important thing is that, well, I'm going to tell you, is that these concept quantities basically are differential polynomials of the potential. So basically, you take polynomials that are in the potential and the derivatives, many derivatives, and from this you can doing these combinations that we can find them iterative from the Zodinka equation. You can find the You can find these integrals and the corresponding quantities. It is possible to show from the KG properties of the potentials and this relation that the even integrals that corresponds to the real part of the potential vanish and we are only left with the odd integrals. Then, if you go back to the Swinger equation and you use this, introduce this, what you can see is that for the standard branch, the potential is the same for the Selenium potentials because the difference, you remember, was at this gradient. Because using that is a gradient and that the generating function decays sufficiently fast at infinity and to minus infinity, then the Infinity, then the integrals are the same, and you can see that all the change of cadet integrals are the same for the two potentials. In China Secrets book, there is already the suspicion that this is happening, and actually some of the first Cadillac integrals are shown. So, in our case, what we have also analyzed is what happens with the other branch, with the David branch. So, then you can see because the W branch, the potential, you are adding a gradient of the generating function, then you can. The generating function, then you can it's easy to prove that also the cadet integrals for all the potentials and all the master equations that we have in the Wranch also have the same set of Cadillac integrals. Okay, so but this is just you want to find this is the from here you can find a recurrence relation for these integrals and how to compute them in the case of a general potential. So and basically that's what I wanted to tell you about and let me just finish with some To tell you about, and let me just finish with some remarks and conclusion: it's like first of all, we have shown you a complete picture of the phase space of master function equations that describe perturbations of Schwarzschild. Well, we have found some new, a new even parity master function for the standard case, and we have found this other branch of potential master equations, the Davo branch. And we have seen that. And we have seen that all of them are connected by Davou transformations. And thanks to this, then all the set of quasi-normal modes and also Cadébay integrals are the same for all of them. So, which is telling you that the potential in itself is not the most important physical quantity, but this physical quantity can be more reflected into the frequencies and also into the calibration. Frequencies and also into the Cadave integrals. So basically, we can say that in this phase space of master function equation, there is this hidden symmetry, you like it, which is the Dalbu covariance. Well, this is what I said before. And well, for the future, I mean, what we want to see, what we are working on is we think that we can use. We think that we can use all this structure to have computations, for instance, of the gravity factors, which typically either you use approximations using WKB approximations or you need to make complicated numerical calculations. But we think that by using all the symmetries and the calibrate integers, we can have nice approximations to them. We would like to see if something similar can be done with questionable mods, although it looks a bit much more. This it looks a bit much more complicated, and so still we don't have a way how to do this. And well, finally, think about how if this has any extensions or implications for, for instance, scale black holes, other matter fields, and maybe other theories of gravity. Although we know that in other theories of gravity, this spectral thing between odd parity and even parity is. Between of parity and even parity is broken. So it's maybe that is a special property of general relativity. Well, I think that that's all what I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Okay, so we're open for questions. Any questions for Carlos? Maybe I'll start with the first one. So can you, does this also apply to the climate? Does this also apply to the transformation that I want to listen in the question? Could you please? Sorry, could you say again? Can you hear me now? Yes, now, yes. Sorry. So I guess that the transformation for the harper-polar slicing that Rodrigo talked about, that also fits into this framework, right? It affects to what, sorry? So the transformation to the hyper-law slides that Rodrigo talked about. Learning slides that Rodrigo talked about. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That should also fit into this framework that you presented, right? Yeah, actually, it's something that we were thinking is because, I mean, I know that José Luis, looking at the papers of José Luis, that when you do the haploid transformation, then for the quasi-normal modes, they are not anymore. They are not anymore unbounded. And yeah, and it could be useful to see what happens. Although in this case, the rattle will change, but in principle, it's a transformation in the background. So yeah, I think it can be done and probably most of the properties will be preserved. Could we if that's true, could we conclude something about the relation between the two calculations that again could be represented? Okay, we could present it and we should look at things like that or between our calculations and the calculations so between the instabilities that we could talk about. Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, but for that you need to, I mean, let's see that the set of potentials that we have in this work, all of them, I mean, it's like, I think really you have a one parameter set of potentials. It's not that you have You have an arbitrary amount of potential. So basically, you have a one, I will say that by looking at differential equations, you have a one parameter family of potentials. So they are not completely arbitrary. So these potentials, they are going to give you the same frequencies. But maybe by analyzing, I mean, one of the things we want to do is to analyze the resolvent of the sonic operator, just where. Well, you can analyze the quasi-mama mods, and maybe there we can get some information. But yeah, we haven't started this study yet. Well, it seems to me it's going in the orthogonal directions, isn't it? Because I mean, it seems to me that what you are doing is quite different from what this instability analysis of. Because what you are doing is, I mean, all your potentials are kind of, you discovered a hidden symmetry. You discovered a hidden symmetry, and so all your potentials belong to a certain class which are equivalent to the Schrodinger equation and to the to the standard, you know, to the standard Schwartzhield. It's not going to be perturbed Schwartzhill. You are exploring Schwartzhield only, not kind of something which is with an external perturbation on Schwartzhield. So it seems to me that the two things are quite different from each other. Yeah, in principle, I quite difficult. Another thing is that whether you can use some of these methods. Use some of these methods to study other potentials that are not in this family, right? But that they won't be really related by a Darboux transform by just definition, because your potentials, you obtain all the potentials that you can obtain by from Darboux transform, right? Right, right, right, no, no, the potentials in this family will not be related to the ones that produce this instability, right? Okay, and and then. Right. Okay. And then another thing was about, I mean, you've got, as you say, you've got a space of these potentials, and then you've got this group acting on it, the Darbu group, and then you're looking for invariants. And you've isolated some, which is really these frequencies, which Chandra had noticed before. But do you know that there are not others? Yeah, well, all this cadre integrals, they are functionals of the potential. Potential. So, and the calories are the same for all the families of potentials. So, these are infinite invariants that you have. Okay, but those invariants don't have direct interpretation in terms of what I'm physically interested in. Is that correct? I'm not clear about. Yeah, the question we are asking ourselves now is what is the meaning of these kind of quantities? I mean, I have recently somebody came to us and said, Oh, could be this. Came to us and said, Oh, could be this related to log numbers. I don't think it's related to non-numbers because, in physical numbers of black holes should be zero. But what I can tell you is, I mean, as I said, I like to distinguish between the situation where you have a scattering process and a free oscillation like a cosmonaut mode oscillation, right? In the case of a scattering process, I think the calendar integrals can give you all the information about the volume of coherent. About the volume of coefficients and therefore about the reflection and transmission coefficients. Right. In the case of, then the big question is what they give you in the case of questionable modes. And that I cannot answer yet. Right. So, so the I mean, so the usual thing in inverse scattering problems. I mean, you have got all these infinite number of quantities which are constant. I mean, but then the statement is that how do I relate them to? Statement is that how do I relate them to? I mean, so in some sense, you know, you can solve the whole problem, right? Scattering problem, because we've got infinite many conjured quantities. Exactly. But yeah, but that is in principle, in practice, how do you convert that into those observables into the observables that are you are really you might be interested in, right? And that is right, right? No, no, certainly. That's the asymmetric problem, which is the hard problem. Okay, thank you. Well, in the case of the scatene, we You well, in the case of the scattering, we are very hopeful because there are some nice mathematical properties that you can use to at least build some approximations to observable, let's say, in a scattering process. But I mean, the question is whether you can get the S matrix, right? That's a question. Yeah, can you get? I mean, in principle, all the information is in these quantities that you have, but can you extract it in some useful way to get the S matrix? That would be fantastic, right? That would be fantastic, right? Right, right. That's the idea. Right. Then the question is: can we do anything about the question of mods? And that's what I don't know. Right. That's the second. Yeah. Okay, also, I want to, let me see if I understand how the cortex degree enters. So you are considering the forming, the potentials, and the Potentials and the master functions with this parameter tau, right? Yes. And then the way in which cortex degree appears is that if you impose these potentials to change in tau according to corteffect degree, then you have a suspectality. Is that the way corteffect degree appears here? Right, right. So this gives you a sufficient condition for a suspectality. So my question would be, are So, my question would be: Are there, are you aware if there are quote-vetect debris-like equations, more general than quote-vetect debris, that still keeps this isospectrality property? Could we use operator? I don't why did you try part of the degree? Well, yeah, you. Well, yeah, you know, in because this comes, as you know very well, this comes from invest scattering methods, right? I mean, you know that you can solve, yeah, this is what people in the 70s found is that you can solve the Corteve de Bric. And I mean, here we are not interested in the Corte de Brig, we are interested in the Zödinger, but the people were interested in the Corte-Védebric and they used the Zödinger. So basically, it's like. So basically, it's like
