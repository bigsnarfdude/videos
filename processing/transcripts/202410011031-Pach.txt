Next up we have Jan Buck who's the title of his talk is My New Candidate for My Favourite Ever Seminar Talks I don't say. That was a very immodest sentence because I have to start with a disclaimer that I never gave the title which everybody liked apparently. It was given, I think, by Alex or maybe by Paul. I just wrote that in the US. I just wrote, I think they asked me what I'd like to talk about, and I wrote back that I will talk about some geometric nonsense which is related to geometry, and they considered it as a title. So I thought that I would look on the internet for something which has nonsense in it. And this was the only image that I found for which you don't have to pay. I think this is the future, you know. Previously, one could go to the internet and find all kinds of things, and nowadays there is a warning that you have to contact this or that. At any rate, so thanks for the organizers. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me. It's always a pleasure to be here. And actually, the title is not a bad title because in That title because, in the sense that there is a lot in common in discrete geometry and combinatorics, graph theory. And one of the things is that in both of these subjects, we have some interesting theorems, big problems, but very few interesting constructions. And that's why, for instance, That's why, for instance, intersection graphs became so popular recently, in particular with respect to the Scheiner conjecture, because there are good examples of graphs that are kind of non-trivial. And good toy examples for checking whether our combinatorial conjectures are completely ridiculous or At all, maybe reasonable. Okay, so in general, there is this after Edush and Sakaresh's happy ending CRM, it became a very popular topic in discrete geometry to look for unavoidable configurations. In the case of the address, In the case of the add-ox accuracy where you have many points, then we can find many of them that are informed exposition. It is unavoidable. But there are many other unavoidable sub-configurations that you can find in a point set. And I just start with a totally trivial one. So if you have, well, there is this term complete geometric. term complete geometric graph. I will use this in a technical sense. So a complete geometric graph is just you have endpoints in the plane in general position and that's a geometric graph. If I connect some of them by straight line edges and if I connect every possible pair, then I'm talking about a complete geometry graph. And this is the notation that will be used on these slides, that Km for the complete graph and Km V, it means that with this point set by denote by V, and this is the complete geometric graph is used by this vertex set. Now already at the beginning, you may wonder that why do I connect these points by Connect these points by segments and not by curves and things like that. Yes, I could connect them by more complicated things, and you will see that we have enough problems even in this case when we connect them by segments. But all of those questions that I am talking about make perfect sense if uh if uh I'm talking about uh edges that are some kind of uh simple curves. Simple curves. Okay. So, what is that trivial uh claim, or the way Bolo Bash likes to say it utterly trivial that if you have a complete geometric graph, you can always find in the complete geometric graph n half pairwise disjoint edges. Pairwise disjoint in the geometric sense, not only as an achievement, but Sense, not only as an chain, but this is the simplest proof of it: that you just connect the vertices in increasing order of x-coordinates, and that's a non-self-intersecting pass. And if you take every other edge, then you get such a non-crossing matching. Now, I already mentioned a non-trivial problem. A non-trivial question which is dual to it, so to speak, that what happens if we don't want to find disjoint edges, but we'd like to find pairwise crossing edges. So I will need this at the end of the talk, if I get there. And here the conjecture would be that if you have Would be that if you have endpoints, that we can always find n-parvise crossing gadgets, constant times and parallelized crossing gadgets, but we are far from knowing that. Maybe you would say not so far because it's n to the one minus three law of one, but this little of one is very annoying, and in fact, it influences many possibilities. Uh many possible results that uh I I might some of them may be mentioned later in the video. Okay, so where is the chromatic number and the coloring? So of course even for the matching problem we can ask that what is the minimum number of uh non-crossing matchings that are complete geometric. Matchings that are complete geometric uh graph induced by by a vertex M element vertex that uh can be partitioned into. And this is just equivalent to asking that what is the minimum number of colors you can color the edges of this complete geometry after segments connecting endpoints so that if you look at one color class, then each color class. Color class, then each color class consists of disjoint segments. This is a particularly easy case that the points are in convex position. You can also draw them regular angle and so what we are interested in is just the chromatic number of the intersection graph. Number of the intersection graph on the segments of the edges of the concrete graph. And the other utterly trivial observation is that if the points are in complex position, then we can always cover the whole complete geometric graph by n non-crossing. By n non-crossing matchings. And essentially, the previous figure shows you how this is just a small example, but in general, you take an edge and the parallel class of that edge is the f anymore. Actually, it is only if n is odd, but it doesn't matter. And here is the question, chromatic number question. The question, chromatic number question, if you wish, that what happens if you want to have if the points are not in convex position and can be in any position, what can we say in this case? And the best that we can say in this case is that for any point set, we can cover the concrete geometric graph pipe and to the three-half non-clausion matching. And is that the truth, or is that just the question? No. So, most likely the truth is close to n. Actually, as far as I am concerned, it can even be constant times n. And here you'll see why this to the 3/2 comes out of the proof. And also, you see that even if you want to consider only complete geometric graphs, Graphs, necessarily you have to consider graphs that are not complete. So this result is an easy consequence of a theorem of Gays Artault, which says that if you have a geometric graph with n vertices and E edges, then it always contains a large non-crossing matching. What is a large non-crossing matching? Matching square root of E over N. So in the case of the complete graph or a dense graph, the number of edges is just n squared. So here you get n squared divided by n squared root of n. So you do this, you can find all this non-crossing matching of size square root of n, and one by one you remove it. And obviously there are n square edges, so in n to the three-half steps, you get to the end of it. You get to the end of it. And you can prove the order of n if you could improve this theorem. And I think that this is an interesting problem. We prove this theorem to get rid of this square root, just to prove E over M. But I would be happy with E over M uh times a logarithmic factor too. Okay. Yeah, how much? How do you have all collinear points? How much? How do you handle collinear points? No collinear points. Okay, so just general positions. I don't handle that. Yeah. Now, so this is, so far we wanted to sort of cover the complete graph with non-crossing matchings. But we go a little bit further and we can look at stars or, in fact, At stars, or in fact, star forests. So, what is a star is automatically non-crossing. So, what is a star? Just a vertex and no real image. There cannot be any crossing there. And the star forest, the non-crossing, the star forest is just every connected component is a star. And the trivial observation here is that if you have a That if you have a complete geometric, doesn't matter, complete graph, you can always cover it by n minus one stars because you take a vertex connected to everybody else. From the rest, you take a vertex, you connect it to the remaining ones, and so on. And n minus one steps, you are done. And let me mention this theorem. Here, I proved with Sakapia and Schneider last year, which I like because Vida and David have worked on a lot of problems, similar nonsense problems, if you wish, that I raised. And this is a retaliation because this is also a problem that. Because this is also a problem that Day has in a paper which contains many other interesting questions. So, what is the result? The result says that to some extent this n minus 1 is tight. So, if the points are in convex position, it's an important assumption, then you cannot uh cannot uh decompose the quantity geometric graphs into fewer than n minus one, not just stars, but uh uh disjoint non-crossing star forests. It would be nice to have some kind of linear algebraic proof of that. The proof is not not very simple. It's not too complicated, but not very simple. It has some flavor of the Of the gray and polar theorem, anyway. So it may have some linear algebra background. So the situation is completely different if we don't assume that the points are in a convex position. So here is an example. In this example, the point The points are so. Let me take four sets of points, this position, each of them contains n divided by four points. And I claim that the complete geometric graph induced by them can be covered by fewer than n, namely three-quarters of n, plane star for s. Long-crossing unions of. Crossing unions of non-crossing stars. So, well, this picture, which took a long time for me to draw, is supposed to show you how. So, you take one point arbitrarily in this class, one point arbitrarily in this class, and you connect this point to everybody in its own class, and every Its own class, and everybody in the class to the right of it, same here, everybody at this point, everybody in its own class, and everybody in the upper class. This is a star forest consisting of two stars. And clearly, I can take this point, n divided by four points here, n divided by four points there. This will be n divided by four points. That this will be n divided by four different plane stars for us, and they will take care of all the edges here, all the edges here, plus the edges between these two classes and these two classes. And then I can cyclically repeat it three times, and three-quarters and plane stuff, I guess, would suffice. So it has an immediate corollary in our. It has an immediate corollary. Now, I changed n to m for a reason. That if I have m points in any position in the plane, and if I manage to find m like Mary points so that they are in the position shown in the previous slide, in this position, then I can always cover the The complete geometric graph of those n points by n minus essentially the size of that non-convex Z plane star for n. So there is a saving. So why is that true? Because you do what I showed before in this part, and then one by one I'm adding the other points as a single star and connect them to all previous. and connect them to all uh previous ones. Then here I get I started with three quarters of m star for s there and I'm adding n minus m stars and that's it. Okay, so here is a question where David Wood is included, but Pavida is not included. What can we do? She cannot be included in every single Do, she cannot be included in every single paper. So, the question is that, which is still an unsolved question, interesting question, that does there exist a constant, epsilon positive constant, so that every complete geometric graph can be covered by strictly less than n plane subgraphs. Uh n plane subgraphs. I mean one minus epsilon times n, plane subgraphs. N n minus one is trivial, right? But stars. Can you gain just a positive fraction of that? It's really utterly upsetting that we don't know, we cannot answer this question. But what I'd like to say here very quickly is that this is true for This is true for dense point sets. Now, I already have to apologize for this term dense, but unfortunately in DC geometry, this is uniformly used, although probably sparse would be as good of a word for that as dense. So the prototype that you have to think of of a dense concept is a Dense point set is a grid. Points cannot be in general position, then square root n by square root of the grid. And here, clearly, if you look at the maximum distance between two points and the minimum distance, then the ratio is of the order of square root of m. The ratio cannot be smaller than square root of m for packing reasons. Square root of m for packing reasons, it can be larger. Packing reasons, I mean that obviously around each point, if the minimum distance between two points is one, for instance, then around each point you can take a circle of radius one half and they are disjoint and they are all in this big area. So, uh dance. So dense. And I call it alpha tense if it cannot be smaller than the square root of L, but it can be bigger than square root of L. And how much bigger if it is within a constant alpha than we call it alpha delta. So the kind of stupidity of this name is shown by the fact that as you increase alpha, As you increase alpha, then actually it will be less and less gaps, right? Which is what can I do? I could have changed actually the terminology, but that would have created even more confusion. So the statement is that if you have a dense point set, then actually the complete geometric graph. Complete geometric graph of n vertices can indeed be decomposed into much fewer than plane subgraphs, much fewer than n-plane subgraphs. And in fact, this term depends only on polynomiality on one alpha, so it's not very bad. Probably this 12 can be improved a lot. We didn't try that. And in particular, it implies easily improved. Easily implies that this is also true, not just for dense point sets, but for randomly selected point sets. Although they are not dense, because it may happen that two points are very close to each other, but the probability of that is very small. You delete uh those points and maybe you add them at the end one by one in the same way with the with the stars. So it's not good using that observation. Using that observation from one of the previous slides? I will tell you exactly, very good. So it uses that observation. That's the reason why I showed that slide. And so I won't tell you the proof, but I like to tell you just a qualitative argument and then a problem. So the qualitative argument Argument is so just the existence of such a constant, I like to prove, because it is kind of nice. You don't have to think much about it. Because if you know the First Hemberg-Henson theorem, which is a very nice generalization of the semi-ready theorem on arithmetic progression. So, what it says, and we will really need it only. And we will really need it only in the two-dimensional space, in the plane, that if you take in the plane a grid, and if you take a positive density subset of the vertex of the grid, then there you will always find A large subgrid. So, in the one-dimensional case, seven years you always found an arithmetic progression. Here you find a subgrid, which means that, like, for the mess. So, a subgroup is like a 3x3 or 4x4 subgrid. For subgrid. But the important thing is that the grid point, the distances between the grid points are the same. They are not necessarily one, right? Just like in 7 AD theorem. The arithmetic progression, the differences between the members can be arbitrary, but it's agreed. Now, if you know that, then you do the following. That you look at your point set. Look at your point set, which is a dense point set, according to the definition. You don't have to read what the nonsense I'm writing there. And you divide your square, in which the points are, into little cells. And if in a little cell you have, you know, at least At least one-half or one-tenth of the expected number of points, then you call this little cell green, just like I do. Obviously, a positive percentage of these little cells will be green. So you can apply the Kartznerzo-Fierstenberg density theorem and you will find somewhere in this picture a five by five subread. Subgroup like this, so that here every cell is rich. And once you have a 5 by 5, take these two corners, one on the top, one in the middle, and you found four sets in non-convex position which contain a lot of points, and you can apply the observation. The observation that I mentioned before. Okay, so actually, if you want to have a quantitative form of the theorem, then it also involves only combinant ones and nothing else, but I don't want to go into that. The one thing that I'd like to mention is the following. Is the following. That I at the beginning I asked this question: if you have endpoints, a general position in the plane, then can you find, I don't know, they don't go through the same point. Constant times n pair. Times and badbyes of course you guys. Suppose that the answer is yes. If the answer is yes, then actually from this it immediately follows that we can cover the complete graph. The complete graph for your point set with 1 minus another point times n plane graphs. So if the answer is yes and that's a nice and short argument that I I don't want to present because my time is up. because my time is up but uh i i just want to uh sort of emphasize that uh that uh this question is is stronger than the question i consider thank you very much for your attention So you're so this is using first of the cat also. Just for the random set, do you need that? Can't you just find four? Yes, once you found it, then for the random set, you are... Yes, you don't. This is your strong result. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, it's it's interesting that uh there are a number of uh There are a number of problems of this kind that you can easily handle with random sets, and even this little strengthening that you want to go from random to dense. Most kills most of the troops. Yeah. But you are right, yes, then then one doesn't think that we can. Probably moving on to the next talk but let's oh yeah thank you very much Can you switch one? I can try, but it's better if I don't miss it and you miss this. Yeah. Just press the red discussion button. I don't see any red size.
