Go ahead, Jan. Okay, I'll go ahead. So, I'm very happy to share my work on the cost-grained modeling of plant-pariser war. So, currently, I'm in China, so I'm around 13 hours ahead of your time. So, my background is mechanics. So, I'm interested in the special mechanical property of mechanical property of biological materials. So for me, I think the primary cell war is a unique structure, unique properties. First, it has some unique structure. If you look at this image, it shows that this primary cell has around 100 to 200 nomellae, and in each nomella, it has a cellular microfiber aligned in the same direction. And for the microfiber from different mallet, it has different orientation. And during the growth of plant, this plant cell wall can expand more than 10 times without breaking or weakening during the plant growth. And the other hand, as we know, that because the primary cell wall has to sustain the toggle pressure, the total pressure The toggle pressure. The total pressure is around 0.5 megapascal, so it's very high. This means that private cell work has to have good strength. And in engineering materials, as we know, that these two properties usually compromise with each other. So I'm wondering how do primary cells achieve both strength and also excellent extensibility. So, if you want to answer these questions, we first need to know the microstructure of plant cell war. Secondly, we have to measure the mechanic property of plant cell war. At the end, we also need to modeling to bridge the gap between the microstructure and the mechanical properties. So, for the experimentary studies, I think we use online scale as a model. Scale of the model, we can isolate this and seven micrometer thick cell wall. It's very thin, but it has around three millimeter and five millimeter large. So we can use this sample to do mechanical test. And also, we can use FM to detect the isomatic structure. If you look at the stress-straight curve of this primal cell wall, it's This primary cell wall is much different from the other network structure. If you look at this figure, this figure shows that the usually usual strategic curve for this tissue, rubber, thermoplastic, and also those are the most common material in our life. They are all different from the flat-rate curve of this plant primary cell. Primary cell wall. So basically, this primary cell wall has the highly loneliness stress-strain response. It has three regions. The first region is the sleeping region, which means that the muscles of the cell keep increasing. And the second region is the softening region, where the molecules keep decreasing. And the third region is linear response. Response. And now we know the microstructure of the primary cell and also have measured the mechanical property one to low the structural property range shape. In this case, we need to rely the modeling. So there are different modeling methods at different scale. At the continuous level, we have this finite element method, but it doesn't provide insight into the world polymer behavior or microstructure information. And for the atomic And for the atomistic scale simulations, it is just too computationally expensive to simulate the planet cell world. So we use this cross-grade molecular dynamic model to simulate the behavior of the plant cell world. So briefly, I think in the model, the three components, cells, microfiber, cell booking, and packing are modeled as a channel base. And we establish the four We established the full Lamelli model. So its dimension is around 900 by 900 by 160 nanometer. And each mall or the cellulose orientation are all different. So using this model, we can get a lat isotopic cell. And also, we can simulate this stress-straight behavior. Stress-break behavior. So, here is the result of a model, and compare, and if you compare it with the experiment result, they can match with each other. Based on model, we can see how much stress in the cellulose and how much stress in the root and packing. And we found that if you look at this blue line, the blue line is the line. Uh, this is the blue line. The blue line is the stress in the cell wall, and the red line is the stress in cellulose. We can see that most of the stress is sustained by the cellulose, and that looking packing just so it's very little stress. So we can see that the seismic fiber are the main load-bearing component, and we also can look at stress in each manner because this cell. Each manner because this cell has a four lamel and we stretch it around the zero degree direction. So, if we look at the stress in the four lambella, we can see that the minus 15 mallor has a higher stress. That's because for this matter, the cellulose orientation are close to the stretching reaction. And they will also come look at the stress in the cellulose microfiber and then this is the four. And then this four images showed stress in the cellulose. And if you look at the scale bar, you can see that the maximum stress in the cellulose is close to the 1000 Mach Pascal. However, if you look at this left figure, you can see that the stress in the whole time cell wall is around the max one is 16 Mach Pascal. So it means that the stress in the cell. means that the stress in the cellulose is much larger than that in the cell walls and from the modeling we also can check base movement of cellulose microfiber i think the first movement is a straightening and because in the initial configuration the cellulose microfiber is curved it's not in the straight uh it's not a straight chain because of the entropy effect at the initial configuration is Back at the initial configuration is just curved. And as the stretch goes on, it begins to become straight. The end-to-end length of cellular fiber increase. The second basic movement is curving. In this case, if we have to know that the striking direction is along the horizontal direction, and here we just show a small window of the whole cell wall. So the whole cell wall is being So the whole cell is being stretched along the direction. The cellular fiber, which is perpendicular to the stretch direction, is curving. In this case, the end-to-end length of the cellulose fiber will decrease. The third basic movement is sliding. In this case, you can see that the bundle, the cellulose bundle, will keep Cellulose bundle where keep is being stretched, and the cellular fiber are all straight. So, in this case, this single cellulose fiber cannot be stretched. Then, this sliding happened. The last basic movement is the orientation. In this case, you can see that the orientation of cellular flavor become more close to the strike reaction. And this basic movement can be quantitative. Movement can be quantitated by the length of this end to end length. For example, for the straight lining quanta, in this case, the self-micr fiber end-to-end length increase, and for the curving, the end-to-end length decrease, and for sliding, the end-to-end length keep the same. Now, we try to correlate the base movement of these cellulose to the cell tensor-stress-ray response, and we generate this. Generate is five different malar. Each malar has the orientation of the cells are all different. And for example, for this zero degree malar, all these cellulos has orientation of G degree. And for this light degree the matter, all its silos has orientation of light degree. If you look at the The end-to-end length change of cellulose in each lamella, we can see that as you stretch the lamellar, for this zero degree lamellar, which is marked by the blue line, you can see that first, I think the end to the end-to-end length increase, which is a straight line, and then the end-to-end will reach the tenth and doesn't change. This means that here we can see the means that here we can see the sliding happened. So for this zero degree in the manner and 30 degree lamenter, we can see first the sliding, the straighting happened for the cellulose microfiber and then it reached the sliding region. However, for this green line and the green, the black line, which is for the 60 degree matter and light degree matter. Matter and light matter, we don't see the straightening of cell wall. And in this case, we see the curving because the end-to-end length keep decreasing. And if you look at the stretch-straight curve for this different manner, we can see that basically, if you observe the straightening, it means that this motion loss of cell work keep increasing. If we observe the sliding, you can see that the motion loss of the cell work will keep decreasing. Cell work will keep decreasing. And if the curving happened, it means that this metal will hold very small stress. And finally, we also can use this modeling to investigate the plasticity of the cell wall. Here, we show you the cyclical response of cell warp from both experiments and modeling. You can see our model results match with the Result match with the 10 result. So the key is clear. We show the two cycles. You can see that the first cycle is marked by the blue light, and the second cycle is marked by the red light. You can see that the plastic derivation only happened in the first loading curve. Here, you can see that for the first loading curve, yes, the plastic elevation. The plastic elevation happens because if you after the first cycle, for the second cycle, the second loading curve begins at the strain around the point 02. That's the plastic air function happened. And also, we look at, we check. Just for time's sake, we have one minute, so we have some time for question. Okay, so we check, also check the damage. So we also check the dimension and we found that this microfiber sliding is responsible for the cell plasticity because if you look at change of the entire length of cell group microfiber, you find that in this first loading curve, the sliding happened. So take home message that the cell will exhibit highly long-lated stress-based response and the cell fiber are the main loading value component. The cell sliding is responsible for the plasticity of the. Is responsible for the plasticity of the primary cell wall. So, for the future, I'm wrong in also the raw behavior and the bioaxial stretching. Because currently, we just simulate the uleaxo stretching. However, in reality, the plant cell will sustain the pressure. So the tension should be biaxal. And also, we also need to simulate the effect of the growth in the model. Currently, we don't. Growth in the model. Currently, we don't consider the effect of growth. So that's more, I would like to take your questions. And we have time for some questions. So you can either ask on the Zoom, on Slack, or here. Yeah, there's a question here from Henrik. Yes, it's a very nice model you have. And you kind of alluded to this towards the end. Alluded to this for then, but how time-consuming is it to do these foundations? Can you do kind of a scan of different orientations with the biaxial loading and get a kind of a curve response that you could then potentially move into a continuous model? That's a good question. I think currently we use at least a massive scale model, and so we can check the detail. We can check the detail, but for the continued model, it's usually the FEM method. For that case, it's very difficult to simulate the sliding between this fiber. So we can, from the least massive model, we can get a stress-rate curve. So we can transfer the continuum model. Yeah, it's okay. But for the, if you want to look at the sliding or detachment or for bounding. Or for bounding of least microfiber in the continuum model is still difficult now. So, but what is the time scale for a single simulation like this? Its time scale is around the micromecond. Yeah, but on the computer. Yeah. On the computer, it means how long it takes for the time takes to finish the simulation. Do you mean that? Finish the simulation, do you mean that? Yes. Yeah, it's around, I think, one day. So we have a few questions online, if you don't mind. So we have first Sarah. Hey. Thank you very much. It's a really beautiful model. What is the contribution of the matrix to the microfibril curving in particular? Like if they're moving this way, if they're moving through a stiff Way if they are moving through a stiff or a softer matrix, does your model take that into account? Oh, we take that, yeah, we take that in count, but we here we didn't show the packing because you can see that because most of the polymer are packaging. Here, we just show in these movies, movies, we only show the sellers, we didn't show the packet, but we already considered the effect of packaging. And so, if you have stiffer pectin, does it change the ability of those fibrils to curve? Sure. How much does that affect the stiffer? But if you look at the percent length of the pectin, it's around just 10 nanometer. But for cellulose, its percent length is around one micrometer. So the cell fiber is much stiffer than the packeting. The packing. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, I guess I meant when it curved through it, but maybe we can chat about it later. I think we're moving for the next question. Yeah, so day one, please. Yeah, thank you for the really interesting talk. So I want to ask how well parametrized the model is. Like, was there any like, did you have to just check multiple parameters or are all of them very much determined or like fit? Like fit to the curves. Oh, for the parameters, I think the first one is the mag structure. I think the mag structure is based on the FM imaging. And the other parameter we need is the interaction between these polymers and also the mechanical property of the polymer. I think for the mechanical property of the polymer, we can get from this already. This already examined the result or just atomistic simulations. For the interaction between different polymers, let's draw from the atomistic information, atomistical simulation result. Okay, thank you very much. Okay. I know that there's some other people with questions, but just for the sake of time, we would like to move on to our second speaker. Afterwards, there will be ample time for discussion also, so I hope we can. Time for discussion, also. So, I hope we can ask those questions. So, I would like to invite Alexitz here up to the front of our room. So, Alexitz, he started his scientific journey with development in Brazil.
