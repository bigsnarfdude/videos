First of all, thank the organizers for organizing this, for inviting me into the opportunity to give this talk. We've heard a lot of very beautiful talks about the abstract theory of fusion categories and fusion two categories. And this talk will be a bit more concrete in the sense that I will present a number of very specific examples with fusion roles and modular data, a particular example of fusion categories, which I think are interesting, and the hope is to get some ideas across through the properties of these examples. So I guess. So, I guess, well, this is a conference on fusion categories. I don't really need to define fusion one categories. I guess the only things to note on this slide is that, as Terry said, C is the only field. And moreover, even worse, we're going to want everything to be unitary. So not everything really needs to be unitary, but to make sure I don't say anything false, we'll assume everything is unitary. And yeah, as probably you all know, the standard example is a finite group. So you get these two equivalent fusion categories. One is the Equivalent fusion categories. One is the graded vector spaces, one is the representations. And more generally, you can twist the graded vector spaces by three cosine. All right. So this slide is sort of motivation. And this has come from a number of talks. So the basic question is: what are the examples? So it's finite groups as an example. Quantum groups give examples at appropriate groups of unity. And And then there are these quadratic categories. So, what's a quadratic category? So, essentially, it means it's generated by an object satisfying quadratic equation. So, the basic example is this Fibonacci category. So, you have an object x satisfying x squared equals x plus 1. In particular, if you pass to the dimension, it's literally a quadratic equation of numbers. So the dimension is a quadratic equation. In the unitary setting, there's only one of these, so I'll just say the Fibonacci category. And the, I don't know, interesting or terrible thing is that there's pretty much nothing else. So there's this example from subfactors called the extended Haggrow fusion category, which is not really understood. But besides that, all known examples start with a group, a finite group, a quantum group, or some quadratic category, and then there are some constructions like tensor products, equivariantizations, extensions, and various things you can do. But these are essentially just the examples. But these are essentially just the examples. So, the point in terms of motivation is that if you want to study fusion categories and you want to see what sort of non-group-like behavior can appear, so far the quadratic category is pretty much the only game in town. These are the new examples of fusion categories. And there are quite a number of them. That's only because of what Jerry said. We are not looking at the right corners. Yeah, certainly true. So it's very possibly all we can see with our very weak glasses. Weak glasses, but nevertheless, that's the kind of reality. So here's the conjecture. The conjecture says that for given a cyclic group, there's this so-called near-group category where the simple objects are the group elements and one other, a non-invertible object. And you have this quadratic fusion rule, which is when you square non-invertible, you get the sum of the invertibles, plus a multiple of itself. So this, the order of the group, is the The dimension of the Hom space, the multiplicity of x and x squared. We're going to call this later multiplicity one. So, in general, for these nearby categories, with a certain exception, this is an exceptional class, but in general, it was shown by Terry and David, and I think also Masaki that the multiplicity of x has to be a multiple of the order of the group, and we call it multiplicity of one order to calculate the order of the group. As conjectures, I think, Izumi, I think. Conjecture, so I think Izumi, I think, originally suggested try to find it, he was not so ambitious. He said, try to find it for a prime cyclic group. I think now it's believed it should. After David and Terry's work, he certainly believed it should be for any cyclic group. And not only, there are many other groups that are not cyclic, which should exist still. So this is sort of a minimum, a very modest, modest element in general. What's the first one for which it's not sound to exist? Well, there's, Terry might know this. If the two rank is high, it's not going to do this probably, right? Two rank is highest. I don't think this probably right, but high two rank is generally an obstruction for this kind of stuff. Probably. Oh yeah, I'm saying it's the RFC, you know, in general. Oh, AS1 in general, yeah. I mean, it's just Z2 cross Z2 plus E2. Yeah. So Andrew has that paper actually where he classifies all the ones corresponding to elementary two groups, right? Yeah, all the ones above are. Yeah, so Andrew's classified for elementary terms. For the elementary terms. But yeah, I mean, you don't want types too random. Possibly, you don't want too high other obviously. But certainly specifically, we don't expect it to be obstructions. Okay, so anyway, this conjecture has been verified for some small groups. So Terry has gone quite far. But still, going up to 30 is still a long way from affinity. This is an open, open problem in general. All right. So again, this is a fusion category conference. I'm not going to belabor these definitions, so probably move. Labor these definitions, so probably would be familiar with the Drunfeld center. You can talk about a half-britting of an object, so that's natural isomorphism between the two orders of tensoring of X. I'm satisfying a hexagon relation or some kind of relation like that. And then we have the Druinfeld center, which is the category of half-bratings. And again, I won't belabor this because we've seen this in a number of talks, but the interesting thing with the But the interesting thing, when the first time you study tensor categories, you see the Drinkl center, what to me at least is sort of a little bit used to is that center is not a subcategory because being a central object is an additional structure, right? So an object can be central in different ways. So the center actually can be bigger and for fusion categories, in fact, is bigger. So the centers, unlike for the center of an algebraic object, for a fusion category, you have integral centers quite large. Square of the size of the. Square of the size of the square of the global dimension of squares. And moreover, if you start with enough structure, like this hardcore unitary, these duct everything is unitary, then the fusion category is a modular tensor category. So at this a non-degenerate rating. All right. So again, we've seen this in some talks, but when you have a model, Again, we've seen this in some talks, but when you have a modular transfer category, you have this modular data. So the modular data are these two matrices indexed by the order of the group. And the S matrix gives these normalized Hoflinks. And the T matrix gives the twists. So it's the diagonal matrix giving the twists. And then you have these nice properties. You get a projective representation of SL2Z. And you can recover. And you can recover the fusion rules from the S matrix by the validative formula. So it's both a lot of information about the category and also a lot of combinatorial constraints on what matrices can arise as modular data. So particularly the fact that these are non-negative integers, if you just start with a representation of self 2z, you know, there's no this these will generally not be not integers. So the fact these are non-negative integers is an extremely strong constraint on what matrices are allowed to occur. What matrices are allowed to occur as important. So here's a basic example. And again, many people here are probably familiar with this. If you have a finite abelian group, and you want to find modular tensor categories with underlying tensor product structure is the group, then these are classified by non-ingeneric quadratic forms, which are maps. That satisfies the two properties. So the inverse preserves the quadratic form. And when you take this quotient of Q of G plus H by Q of G times Q of H, you get a non-degenerate phi character. These are called quadratic forms. And then the modular data, the T matrix is simply the quadratic form, and the S matrix is the bicharma. The by character coming from the quadratic form. And there's a much stronger statement you can make before I say that. So, in the, for example, in the book of EGN Nodes, there's a much stronger statement you can make, which is that there's actually an equivalence of categories between such things, so we'll call these metric groups, a finitely related group with a non-generic correct form, and pointed modular tensor categories with correct names. So for finite groups, the theory of modular tensor categories. Groups, the theory of modular tensor categories reduces to this theory of quadratic forms on finite groups. And so we call these metric groups. And we'll need one additional structure later, which is the notion of involution on a metric group. So an involuntary metric group is a metric group where you also have an involution, which preserves a quadratic form. There's always one for free. So the inverse by assumption preserves a quadratic form. So you always get an involved metric form by taking the involution to be the. Or by taking an involution to be the inverse map. But later we'll launch other involutions as well. So just a slight additional structure to make. So far, so good. Okay, so this is not a very exciting slide, but for the purposes of just feasting your eyes on a particular concrete matrix, if you haven't seen any of this before, here's a matrix. So this is E4. Hopefully I haven't done anything, calculated anything too embarrassing. But if you want a non-degenerate black character, so you need a fourth root of unity. So you need a fourth root of unity, which wants to be non-degenerate. You need a primitive fourth root of unity of i or minus i. And then each such choice of i or minus i can be realized by two different quadratic forms. So you get four of them. And I guess the only thing I want to say here is that the T matrix is simpler, it's diagonal, so that certainly makes it simpler. And it also gives more information. So for each S matrix, there's two different decimations. So in some sense, S matrix is two different duplicates matrix. So, in some sense, the S matrix is a little bit less useful. So, it's really all about the quadratic form. And not only that, you can write, the S matrix is really just the bi-character that comes from the quadratic form. So for the rest of the talk, I'm not going to say too much about S matrices in general, because they're more complicated, and they don't really give more information. So the T matrix, although it's less information, well, although it looks like less information, it's actually more information. At least in many examples. All right. So now I want to start talking about. So now I want to start talking about these quadratic examples. So let's start with a near-group category for Z3. So this was constructed by Izumi and separately by Feng Shu coming from conformal inclusion. So the fusion rules, I meant to have a pause there. The fusion rules, so you have the group Z3. So I'm kind of sloppy with tensor product symbols. I often omit them. We have the group Z3. Then Z3 fixes the non-inverbible object X, which is fixed, but tensor on either side by the group like L. But tensoring on either side by the group-like elements, then you have this near-group relation where you square x and you get all the invertibles and three copies. Again, this is what we call multiplicity one. The multiplicity of x and x squared is exactly one times the order of the category. And you can ask, what does the drink fall center look like? So the first interesting observation is that Z3 lifts to the center uniquely and And moreover, well, so yeah, I'll get that in a moment. And secondly, the object x itself also lifts the center, but in nine different ways. So there's nine different half ratings for this object x. And we'll want to think about where this number nine comes from. I mean, nine is a lot of possibilities. It's three squared. This is my butt. What's that? Three squared. Yeah, but that's uh that's um not really where it comes from. So it is three squared, but it's not really the right one. Re squared, but it's not really the right one. So, to keep the talk, to keep things sort of simple, there are more things in the center besides these two things, besides x and invertibles, but I'll ignore them for this talk. So we'll just look at the half green for x and the invertible objects. So interesting facts here is that the C3 lifts a center in a non-degenerate way, and this is a result of the Muger when something, when you have a non-degenerate. When you have a non-degenerate subcategory, then you have actually factorization with this non-degenerate category and it's centralized. So you can decompose a sensor as this copy of Z3 and it's centralize it. Then when you go to the centralizer, so that divides everything by 3. So now the 9 becomes 3, so there's 3 half, this 3, this 3 half grading so that's. So now it's an even easier question. So where does the 3 come from? Easier questions. Where does the three come from? Well, three comes because we start with the group Z3. That again is wrong. That's not where the three comes from. So it turns out where the three actually comes from here is it comes from Z7. This is not obvious at all. So the way you get three is you take Z7, you throw away zero, and then, well, you take Z7, you look at the inverse map. So there's one trivial orbit which is zero, you throw that away. The non-trivial orbits, well, there's three of those, right? So six divided by two is three, and that's what this three actually is. What this three actually is. And the reason, well, you well, so why is that the three? Well, there's a quadratic form on Z7 which gives you the twists of these three path breakers. Where's the Z7 form? Well, that's a very good question, so that no one knows. So I'll talk more about that, but that's sort of the big mystery in the solving. 2 times 3 plus 1. Since this, like 3 does the center, does that mean that this category has radical portion? Can we just push it down? 5 has continued to be 0. The center. The center subcap can be the portion of taken out to where the portion of the downstairs thing, but because of the set function. The downstairs category is not created. No, but I mean just dominant tensor functions are commuted algebraism center that's all functioned. This is the sleep with more commutative functions. So again, this is, I'm not saying this is very convincing, but this, I should say, is due to Terry and David thought. I'll explain more generally what Terry and David noticed thought. If you just saw this example, you wouldn't necessarily be given a C7. The quadratic form is a nice coincidence, but again, you might say that's more like, it's more to Duplicate 3. Okay, so let me talk about David and Terry's work a little bit. This is stupid. Isn't this E7 like? Isn't this Z7 uh like the uh premium of the one dimension of x as a as a square root of twenty-one, actually? Yeah, so the seven is related to the square root of twenty-one, so you can see it that way. But but later, it's okay, so that's a possible explanation for where the seven comes from. But um yeah, I mean the Herbinus progression will tell you something about the group, but later on we'll see groups that are not cyclic, so the dimension will not quite be enough to tell you about the group. So for a cyclic group, it's going to be related to the pro-benefits dimension. Related to the periphery's dimension, but in general, non-cyclic groups will appear as well. And that'll be unclear where they're comfortable. But you said nine different half-gradings, and then you said three different things. That's because we, once you, I'm only looking at the three that are in the centralizer, so we'll push it. We're throwing away the. Okay. So here's the evidence-ganned conjecture. You start with two invaluative metric groups, and we have some conditions. One condition is the fixed point, the fixed point subgroups are the isomorphism. The fixed point subgroups should be isomorphic, that's a condition. Another condition is that the difference in dimensions should be four times the order of the fixed point subgroup. So that's again a strange condition, but that's required. Last condition is a sum of the, I don't want to define the Gauss sum, but the sum of the Gauss sums should be zero. So I didn't write that down. But there's a condition on the Gauss sums as well. And with these conditions, you define the following two sets. You take set-theoretic quotients of the groups by the Write quotients of the groups by this involution. So there'll be two types of orbits. There'll be single orbits that are the fixed points, and there'll be orbits of size two. And you just smash together the orbits of size two. So you just shrink the groups a little bit by collapsing the orbits of size two. You just reach into groups. And then what they found is that there's modular data indexed by these two groups. So you just take the two groups, but smash together the orbits of size two end of the involutions. And then the T matrix is simply the quadratic forms applied to these two sets. The quadratic forms applied to these two sets. Because we're assuming the involution preserves a quadratic form, it makes sense to apply the quadratic form to the quotient by the orbits, right? Because we're assuming that the quadratic form is constant on orbits. That's an assumption in the mind of the matrix. So that's it. So there's also S matrix. I didn't write it down again, so I want to keep things simple, but that's the two matrix. You just put together the orbits and then Orbits, and then you apply the quadratic form. I should say, well, let me say that in a moment. Let me say it now. So, just maybe oversimplifying a little bit. So, the way I'm presenting this is sort of two types of things, there's G1 and G2. If you want to write your S-matrix, there's really four things. So, within G1 prime, you can look at the fixed points, and you can look at the orbits of size 2. And within G2 prime, you can also look at the fixed points and the orbits of those two. So, that gives you four things. And moreover, by assumption, the fixed points are the same. The fixed points are the same. So that further deconstruction is really what you need to use to write down the S matrix. But for the T matrix, you can just think of it as two things here. And then the conjecture of Evans and Gannon, so this is really Evans-Gannon conjecture. We made a slight generalization with the Zoomie, but this is essentially what they had. So if you have a near group for some group A, then the monitor is always of this form. The first group is A cross A. A. Q1 is some symmetric bi-character, and the involution is flipping the factors. So the fixed points of the involution is going to be the diagonal, and that will be isomorphic to A. So the fixed point group here is A. And this is the conjecture. So you get near groups in this form by taking G1 equals A cross A and using the flip. Using flip. And the big missing piece of this conjecture, which is sort of Dave's question, is what is the second group? So that doesn't appear in the conjecture. Second group is some other group that is compatible with respect to these assumptions, but you don't really see it. So that's the conjecture. In the odd case, there's a slight simplification. So in the odd case, if you restrict the quadratic form to the fixed points of these involutions, which is isomorphic A. Which is isomorphic to A is a diagonal, which is isomorphic to A, that's non-degenerate, and that leads to this new group factorization that we saw previously. So, what we saw previously is just factoring out this diagonal of A. And moreover, another simplification is that the involution on the complement of the fixed points will always be the inverse map for the odd group. So, this made the object speed a bit easier. Well, not easier, but a bit more specific. So, that was the original Evans gap. More specific. So that was the original Evans-Gannet conjecture. And then with Wasaki, we just did a slightly more generally, but we don't really allow for an even group and a more general integration. Maybe I should just go back to the previous slide for something. One of the things I just to say, Tevio, I do just need to move on. So one other thing to say is that in the previous slide we had these half gradings of X. So this was the neutral factorization of Z3. So, this was the Mueger factorization of the three, that's the fixed points of this involution. The half-gradings of x, these correspond to the second group, gamma, the non-fixed point orbits. So half gradings of x correspond to the non-fixed point orbits of the second group. So that's what the half-grades got. So in that case, it was, in that case, it was really 21, but when you factor up at 3, it becomes 7. So I'd like to do a few more examples in the remaining minutes. So Evans and Gannon further said that the fact that such modular data exists, so they had this generic form of modular data, and they said, the fact that modular data exists, it's very hard for modular data to exist. This implies these near groups should exist generically. So that's their basic philosophy, which we follow as well. So we generalize these further with Masaki. So we have a few more families. So in all cases, you have two invited metric groups. The conditions are a little more involved for some of the other families. For some of the other families. So the three conditions I wrote are a little bit different for the different families, but they're all generally start with two involved metric groups and some conditions on the fixed points. All right. So I'm going to get to some more examples in my remaining time. So near group for C3 cross Z3. So here you have the fusion rule, same fusion rules, but now the group has order 9. So again, it's multiplicity 1. The same situation holds. You have Mueger factorization of the center, so you pull out a C3 cross C3. C3 cross C3. Then you look at the half-brittings of X in the centralizer. There's six of them. These are again non-trivial inverse orders, as you can see 13. You throw away tribulor 0, and you have 12 divided by 2, that's 13. And in this case, we actually get the centralizer is actually the center of the Hager-Fitching category. So this was, I think, noticed first by Victor. And so Hager. So, the higher category of terror productive rules is also quadratic, but it has slightly more complicated rules. So, there's multiple non-invertibles for each group element, and then you have these rules over there. And the reason this happens is that this near-group physi 3 cross C3 is, like I said, multiple near-groups for C cross 3. This is one particular near-group physi 3 cross C3, but it's an equivariantization of this Hoggrow category with respect to interaction of C2. With respect to interaction of C3. So you get the same center. Modulus extra factor of C4. Is the copy of Z3 across the C2 that was at the center the center of XC3? That belongs to a category of the working in? I believe so. I believe so. All right. I think maybe, in interest of time, I'm going to skip this slide. This is just definitive equivalentization, but maybe in interest of time, I'll say. In the interest of time, I'll say whoever wants can talk about that later. I want to get to some more examples. So, all right. So, now I want to talk about the categories we actually want to discuss, which are the so-called almost near-group categories. So, an almost near-group category, it's like a near-group category, but we introduced an extra factor of Z2. So now we have two different non-invertible objects. We have a Z3 cross Z3, which acts like near-group. So, the G is Z3 cross 3 that acts like a near group. So, it fixes G, but H does not fixes X, rather. Does not fixes x, rather, h does not fix x. You have x and h x separately. So you have sort of a near group part and a hog or a zoomy part. And in this case, you again have Mueger factorization for the odd part. So z3 cross z3 comes out as Mueger factorization. Then if you look at the non-invertible piece, so now we take the sum of the two non-invertibles together, there's 18 half gradings. And now the group that appears is Z2 cross Z4 cross Z5. So that's a bit strange. Course E5. So that's a bit strange. So this group has order 40, right? 2 times 4 is 8, times 5 is 40. We have 18 half grading. So how does that work? So once again, the involution here is the inverse. So what are the fixed points under inverse of this? So z2 cross z2, so you have four fixed points. 40 minus 4 is 36. Then you divide by 2, that's 18. And that twists are given by a quadratic form on this graph here. So that's the test. And the starting point. And the starting point for this work was how do you know this category? So, where does this category actually come from? This category comes from the same picture as before. Just like the 3 quick near group comes from hog growth by equivariantization, this comes from a Z6 hog growth by equivariantization. You have to variantize by the odd part, and you get exactly this. That's how we know this exists. However, once you know this exists, and we kind of know the modular data from the Hager-Up situation, we notice the modular data. We notice the modular data doesn't really depend on having a z3 cross z3. You can just replace z3 by an arbitrary odd group. So, why not just put a single copy of z3 there and see what happens? So, that's the starting point for this exploration. And right now, every time you act, I'm not sure if this is clear, every time you active varietization, you sort of get a doubled group, like hyperc3, gives 3 cross z3. But if you want, but we should be able to get categories which don't have a doubled group. The modular data works just as well without the group being doubled. So, we want to try to construct that directly. So, we want to try to construct that directly. And that's the purpose of this project. So, here's a conjecture: consider the fusion rules. I wrote plus because we have a little bit of cosmological assumptions as well, which I'm not going to write down. So, you have a copy of Z2 cross Z3. The Z3 part acts like near group, so it fixes X. Z2 part doesn't act like X like generalized hologram, so it gives you two different copies. This is the so-called mixed categories. And the conjecture maybe looks very specific, but the conjecture is that. But the conjecture is that, and one other thing is, we allow these two objects to be either dual to each other or self-dual, so that corresponds to whether you just have x squared or h times x squared. So there's two possibilities. And the conductor is very specific, and it's for self-dual case, there are exactly two categories, and the twists are given by half-braidings on C2 cross C8. For non-self-dual, there are four categories. Twists are given by half-braiding on Twists are given by half breeding on by the twist on half breeding is given by contradicting four months and four crosses four. For two of the, and these two cases can be this case can be further subdivided into whether the twist of H is plus or minus one, which we call boson or fermion. This looks very, you know, again, very specific, like where does all this come from? The answer is all this comes from modular data. So we have tangent modular data based on these pairs of metric groups. We look at the possible configurations, and this is what comes out as likely to exist. So it's a prediction based on modular data. And more generally, there's an issue of mod 4. So this, the C3 mod 4 is when you have boson and fermion here and just boson on top, and the other case would occur for one month forward, like C5, for example. So have you constructed any of these yet? Constructed any of these yet? Yeah, yeah. We have constructed, and since I'm almost out of time, let me maybe skip ahead and just say what we have. So, well, I'll skip ahead. We do all the Zoomy stuff, which is extremely tedious and extremely painful, but we kind of cram through it. We have to compute all the, we have to first construct fine polynomial equations, solve the polynomial equations, find the tube algebra, compute all the module data. It's a huge, huge pain. So, the slide is not proportional to the amount of work it takes. So, we've done it for Z3 numerically, so we've verified. E3 numerically, so we've verified all these cases. And so the conjecture seems to hold. And here's the chart. This is my second to last slide. So the general situation we have is, so there's one other interesting point, which is that these are also part related to near groups. So the general situation we have here is there's a near group for with multiplicity 1 equals 2 plus 2 plus z3, and there's a near group with multiplicity 2, m equals 2 is seems to have disappeared from the slide. There's a near group 3 with multiplicity 2, so order six times multiplicity x. So, what are six times locally segments? These are related by Z2 plus 2 deparantization. And these categories we're looking at now, these almost near groups, sit in between. So, these are just a Z2 covariantization. So you've got these two possibilities of boson, self-dual or non-self-fluid, different copies of Z2. They sit between multiplicity 1 and multiplicity 2 near groups. There's also the fermionic case. This one doesn't do equivariant times. I'm not going to claim this is all proven. This is all, I think, what we believe to be true. I think some of this we can prove, but this is what's happening. But this is what's happening. And more generally, we expect this picture to hold for three mod 4. So, you know, for Z7, it should be the same. For Z11, it should be the same. For Z5, there would be a different picture because of this. So I'm sorry I rushed a bit at the end. That's pretty much it. So let me just go to the conclusion. So the conclusion is, first of all, these categories should exist and probably form infinite families. And even if you think all these categories, like, who cares? It's just like some specific list of fusion rules. There's another point to take away here, which is that even if you don't care about these categories, That, even if you don't care about these categories, this is evidence for the Evans Gandhi program of using modular data to predict the existence of categories. Because before we did this work, all we had was modular data that said there should be one fermion self-school, just three out of the four should exist. And then we do these really complicated polynomial equations, and that's exactly what we find. So the modular data has correctly predicted which categories should exist and which ones should exist for different parameters of n. So it's quite powerful evidence, I think, for the Evans GAM program using modular data to predict categories. Data to predict categories. And yes, and what we still need, which is what Terry and Dimitri talked about the last two nights, is a general method to construct them. Any question perhaps? Uh, can you go back to the slide where you worked on the fusion row for almost three hundred categories? For almost three of the categories. Is the H one of the G's in the direct sum? No. So you're only summing over the near group parts. So a near-group part and a hygiene resuming parts. The H is the Hager-resuming part. That doesn't. Just like in a Hager-Subject itself, you only get one of the summation. So you only summing over the near group, the near group. So how does H multiply with just this? Just like a group. So H, since it's a six interval element. Okay, and it just. Yeah, but H doesn't fix the, but G fixes X, whereas H uh. G fixes x, whereas h transposes x and h x. But h is of one of the group elements of it? So the group is z2 cross z3. So the sum here is over the z3 part, it's only over z3. But the group is z6. On your hand-drawn slide, was this for the centers or for the actual near group? Actual near group. Actual near group. Okay. So I believe, so to be a little more precise, I believe there's probably two of those, like complex conjugate and complex conjugate. And then for each one of them, there should, I think, be one self-double boson, one non-self-double boson in between the multiplicative one and multiplicative two. And then one non-self-double fermion living somewhere else. Maybe the third copy of Z two. So I don't know if this these categories occur other than in between the nearer neuron space. And also, the other thing, as I guess, so I'm interested in the centers for Argon, which are asking. I think Kane has already computed it in this case, for Z3. But so the centers for near groups is kind of using this general formula for them. For these, we're kind of doing that now. These, I think, are harder to centers up, but probably. These centers up, but probably we can get the centers by computing these. So the C3 is already done by Kane, we can probably, for example, C7, if we have a strong enough computer, we can probably get the C7 multiple C2. Modular data, you have quite a general modular data from two gate groups with evolutions. As I all expected to be the infield centers or something. No, so examples are not shifted centers. So there's some that, as Eric noticed one. So there's some that, as Eric noticed, once there are Zestings, ones that are, I forget what it's called, but there are families of them sometimes. Different central charges. They're not always central charges. That's one. They're not always different filth centers then. Yeah, I think, well, the idea is that sometimes you factor when you factor away something pointed that has some Z2 thing. Has some C2 stuff thing on your central charge? Yeah, so in all the examples we have here, we just factor it to the other factor is not of this kind of general form but not a bit false essential. When there's a factorization. Testing could change if I think for it. I assume as these equations for the na groups with the double multiplicities, I think they're pretty nicely solved by hand after N is the quota. And after n is equal to 4, I believe. But does that get to the center? I think you're that bottom one for Z mod 7, potentially. Have you tried that? To compute the center? Just as the category for Z mod 7 for existence of the category here. I haven't tried it. I think it's a method pretty efficient. Yeah. But I talked to him, Saka about this. He seems to think that computing the center here is easy. So, the general question, all these things, like, if, like, how All these things, like, if like how composing is the equivalent station related to near group, like, which should you look at, or you know, are they all the same? But this computationally, there's a difference, some are easier than others. So, like, so this, so yeah, so I think in this case, Masaki's meeting, I think it's easier to be completely sensor variant and you figure out central scaring because of some certain symmetry that allows you to drop it. So, I was wondering, uh, for this diagram, could you use uh subfactor methods? I mean, the problem uh is to find a type of subfactor that you can look at. Subfactor, and then you can look at the exponential row, which gives you the bottom line and you're looking for the immediate subfactors. Yes, and I think, you know, so I mean, subfactors they call it orbifold, orbifold, which essentially is acquired. So, yeah. Yeah, I think probably it depends on how good of a concrete presentation you have on the plan out for it. But yeah, presumably you can do that with several things as well. I think that's just wrong, but. But thing that's just wrong, but it didn't mean it's not making too much action. I guess so. If there's a lot of complicated structure constants, then when you start moving strings around, it gets bit messy. But yeah, in principle, that should be an equally good method. Right, so existence, I think, yes, I think existence is, yes, I think that's correct. I think for existence, you don't need, you can get this without doing the quantum equations using epic variants or sub equalization. That's absolutely correct. So that's just a point, actually, that I found. So I thought this is the point of actually found that out because we spent a lot of time struck on this and then I think Motaki pointed out you can also get a front picture. Although a little bit annoying. One more question. And so you had it, this G prime that you constructed, what's its rank? That's. For which example? Like it's just this basic one that you did. Or maybe you just ignore this one. Oh, I don't know, but I could look it up and tell you afterwards. So in all these things, I only talked about half range for x plus h x and the group. There'll be some other stuff. Any more questions? Because one of the few spells is Jacket A
