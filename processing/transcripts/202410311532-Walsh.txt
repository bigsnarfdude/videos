The organizers that participate in this wonderful workshop. So, this is the joint work with my frequent collaborators, William Chent, and Lucy Pittsberg, and Miles Wheeler Kath. And this is really work in progress. So, like interval arithmetic, all the constants have like a, there might be a sign-off for missing factors of two or something. But all those mistakes, of course, are my own and not for my colleagues. All right, so the pictures, the motivational pictures here are slightly different than a lot of the ones we've seen so far. Are slightly different than a lot of the ones we've seen so far. I'm looking at vortices, which are sort of things in. Okay, so now I see that all ones on the troll vortices. It's this button, I think. Okay, yeah, so these are a special phenomenon you often see in two-dimensional flow, which is the case we're going to look at now, which is where you have the fact that the vorticity is transported means that you can have constant regions of concentrated vorticity that sort of persist. So, this is an example from hydrodynamics. This is one which is clouds in the lee of the These are clouds in the lee of the Alejandro and Silkirk Island off the coast of Chile. These are just sort of ideas to have in mind. The basic equation of motions throughout the talk are just the incompressible Euler system. So here the domain is time-dependent, the domain is script D. It's in 2D, of course. The velocity field is this bold U, and there's a pressure, which is lowercase P. So these are in the lab frame. There's going to be a change of variables eventually, so that that'll be important. Eventually, so that'll be important. All the vortices are a little bit exotic for many people, I think, but they actually are a classical, even 19th-century model of concentrated vorticity. And the basic idea is that you take, say, this setup that we had in the clouds in the League of Alejandro and Selkirk, and you imagine just cutting out holes so that the domain of the fluid we're looking at is in the exterior of these. And then we'll just treat these as regions of constant pressure. So, just like the waterway problem, where the air is just a vacuum. Where the air is just a vacuum, it's just a concentrated region. And the fact that the vorticity here is manifested in a vortex sheet that's on the boundary. In other words, the circulation of the velocity field around each of these holes is non-zero. So mathematically, for example, if you have seven of these, this is what we're sort of looking at. You imagine that your fluid domain is the complement of sort of M in general regions, each of those disjoint and all of them having a boundary, which is a Jordan curve. Which is a Jordan curve. So, some degree of regularity, and then of course. That's the basic fluid motion, and okay, we know what the kinematic condition is, it just says these things: the motion of the boundary agrees with the normal velocity of the fluid. The dynamic condition, again, says that the pressure should be continuous over the interface. We're modeling these hallow vortices as regions of constant pressure, and so constant in space pressure, at least. That means that the pressure of the fluid should be some TK of T on the K of vortex boundary, and this could potentially be. Vortex boundary. And this could potentially vary in time, but it should be spatially constant. So then again, as we said, the vorticity is manifested here by the fact that the velocity is field is irrotational in the interior, but you have a non-zero circulation around each of the boundary components. So we'll call gamma k the circulation around the kth vortex boundary. So there are two ways of understanding what this pk is. So that's the pressure on the kth vortex boundary. So you could just treat it as constant. So, you could just treat it as constant. It's going to be time of panic for us. So, you can just think of it as a pressure forcing. So, there's a very simple way of exerting some forcing on the fluid. Another physical interpretation is to say that you can imagine that actually these vortices are a second phase, which is compressible, where we're using the so-called isobaric approximation, which was proposed by Prosperity. This has actually been studied by a lot of people, including Lai and Michael Weinstein, a lot recently. And Michael Weinstein, a lot recently. So, the idea there is: you just have compressible Euler, but you imagine that the pressure is homogeneous in space, so that effectively you have an ideal gas law. And we're making the additional assumption, I guess, that the gas law is isothermal. But either way you want to interpret it, that's the system of interest. And the basic idea for this project was to try and construct vortices that implode self-simulate. So, those are going to collide into each other in finite time, and as they do so, the pressure and the In finite time, and as they do so, the pressure in each vortex is going to infinity. So, there are singular development and Euler equations, of course, a big business these days. And there are point vortices that have this basic property where they collapse into a point. This is not possible for vortex patches, which talk about that in a moment, but for hollow vortices, it actually is, and we're able to construct exact solutions that have that behavior. Alright, so let's begin with the collapsing point vortex. Vortex, I shouldn't be a lot of people talking about point vortex already, so I'll go through that quickly. But the basic idea of a point vortex is that, or point having point vortices, is that you imagine that your vorticity, which is called omega, is just the sum of some direct delta functions which are modeling the position of your vortex, where the strength of the vortex is this regulation around it. This is not an exact solution of the Euler equations. It's not even a weak solution of the Euler equations, but there is a suitable weakening of the Euler equations. There is a suitable weakening of the Euler equations that's been known for a very long time that gives a good effective equation for the motion of these things. So we're working in 2D, so we're going to try and make use of all the complex analytic tools. So let's write everything in complex variables. So x and y now, vector is now z, which is x plus iy. So at time t, we'll just imagine these vortex centers. This is where the densities are, the density, the point of the center of mass for the The point of the center of mass for the drop measures are moving, so their position is Z1 through ZMOT. The circulations are always fixed. So the Kirchhoff-Hommel's model, also the Kirchhoff-Ruth model, is that the vortex centers are just evolving according to this deceptively simple looking ODE. So we have a nice model that we should be able to understand. This actually has a lot of really rich structure to it, has been studied for hundreds of years. We're interested in the very specific. We're interested in a very specific class of solutions, which are the collapsing ones. So that's where all of the vortex centers converge in finite time on a common point. So we'll call the collapse point, a time we'll call kappa. You can all do this in backward time, but I'm just going to focus on the forward time. And in particular, we have a self-similar collapse. There's a way of writing it. So the distance between the kth vortex and this collapse point is just evolving by a constant complex multiple over time. And you can show that that multiple has to have a very particular form. Hole has to have a very particular form. It's something like this. So here, again, the collapse time is kappa and this omega is telling you something about the rate of rotation. So the orbits in these systems are trace logarithmic spirals that go into the origin. But actually, if you have exactly three, I think you can show that all collapsing vortex configurations are exactly, are self-similar. I don't believe that's known for higher than three. Alright, so just to encode this, to give some notation, so there's, you know. To give some notation, so there's, you know, to have a solution to this system that's collapsing, you need to know where the initial 0.4 receis are located. So that's now just throw the zero away and just write the Z1 through Zm. You have to decide what the circulations are, and you need to know what this bold omega is, omega omega is this constant, which is encoding both the collapse time and this rotation. And then you just write down the steady equations and you get this nice, now it's not even OD, it's an algebraic equation, and you look for roots of. Algebraic equation, and you look for roots of that. And root of that would be something where you actually collapse into the origin specifically. Alright, so maybe this is a bit technical for now. We're going to need not just solutions to this, but not to generate ones, which basically means that when you look at the Jacobian of this function whose zero sec is your solutions, it should be a full rank. Alright, so I'm going to not show this already slide and just show some videos. But so these things have been known to exist as far. So, these things have been known to exist for a long time. I think the history is a bit complicated because the first distance results were by Grobli in the 19th century in his thesis, and then that was largely forgotten, so it was rediscovered independently by multiple people. This is one of Grobli's solutions, and these are a triple of 0.4 disease that collides with the origin in finite time. It does so self-similarly. So, maybe it's a little hard to see this, but that is a, it's a non-it is not an isosceles or a It is not an isosceles or even an equilateral triangle. These things always have to be non-symmetric. This is a kind of a construction. A restraint, a constraint. So these are completely understood. At least in far existence, there's a characterization of them. You can parametrize all of them. When you go up to four, though, it gets a bit more complicated. So these are not as well understood. I don't believe there's any complete parameterization of them. But this is one which is particularly nice because it's explicit. The other one, many of them are only known to. The other one, many of them are only known to know existed numerically. But higher than four, and even at four, there's a lot of open questions just in terms of existence theory. So this is a really beautiful area of applied math, actually, which I don't understand as well as I should. But anyway, so these things exist, and we'd like to now turn them into solutions of the Euler equations rather than point forces. That's the basic goal of this research project. So, knowing that these are spiraling, the origin of the These are spiraling the origin. The first step is to choose an appropriate moving reference frame so that I can look at steady problem instead of a time-dependent problem. And okay, so I want spiral, so I choose a basis where I've built in this sort of logarithmic spiraling. So there's a length scale change, L of T, which is motivated by what you see in the point-fortex case, and then I'm also rotating. That rotation rate is again to ensure that I get logarithmic spirals occurring in the system. system. So this will collapse at the origin again at time t equals kappa. And I guess if you formally take kappa as it goes infinity and this will be stiffy rubber. So now we'll just rewrite the system in terms of variables in this moving frame. So use C and A for the horizontal and vertical variables, x and y for the original physical frame. You can just compute what the change of variables are between the two. If we want cell solar motion, then the The fluid domain at time t should be just the image under this mapping of the initial fluid domain, which will just throw away the zero and write script t. And likewise, all the boundaries of the images of the boundaries of the time zero. So then, okay, so I'm skipping a few steps, but you write down the velocity field that you observe in the stationary frame, in the moving frame, and it relates to the physical velocity in this way. We built in the scale. In this way, we built in this scaling here. So, by choosing this logarithmic scaling, actually, you can ensure that these terms here have the same, scale the same way, and therefore this is a well-defined definition. So, now you just recast the problem in these variables. And likewise, the pressure, when you put it in this coordinates, it makes sense to build in this scaling, and we'll see why in a moment. So, this capital P is the pressure in the, it's rescaled, but in the moving frame, and then U is the vertical And then use the relative velocity in the frame, also with the rescaling built up to it. And then an elementary, but surprisingly difficult mechanics exercise is to write the Euler equations in this frame of reference. And the solutions that we want are ones which are time-independent. So you get the steady Euler in a spiraling reference frame, and that's, I claim, are these. So it looks similar to things that we're very familiar with. A couple of things that you're unfamiliar is now the A couple things which are unfamiliar is now the, I mean, because things are contracting, the velocity field, the relative velocity is not divergence-free, because things are rotating, it has a constant divergence and a constant non-zero curl. The boundary conditions are at the same, these scale exactly with the right wave. Now, because I don't want things to move, I have the moment velocity zero on the boundary, and now the capital P will just be some new constant capital PK, which is now going to be independent of time for my channel. Momentum balance, just to focus on that for a moment. So, there's two fictitious forces. This orange one is the Coriolis force, which is familiar to many of you from geophysical applications. The contraction force, I mean, this is due to contraction. That's the kind of new element because we're working in these collapsing coordinates. But thanks to the choice of scaling, these are both independent at times, so we're really looking at a steady problem. So, oh, okay, I'm going slowly. All right, so there's a couple, we have several results. So, the first is looking at the, oh, sorry, I say nearby, but I haven't said what earned nearby. So, I'm looking for, so there's actually an explicit set of solutions to this, which are purely circular. You can just write these down and check that these are equation solutions to the problem. And you want to say, okay, are there anything which is a little bit more interesting than that? And in particular, we're looking at things with sorts of built-in symmetry. sorts of built-in symmetry. So M-fold symmetry means that it's invariant under rotations by 2π over m radians, both the velocity field, the fluid domain, and the pressure. So we can do that with just rotating but non-collapsing. There's a certain dispersion relation that relates the speed of rotation to the symmetry class that you want and the circulation. As long as you have a root of this, you can do a local verification argument and get Local verification argument and get an analytic curve actually of rotating holoforts in the. These have the kind of the natural parameterization for their boundary. It looks like 1 minus epsilon cosine m theta, the leading order, where this is the polar graph of R epsilon. And they have a nice symmetry. So they're even about the horizontal axis. For the imploding vortices, things are a bit more complicated. So you get an N. More complicated. So, you get an n, there's another dispersion relation, so there's a much more stringent requirement on how these parameters relate. But as long as m is greater than or equal to 4 and you select things in this way, then you also get a curve of, actually a two-parameter family of imploding all the vertices that are perturbations of a circle. So, the same leading order form for the boundary, but sort of a recurring motif in these collapsing configurations is that you In these collapsing configurations, is that you really don't ever get to expect symmetry. So these don't have even symmetry over either of the axes, actually. So just as a comment here, so if you look back in the physical variables, the corresponding pressure, say, and the vortex region, which is just a perturbation of the wall now, so these exhibit the desired asymptotics. So it's blowing up like one over the distance to the collapse time for the pressure and the area. The pressure and the area of the vortex patches is below. So it's going to the zero at that point. So the system is, of course, time reversible, so if you want, you can just do the same thing backwards, and now you have things which are growing rather than contracting. And so you notice that for m equals 2 and 3, I don't have any results for the imploding case, and that's not an accident, actually. There's a rigidity result which we have that says that, in fact, in the two. We have that says that, in fact, in the two, m equals two and equals three, there are no solutions in a neighborhood, the circular ones, except for the circular ones. Not much else. Okay, so the other theorem is that going back to these collapsing point vortex configurations, so this is one of Chromebooks again, and then here's the quartet that I showed you, but just slowed down. So the basic idea is that take any The idea is that take any of these configurations you want, no matter how many vortices, as long as it's finite, as long as it's not degenerate, so take a Jacobian, make sure that it's full rank, then there exists a family of nearby employee and hole of ordinances, which are perturbations in some sense. So if you imagine that these are not streamlines that are so close together you can't see them and just is actually as a hole in the fluid, that's roughly speaking what these things look like, except that they collapse. So that's the main theorem. Again, so this is reversible, so you have time to. Again, so this is reversible, so you have ti so the same result gives you things expanding all the vortices. They blow up, I mean they spiral out of and grow out of infinity. So actually, I mean just last week there was a paper by this group at Bath where they construct vortex patches that are concentrated on self-similarly expanding point vortices. So this is sort of spiritually similar, but I mean their vortex patches obviously can't expand in area because the area is conserved, so it's not exactly self-similar motion. And okay, so from the And okay, so from the, and this is important, is CJ explained earlier that for the time-dependent problem, these are solutions, but the Taylor sign condition is it satisfied all the complex boundaries. So if you wanted to do a stability analysis, that's at least a starting point. That would be very hard. All right, so I don't have very much time, but I will try and just give the outline of the main ideas for proof. So, as is half the people here, I think we're using conformal mappings. The canonical domain that we want, though, is not. The chronicle domain that we want, though, is not a strip anymore, but something which is result, which is, you know, approximates what the streamlines are looking like near the point fortices. So we use called script D, rho. So you put a point in each of the locations of the point fortices. This is in the, let's say, the zeta plane. And then you cut out a ball of radius rows. And rho will be able to shrink to zero at the point of bifurcation. And then you imagine that your vortex configuration is just the image of that under some operator unknown confonion. Under some operator unknown COFO mapping, F. That gives you the fluid domain, and then to get the velocity, you write as a relative velocity, capital W, which is a harmonic but multivalued function w, plus this is encoding the effects in the relative moving frame. And then, so the complex relative velocity field is then just found by computing this ratio of derivatives. So the unknowns are now F and W, which are. are now F and W, which are in this conformal domain. At least they have to be C1 plus alpha each, but that's not really a big concern. And you write down the kinematic and the dynamic conditions as usual. They take this formula. So this is the kinematic. You're asking, so this is the normal vector to the boundary, dotting it with the velocity field. And actually, you have to do this, by the way, because as we discovered, the imaginary part of the complex velocity potential is not constant on boundaries when you do these moving. Constant on boundaries when you do these moving the spiraling coordinates. So that was a nasty surprise, but if you write it this way, it still works. But then, okay, so this is Bernoulli condition, and I have this in orange here because this term, which is coming from the rotation and the contraction, is a pain. It's okay for us analytically, but if you're wanting to do this using some of these methods that have been complex function theory methods from, say, the Crowdie School, having these inhomogeneous terms makes that very difficult. So if you threw that away, So if you threw that away, you could do this, I think, explicitly, but we wanted to keep that there because otherwise the pressure isn't spatially homogeneous in the physical variables. Okay, there's the regular circulation condition. So these are on an unbounded domain. It's on a canonical domain, but the domain is moving as you're shrinking or expanding row. So that's not analytically very ideal. So if you just read everything. Very ideal. So we just rate everything using layer potentials or Cauchy network operators, however you want to think about them, in terms of density. So we use the density μ for F and for μ for W. These are just normalized that we've defined on M copies of the torus, each and they have the requisite regularity. So now the problem becomes very non-local, but it does fix the domain. Everything's just defined on toroid. But having the ability to having the fixed domain is worth the non-locality because it allows us to do this stuff. Because it allows us to do this decision with that. So abstractly, the problem is just some big nonlinear, non-local operator acting on all these guys. For the amfold symmetric rotating case, this is just a crown over this argument. The hard part is about setting it up. I think I actually did this calculation myself at a long layover at Newark Airport. So it's not a very hard theorem. The imploding is a bit harder. So the linearized operator actually has a two-dimensional kernel, so you have to do something in advance. Kernel, so you have to do something in advance here. And we use an equivariant variant of the kind of organoids in theorem, which uses the fact that there's a rotation, a continuous rotation variance from the system. And then the real difficulty part is the difficult part is where you use the M imploding all the vortices. And so this is done using this vortex designularization kind of machinery or approach that Miles, Meng, and I first used looking for translating, rotating, and stationary. And stationary, 0.46 in the plane. And then, actually, in the recent work with also with Christopher of our home, we did this inside waterways. So, I wanted to show this just because this is a waterways mainly to have at least one slide with waterways. So, this paper with Christopher is we found waves of this type, which are actually something that's been mentioned today. So, these are gravity waterways with O1 gravity and the submerged point vortex that's moving with it. And you can designularize this to get a vortex gravity wave with the Hall vortex in it. Gravity wave with the Hall of Vortex. When they're overhanging, we're trying to brand these as cyclopathy and gravity waves. Anyway, and the key point in terms of the analysis is that when you take the linearized holo-vortex problem at the point-vortex system, when rho is equal to zero, it's, I mean, the kernel and co-kernel have exactly the same dimension as the corresponding linearization of the point-vortex system. So this is, again, sort of confirming for the hundredth time. Sort of confirming for the hundredth time that the point for the Kirchhoff helmet system is a good one, because the linear behavior of one predicts the linear for the full weather or the full fields problem. So once you do that, and okay, so lots of weather analysis, but this is the summary. Okay, so I think I finished on time, but uh thank you very much. I don't want to stop very quickly, sure. I'm trying to stop the recording. Should be actually questions.
