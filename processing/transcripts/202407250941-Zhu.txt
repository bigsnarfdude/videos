Actually slow module randomization framework. So it's a little bit uh different because of the low module randomization we we try to detect the causality rather than the G by interaction that I would have in the stable later. So further let me uh briefly review uh some static method for perform GPI interaction. perform G by interaction and also tier for G16. So we know for G by if we wanted to test the G by interaction, if the trader is a continuous variable, it's quite easy. We can perform this simple reading literature model. So in this model, it includes both the gene and E and also the components of G by E interaction. By E interaction. So it's quite simple method. Then, with this method, we can actually have multiple different tests in order to find the association between those genes and the phenotype Y. So one is that we can test beta 1 equal to 0. That will give us usually we call it a main effector. So we can test the main effector. We can also test the interaction effect. Intellectual effect there's a beta equal to zero. So also we can test both the G and the G by E that is joint test for many vector and actually it's like two different models. So all those testers will tell us whether there is an association between G and Y. So So currently, when we have data, usually we start with the association. So for association analysis, we do not include any environmental data, also G binding interaction component. So we can do this association test as a Y and G correlation. So we call this marginal. The marginal effect. So, all those methods tell us the association. So, one way is that we can compare the power of those different tests. So, here is the result from a paper published a few years in GBI International. It tells you the symptom power for all those four different tests. So, the fourth part in this In this top figure, so there's a power, but for the x-axis, it's just a mean of environment. So the power of those tester will depend on the mean of environment. So in general, you can see with the model, the true model is interaction model, so there's no main factor in this model. So you can still say actually that Actually, the intellectual model and the manufactured model usually know. So, marginal effect, which is genome, usually we do genome as she studied in this matter. So, marginal effect and the joint effect of G and G by E, usually give us a more powerful. So, for different of those models, written, as we consistently show the G-byte interaction analysis is the power. Interaction analysis is the power which we know. So, another important observation is when we try to use the T-bar interaction model, so there is a correlation between G and G times E. So that correlation makes us very difficult to separate whether this is the main vector or this interaction. Effector or there's interaction vector. So, because there's a correlation. So, basically, from this data, what we learn is the static power for detecting by interaction is known. So, we can reduce that also to models. So, one is intellectual model, which the other is a GR association model. So, the difference between those two. So the difference between those two models is very straightforward. So when we test the intellection, we have E and G by E components of the model. So actually, we can see both the models include the main effect or marginal effect. So actually we can look at the difference between alpha and the beta one in this model. So if we do analysis, we find that this. We do analysis, we find that there is any difference between alpha and beta one. Actually, that's could be because of we had the E component and the G by E component. So actually there's two, so we can look at the difference between alpha and the beta one. That difference includes the interaction contribution and also includes the we call it mediation components. So that component is a component that's E. Even this association between E and G, it can't appear, right? So yeah. So actually we can do this test. We can say if we test the difference between alpha and beta 1, actually we test whether there's interaction evidence. There is interaction evidence or also mediation evidence. So if we have some statistical for both the main effect model and the marginal effect model, that statistical is very straightforward, very simple. So we can calculate we can test it. So so the this advantage advantage if we look at the difference. If we look at the difference, because we do not need to reject this main effect model and the interaction effect model into the same data set. Actually, we can still do this tester, but the marginal effect and the main effectors come from different models. So that's the the good thing because we uh if we Because we uh if we usually we do GWAS analysis uh early, so usually that a GWAS analysis will always have a bad large sample size. So that's good thing. But GBAR international analysis, you always need to measure the environment component. So it's always far behind. Also, they may have some missing data because we do not know the environment component. So, but for this tester, you basically can use those three different uh data sets to do the tester. However, there are some kind of issue or bias if we wanted to detect the interaction of mutations. So, one big issue is GWAS and the genome-wide interactions are usually performed by different group. So in this case, there are some variations across the status. That includes the trade definition, trader measurement procedure, quality control procedure. For example, if one started, they want to do inverse normal transformation, the other starter, they otherwise inverse normal transformation. So those could cost the system, systematical differences between I barn and beta bar, right? So also it. So also the covalent, how you are going to add the covariate the significance model. So then also how do you deal with the population structure so that they may have different ways to deal with the population structure. So all those can cause the difference between R and 1. So how we are going to solve this issue? Actually, it turns, we do not need to test the difference. Not needed to test the difference between alpha eta 1, but we can assume some kind of coefficient. So we wanted to test alpha minus theta beta 1 to 0. The reason is because all those are systematic biases, so we think we can add a parameter here and we can eliminate those systematic bias. So if we know there's a zeta, we can still cast an We can still test with the intellectual or mediation, but we can use this method to do the test. But one question is we need to know this C, how we can estimate this C. So it turns out this is very similar as a model randomization approach. So if in modular randomization, In modular and margin method, we already got that so this we use internal variable to test the causality of this theta for exposure x on y. So here in this model, we usually assume genetic valence or internal variable is not directly associated with y. So if there is association, if there is association is associated directly with y, that is a horizontal pre-tropic. So in mono-normalization, we need to eliminate that pre-tropic effect. So actually, this pathway can also be drawn similarly for G-by intellection analysis. So here again, we have So here again we have genetic variance but we we don't know about the exposure although we have outcome but we can create a solo exposure product. So this solo exposure you can imagine this is kind of a polygenic score. So here X is G to Y is better director association or director contribution is that as an environment G by G by E interaction. So that's G to E, we can consider E as some kind of confounding. So G slow E, that's actually some mediation. So we can try to find out whether there's horizontal pre-trapping or mediation rather than test the causality. So in look at the figure, actually there's In local figure, actually, they are very similar. So, even the ST by interaction, you explain the departure from this part. So actually, we can monitor the margin framework, we have a lot of different methods to find which valence has a feature effect. So, that is one of the tests we can use. So, here for the by inflation, From G by interaction, actually, we can similarly just perform on the randomization. For the estimate theta, then it's a successful. But it's very straightforward. So the question is, I said this modular randomization based framework is tested for associa either for mediation or device interaction. Of Devi interaction. So, really, it's not a direct request for interaction. So, what we propose is that we can do two staging methods. So, further, we can use this method to split the whole genome. And next step two is we generally locate those genetic values survival into this tester. Then, we direct the tester interactions. So, that will give us the internet. That will give us the interaction. So the nice thing is when we use this two-stage method, it can reduce the number of comparisons at the stage two test. So this can increase the power. So another thing is there is another interpretation. So at the second stage, we find that the direct test is not a significant. The director test is not significant, then it will paralyze this mutation factor. So that is also nice. So actually this method is similar to a two-stage method of test G by G interaction proposed a few years by TRIS. So in this method, they condition on the marginal effect, they only tell those genetic values, which genome-wise situation happened. Rich genome-wide association happens, then they localize the G by D-E interaction, you can, or G by D interaction. So here you can actually do the same thing, conditional minimal effect with G by D testing in the circular G by E test in the circular. But however, actually our experience tells us that our method actually can reduce the number of Can reduce the number of module comparisons substantially at the steady two. So, another advantage is we can detect a balance with a low minimal association by the simplified GPA simulation. So, I'm going to skip the simulation because I don't have a lot of time, so I'm going to show you some results. So, we use the genome-wide intellectual. intellectual started some restatistic launch strategy by the gene lifestyle intellectual consortium. So one data set we are going to look at is gene by smoking intellectual on mixed trade. So the second is for gene by alcohol drinker interaction test. So actually the total sample size So actually the total sample size for state one is around 130,000 samples. They provide all those summary statistics, including the main factor summary statistics. So we can expand. So then in terms of TWAS data, we use the summary statistic from this study that has involved 1.6 million summary size, marked multiplier. So here at the stadium one, So here at the stage one analysis, this is what we find. Actually, we find that multiple loads show potential interaction for smoking contributed to HDLC. So this is another for alcohol drinker, we also identify multiple values. So just to give you some sum. Some summary. So we use the photostadia to screen the genome. We find a total 17 independent signals. There's on 15 independent locals. So input LDLC, 4 smoking interaction, 5 actual drinking interaction. And so it's not a necessary intellectual mingling. So HDL and TG were also part of a number of A number of planets show some potential evidence. So then we apply the second stages. So we find that eight of those 17 actually have direct interaction evidence. That's after a teleform comparison. So here is the much detailed result for those eight genetic variants. So at the stage one, we show they are quite significant. Then for the direct test. For the direct tester, so that's a direct tester. We also saw find the direct interaction tester in gene art interaction strategy. Those are the significance. So all those significant, then we try to say even we can replicate those interactions in UK BioBank data. So one question here is uh we use UK BioBank We use UK BioBank data to use a direct tester, but the UK Biobanker data is part of this large GWAS study. So the nice thing is that actually this intellectual test step is independent of this test step, also independent of those test steps. So you basically give you two replication. So in this replication study, we also found multiple values. We also find the multiple values and they are can be treated. So then we combine, if we combine the evidence, those genetic balance can be treated. So interesting for this genetic balance, although we find it validation was not replicated in UK Bar Bank data, so that genetic value Bank data. So that genetic valence was not as significant in my test. So that's actually one of the noble values, but we couldn't replicate the result, which couldn't not survive for multiple comp balances. So what about those non-loss are could another be survived in stage of two? Survived in stage two analysis. Actually, we found that only one locus is not associated with smoking or drink. So if you tell us all those, most of those genetic values may have those mutation complications. I think I don't have enough time, so I guess. So finally, I wanted to just mention we use those differences. Actually, we can estimate the capability. Capability, this capability can be contributed to because of the intellectual competition. So actually, that has a reality is also significant for TT and LDL C, but for LDLC is only for L small T. So it just tells us there is some kind of there is some kind of contribution for Contribution for G by E interaction. Also, we find that for those minimal effects, they are a substantial portion of the G by E international mitigation contribution. So, I think I don't have enough. I should probably stop here. Maybe get a summarize quicker. So, we developed those two stages and we also developed the stage. And we also detect the multiple G bar intellectual. And we find that the minor effect could have some contribution of G bar intellectual or mediation. But I have not time to talk about it, so I will just talk with you. Thank you. I want to have you back here again. Very clearly, on my idea of using the name of the conversation. Maybe one quick question before we have the coffee break. HDL and triglycerides are very highly correlated negatively. Are just what are the results independent between those two fractions? So actually some of those evaluations, when we find the HDLC, we also find the LDLC. So it's not a properly dependent. Probably the presenter. But certainly, they are quite a most of the valences, they are not with a certain number of values actually can only be found for. I was just saying because you showed a difference between regalisterides and HDL, which regalicoids have looked at more interaction than the HDL. Yeah, we haven't looked at it though. Those two are sort of highly correlated. We haven't looked at them. Maybe we'll take a coffee break and come back at 10.15. 10:20? Okay, 10.20.
