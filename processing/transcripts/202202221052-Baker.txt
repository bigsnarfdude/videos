Yeah, kind of a similar but different uh project from Nimish's. So I think it's a nice kind of segue. Um, yeah, so I'm going to talk about buoyant microplastics and wind-driven turbulence, and this is work I'm doing right now with Michelle at the University of Washington. So, first, I'll give a little motivation and background info. Then, I'll talk really briefly about some experiments in an idealized case, and then I'll go. Case and then I'll go over the experiments that we're doing and some preliminary results. Okay, so why do we care about microplastics and wind-driven turbulence? I think we all have gotten a lot of motivation on that already, but just quickly, it's important to know how deep the microplastics get mixed by the wind and the waves. Today, this morning, we heard about horizontal transport on a global scale. And Nimish talked about more. And Nimish talked about more vertical transport. So there's different mechanisms of transport, but ultimately, we want to know how deep they're getting mixed. And in particular, that affects estimates of how the microplastics can be weathered or broken down. For example, in the ocean, microplastics break down pretty slowly over time, but we don't actually know the time scale of that. So the existing estimates of how long microplastics are. Estimates of how long microplastics exist in the ocean are actually not peer-reviewed. And recent research has showed that sunlight can chemically break down some types of plastic. So this would, of course, affect their lifetime estimates, but how? So essentially, sunlight is attenuated by the water as you go deeper. So that's one reason why you need to know how deep plastic is mixed in the ocean. And when I say mixed, of course, we're thinking of turbulence. Mixed, of course, we're thinking of turbulence. Okay, so how does turbulence happen in the ocean surface layer? A common scenario is that wind blows over the water, which creates two things. We get waves and a shear layer. So both of these can lead to mixing. The shear layer scales with the wind speed, and we're going to quantify this with U star, which is the shear or friction velocity of the water. When this gradient gets steep enough, When this gradient gets steep enough, it becomes unstable, and which leads to turbulence and mixing. Okay, so what happens when you have microplastic particles in here? And in particular, I'm thinking of buoyant microplastics, which most microplastics in the ocean are positively buoyant because they're in salt water and they do have a tendency to float. But at the same time, this turbulence mixes them downward. This turbulence mixes them downward. If the particles are on the larger side, so millimeter or centimeter scale, as well as being non-spherical, they don't perfectly trace the water's motion. So their shape and inertia cause them to sort of take their own path. And the balance between buoyancy and mixing results in a concentration profile which decays with depth. And theoretically, it's an exponential decay. It's an exponential decay. But the interaction between particles and turbulence is still an active topic of research, as this conference shows. So this concentration profile is still sort of an open question for microplastics. And that's one of the questions we're trying to answer with our experiments. The other question we want to answer is: what is the particle orientation? So, this matters because the particle orientation determines the instantaneous drag, which can help the Which can help us kind of understand how they're mixed. And the other reason we want to know that is because if these particles are sensitive to UV light, their orientation as well as their depth determine how much sunlight they're going to be exposed to. So, then, what other mechanisms for mixing are there? We also have Langmere circulation, which happens when wind blows over water waves. Essentially, the vorticity from Stokes drift and breaking waves is rotated by the wind shear. So you get these counter-rotating cells with regions of convergence and divergence on the surface. And then these deep upward and downward kind of jets. So that encourages really deep vertical mixing. And you can see this on the surface, they form these windrows. So this is where the bubbles are other flowing. Where the bubbles or other floating matter converges on the surface. And then you can also get breaking waves. So when waves become steep enough, they break. And this can happen both on the coastline or in the open ocean in very young seas where the wind is fast compared to the speed of wave propagation. So when waves break, they create strong downbursts and intense mixing near the surface. Okay, so this is very complex. What if we could hold the sea surface steady and just isolate the turbulent boundary layer on the surface to start? So it turns out we can. So first I want to spend a few minutes just focusing on water flowing over a solid wall in a channel. So essentially flipping the problem upside down, we just have a flat solid wall where a turbulent shear layer forms over the surface. Forms over the surface. So here the particles, and here I'm showing disk and rod-shaped particles are going to interact with this turbulent boundary layer on the bottom wall. And some questions that we want to answer here are what is how are the particles oriented? Do they have a preferential orientation? How do they tumble? And how does their shape affect their concentration distribution? So I'm basically going to skip all of the messages. Basically, I'm going to skip all of the methods and details of this sort of idealized experiment. And if anyone has questions, we can talk about them later. I'm just going to skip straight to the results of these. So first, let's look at the particle orientation. And here I'm showing the rods. So these are PDFs of Px, Pz, and Py, which are just the components of the orientation of this vector P. P of the rod particle, which is aligned with its axis of rotational symmetry. So here the circles are for distributions of particles near the wall, and crosses are farther away from the wall. So essentially what these PDFs are telling us, just to skip to the conclusion, is that the preferential orientation of rods basically looks like this, where they're tilted a little bit nose up, but otherwise mostly aligned in the streamwise direction. So in the same The streamwise direction, so in the same direction as the flow. And as you can see from the fact that the peaks are sharper for the rods near the wall, the distribution is more isotropic near the wall and more random in the outer region. So then I'll show the same thing for the disks. And here we see kind of a similar thing. So the disks are, they have their flat dimension aligned mostly in the streamwise direction. Aligned mostly in the streamwise direction. Again, a little bit sort of nose up. And here we see actually the opposite result where the disks are, they have a very isotropic alignment in the outer region of the flow. And near the wall, they're a little bit more randomly distributed. So that's an interesting difference that we find between rods and disks just in respect to their orientation. Then I want to look at the tumbling rates. The tumbling rates. So these are vertical profiles of the mean squared tumbling rate, which just quantifies the total magnitude of their tumbling motion. So here we see that the rods, which are in red, tumble a lot more than discs, which are in blue, near the wall. So this is the region of the flow where the shear is the strongest. So maybe the rods are more responsive to the mean shear than the discs are. And rotation due to this mean shear would show up in the component of the In the component of the tumbling rate that's normal to sort of the plane that we're looking at, normal to the streamwise component. So we're just going to look at that component alone, which is the Y component. The negative values here show that the particles are tumbling in the same sense as the mean shear is rotating them. And here we do see that the rods have a larger spanwise tumbling rate. So this does suggest that the rods follow the motion of the mean shear more readily than Motion of the mean shear more readily than the discs. And here are just two examples of that kind of motion. So you can see the rod tumbling here, and it is mostly around the spanwise axis. It kind of looks like it's just tumbling end over end, as opposed to the disc here, where it's more just sort of wobbling around its flat, slightly tilted preferential orientation. So this kind of motion suggests that discs have more of a resistance to. The discs have more of a resistance to tumbling, whereas rods are more easily rotated by the shear and the turbulence. Okay, and then finally, let's look at the particle concentration for this turbulent boundary layer experiment. So these are vulnerable profiles of the concentration for the rods in red again and the disks in blue. And then we have sort of a control case where we have some spherical particles. And I've just shifted each one. And I've just shifted each one to the right so that they don't overlap, just for clarity. So, as I mentioned earlier, the particles are caught in a balance between a gravitational settling, pulling them downward, and turbulent mixing, resuspending them upward. So if we make a few assumptions, we can actually find an analytical solution for the concentration profile from this balance. So, first, we're going to assume that we're at equilibrium conditions where the net particle Equilibrium conditions where the net particle flux is zero in the vertical direction. Then we're going to assume that the particles settle at their terminal velocity in still fluid. And third, we'll assume that the turbulent flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. All right, so with these assumptions, the flux balance becomes an advection diffusion model, which we can solve analytically to get this power law, where this exponent is the Ross number. It depends on the particle. Number. It depends on the particle settling velocity and the shear velocity of the flow. So, how does this compare to what we actually observe? That's what I'm showing here in these lines. So, clearly, it's not a perfect fit, and the concentration profile for the spheres doesn't match very well at all. For the rods and the disks, they do follow the theoretical profile at intermediate C positions, but near the wall and in the outer region. The wall and in the outer region, there's some deviation. So, why would that be? We think some of these assumptions don't necessarily hold for particles like this. So, first, in the free stream region away from the wall, we find actually a slight non-equilibrium condition where there's a small net flux of particles downward. And we also find that the particle setting velocity in the channel was equal to the terminal velocity in the outer region. Equal to the terminal velocity in the outer region, but that decreased as the particles approached the wall. So we think this is probably a result of particles interacting with the wall either through lubrication or saltation. Okay, so just to quickly summarize these simpler experiments, we find preferential orientations like this. We find that the rods tumble a lot more than the disks, and we find that their concentration And we find that their concentration sort of follows this power law, but not all the way. All right, so now I'll move on to our actual experiments in a wind wave tank. So here we're looking at this sort of wind tunnel over a water channel. You can see people here for scale. This is the Washington ARC Interaction Research Facility. Research facility. So the test section here is about 12 meters long. The wind blows around here, so we get waves and wind shear generated on the water surface here. We have a beach at one end to absorb these waves and prevent reflections back into the test section. And our region of interest is here at about a seven-meter fetch from the start of the channel. So in this region, this is where we do. So, in this region, this is where we do our particle imaging and also measure the water velocity. All right, so first I'll spend a couple minutes just talking about the water velocity itself. So, how we measure this, we have an ADV profiler attached to it to take several profiles throughout the or through the water column at different span-wise positions within the water channel. Positions within the water channel. And this is, you can see the beach sort of in the picture here. So, just a sense of the positioning. When we do this, these are the water velocity profiles that we get. So, this is mean streamwise velocity here as a function of depth with respect to the instantaneous water surface. So, there are waves on the water, and here I'm plotting the velocity as a function of the distance. The velocity as a function of the distance between the instantaneous surface, even as there are waves forming. And I'm showing three different wind speeds here. So the highest one is 16 meters per second. This is the free stream velocity inside the wind tunnel part of the water channel. And at the highest wind speed, especially, we see a very strong shear layer developing on the surface of the water. So this indicates. So, this indicates that we probably are going to have some turbulence because this is a strong shear layer. Also, note that we have a little bit of a return flow setting up at the bottom, and this is pretty normal in laboratory experiments when you have a finite volume of water. But we're mainly concerned with this part near the surface, so we're not too concerned about that. I also am going to show the shear stress, so this quantifies the vertical transport. Quantifies the vertical transport of the fluid momentum by turbulence as well as by nonlinear wave distortion. And again, we see that it's pretty high near the surface, especially for the highest wind speed. So this indicates that, yes, we do have turbulent mixing, and we can expect the particles to kind of not just stay on the surface, but likely get mixed down. All right, so let's also look at the instantaneous velocities. Previously, the profile. Previously, the profiles kind of give us an overall average behavior, but we also that doesn't tell us the whole picture. So, here what I'm showing is a subset of the profile between 24 and 27 centimeters below the water surface over a period of about two minutes. And these are just instantaneous velocity measurements that we see. So, what we see here is these very Is these very coherent, kind of almost large-scale fluctuations in the velocities? So, this is stream-wise, span-wise, and vertical velocities. They're pretty large. They span at least several centimeters, and they're fairly coherent in time as well, lasting kind of several seconds. So, what we think we're seeing here is some language circulation, maybe sort of transient or turbulent. Or turbulent linguistic formed by the vorticity from our waves on the surface interacting with the wind blowing over the water. So that's an interesting result. We have both turbulence from the shear layer as well as language circulation, which can be affecting our particles. And then finally, a note on the waves that we have. So we have deep water waves. We have deep water waves, and it's a young sea state, like basically all laboratory experiments are. Our significant wave height varies from one to four centimeters. So this is a young sea state. We have a wave spectrum here for again the three different wind speeds. And what's to note here is that the wave spectrum peaks. Wave spectrum peaks, but it's sort of a broadbanded spectrum. So it does actually match the shape of a John-Swap spectrum, which is encouraging for us. So even though these are laboratory waves, they have a realistic spectrum shape. So that's great. They are unidirectional waves with a small fetch, but they should be summaristic for recreating some aspects of ocean surface turbulence. Of ocean surface turbulence. All right, so then let's add the particles. These are five different particle types that we have tried so far. Here's a one centimeter bar for scale. And all of these particles are made of HDPE. So they're going to be slightly buoyant in water. These are nurdles, which are plastic pellets like Michelle talked about yesterday. We also have rods cut from 3D printing filaments. Cut from 3D printing filament at one centimeter and two centimeter lengths. And then we have discs as well, which are die cut from a sheet of HTP. So this is five millimeters and one centimeter in diameter. And these particles can be described with a couple non-dimensional parameters. And here I'm going to focus on two of them. So the Stokes number is a non-dimensional time scale, which has been mentioned before already, but just to review. Just to review, it quantifies the level of inertia in the particles, and it's the particle response time scale normalized by the relevant fluid time scale. And here, all these particles are on the order of 10. So the Stokes number varies roughly between 4 and 20 from kind of the smallest to the largest particles here. And then we also have the SV number, which is the particle terminal rise velocity normalized by this shear velocity. And here they're all on the order. And here they're all on the order of one. It varies between about 0.9 and 3, depending on what particle we're looking at. So, this indicates basically that buoyancy is important, but it's not the dominant mechanism in the dynamics. Okay, so as I talked about in the introduction, we need to know how the particle depth and orientation kind of evolve over time. And to do this, we need long track. And to do this, we need long tracks, which requires a large field of view and a large depth of field. We also need high resolution to see the orientation, and we need high resolution in time so that we can track the particles. All right, so how are we going to make this work? What we're going to do is large-scale 2D shadow tracking. So, essentially, we have a point source of light, we shine it at a Fresnel lens, and this creates collimated light rays. Creates collimated light rays that we shine towards the back wall of the channel. And the advantage of doing this is that if you have an object in this collimated light, it will cast a sharp shadow that doesn't change in size no matter where this object is inside the light. This is the same kind of lens that you find in a lighthouse, and it's a useful way to get a large region of collimated light. So essentially, So, essentially, what we're tracking here is not the particles themselves, but their shadows. And this is a picture of what this looks like in real life. So, here we have a blue LED, blue to minimize the absorption by the water. This is our Fresnel lens, and this is the rectangle of collimated light that it's casting on the back wall. So, the scale of this, our lens is one meter long or wide, so our field of view is the same size. It's one meter. Is the same size, it's one meter. So, this is great. We get a large field of view where we can get sharp shadows from the particles throughout this whole 3D volume, basically where the light is shining. But how do we image this large field of view at high resolution? Basically, we need a camera array. So, we have an array of four cameras. Each camera is focused on one quadrant of this light sheet, and they're attached to a central. And they're attached to a central computer, so they're synchronized, and we basically just get one very high resolution image of the particle shadows. So these are, this is an example image that we get from the camera. This is just one quadrant. And here I'm circling a particle. In order to detect it, we first reverse the intensity and subtract the background to get something that looks like this. And from here, we can just binarize the image. Here we can just binarize the image and detect particle and get its centroid as well as the outline from which we can get the orientation. All right, so first I want to show just some videos of three of the particle shapes. So the nurdles, the small rods, and the small discs. And here I'm showing the intensity reversed background subtract images just so it's more easy to see. And I just want to say again, these are preliminary. Again, these are preliminary data. We've only started doing these experiments recently. But, all right, so here is the video for the nurdles. And I'll just let it play for a minute first. So the red dots are tracking one particular particle in this video. So right away we can notice the wave orbitals here. So the particles are clearly following the circles of the wave orbit. Circles of the wave orbitals. And we can also notice that some particles are moving up and some particles are moving down. So, this is illustrating the fact that there is turbulent mixing as well as buoyancy. Particles are not just floating to the surface. And also at the end of this animation, we can notice a group of particles getting pushed down right there, pushed down by a breaking wave, potentially, is what we think it is. Is what we think it is. So that's exciting. We have three types of sort of turbulent mixing in this channel: we have the shear, the turbulence from the shear, language circulation, as well as breaking waves. All right, so then I'll go to the rods. Again, I have one of these rods being traced out, and there are some other ones in the video. So, again, we can see particles both going up and going down, but also here we can notice. But also, here we can notice the rotation. So, the rods here are tumbling, but they appear to be tumbling fairly slowly relative to the time scale of the wave period. So, that's kind of an interesting result, which maybe seems different from what we saw in the turbulent boundary layer experiments. And finally, here's the video for the disks. So, in this case, and I'm sure it's probably a little hard to see over Zoom. Sure, it's probably a little hard to see over Zoom. But what's different here is the disc is actually tumbling a lot more energetically than the rod was. So it's got a pretty intense tumbling event right here. So that's kind of surprising. From the turbulent boundary layer experiments, we expected the rods to be tumbling more strongly, but here it seems like the disks actually are. So So, that indicates maybe there's some effects from waves that are having some different dynamics relative to the taperline boundary layer on just a solid wall. So, we don't really have any explanations, mechanistic explanations for this yet, but this is something that we're looking into. And then, finally, I also want to look at the particle concentration for this experiment. For this experiment. So again, we have sort of the opposite thing from before. The rising is balanced by the turbulent mixing. And again, we're going to assume equilibrium conditions. The particles rise at their terminal rise velocity in still fluid. And again, we assume mixing due to turbulent diffusion. And here, this is different than the case in a solid wall boundary. The case in a solid wall boundary layer. So we assume constant mixing due to the turbulent diffusion, which scales with wave state as well as the shear velocity. And essentially what we end up with is this exponential decay, where this decay length scale depends on the rise velocity and the eddy viscosity. Okay, so here is the concentration profile for just the nurdles. I'm going to just show that first. I'm going to just show that first. This is normalized concentration, and this is depth normalized by the dominant wavelength. All right, so how does this compare with our exponential decay? Pretty well. So the shaded area here is a 95% confidence interval, and we see that the exponential model matches the neuronal concentration pretty well. There's some variation, but overall, it's not too bad. It's not too bad. But then, what happens when you look at the rods and the disks? So, the rods are in red, the disks are in blue, and here we see that it's actually a lot different. The rods and the disks don't really follow this model at all. So we need to look deeper into why this is the case, but it's likely due to the particle shape or size affecting its transport in turbulence, and specifically wind-driven turbulence. These particles. These particles, the three particles that I showed, do have slightly different Stokes and SV numbers from each other, but it's not a drastic difference. So that leaves the question: why is this concentration, why are these concentration profiles so different from the neurdels? So this indicates that shape may play an important role in this dynamic, even though they have similar inertia and rise velocities. All right, so just to summarize, we designed. All right, so just to summarize, we designed an experiment to measure plastic particle depth and orientation in wind-driven turbulence and waves. We found that particle tumbling varies with shape, with the disks seeming to tumble more than the rods. And the disc and rod concentration does not follow this exponential decay as opposed to the nerdles, which appears to follow it pretty well. So, the next steps we need to do, we want to do a parameter sweep so we can kind of isolate. So, we can kind of isolate the effects of shape, size, and rise velocity on the particle dynamics and what they're doing. We want to measure the particle orientations, and we want to get Lagrangian statistics of their depth and orientation. And ultimately, we want to use these Lagrangian statistics to estimate things like the total amount of sunlight a particle experiences over time or the average temperature or salinity of the water around it. Or salinity of the water around it, or any other ocean properties that depend on depth. So, ultimately, we want to answer the question: is particle inertia, size, or shape the most important for determining its behavior, or are they all important? That's something that we're working on right now. And then finally, I want to acknowledge my funding source as well as the students who helped me do a lot of this work, in particular, Anusha. Work. In particular, Anusha Egerwald and undergrad, who has been working with me for several months now. All right, so that's it. I'm happy to take any questions. Great. Well, thanks a lot for an excellent talk. You can see the applause, not hear the applause. Wonderful. Do we have any questions for Lucy? So I have a first question. have a first question from i have a question those are clapping hands still so bruce has a question really nice talk lucy thank you very much the one thing i wasn't sure about was your interpretation of some of this uh intermittent flow in this wave tank we're looking at right now being attributed to language circulation because i wasn't sure if the width of your tank would be great enough to allow Would be great enough to allow for Langmuir circulation. Can you elaborate on why you think it might be that? Yeah, so that's a good question. And we're not, I mean, we're not 100% sure yet that it is Langmuir circulation. The width of the tank is about a meter. So theoretically, it is large enough to have some circulation. We haven't verified it for sure. But the reason we think it's that is because those length and time scales are kind of larger than what we'd expect for if it was. What we'd expect for if it was just turbulence alone, because they're so coherent, it seems like maybe it's some type of it might be transient, but it seems like it's some type of more coherent kind of control rotating cell or something like that. So, but we do need to verify it more. We're not you didn't see some kind of convergence, say, in the middle of the tank or against the sidewalls, which might be a good signature of it. No, yeah, we there's not really any bubbles or anything to look. Any bubbles or anything to look for to see if there's convergence, but that is another way that we can verify it by adding something that floats in the channel. Thanks again. Yeah, thanks. Do we have another question from Luish? Hi, Lucy. Really nice work and really nice talk. Thanks very much. I was wondering the L, the length scale, the mixing length scale, how did you was that you fit it to the data or how did you estimate it? Yeah, so I just fit it to the data. Yeah, so I just fit it to the data. I haven't verified if that's if you calculate it from the formula that it's supposed to be, because we don't have great estimates yet for like the shear velocity in our channel and stuff. So once we can actually estimate those better, then we can compare what we expect L to be and then we can fit it to the curve and see how close it is. Cool. But yeah, for now, they're just fit. And one other quick, maybe more, more of a comment. What about the weight? More of a comment. What about the wave-induced mixing that Michelle has worked on before, as well as the wind-induced? I mean, is there a way to combine the two? I mean, yeah, I mean, they're kind of all mixed together in the data that we have. So it's there. And I don't know if we'll be able to necessarily separate out those effects or not. Okay, we have another question from Marie. Yeah, thank you very much for the talk. I have a question on the diffusivity, the turbulent diffusivity that you use for this setup, because we know that for this kind of mixing, the turbulent intensity should decrease with depth. And I'm wondering how you take it into account to model the vertical concentration profile. Yeah, so that's a good question. Yeah, so that's a good question. And I'm so essentially just using the model from Kukulka 2012, where it's parameterized. So it is a function of depth, but it's just parameterized from the shear velocity and the significant wave height and the wave frequency, I think. So yeah, there's room for improvement in the model. The diffusivity is like something that's important for. Something that's important for the model, but hard to know exactly what it is. So, yeah, right now it's kind of just first order. Yeah, because I think that for the, well, I don't remember the size of the wave, it's a few centimeters. Yeah, few centimeters. Well, it could be assumed at constant for about a few centimeters below the surface, but I think after you have to take into account maybe the decrease, and well, but if you Maybe the decrease, and well, if you don't have a look at it, but it could be interesting. Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's yeah, it's an important parameter. And also, you look at the terminal, well, the vertical velocity. So you have access to this quantity, but you use the setting velocity in using In a using maybe a balance between the drag and the buoyancy, but why you don't use the ones that you measured in your experiment? Oh, yeah, that's a good question. So the ones we measure in our experiment are already, I mean, they're not a good estimate because it's like already the balance between the turbulence and buoyancy. So it's not going to measure just the rise velocity from the buoyancy alone. So that's why we do it. So that's why we do it. We just measure the particle rise velocity in still water because the averages we get would be accounting for particles that are rising and that are mixing down together. But yeah, it's using still velocity or still water to measure the rise velocity is also maybe not the most accurate thing because they might act differently when they're in turbulence. And actually, many studies have shown that they do. Studies have shown that they do act differently when they're in turbulence. So that's another kind of simplification. Thank you. Great. Any more questions for Lucy? Excellent. Well, thank you very much, Lucy, for a great talk.
