All right, I'm going to talk about a slightly different topic compared with a lot of the solid particles presentation this morning. I'm going to focus primarily on bubble deformation in turbulence. And particularly, I'm going to focus on the multi-scale deformation and fragmentation. And that is basically consistent with the theme of this workshop. The theme of this workshop. I was able to find my cursor somewhere here. Okay, there we go. All right, there we go. So I'm going to use this cursor to show where I'm pointing at. Hopefully the Zoom audience can see it as well as an in-person audience. So first of all, I'm from Johns Hopkins University. This work is done by a series. Is done by a series of graduate students started from by Ashik and Ashwans. They are actually my first two PhD students, and followed by Xiong Tan and Inghe Chi, and a bunch of other grad students who have contributed to this. And more importantly, I think we have a very nice contribution from years of undergrad students who helped to build the facility and do some experiments. Oh, by the way, I just want to emphasize I'm an experimentalist. So a lot of the work I'm doing, I'm going to presenting today is actually. I'm going to be presenting today is actually up and downs about the story I want to share with you guys over the for the stuff we did in the past five to six years. Okay, I'm going to move on to the next slide if this thing allows me to. Not anymore, I guess. Is this working? Okay. Okay, now it's working. All right. I want to start by talking about simple problems. Sorry, it's very hard to navigate between two different things here. Okay, I want to start by talking about simple problems. A problem that Charles has alluded to this morning. Okay, it's not working. Okay. Working okay. So the problem is essentially related to how the bubble is being deformed in a simple shear flow, a simple straining flow here. And in this particular problem, you can think about a dimensionless number, which is Web number, which is slightly different from the Capillary number Charles presented this morning because Capurian number is typically limited to the very small-scale bubbles or droplets. Then the surrounding flow is typically laminar, and the viscous stress really drives. And the viscous stress really driving the deformation. But if you imagine the bubbles or droplet becomes larger and larger, and you're dealing with a problem that's a finite-size droplets or bubbles being deformed in a simple stringing flow, you need to use Web number because the pressure that's deformed the bubbles or droplets is actually the dynamic pressure instead of the viscous shear stress. So, in this case, you can easily define a dimensionless number called WebNumber. And this Web number here. Number and this web number here is right here. And this web number is a ratio between the rho u squared, and rho is a density of the surrounding flow of using subscript w to represent water because I'm going to focus primarily on the bubble problem right now. And the u is a typical velocity scales that you have to deal with in this problem. And I'm going to talk a little bit later what is this typical velocity scale refers to. And then in the denominator, I have the surface tension, and this is a basic. Have the surface tension, and this is basically the restoring force. Essentially, the pressure gradient around the bubbles trying to deform the bubble, and the surface tension trying to restore it back to the spherical case. So, when the wave number is smaller than one, you can see that the bubble is essentially spherical. And when you start to increase the pressure gradient across the bubble a little bit, imagine you have a pressure across the vertical direction to try to compress the bubble. Then you're going to try to deform the bubble in this way. And this is basically for the case where you have. And this is basically for the case where you have web number larger than one. And if you move forward, this is basically a case driven by this kind of a simple straining flow. And if you imagine that you continue to increase the web number to very much, much larger than one, the problem essentially becomes a fragmentation problem because one bubble or droplet breaks into two. As Kuma mentioned this morning, and this is actually, I think in his uncertainty list, he mentioned this is a pretty high uncertainty when you start to add a fragmentation. When you start to add a fragmentation and coalescence into the problem of multi-phase flows simulation, so this is basically which we believe we can use experiments trying to inform the simulation about how should we understand the fragmentation or coalescence problem. Today's talk, I'm going to focus primarily on the fragmentation and deformation problem here. Okay, so this is a very simple problem, right? So we all can picture this in our mind. We have a simple linear flow and we deform the finite size bubbles. We deform the finite size bubbles until it's a breakup. And this has a very wide range of applications. A lot of audience here today are familiar with that. Some of the applications related to the gas bubbles. And this could be found in, for example, chemical reactors or could be found in air-sea interactions where you have breaking waves and train gas into the ocean side. And the train gas basically undergoes a sequence of fragmentation that eventually break a very, very tiny droplet. Eventually, they break a very, very tiny droplet of the bubbles. And that's why you can see this kind of white cap in the ocean. And for guys who just came from Cancun, you can imagine this is basically all the nice white-ish water you see near the beach is basically for the air bubbles. And then you also have this less beautiful phenomena, which is due to the oil pollution. So in this case, the things that being fragmented is not air bubbles, but oil droplets. Okay. And also you can imagine the And also you can imagine the problems like atomization, and you have a large liquid brain fragmenting to smaller and smaller constituents. In this case, it could be fuel droplets, it could be other kind of media. For the COVID-19 case, you can imagine this is basically the virus-laden sort of droplets. Okay, in all those cases, as I mentioned to you before, the key dimensionless number is a web number. And the web number has a certain quantity. For example, it has a velocity scale u here. Has a velocity scale u here that's related to the velocity around the bubbles that are trying to drive the deformation breakup, and also you have the land scale, which is a bubble diameter here. So the key question we really want to ask for our project is really what is our typical velocity scale and land scale that we should use in turbulence. Essentially, what kind of turbulence land scale and velocity scale really drive the deformation and fragmentation of the bubbles? All right, so. All right. So moving forward here. All right. So the classical framework to quantify or describe the bubble fragmentation is turbulence. It can be simply pictured in this way. So you can imagine you have a bluish, this is the bubbles, surrounded by a bunch of eddies of a different sizes. Eddies basically, you can imagine the typical swarming flow structures in turbines. Flow structures in turbines. If you separate those eddies and rank them, and you can actually thinking about the small eddies to large eddies, small eddies down to the chromograph scale, large eddy down to up to the integral scale. And there is a range in between. This is a sort of the so-called inertial range where the energy is sort of cascade from large scale down to the smaller scales. All right, this is a slide I feel like it's actually very interesting because there's a little bit of history here. The common graffit in his 1941 paper focused a lot of on 41 paper focused a lot on the fundamentals of turbulence, and he's probably really the pioneers who worked out a lot of interesting phenomenological models for turbulence. And one of the importance is to describe the energy cascade phenomena. And in this inertial range, you actually have this very interesting power law scaling if you describe the structure function. So the second order structure function is described as a velocity increment for certain separation R. A certain separation R, you take a square of that, and you get something like a kinetic energy. And this typically second-order velocity structure function scale with C2 multiplied by epsilon R to the power of two-thirds. Epsilon is the energy dissipation rate. That typically tells you how strong the energy is being dissipated through turbulence here. And R here is again a scale separation. So if I pick two points in the flow, then that's basically the separation between that two points. Between that two points. What's less known from a historical perspective is that Karma Graf actually wrote another paper in 1949. This is eight years after his pioneer work about the fundamental turbulence. Eight years later, he wrote this paper on the breakage of drops in a turbulent flow. Okay, what's interesting here is this is almost at the same time with Hainz's most famous work in 1955 on the fundamentals of hydrodynamic mechanism of splitting in dispersion processes. So, but later on. So, but later on, when people refer to fragmentation processing turbulence, people always call it HINS theory or HINS model, even though Common Graph actually did that probably six years earlier. But at that time, there's no internet, so they probably don't know each other's work. So I will refer to this framework Common Graph hints from in my presentation just because the historic perspective here. But in both papers, they had this very strong assumption here. This very strong assumption here, and this assumption, this is actually a copy-paste directly from Hint's paper. I'm going to read it here. So, the key assumption in Hint's paper is these dynamic pressure forces, which refer to the force that actually caused the deformation and breakup of bubbles, are caused by changes in velocity over distances at the most equal to the diameter of the drop. You can apply it also to the bubbles. Bubbles and drops are in my presentation interchangeable, although they have a different density and viscosity. Although they have a different density and viscosity, but for now, I'm just only focused on the surface tension, so it means the same thing to me. So, this one, this quote here, really emphasizes a key assumption in Kromwalf-Hinn's framework, which is bubbles are driven by the eddies of the same size. So, what that means is if I have a bubble here, I focus on the pressure that drives the deformation. I typically focus on the velocity that cross the bubble diameter. So, basically, I have a velocity here, ux, the data. A velocity here ux, and the other velocity is at the separation r away, and the separation r is basically the diameter based on the Komographic Hines assumption. So, if I do some simple substitution here, so instead of having a typical velocity u, I'm using the second-order structure function. You can see that this is a basic delta u squared instead of u square. I can place the second order structure function from the fundamental turbulence theory. So, I have put it here. So, you can see that it becomes rho times. So you can see that it becomes rho times C2 epsilon D to the power of two-thirds multiplied by the diameter of D divided by sigma. One thing you notice is that for the web number used here, there's only one length scale, and that length scale is the bubble diameter. Okay, and that is consistent with the common web-Hintz assumption. That is, the bubble is being driven by flow at its own length scale, which is the diameter of the bubble. Okay, so this is a very interesting problem. So, this is a very interesting problem. And one thing to notice is this hypothesis since 1955 has not been validated. And this hint theory for fragmentation is basically the most classical framework used by chemical engineering for describing the fragmentation process. So, we want to really test it. Okay, this is a simple question. Is this true that the deformation and fragmentation of bubbles or drops are driven by only one length scale? Only one land scale. Is it possible that other land scales also participate in the process? And if so, what kind of role are they playing? All right, in order to do this experiment, it turns out it's actually not that easy. And the reason it's not that easy is because if we put bubbles in turbulence, all right, it will be deformed, but not just by turbulence, but also by buoyancy. So here I'm going to show you the same thing as I mentioned to you before. This is a web number, just talk about the bubble being deformed by the turbulent stress. Turbulent stress. And if you also think about the bubbles, because of the buoyancy, it will rise up because of rising motion, it will also deform the bubble. So you have a different dimensionless number here, which is Aventos number. And this number is basically defined the ratio between the pressure due to the rising motion divided by the surface tension. So you can see that for Webb number and Vitosh number, they have the same denominator, but they don't have the same numerator simply because it's a different way. Numerator simply because it's a different way to drive the deformation. All right, so if you build experiments, the key to keep in mind is that if we want to study turbulence-induced deformation, we have to make sure the turbulence stresses is much more important than the buoyancy. Otherwise, you basically study buoyancy-induced deformation. So, in order to do that, obviously, we had to say, Oh, okay, the web number has to be larger than Aventos number, and Aventos number could be either larger than one or close to one. That's fine. So, I have a, if I rearrange. So, I have a. If I rearrange this equation, this dimensionless equation, I get this dimensional equation, which is the pressure induced by turbulence has to be larger than the pressure difference induced by buoyancy, and that has to be close or larger than the surface tension restoring stress. So for the bubbles to be deformed by turbulence, I hope that's clear. And what's nice about this equation here is you have only two unknowns because for bubbles in water, we know the density of water, we know the gravitational constant. Water, we know the gravitational constant. We're on Earth, we know the surface tension. And C2 is a common graph constant, that's also a known quantity. Only two unknowns is epsilon and d. And we have two unknowns and we have two equations. So we can actually solve it. So eventually you can solve this and you get the roughly the good regime to study this problem. And you need to have a bubbles roughly in the order of millimeter. And you need to have energy dissipation rate larger than this number, order of this number here, in order to see the bubbles being deformed by turbulence. The bubbles being deformed by turbulence instead of by buoyancy. This is a very strong criterion that basically based on this argument that we just have to satisfy this in the experimental setup. So if you follow this, you can see that the ypsino is actually one very important parameter you need to control from a turbulence perspective. And this is typically not always the focus for turbulence community, single-phase turbulence community, because for single-phase turbulence, they don't care about the dimensional quantity, they only care about the dimensionless quantity, for example. Care about the dimensionless quantity, for example, Reynolds number. But for multi-phase flow, you realize that in order for this one to work, you need to control the epsilon energy dissipation rate. And I just want to mention that the epsilon larger than 0.5 meters squared per cubic second is actually a number that you can actually see in nature and also in industrial applications. For example, in breaking waves, the energy dissipation rate is 12 meters square per cubic second, which is much larger than this criterion, which means a lot of the bubbles. Criterion, which means a lot of the bubbles, minimum-sized bubbles in a genetic environment is really deformable and you can be fragmented. Of course, that makes sense because they had to be fragmented multiple times in order to reach the final sort of a size. All right. So that's great. We have this kind of a new design criteria. Now we have to design the system in order to meet the requirement. So we survey a lot of existing turbulence facilities with a relatively small mean flow. And so this is a lot. And so this is a lot of the facility we covered before. I just want to emphasize on this second column here, which is the energy dissipation rate. You can see that energy dissipation rate are ranging from 10 to minus 5 to 10 to the minus 2, and which is still smaller than the requirement we put forward. Which means a lot of this existing facility are not suitable for studying bubbles being deformed and fragmented. One clarification I want to mention is that it's not really a fair. Is that it's not really a fair table to all these existing facilities because they were designed for single-phase turbulence, they were not designed for bubbles and droplets fragmentation. So, naturally, their energy dissipation is not high enough. But that basically gave us the motivation to build a new facility that really tried to targeting high-intensity rooms. All right. So, this is basically the facility we built. This is called Veyon Set. And this is kind of a silly acronym I put together a long time ago. Put together a long time ago just to my students, sort of stopped using that a while back. Anyway, so this is a sort of my personal obsession with the I have to give a name for a facility, for example. So this is a vertical setup and has an octagonal cross-section. And the reason we want to have octagonal cross-section is because we want to have three-dimensional visualization. And it's made of non-corrosive materials, so we can deal with even marine. We can deal with an even marine environment and have a third system. I will talk about that later. Okay, so a couple of the interesting features about this facility. We have a mean flow that coming from top to bottom. And the reason we have a mean flow coming in the vertical direction downward is because we want to counter the rising motion of bubbles. And then we can keep the bubble in the test section for extended period of time so we can study their interaction with turbines. Okay, that's really the motivation here. Motivation here. So you can see that this is a mink flow, and the bubble is actually rising from the Capricorn island into the section that we have a lot of cameras. So we can study their deformation and fragmentation. This is the case when we play, we only turn on the Mink flow. You can see that the bubbles try to rise up, but they sort of get frozen in the test section for a long period of time. They just jiggle around. This is because Mink flow is set to balance their rising motion, so they can actually stay in the test section almost forever. There's a problem here. There's a problem here is typically millimeter bubble millimeter size bubble rise about 10 to 20 centimeters per second. And if you set your mean flow around 10 to 20 centimeters per second, it's not fast enough to generate intense turbulence. Okay, so turbulence has to be generated in a decidedly different way. The way we did that is we added a jittery on the top of the test section. And this jittery has a fairly unique design using a 3D printer. And this is a printed. And this is printed using the nylon powder and sintered together. You can see that there are two different channels here. One is this kind of square channel. The square channel is a screw hose, basically, and then allow the mean flow to pass through the jet array without a problem. On top of the square hose, we have this lot of circular nozzles here. And the circular nozzles are actually going through the 3D printed jittery and connected to those kind of side channels. So basically, we can have flow. We can have flow so the um the mean flow passes through the square holes, and the jets is actually going through the side channels and the uh and fire coaxially with the mean flow into the test section. And the jet can be as fast as five to 15 meters per second, so they can actually much, much faster than the mean flow allows us to generate very intense turbulence. Okay, so then you have the bubbles rising into the area where you have a sufficient amount of turbulence. Sufficient amount of turbulence intensity, and the bubble can be deformed and broken. And on top of that, I have high-speed cameras all around this test section. As I mentioned to you before, we have the octagonal test section, which has a lot of flat surfaces for the high-speed camera to see through. And eventually, each camera is equipped with a high-power LED system, so you can actually really have a three-dimensional view about what's happening inside the test section. Okay. Okay. So far, I introduced the experimental setup. I want to go back to the simple problem. This is a picture I mentioned to you before, right? So for most of the studies we have seen so far about the bubble deformation and fragmentation is typically related to this picture of bubble being stretched and deformed and fragmented in a linear or a simple straining flow. So this is our picture. And now I want to show you. And now, I want to show you a video, the raw video taken from our system. And I want to show you how different a bubble actually behaves in a fully developed homogeneous tropical turbulent environment. So you can see this guy here, where so this guy here, one thing you do realize that it does not look like ellipsoidal shape, okay? It's not being deformed persistently along one direction. It's being deformed slightly in one direction. It's being deformed slightly in one direction, then tumble, and then started to be deforming a different direction. And you see that one thing you notice that is this bubbles has very, very complicated interaction with the surrounding turbulence. And that's because one thing, because the surrounding flow is not persistent, it has its own time scale. Okay, so this is going back to the workshops topic. We are talking about multi-scale. So the bubbles has to actually interact with eddies with different time scales. Eddies with different time scales. And when we talk about time scales for eddies, there also has an associated land scale, which means bubbles interacting with flows with all kinds of different land scale and time scales. It's very different from the bubble being deformed in a simple straining flow. Another thing I want to mention here is the bubble size here, you're saying is order of two millimeter. And the chromograph scale we have is about order of 50 micrometer. So this is not the sub-chromograph bubbles or drops that Charles mentioned this morning. This is really the finite. Mentioned this morning, this is really the finite size big bubbles, okay? Relatively speaking, all right. So, this is basically the problem we want to study. Of course, you can see that this is complicated. How do we even approach the problem? Well, naively, as an experimentalist, the first job thing I have to do is quantify this process. In order to quantify this process, I need to determine two things. First of all, I need to determine the deformed shape, right? Because a bubble has a complicated shape. It's not ellipsoid, which means we have to identify. So it, which means we have to identify its shape. The full three-dimensional shape is important. Second, I need to determine the background flow because I need to really understand the flow from the surrounding turbulence. In order to do that, I need to segment the images here. So this part is basically the bubble image on one camera. And then on top of that, we have this image actually for surrounding tracer particle. I forgot to mention that in addition to bubbles, we put tons of tracer particles just to see the surrounding flows. This is not very easy to see. I'm going to zoom in to this area here and then sort of increase the contrast a little bit. So you can see that this is basically the bubbles. You can see a lot of the shiny dots around the bubbles that represent the tracer particles. Okay. So now what? So we have to do quantitative quantification here. So they have six cameras of those images. Now we can start to put the three-dimensional reconstruction together. The first reconstruction we did is actually. The first reconstruction we did is actually for tracer particles. We have to spend a lot of time to develop this, our own sort of shake-the-box code. And this is really the code that we developed to increase the concentration of particles we can track in three-dimensional. Okay, so this is basically the tracking of the tracer particle without the bubbles. So all the arrows you're seeing is basically the velocity of the tracer intervals. And from this tracer. And from this tracer information, we can at least quantify the turbulence environment, the bubble experience. So, the turbulence environment, as I mentioned to you before, this is a second-order structure function. This is something well known for turbulence. And with the data set we have, we can easily quantify or measure the second-order structure function here. So, if you plot the second-order structure function as a function of the R, R being the separation between a pair of particles, and then you can see there's a scaling law, which is a close. Can see there's a scaling law, which is close to the r to the power of a two-third that's consistent with the common graph theory. This is really tells you as we can measure the turbulence in this very intense environment. And another thing here to keep in mind is we can actually use the second-order structure function to determine energy dissipation rate. As I mentioned to you before, we know the second-order structure function. Then the C2 is a common graph constant, which is also known from literature. So we can use that to determine the energy dissipation rate. All right. Dissipation rate. All right, come back to this table. This is a table I mentioned about the survey across different facilities. And we have energy dissipation rate for different facilities before. And now I'm just adding our facility. You can see that our facility reached a level that is higher than most of the previous facilities and also consistent with the criteria we put forward because we need energy dissipation in order for 0.1 in order for bubbles to be deformed just by turbines or mostly by turbines. Turbo or mostly by turbines. Okay, so this is one thing we satisfy. And the second thing we have to do is the deformation of bubbles, right? As I mentioned to you before, we only reconstruct a three-dimensional complicated shape. And it was not an easy task, but the good thing is that we have developed actually Ashik, Masouk actually developed this algorithm to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry. So we have six cameras, right? So those are actually. Have a six cameras, right? So, those are actually synthetic images we did, we made out of the simulation data set from our colleague Krato Trick Wasson here. And then on the right here, I'm showing you the reconstructed results. The blue one is actually the DNS data set, and the grayish colors, which is slightly larger than the blue color, is actually the reconstructed results. So, with even six cameras, you can actually get a pretty decent reconstruction of the three-dimensional shape. So, that's actually give us the So that's actually give us the information about the geometry. So finally, I want to summarize what I have talked so far. So first of all, the hypothesis, really one of the challenges, really related to if there's only one length scale that matters for bubble deformation in turbulence. In order to test that, we need to have a criterion for energy dissipation rate exceeding 0.1 meters squared per cubic second. We constructed a severe onset facility that reached. The severe onset facility that reached this energy dissipation rate. We also had the experimental technique to quantify the carrier phase, which is a basic high concentration of tracers. We also can reconstruct the dispersed phase, which is a complicated deformation of bubbles. So we basically had this nice framework, experimental framework to satisfy all the conditions we put forward. And now it's time to test the hypothesis. So just want to make sure I can convince you guys we have the I can convince you guys we have the full data set. I want to show you this case, which is actually a deformed bubble, which is this blob here. It's in a turbulent environment, and the turbulence is basically denoted by all this kind of color lines. The color line is basically the trajectories of the tracers. The color actually represents the velocity. The color bar is not shown here. It doesn't really matter because this is only one case. You can see that we can track the bubbles from almost spherical shape to the moment of breakup and also the surrounding flow. So we can use that to. Also, the surrounding flow, so we can use that to understand the fragmentation process. All right, I'm going to try to speed up a little bit. So, going back to the Columbian Graph Hines framework, this is the framework we want to test. The basic assumption is that bubbles or droplets are broken by eddies of similar sizes. Right now, I'm using this the blob here to represent the bubbles. And this circle, the arrow here is basically representing eddies. I'm showing them with the same size. That's basically the common weapons. Size that's basically the common weapons assumption. The underlying assumption for this hypothesis really is saying that if you have eddies with a land scale much larger than the bubbles, okay, and that eddies is denoted by this blue arrow here. You can see that it comes from eddies much larger than the bubbles. And the assumption for this Commgraph Hints framework is really saying that the super bubble scale, okay, I'm called this large eddies, super bubble scale eddies, only a vector bubble. Only a vector bubble without deforming it. So, this is basically the one side of the assumption. The other side of the assumption, which is that the sub-bubble scale eddies effect can be filtered by the bubble, which means eddies that's much smaller than the bubble size is actually being filtered by the bubble itself. It's really not affecting the bubble dynamics or deformation. Is that right? So, can we really ignore the super bubble scale eddies and sub-bubble scale eddies for deformation and fragmentation problem? Okay, so that's basically what we want to do. Okay, so that's basically what we want to tackle. Let's start with the deformation mechanisms. For this particular case, you have a bubble being deformed in a straining flow. This is sort of a turbulent, but locally, it's still some kind of a straining flow. If I simplify the problem, this bubble is basically deformed along the direction. If you think about this is actually locally, if you do the coarse graining of the flow at a bubble scale, you end up with this type of straining flow. And the flow basically is compressing the bubble. And the flow basically is compressing the bubble along the vertical direction, stretching it along the horizontal direction here. And this makes sense. This is consistent actually with the Common Graph Hines framework because this velocity gradient tensor is actually close to the bubble scale. Okay. But there's another situation that is also relevant to the bubble deformation. And this is a particular case that we're interested in. So you can see the bubble is actually not really being deformed by straining flow, but almost like it's being slacked. Straining flow, but almost like being slapped by a flow, and the slab is coming from the horizontal direction, and the bubbles were being pancaked and eventually be fragmented. Okay, so in this case, if you still do the sort of a cost average, a cost graining of surrounding flow, instead of having a flow that is at a bubble scale, you have a flow that is almost uniform along this direction. And this is basically the velocity of the surrounding flow, and this is the bubble velocity. If you take the difference, you have a slid velocity, you can see that the bubble. You can see that the bubble minor axis is roughly aligned with the slip velocity direction. And that's what's driving the deformation. So this is actually the flow is actually not coming from an eddy of the bubble size because it's almost a constant direction magnitude along the bubble scale, which means it really comes from eddies that are much larger than the bubble scale, which means the bubble can be deformed by super bubble scale eddies. Okay. And so I'm denoting here: this is a basic bubble deformed by similar size. A basic Ibubo deformed by similar size IDs. This is deformed by a much larger size IDs. All right. So, in order to understand this, the simplest way to think about this is actually do a Taylor expansion. And what I mean by Taylor expansion is that if you imagine the bubble's center of mass is located at X naught, okay, and I can find a tracer particle around this bubbles and their velocity is UIP here, I can do a tail expansion of the velocity about this center location x naught here. This center location x down here. And what I get at leading orders is I get this kind of uniform flow direction, which I'm assuming this is a coming, this is basically coming from a flow much larger than the bubbles. And I have a flow that is giving me very similar to the velocity gradient tensor multiplied by this X being the separation distance from the center. And this is basically the component very similar to the Kombuff-Hinzer hypothesis. And this is basically eddies of the bubble size. And finally, you have this higher. size. And finally, you have this high-order components. This is really the small-scale eddies that has been ignored in the common graph HINS framework. So I just want to add in some cartoon picture to make the physical picture a little bit clearer. So this is part I emphasized before. This is a bubble interacting with eddies of the same size. And the first term is actually a bubble interacting with some kind of uniform flow. That means it's really coming from eddies much larger than the bubble size. And finally, Than the bubble size. And finally, I have the small scale. But for now, I'm going to skip the small scale, just focusing on the first two components. So the first component, really the bubble moving in a large scale flow, this is basically due to the density mismatch. And when you have a density mismatch on also the finite size, the bubble actually may have a different velocity compared with the surrounding large-scale flow. And when that happens, you have a slip velocity, which is determined by Determined by the velocity difference between the bubble velocity and the UI bar is basically this kind of average velocity around the bubble. Okay. And this really represents large-scale flow. And here, DE represents eddy size. I'm using subsquared E to represent eddies. And now I'm introducing this new length scale, which is represent the flow length scale. And you can see here for the flow length scale larger than the bubble size, the flow velocity can actually count. The fluid velocity can actually contribute significantly to the deformation. So, in this case, we have to define different web numbers because, as I mentioned to you before, in a web number, we have this typical velocity scale, and the velocity scale has to be chosen based on different physics. If we only focus on the eddies of the bubble size, we can have the velocity gradient tensor cos win at the bubble size. We can have the eigenvectors E1 and E3, and one being the largest. and one being the largest stretching direction, the other one being the largest compression direction, and their eigenvalues being lambda one and lambda three. And in this particular case, I can define a web number, and this web number here is using the lambda three as most compressive direct eigenvalue multiplied by the diameter of d and multiplied by the d. So this is really indicating that this is a web number based on the bubble diameter. And you can see here, I can measure the web number. This is actually one thing. Web number. This is actually one thing I want to mention. This is an instantaneous web number. This is only made possible through our simultaneous measurements around individual bubbles. And this is actually very close to the log normal distribution I will show you later. Another, this is basically the bubble deformed by eddies of the same size. Another case, another sort of things I want to mention here is a bubble is deformed by the slip velocity here. And the bubble slip deformed by the slip velocity is related to the bubble. Velocities related to the bubble interacting with eddies much larger than its own sizes. So, this is one thing that has been ignored in the common graph-Hings framework, but we added back in because of the density mismatch between the bubbles and surrounding flow. And here you can see that the web slip velocity is actually instead of using the quantity that related to the bubble size, we directly use a slip velocity, which doesn't have a bubble diameter in there. So, once you edit that into here, you have a different web number, and we can also plot the web number. Number and we can also plot the web number PDF, and those because of the slip velocity could have different directions. We decompose that into the X being the horizontal direction, Z being the vertical direction. They're slightly different because, in addition to turbines, we have a buoyancy. So that's why the Z direction has a bit of a higher web number due to the buoyancy. But they overlap with the horizontal direction pretty well for the high web number regime, which really means that the turbulence is the main mechanism driving the deformation of the bubbles. Mechanism driving the deformation of the bubbles in our facility. Okay, so you can clearly see that there are a very different PDF here. So the bubble, the web number based on the velocity grading at a bubble size following this log normal distribution, this is a very well understood based on the fundamental turbulence theory of the energy dissipation rate distribution. And for the slip velocity, it has a very different sort of dependencies because the slip velocity related to the velocity. The fluid velocity related to the velocity difference that's not really connected back to the velocity gradient intensor at a bubble scale, but comes from something much, much larger scale. So that's why it's actually showing the stretch exponential distribution that is different from the small scale turbulence. One thing you can, we feel a little bit down when I saw this problem in the very beginning is you realize that the peak here is web number equals to one. Okay, and deformation really driven by this branch, the web number larger than one. The web number larger than one. And one thing you realize is that for our experiments, they have a similar probability in terms of using whichever the web number you define. Either it's a velocity gradient tensor-based web number or slow velocity web number, they have similar magnitude. So it's very hard to say which one really drives the bubble deformation. So when the magnitude failed to tell you exactly which mechanism dominates, we went through a process trying to understand the orientation. The idea here is. The idea here is both mechanisms have certain orientation. For example, if I use lambda 3, I'm implying that the bubble is being compressed along the E3 direction. If I'm using slit velocity, I'm implying that the bubble is being compressed by the slit velocity direction. When they have a similar magnitude, I can check which direction the minor axis of the bubble aligns better with. Use that to determine which mechanism is actually driving the deformation. So that's what we did. So that's what we did. We identified the bubble minor axis from the reconstruction results. We can retell the R3 direction, and we can also tell the major axis R1 direction here. And then we can check the cosine or the dot product between the unit vector along the R3 to either E1 or E3 direction. You can clearly see that there is a, so W here is a dot product between the two unit vectors that represent the cosine of the angle in between. And when this angle is close to one, And when this angle is close to one, that means the two aligns. Zero means two perpendicular to each other. And here the PDF is really peaked around one for R3.e3. That really indicates that the bubble minor axis actually aligns better with the compression direction velocity gradient tensor cost grain at a bubble scale. So this is a consistent with what we expected from the Common Graph Hinge theory. And for the slim velocity here, you can see that clearly that the bubble minus. Clearly, that the bubble minor axis R3, you know, the blue line actually peaked around one. That means the R3 actually aligns with the use of slip velocity. So this is another thing also consistent with our expectation because whenever you have slip velocity, they tend to pancake the bubble along that direction. But if you compare between the two plots, you realize one thing is this really aligns better with the slip velocity compared with the velocity gradient tensor, because this heat value here is about. Uh, value here is about four, but here the value here is only about 1.6 something, which means this is a much stronger alignment compared with this one. That indicates that the bubble in turbulence is deformed more by slip velocity. I want to mention that slip velocity is different with the buoyancy direction. This is really just the random motion of the flow and also the mismatch between the two phases that are causing this kind of a slip velocity. So, this is actually a dominant mechanism for deformation. Mechanism for deformation. All right. There is a conception or this understanding in the community that the deformation, large deformation essentially means breakup. If you stretch a bubble to the extreme limit, the bubble will break up. So large deformation means a breakup. Is that true, though? So here we come back to this phenomenological model here by the common graph-Hinz framework. And then I'm going to emphasize on this part. Going to emphasize on this part. I already talked about the super bubble scale eddies and the effect of this to the bubble deformation. Now I'm going to focus on the sub-bubble scale eddies and its effect on the fragmentation and really challenge this assumption to see if this effect can be ignored. So this is actually not a very easy problem. The reason for that is because in the first four years, when I try to study this problem, I have these issues. When I asked my This issues when I ask my student to say, Hey, I have this velocity field, I have this bubble. Okay, how do you get the small-scale eddies? My naive thinking of that is basically do filtering. Okay, I filter it once, I get rid of the mean flow, then I do it again, get rid of the velocity gradient tensor. Whatever is left in the velocity field must come from the small scale eddies. But the problem here is when you filter out the leading terms, you filter out the first order term and second order term. Sorry, this is. Second order term. Sorry, this is really a zeros-order term and first-order term. You're left with the second-order term. But the second-order term is as strong as your noise of the merriments because you already get rid of the leading orders. What you're left with is very poor in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. So it was very difficult to do in our fully developed turbulence facility. So there are only two ways you can study a problem. You either control the inputs or you measure, you inputs or you measure you you control the you either control the inputs or you measure the outputs for our system we're trying to use the fancy diagnostic system to measure the outputs and get rid of the leading term only leave with the small scale terms but that doesn't work out because of signal to noise ratio so velocity is too difficult to measure so the signal noise ratio is too bad so the only thing we're left with is control the inputs what do i mean by control the inputs control inputs meaning Control input: Meaning, I need to design a system that naturally damps the first two orders that leaves with only the second order term. And that's basically the motivation for the new experimental facility. So, in the new experimental facility, we have to have a magic knife to cleanly separate the land scales of the turbulent eddies. How do we do that? It cannot be done in the fluid developed turbulence because the fluid developed turbulence, you have all land scales present all times. You cannot separate them cleanly. You cannot separate them cleanly. The only way we thought about this is when I attended a DFD meeting, I heard this talk by McKeon from Harvard University at that time. They were studying this problem to understand the turbulence cascade. The idea of the setup is you have the two piston and they fire a vortex ring against each other. And when you fire two vortex ring against each other, they actually undergo a The actually undergoing a series of elliptical and core instability, eventually you have large eddies basically containers in vortex ring and then cascading into a cloud of small eddies. And I got the simulation data set from Rodolfo from University of Houston. He actually moved back to Spain recently. So in his simulation results, you can clearly see that this is only half of the simulation results, only one vortex wing. Results only one vortex ring, not two. So, this is one vortex ring here. So, this is early stage. At a later time after the collision, you can see that I have the fragment into this cloud of small eddies. You can clearly see the scale separation between the early stage and late stage. My naive way of thinking about this, this is actually my metric knife because in the very beginning, I only have large scale at ease. At later stage, I only have small scales. I do not have a mix of both. A mix of both. If I put bubbles in two different stages, I study their fragmentation. I have a clear way to understand how small eddies contribute to the fragmentation. If I choose a bubble to have the same length scale with this original size of the eddies, at a later stage, because of the eddies are much smaller than the original size, that means the bubbles only encounter eddies much, much smaller than its own size. So that's the logic. I hope that's clear to everybody. The way to do Everybody. The way to do that is to actually put this in a tank. We have two pistons similar to the work done by McKeon et al. And this is actually done by two very talented undergrad students. Actually, the first year when I joined Hopkins, I had their help, which is really, really useful because they actually put together the entire facility, calibrated everything, did amazing work to start this entire work. So here I have the two pistons firing against each other, and then in the very beginning, they have one vortex. And then in the very beginning, they have one vortex ring, and later on, I'm sorry, in the very beginning, they have one size of eddies, and later on, they fragment into a cloud of small eddies. And here, I want to show you this dashed line box here. This is really the view volume focused by a number of cameras. And there's a needle at the bottom of the tank. And this needle will inject a bubble. And the bubble will rise up as the vortex ring collided. And then it will be timed so that the bubbles were interacting with the eddies at the different locations. Different locations. So everything has to be synchronized, including the linear actuator for the piston and also the syringe pump, and also the camera. So it was not actually an easy experiment. Eventually, you want to have something like this. In the very beginning, bubble is interacting with large eddies and being fragmented, and later on interacting with a cloud of smaller eddies. And we want to see their differences. Okay, we use the same experimental technique, including the shake box for particles. Including the shake box for particles and also the visual hall we mentioned for reconstructing bubble geometry. One thing I want to mention is the turbulence cascade process in this kind of small setup. So you can see it's the same second order structure function. I'm showing you this second order structure function for the initial like large eddies. You can see that most of the energy is actually close to this length scale. This is basically a large eddy we have. And later on, within fragmenting into, oh, by the way, On with the fragment into. Oh, by the way, I just want to mention that the color is a matching color here from now. So, red really means the early stage or initial stage, and the blue means late stage. And we get into the late stage, you can see that we start to have this two-third power load, meaning the flow started to become like a turbulent, and we have this kind of inertial range. And energy actually at the larger eddies are being damped significantly. So, we have a very strong small-scale eddies. We can also study the vorticity evolution. Study the vorticity evolution in this problem because, in the very beginning, the vorticity is primarily, especially for this ring here, is primarily along one direction. So, if you take that vorticity along the z direction divided by the total vorticity, you get close to one if it's only one direction. But at a later stage, because it becomes more isotropic, you're getting close to the different number. And the different number is basically, if it's a fully isotropic, is close to one over a square root of three. So you can create a A square root of three. So you can clearly see that the flows developed from sort of a one direction and close to become a sort of a fully isotropic turbulence. All right. Another thing I want to emphasize is the bubble web number here. One thing, if you still remember in the very beginning, large web number typically means large deformation, large fragmentation. So one thing you can realize that if I define a web number, it doesn't really matter if I use a strain rate or use a what. matter if I use the strain rate or use a vorticity, the magander lines always have a higher web number compared with the blue line. I hope that's clear. And the maganda line here really represents the web number for the bubble encounter in early stage by the single size eddy. It makes sense because in the very beginning, Eddie contains a lot of energy. It has not been dissipated yet. So that's why web number is definitely higher. At later stage, because of the energy has been dissipated a little bit, so the web number is actually lower. Bit so the web number is actually lower. If you just based on web number, this is again, this is still based on the common wolf-hinks hypothesis because you can see that the d the diameter of the bubble is still used in this web number definition. If you just use that classical framework, you can tell that the bubble will have a high, more violent, faster breakup in the very beginning. At later stage, when they encounter small eddies, web number drops significantly, and then the deformation should be weaker. The deformation should be weaker and the fragmentation should be slower. Let's see if that's the case. I'm going to play a video at the same time. So the left side is actually the video for this bubble encountered large 80s and this is actually a bubble encountered a group of small 80s. I want to mention that the bubble here is actually smaller size, which make this egg even harder to break compared with the early stage. I'm going to play at the exact same time and you can see which one is faster. Which one is a faster and a more violent? Oh, he actually didn't play at the same time. Let me try it again. Okay. You can see that this one already finished. And this is why this one is still going. Okay. Just as a reminder, this one actually has a higher web number. Okay. Based on our classical framework, this one should break faster and more violent. But in reality, actually, winning. Reality, actually, when this one even has a smaller web number because of small eddies, actually breaks up in a much more violent and faster way. Okay, so this is really a distinction between the classical framework and what we observe here. In order to explain this and really trying to revise the model, classical model, the key here is the land scale. As I mentioned to you before, the classical framework really hypothesized there's only one land scale, the bubble land scale. Only one length scale, the bubble length scale, the bubble diameter. So, which means bubbles only interacting with eddies of its same size. But in reality, if you imagine this is a bubble, deformed bubble, it's a spherical equivalent diameter, the capital D here, encounter an eddy of a different diameter. They'll call this D D E. And in the new model, we have to assume that they're different. And then we have to put forward some kind of a criterion for breakup. So, first of all, So, first of all, in order for the bubble to break, the eddy has to have a sufficient amount of energy or stress in order to break the bubble. So, this is the first criterion. We really say rho times u e squared. The u e is basically eddy velocity, has to be larger than a sigma divided by dE. And this is basically the surface tension of the local curvature. The second criterion, which was not realized before, is this time. If you remember that, in the very This time, if you remember that in the very beginning, I showed you guys this video, the bubble is being deformed crazily, and I mentioned that the time scale really matters here. So, the time scale, which is interaction time using the bubble diameter divided by its velocity, has to be smaller than the relaxation time, meaning if you don't break the bubble fast enough, the bubble will relax back to sphere. Okay, so if you put this two criterion together, you have this kind of a figure. So, the first local stress curve is basically this blue line. Stress curve is basically this blue line. In order for bubble to be broken by eddies, the eddy velocity UE here has to be above this blue line. For the second criteria, this is a red line. And in order to satisfy this, the velocity of the eddy has to be above the red line. If you make the intersecting between, you have these two areas set apart by these two lines. One is a breakup region, which is of eddy velocity larger than the minimum of eddy velocity. The other one is below. The other one is below where you have no breakups. And essentially, mathematically, you can write in this way based on using this two criteria and this picture here. Okay. And then we know that the eddy velocity distribution in the homogeneous tribal turbines based on common graph 1962, you can easily write down this kind of log normal distribution. And actually, some of this derivations are thanks to Charles' help. And the probability of finding Eddie's velocity. Of finding eddy's velocity at a specific eddy size dE is following this formulation here. And this formulation actually relies on the eddy energy dissipation rate of distribution here. And we can use the equation and substitute into the second equation to get the eddy velocity distribution. And then once we have the eddy velocity distribution, we can use the criteria from the previous slide to determine the fragmentation probability. The fragmentation probability of one bubble size D, contributed by the eddy size DE here. So the different colors actually represent a different bubble size from 2 millimeter to 5 millimeter. And the horizontal axis here shows the eddy size divided by the bubble size. If we use the common graph-Hings framework, which assumes that the bubbles only be broken by eddies of the same size, this curve should be a data function at one, meaning d. At one, meaning DE should be the same as D. But in reality, you can see that it peaks around a small number smaller than one that really indicates that the highest probability of the fragmentation is brought by eddies slightly smaller than the bubble size, instead of exactly the same as bubble size. So this is only a talk about the collision of one bubble with one single eddy. We can also consider the collision frequency because smaller eddies actually tend to be more frequent. You had to consider that. Frequent, you had to consider that number density is a little bit higher. So, when you add that into the consideration here, multiply by the collision frequency by eddies of different sizes, you have a slightly different curve, but the peak is still at this value here, and this value is determined by the intercept between the two criteria we mentioned before. This figure really emphasizes that the sub-bubble scale eddies are more important for bubble fragmentation, and we can move on to the experimental validation. Move on to the experimental validation. In order to validate this revised model, we have to quantify something called bubble breakup frequency or the time scale between the two fragmentation events. So here is a T C here to talk about the two breakup events and the time interval in between. And this is basically we got from the vortex ring collision experiments. We have a range of diameter from 2 to 3.5. Two to you know 3.5 millimeter. It's not a huge range. We have this kind of a we repeat the experiments many many times in order to get this curve. And then we can use a model prediction. By the way, there's no fitting parameter for this model. We got this curve without any only thing we use is basically average energy dissipation rate of the system, which we measure by using the particle tracking method. So they actually agree pretty well, but we're not very happy with the range of parameter we got from a wall-text ring collision. So we actually Tetrain collision. So, we actually see another experiment conducted by Vojaska back in 2018, and this is their experiments. Their experiments also use the jets to fragment the bubbles, and then they can increase energy detection rate over a wide range simply because they don't really care about whether the flow is perfectly homogeneous or isotropic. They can actually have a bubble very close to the jet, so the bubble sometimes could be fragmented by the jet directly. But they managed to get the breakout frequency as a range. Breakout frequency as a range of function of the energy dissipation rate over quite a wide range and with different kinds of bubble sizes. I want to mention, I want to put a curve of common graph King's theory. So if I assume the breakout frequency is related to the inverse of the eddy turnover time using common graph theory, I can get this dashed line here. Okay, actually, this is a breakout frequency many people used in the fragmentation community. When people try to calculate bubble. Try to calculate bubble fragmentation, they use this kind of dependence. Once you realize that is it shows a much, much gradual change as a function of energy dissipation rate compared with what the experimental data suggested. So we can actually use the model for a wide range of energy dissipation rate. We did the model for the point two, which is actually our energy dissipation rate. The arrow here shows you where that landed on this figure. We can also change the energy dissipation rate. Also, change the energy dissipation rate for a slightly higher energy dissipation rate. And we can actually do this over many, many different energy dissipation rate to determine the fragmentation probability. And then we can calculate the breakout frequency using the revised model. And this is basically the model prediction. We did the model prediction for 2, 3, 4 millimeter, which is basically cover the experimental range of the bubble sizes. And we eventually find a pretty good agreement between the experiments and the revised model. The revised model. And the model actually did it pretty successfully in terms of capturing the trend. But also, I want to mention that this is not really a power law scaling here. You can clearly see there's some kind of slope change because this curve here is not very trivial. So this is pretty complicated because it contains both the frequency, number density of the bubbles, eddies, and also the breakout frequency dependence. Okay, this is a all right. I'm gonna go to the summary slide. The key of my talk is asking this particular question or really validate this key hypothesis in the classical Komagua-Hinz framework. The answer to this question here is the assumption that only one land scale, bubble, or drop size, matters is incorrect. The eddy size is actually also very important. Deady size is actually also very important. In turbulence, one needs more than just a web number to describe fragmentation. You need a time scale ratio because what matters here is you not only need to have a sufficient amount of energy or stress, you also need to have to break the bubble in a short amount of time. Finally, I want to comment on this idea that in the community, typically we assume that large web number means large deformation, large deformation means fragmentation. But in reality, But in reality, I think they're not really that closely connected. So, the web number here does define the deformation. So, for a larger web number, you will have a large deformation. That's correct. But large deformation doesn't always result in the fragmentation. Actually, the fragmentation can sometimes be short-circuited or accelerated by smaller eddies. So, really, the important thing here is that web number tells you how likely the bubble will be deformed. Likely the bubble will be deformed, but the fragmentation you have to consider a small-scale contribution. With that, I want to thank everybody for your attention. Questions from the Zoom, from the audience, yeah. Thanks, Ray. Thanks, Ray. Real interesting. The first part where you showed this kind of deformation due to the relative velocity, due to the sort of squeezing based on relative velocity. I guess it's still, in the case that you have, it's still just dependent on the dissipation because of the fact that stronger turbulence, you'll have bigger relative velocities. But I'm wondering, are there experiments or type of particles you can try this? Experiments or type of particles, you can try this out, or drops or something where you can change the inertia effects so that you can change something else to show whether that's going to be dominant or not compared to the straining. Yeah, that's a good point. I think the, of course, the first thing comes to mind is, you know, change the density, trying to make it closer to the surrounding flow. But the mismatch of the velocity contributes. The mismatch of the velocity contributes not only by the density difference, but also by the finite length scale. Because when you have finite length scale, you average over the local velocity field. So there's a essentially what I'm trying to say is if you increase the density, for example, using oil droplets, and you could try, you would reduce that inertia effect a little bit, but there's a limit because eventually the financier effect will kick in and they won't be able to do that any further. That any further. Another thing here: the reason we didn't really do oil droplets in the very beginning is because when you add oil droplets, you introduce density ratio and viscosity ratio. And web number is not only dimensionless number that matters anymore. And that creates tons of other interesting problems that worth studying. But it's just to me, it wasn't a very simple system anymore. A really nice talk. Just another way of looking at it. Are you measuring anything about these variation in the curvature of these bubbles by themselves? Like when you're talking about during deformation, before fragmentation, you should expect a lot of variation in their local curvature. Is there a geometric way of doing these things when you? Geometric way of doing these things when you are not able to measure, let's say, the background. You've probably figured it out how to create this background small-scale Addis. Is there a more geometric way of interpreting the curvature of the droplets and then trying to talk about fragmentation? The question related to the local curvature, we definitely attempted that. So there's a current project we're working on is trying to use a reconstructed geometry. Trying to use a reconstructive geometry, and then you sort of put a lot of points on the surface and try to track those surface points and see their evolution, and use that to determine the local deformation velocity. It's quite interesting way of thinking about it because you're absolutely right. Because a lot of things we did so far, including using minor and major axis, still limited to relatively large-scale sort of deformation. And the local deformation. Deformation and the local deformation is very important. The problem for that is that when you have very strong local curvature, it could be induced by very strong velocity in the nearby fluid, or it could be induced by the bubble is relaxing by itself. There's a capurial wave, for example, moving by that area. So it's quite complicated. So local curvature is difficult to quantify exactly and also difficult to interpret once we have. And also difficult to interpret once we have the results. I remain hopeful to see if there's something that can tell us, because one thing you probably see that in our model, we assume some kind of local surface tension as a sort of a first dimensionless number here. And that's definitely something we can evaluate to see if what kind of length scale we are actually the bubble is being deformed by. So that's actually something we're working on. Thank you. This is actually an official coffee break.
