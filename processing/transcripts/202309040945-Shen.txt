Yeah, thanks for the invitation and for the introduction. It's like a pleasure to be here with to give a talk with a great view outside windows, but I hope everyone can still focus on my talk. All right, so today I'm going to explain, this is the, it's just the part one of the two talks given by myself and the Chijun, who will be the second speaker. And we would like to explain. And we would like to explain the connection between perverse filtrations and flow returns for so the story starts with actually a lot of recent discoveries of the structure of respirations for certain abilities fibrations, which are amorphous them with general fibers abelarized, but with particular fibers. With singular fibers, and the perverse perturbations associated with these kinds of geometries showed up in many different places. For example, in the study of hitching systems and in the study of like colour singularities and lock invariants and so on. And so the purpose of this talk is to explain a uniform, this sort of uniform approach to explain all these phenomena using the Fourier transform, which can be viewed as a partial extension of the theory. Of the theory of decomposition over a BM scheme, the BM variant to certain singular fibers. Okay, so everything in this talk will be over the complex numbers. So, well, of course, I will try to explain these two things. So, let me start with explaining what is the perverse pitration. So, since the name itself is a little weird, so this is the structure associated with any algebraic maps. So, you have a morphism from x to y with algebraic varieties. Let's assume f is proper, which is necessary, but it is not that necessary to assume any smooth space, but we just put this a function here for. Or, or can do this, okay? So, assaulting with a proper map, then there is an important which is increasing filtration, which will be our main character, the perverse filtration. So, the filtration is the total cohomology of X. Although, I mean, for all the co-homology, I will. I mean, for all the homology, I would use the pure coefficient, rational coefficients. So I would just write it for the first time then all the time. Okay, so this is a structure, very general structure. And the first and the most recent example, this for example, showed up naturally in the relative hot theory of L-D maps. Say if we pick L to be a relative ample cast. M proclass then L acts on as an important degree to the important operator on the rational homology of X. So then once you have such a proper map, then the question is whether what is the relative cardilagious symmetry with respect to this later ample. And even in formulating this chromological structure, then the perfect attrition comes into play naturally. Petrusion coming to play naturally. So, so the relative part left is so it's not on this entire technology, but actually it's on the gradient piece. The gradient pieces will respect you this filtration. So, the index is there is some constant R, which is the relative dimension R minus I. From homological grading, and this is isomorphic to the square of P. So, this L is a degree two with respect to both gradients, chronological gradient and a perfect gradient. So, it's R colour I. Okay, so this is so the thing to keep in mind is that actually if you consider And if you consider relative geometries, the topology of all the maps, then in particular, the perverse filtration is a natural, very natural invariant. So then for the next, I will first define this filtration, which may not be very helpful if you haven't seen this before, for someone who hasn't seen this before. But I'll give you a few examples which give you something about how they. Give you something about how it really looks like. So, let me start with the definition. So, how to cook up a filtration from an algebraic map? So the idea is that the rational cohomology of X can be defined using shift cohomology with respect to the constant sheaf on X. And then, in particular, we can calculate this cohomology on Y, or more precisely, the hyperchromology. Or, more precisely, the hypertomology on why with respect to the push forward. So, now this term itself is a well, I hope, did I okay. So, this is I just maybe this is better. So, this lies in actually the boundary device, the category of constructible sheaves. Of constructible sheaves of target Y. So if you write your chromology this way, then there is a, so this object is, for example, it's a natural object you're studying in the theme of so-called decomposition theorem of Benison Burst, Penny, and Garber. But when there are, so in particular, one can use the so-called perverse truncation functor to cut this complex, and then this induces. And then this induces an increasing infiltration of the global chromology. So, this will be our perverse filtration. So, you write the chromology display and do the truncation functions here, perverse truncation functions here, and this gives you a filtration. So, the one remark here is that, so if you know the decomposition theorem, you know that this complex actually can split into Actually, we can split into semi-simple perverse sheaves in every degree, chromological degree. However, the reason that we only study the perverse filtration, not the perverse decomposition theorem, mainly the reason is that this is the decomposition theorem is not canonical in general. It depends on choices. But the filtration is canonical because it's induced by the transportation function. So this is the canonical topological information that goes here with the At a proper map. Okay. Oh, drunk. Oh, good. Okay. That's not all the idea. Okay, so let me give you some examples of how this looks like. So the first example is a trivial example where we consider X. Trillium example where we consider X to be a product. So F is some new projective variety. So this is our F. So then by the Kuhnet formula, then we know that X can be written in terms of the homology of the fibers and the homology of the base. And in this case, it's a lot hard to get things that the relative To get since the relative jumps is only for this f direction, so the pk in this case will just be uh so you bound the homological degree of the first factor and do nothing for the second factor. So you can you don't need for this pk, you don't do anything for y, but only just control the chromological degree of the first vector. So this is the pk. So then uh Case. So then a slightly more general situation is a smooth morphism. So I assume that x to y is smooth, but not necessarily trivial. But then in this case, the PK is also a permanent object, which is nothing but the Lawyer filtration. So in algebraic topology, we know that for a vibration, it's missed vibration. Then there is a Labradoric spectral sequence associated with this morphism. And so that the perverse filtration is just exactly the filtration associated with that, the Laberic filtration, which is the filtration associated with that status sequence, which is just a labeled filtration. In other words, the perverse mutation is not that perverse or interesting when there are Or interesting when there are when there's no singular fibers. So then the third example, I'll explain that when there are singular fibers, then this situation can really be complicated and really behaved. So let me try to cook up some singular examples. So P2 cross C, you take the projection to the second factor. So, you know, this is just a projection to the second factor. Well, of course, this is a trigger vibration. So well of course this is a trigger vibration but let's follow up. I wanted one point of this dream code let's call this which I'll denote this by x. So this is just a vibration with very minor singularities. So this is just this is a point over given by p. So a general fiber would just be p2. P2 and the data is a over zero, there are two pieces where, of course, there's a piece which is P2, and but there's a central divider denoted by B. So this is a vibration with mild singular fibers. So let me first describe the perverse petration associated with this geometry. And in particular, Geometry. And in particular, so this is actually the first place where the perverse filtration, the difference between the perverse filtration and the larine filtration is seen. So out of so model model admits two filtrations. One is the larine filtration, which I will X. So now I so the layer tension is so the fibers here. So the fibers here have the fibers have the complex dimension two, which is real dimension four. So the low rate filtration as degrees goes from zero to four, right? So this is zero, one, two, three, four. So, and then we can also consider the perverse filtration, which actually modifies the marine filtration. So if you consider the rate filtration, then so this guy has five. This guy has five homology classes because the P2 has three homology classes in degree zero, two, and four. And then draw a point except the divide that gives you two more classes. So which is supported here over the zero. So the rate filtration, if you write this down, then I, the greater piece for the zero piece of two classes. Oh, sorry, the zero has one class, nothing here. And that, and then R is equal to two there. And at r is equal to 2, there are two classes, two classes here. So this extra two classes are contributed by the exceptional divider. So particularly, you see that if you put an axis here, there's no left to syndicate because the head is heavier. However, you see that the perverse return, since it satisfies that relative hard lapse, so it should satisfy symmetry with respect to this line. What really happens is that this two extra. Happens that these two extra classes, they are shifted here by the perverse destruction. So this two classes, one will go. So this clock, which supported everywhere, will still be here, but the other clock will go here. Similarly, this two has put into one plus one. And then this class stays. So in particular, So there is then the hard massive symmetry is exactly the symmetry with the flattered one. This is a very important. So in particular from this example, we see that when we have two fibers, the first, the perverse rotation is more symmetric, more better behaved. But there is also, it's easier to behave in some direct. It's usually behaved in some direction. For example, so we see that this one dimensional class is exactly given by the class of the exceptional divisor. And that this one, which sends from here to here, is given by the exceptional divisor where. So in particular, the perverse patron is not limited with respect to the cup product. So because this cup likes in P1, strictly in P1, but this cup cup itself likes in P1. Cup itself lies in P3. So P1, cup, P3, cup, P1, this does not go to P2. So in other words, perversation is not multiplicative. It's a complete So it's a complete additive structure. In general, it's not, it interacts well with the cut product, not tricky with respect to cut product. Okay, so in other words, this perversity structure makes some of the things feel better, but some of the things worse. For example, the reverse contradiction always multiplicates, but the perversion may not. But the further structure may not, even the fibers are mildly singular. Okay, so ah, okay. Oh, thanks. That doesn't look much better. Okay, so I thought that the progress material is a very general structure, but today I'm going to be explaining this structure actually. It showed up, at least to me, it's quite surprising. To me, it's quite surprising in several different places, even beyond the animal geometry, so surprising connection. So the first example is showed up in the study of teaching systems. So this is, for example, the subject of new constellon conjecture. The People's Federal conjecture. And sorry, now Abina-Haf's theorem. The numbered Hoff theorem and the P equals Standard conjecture also is showed up in the study of a more classical object called compatify Jacobian. Which I'll explain what's the meaning of this. Which I'll explain what's the meaning of that. How do you think about the perverse detection here? So, comparative edge of covids. So, this is relevant to the story here, comparative edge of covariance associated with planar singularities. And then the story here consists of representation theory of double affine heart algebra and also the invalence of knob and the links. And also, certainly, the Also, certainly the perverse patricia showed up almost the price of innumerative jumping. For example, the perverspilitation is used in defined so-called refined PPF invariants, which balance the common weight and balance the chromosome invariants. So there are So, there are a couple of places where the process situation shows up naturally, surprisingly, and they illustrate some structures of this situation. One of the key patterns here is that in many cases, the perverse filation is conjectured to be relevant to be governed by some more concrete filations. But those other filtrations, for example, But those other filtrations, for example, the weight filtration, they are multiplicative. So, then, in particular, this suggests that for these geometries, although the fibers are singular, they will be very singular fibers, but somehow if you have these kind of connections, then the perversion itself should be multiplicative. Like the case, that blackboard will not happen, of course. So, there are sort of the questions whether there are geometric explanations to these phenomena. So, in particular, today. So, in particular, today our folks these phenomena, these phenomena were discovered like independently and at the least of common features for the perversification. But today I'll focus more on these two. And in Chiju's talk, we will mention more applications, for example, the set of compact hypercala manifolds, hypercalevarieties. Okay, so the structure given defines these phenomena. Structure couldn't define these phenomena with. So I will say in a minute that if you look closely at these structures, then it's natural to speculate that there is a nice expansion of the rotor compensation for a BSD to those geometries with singular fibers. And this is, so I'll explain this. So the first, so the next thing I'll explain that I'll stop this. I will start with what the study of teaching systems and an idea Hodge corresponded told us about the total security. So, the teaching system for teachers. Okay, for this part, I will fix a real focus of genus at least two. Genus at least two, and I'll fix two integers and good co-paramet. And then I denote by M Higgs, the model of phase of slope stable Higgs models. E and theta, where E is a vector bundle of homomorphic vector bundle of rank n n degree d. So the co-pound condition assures us that the stability condition is the same as the thermodynamically condition, so we don't have to worry about it. And the theta is a Higgs flow, which is and the one is some. Which is the analog sum of your natural bundle towards it globally by the canonical bundle of the realized surface. So, this is this OC linear. Let me emphasize this because this looks like a connection, but it's OC linear so-called history. Okay, so there is a model of physics which parametrizes these pairs. Uh, pairs of a vector funnel together with a twisted animal system. So, these model of spaces they are actually they are open have a kernel manifold with modified version. These model of spaces carry two very typical structures. And so the first the story will be an interaction of these two structures, which I'm explaining now. Excuse me, I wish blackboard actually goes wait. That's what I should go. Oh, okay. So this model of this carries two features. One is two structures. Actually, three structures, depending on how you look at it. So I'll explain. So that then p equals second conjecture can be thought of as a The equatorial conjecture can be thought of as an interaction of these two structures. So the first structure carried, let me label this A, as a Lagrangian vibration. So the hitching, so the model of these vinyls admits a natural Lagrangian vibration, which is referred to as the hitching system. So there are many ways for defining actually this. So the hitching system plays a very important role in system plays a very important role in beyond the geometry, for example, in Bennett and Jim's formulation of the Georgian-Mullen conjecture. But let me just try to define. So this is actually an interesting definition which shows that this perverse penetration actually is intrinsic with respect to the heat model of face. So the quickest way for defining it is that this is exactly the affinization map associated with the model heat model. So this is a non-proper Is a non-proper model of space. You can consider all algebraic functions on it. And we take this back. So this is a finalization that also is this model of this. And in particular, this is proper analogy with the base given by some affine space of half dimension of the total space. Of the half-dimension of the total space. Okay, so this is a so that the model of Higgs panel carries a Lagrangian vibration. A guided example to think about is, for example, the total state is the total contangent bundle of the elliptic curve, which is a special model of Higgs bundle, and we consider all attribute functions by it and do the final. We function by it and do the finalization, and with what we do here is just a projection to the cotangent direction. Because this relates into e cross d and this is just the direction. This is our total model of the hitching system. Okay, so we have such a canonical intrinsic merchant. And this in particular, this tells you that the cohomology of the Higgs model. The Higgs model is not only a created vector space, but this is actually the future vector space given by this Lagrange vibration. But one thing I want to emphasize, and this is the single fibrous of the kitchen fibration is very, very complicated. It's almost as complicated as any like the geometry of other The other vibrations associated with, like, for example, Q3 surfaces or Q3 four colours we're familiar with. So, in particular, there's no obvious reason which suggests that this prevent filtration is nicely behaved. Okay, so this is one of the structures, the structure A associated with the Higgs model of this, which is the filtration, the perverse filtration. And the structure. Vespetration. And the disproportionate is still called a pineapple correspondence, which is something very special for the Hitch models, which are not visible in the study of compact capacity manifold, for example. So the non-Apinian Hodge corresponds. So this is more closely related to the metric perspective of the Higgs models, the non-Apinian Hodge correspondence. So this tells us that. So, this tells us that if you forget about algebraics, this is actually an algebraic version of an earlier theorem of Lara Sima and the Shadow, which says that the model of vector model can be written in terms of unitary representation if you forget about the algebraic structure focusing only on the underlying logical space. But now, by adding a fixed field, we upgrade the unitary modulus phase to the GLN modulus phases. To the GLN model of spaces. So, the model of Higgs finals, there is a natural difficult morphism, which is not altogether at all, which identifies to its so-called character varieties. The character varieties does not feel the algebraic structure of the curve. So, I'm not going to talk so much about things here, so let me just use that. Things here, so let me just use a cheating definition. So, this parameterized roughly the pyron representation into the GLN modular isomorphism, the conjugation. So, this is this side is the Higgs model, and this side is the model of local systems. So, in particular, here that if you consider the model of nature model, this corresponds to a unitary pen. A universal arbitrary representation which with a more uh topical theorem of uh non-theoretic shadow okay so oh thanks so but if you have the selected structure involves if you only care about the plausible invariant of facility with the kicks model of phases so you don't really have to consider which code you're talking about so it's only about Talking about. So it's only about, it only concerns the underlying topology of your curve. In particular, the cohomology can be calculated only by the pi one of the curve. So this is the M character variety. This is the structure given by B. And a natural question, which actually is a general expectation, that these two actually talk to each other, which is not the part, which is not. Which is not the part, which is not all this at all. So, by the consideration of the kitchen system, then you get a structure on the chromology, which is the filtration. And then the natural question is whether the ability-Hodge correspondence bees the Hitching system. And the answer is yes, which is the answer is provided by our view this conjecture, the Peek was double conjecture as an interaction of these two structures associated with the Hitching model of space. Associated with the hitching model of space, namely the ability to hodge correspondence features of hitting vibration, so chronologically. So, this is so-called p equals w by first formulated by the cartado. So, I'll first formulate in an original way, and then I'll explain how that the way the computation comes in the same. About 16 years ago. So, the formulation of everything was just so now the left-hand side is a future vector space, which I recall this filtration. And then I'm claiming it can be detected and right-hand side by something else, which is the loose weight filtration. Lead wave rotation W2K associated with the M car. But if you have no opinion of Haut correspondence, it exchanges that the complexity of the Lagrangian vibration with the complexity of the complexity of the boundary of this affine algebraic variety. Again, just before I move to the next. Just before I move to the next step, so I give you a co-example. So the P star C, which is the core model here, and at the other side, it's the Lafayette variety, which is P star plus C star. In particular, this side does not do the downward structure of the individual curve. So this is again a whole model. In particular, in this case, it's easy to exercise that the perverse matrix will reach exactly if the large retraction coincides with the weight retraction. Okay, so this is the conjecture which is now termed so a little before I'll just let you look about the history and how this suggests some structures for that that the modern hit bundles this the modern vibration carries actually something very similar to a Pogetic coefficient. Okay, so the first this is this is in in the work of Dikatado Although, I mean, believe me, in like the original paper, they verify this for the RAM2 case. N is equal to 2, and in this case, the P is only one option, which is 1. So, in this case, they verify this case. But actually, the proof is very complicated, but the process of proof, they ask, they ask. They ask a question, which is why. So you see that these two filtrations have very different flavors. So the worst filtration comes from hot structures, which is obviously not suggestive. And the perverse filtration, as I said earlier, is not multiplicative, even for very loud singular fibers. So in particular, this prediction, they ask that why also explain that How to explain that why this perverse retraction is malpecitive? So, there's a natural multiplicity structure for the hitching model of phase. And the reason that they ask this question is because in the course of the proof, actually, this is the hardest effect, because they verify certain generators, and then the task is to match the perversity of their product. And then, for every generator, they manage to prove it easily, but Manage to prove it easily, but to control the cut product doesn't need a lot of work. So the operating more intrinsic reason that the substitution vibrations has a multiplicative probability. Oh, perversity. And then after 10 years, the work the joint work was marked with the title, the Russian Monic. And myself, we verified this for a genus2 case. So the curve has genus 2, but the length could be arbitrary using the geometry of abundance surfaces and the symmetries of certain other parameters. This is 19. So, in this case, we proved this conjecture, but we in general for arbitrary G and N, we show that actually this course is really just the most important thing. So, we show that the entire P equals W is equivalent to explaining that multiplicativity of perfect patients. So, once you explain that multiple times, Don't get further than opportunity of purpose perturbation, then our argument tells us that we can just get the entire piece of stuff. So, this one is the hardest question. And then last year, there are two proofs independently by the first one by in the joint work with Ravish Molik and also by Hause Malik, which looks quite different if Google Mallet. You can go down it in that shipment which shows that this for arbitrary G and N it is okay. However, in our work, we didn't explain directly the multi convectivity of the perverse petrition. Instead, we just subject to many topics for the GRMPG model of surface and we want to use that. That use that uh at least in our proof. We use uh boring ideas from the global springer theory, from geometrical representation theory to control all the topological classes or product of the topological classes directly. So, although as a consequence, this proves the multiplexity, but this does not really explain why this is true. However, why this is not that satisfied, one of the reasons I'm going to prove the piece of conjecture, but this is not satisfied. There's no reason, and it's It by the main reason, and it's by me, maybe offer by Chija. And one of the reasons is that the multiplicity of the proverspetration is really a relative structure. It's not only for global commodities. So it's sheapris with respect to, it's local over the base, which can be also formulated sheapris. And this also, this multiplicity phenomena also showed up in, not for perverspetration, but for like in the special. Petration, but for like the spectral carbon kilometer geometry, for example, in the Volon story, the multiplexity of the penetration also showed up there. So it would be good to have a more systematic explanation of this phenomenon. So, okay, so this is the status of the question. How much time I have to do is. How much time I have? 25 minutes. Okay. Okay, let me explain the idea of the proof, the actual proof. So how, first, how such a chest statement, which is the proof of study consists of the ability to Haush correspondence, which is very transcendental. So how algebra geometry can be used to prove this, I will explain how algebra geometry can be used to prove such a conjecture. And secondly, I will explain during the proof, how we realize that. During the proof, how we realized that how it is natural to expect that there is a theoretical transform like the Woodi composition showdown for this singular fighter, a sketch of a tool. So the idea is that this P sparring and the W sparrows, they are quite far away. They are really all different spaces with different algebra structures. So the idea is to find something in the middle which Find something in the middle which tackles both sides where the question mark the structure for the question mark can be calculated. So, this is the idea. So, find something concrete which tackles both sides. And then you break this transcendental statement into two algebraic geometry statements. You hope this is algebraic geometry and this is algebraic geometry. So, this question mark consists of sort of structure of the Kijun model of thesis, which was like studied earlier, which was Which was started, started initiated, for example, in the study of model of status by Malcolm, Actium Bottom, and so on, which is the topological process. So, I would call this the structure of people that hitchhik model of state. We use topological classes to calculate both parts. So, it looks good idea that this vocabulary usually adds to the log out of the m cross divided by the And across these, there is a universal family. The normal actually doesn't go peak model, but let me forget about the peak model, but just focus on the boundary part. So the natural way for constructing classes is to use the chain type of this universal family to start with. So you pick a chain family, which gives you a class on the product. If you pick any, this is a clock on a curve set, we integrate it. So you produce classes on n. So here you see that a class with one and you push forward. In other words, it tells you which pretty component you take with that to for this chain class. And this gives you passing the chromology of M to X. So by this notation, actually, we see that there are two choices. One is by which chain crop you take here, and secondly, which cross you integrate over. So since that, I just use the notation CK, where the k is the chain grading and gamma is the cost you integrate over the curve. So it's given by the spare of the product of, since every class is as a linear combination of this way. As a linear combination this way, I could define that dki gamma i just consider arbitrary product. You don't control anything, but you just control the chain gradient. So you force the fun of this chain gradient to be bounded by this case. So at the first graph, this situation is not necessarily well behaved, very strange. Very strange, but there's actually a calculation from the character variety side, which shows that this is actually, yeah, this is nicely behaved. For example, all the topological relations between these classes are homogeneous with respect to turn gradients. And okay, so this is the turn filtration, which comes from the topological classes. So the P equals W finally is the proof of the P equals W equals. The proof of the physical cyber order goes at matching the P and W, but you match both sides with 10 with page minimum by the photological classes. So this third actually is an e statement, it's more like one-page argument using functionality of this part structure by this is verified by Schender. So then this remains the same. So, then this relates to so then the harder part is to prove that the perverse filtration is exactly matched with the channel filtration. Actually, wherever we can do this, we can do more. So, then malet shows that you affect the compensation of the rate filtration. Manage shows that the rate filtration standard is by a large symmetry as in the A large symmetry as in the conversion. So that's a curious quadrilache using some structure, very special for the character variety. Curious, this says for curious, which is, I think, named by Hamas Haught. Probably. So in particular, we just reduce the entire story to just proving that the change filtration The change filtration is compared in the perverse filtration more precisely. So it just needs to show that a certain product of the pedological class is lie in basically a piece of the production, where this piece is just given by the chunk radius. So the good people, this match, this identity itself is interesting in the sense that this part of... So this side is very easy to calculate. It's very concrete using the Padolabiocardi. But this is very complicated because it involves the perverse concrete functions and so on, which is very sensitive to the singular fiber, but they are indeed matched. Or expected to be matched by the conjecture, and we prove it. So then, although the second good thing about having this intermediate status is the following, that although the W star is something very So, although the W squared is something very global, but this statement really is a local statement that you can, for example, if you the teaching vibration has many, many finger fibers, but you can just ignore these finger fibers focusing on the smooth part, which is given, which is the Jacobian vibration of certain spectral curves. And you can still you can ask whether this is true. And this is indeed true, which is given by Bolivik. So, but the reason is that this, or more precisely, it's given. Or more precisely, it's given by that. So, in this case, the perverse patron is nothing but the Mauritius tradition. So, the periodic competition gives you natural splitting of it. And this trend concept is governed by the Abu Jacobi map and the Fourier transform. So, this is an interesting exercise and easy to verify that not hard to verify. Or more precisely, look at the I put that. Yeah, both errors are equally hard. So, not hard to verify. So, not hard to verify over the smooth locus, smooth locus of the hitching system. But if you just threw out all the singular fibers, the base. If you zoom out all the singular fibers, and you still can ask the statements, and it's really. The statement that it's really just it's a legal consequence of the Bulgarian operation. So then this suggests that there should be a Bulbury configuration moving over the entire future base or even governing the singular fibers. And that once you have, and then the entire P, the story phenomenon can be just reduced to this kind of phenomenon. Okay, so I will come to, but that's that. But as I said, the first proof of the first two proofs of the people's step is now to expand its means to really confirm. It's just there's a way to attack the perverse petrition directly with a global commodity and ex-constructive representation theory. But to convince you that this is the correct correct point of view thinking about this, I'll give you another example, which originally comes from a computer story. Originally, it comes from a completely different story, but some of the depth with the common feature with the hitching model of face. And after that, I'll catch the main ideas of the proof, and then I hope probably Chijun will continue and talk more details about really how ethically how to extend the Google Defense. Okay, 15 minutes, right? Right, so let me say briefly about the second story where this phenomenon also showed up, which is the study of curves and compatibility. So, this is a more classical object comparative. So, in this case, I will look at the same notation, just sorry for the convenience, but I still hope that you see it, you know, the curve. Hopefully, it's fine. And I see this is. Hopefully it's fine. And assume this is D as a curve in integral projective curve with final singularity. For example, all the singular points of the curve don't correlate in C2. So an extreme example is the following: that you consider a curve and That you consider a curve, and I mean, this is the extreme example. So, the curve can have a normalization which you just resolve all the singularities. And a typical example is that after you do the normalization, it's just a rational curve. It's P1. But the curve itself, the arithmetic genus of the curve can be as large as possible. So, for example, this kind of example can be constructed by using equations like xp minus yq. Equations like xp minus yq, and then you take the coefficients to g2. So, in this sense, then all the complexity of the singularities are sorry, all the complexity of this curve is really just photographs on the term of the singularity. So, really that there's only one isolated singularity. Okay, such a such a curve, the outbreak answer of the curve. Uh, uh, with um so one of the uh very common speed of an object associated with such a curve is the comparative cobion, which parameters uh rank one and degree. It doesn't matter, but I just think one degree for convenience. Degree zero, the rank one torsion in shapes are this curve, please. So the pointer condition ensures that this is an integral projected writing of dimension. So the dimension is really just given by the Aristotelic genus of this curve. So in particular, in this situation, then you see that if you resolve this measure, Then you see that if you resolve this, you take the normalization of this curve, then arithmetic genus, so the geometric genus of p1 is just zero. So then you can think of this comparative code as just invalids associated with the singularity, that the singularity of the pattern singularity. And that so this objects also they are closely related to our status theory and the cohomology has a root structure. Well, this chromology carries which structures. And I'm honestly, what I can expect, this actually carries the hidden gradient given by the perverse notation. So it admits a canonical or intrinsic perverse notation. Which I briefly explained what I should so you can expect in such a situation that the chromological complexity of this right is entirely encoding the compactity of the singularity. So So, the construction. So, previously, we saw that reverse filtration constructed with relative filtration, but a more difficult analysis of neutral filtration. So, in this case, the C itself does not, the curve itself, it's just a final curve. The idea is that to embed this into a large enough family over a disk, you smooth it. This is a zero. This is a zero, such that both this total family of the curve and the comparative relative comparative associated with this. This is a family of planar curves, and this is relative comparative by Jacobian, such that both are smooth. Truth. This can always be achieved, for example, taking a vertical. This can always be achieved, for example, a vertical family, just making this family large enough. The construction, so I think I should say this is due to Molly and the U. Whose original motivation is to partly to understand the sequence of conjectures relating the singularities or the not loot events of the singularities, means the algebra of this curve. So then, in order to So then, in order to originally, these questions were formulated in terms of field schemes, dynamic cues, and also independently diminutive linear. Schember realized that you can put all the structures, all the stories just to this one single variety, which is the comparative code. So then let me just write H again. So then there is natural future you can find this way because the cohomology of the stimulus of fiber actually can be realized as. Actually, can be realized is that you push forward this Q upstairs and then do the base change, you respect over zero. So this is how you get the Komala work here. And then this is the complex here, so you can use the perverse transition function. We first do the perverse transition function for here, and then restrict over zero. So this is if you do the perverse transition functor. Perverse transition functor of this contact in the bracket, and then you restrict you with zero. This gives you a perverse preparation for this. It's similar to so that there is a human ability geometry involved because although this only concerns a single fiber, but to define everything, there is actually smooth it. So, really, this is determined by these smooth of the curves. And this is the mauvic rule showed that this is. Maui showed that this does not depend on choice, so this is intuitive, which does not depend on the choice of this embarrassing, as long as these two conditions are verified. Okay, so let me just check out the time. Okay, six minutes, great. So, okay, so then there's a so let me be brief. So, there's a proposal by the vaccine, which is wide open at the moment, and that it's compared to ourselves, the planetary variables looks exactly like the HIP2 space, a hitchhik model of spaces. So, so let me give you, so if you have before with a you That before with a unique plan and singularity such that the normalization of that curve is just P1, it's a rational curve. And then the singularity seems invited locally into C2. So you can define, you can use the C2 is just the R4. So you can use that three-dimensional. So you can use that three-dimensional sphere to cut it. So you get a link, which is a topological data associated with the final singularity of the germ. The term of the final singularity, sorry. And the germ is proposed that if you consider the provost filtration as defined there, so it should be realized as the road filtration with respect to. With respect to something which only depends on the topological data of the singularity, which is a link. So, like in a beta-fetch correspondence, the model of Higgs model, which depends on the algebra structure of the curve, the perverse petration can be calculated by the pi one of the fundamental group. And this is the can be started with the local story. Although there's a lot of work concerning the right-land side and this construction, but so far, the fact that my But so far, to the best of my knowledge, it's still wide open. But whether we believe such a correspondence exists, and so sorry, just a little thing like that. So the reason for this proposal is that the perverse grading of this JP bar will detect the results homology of the link. So, this is a sequence of conjectures which are again wide open for most cases. But if you prove such a But if you believe such a link exists, then this suggests that these filtrations are also multiplicated due to the multiplicity of this one. So the perverse filtration is multiplicated. So under the cup file, let's call this star and the star. Star holds hold so sorry. So, this is the work of Oblonkov, Alexi Oblonkov and Jiu Wei Yu. 50 years ago, they used the Bubble-App algebra to actually calculate. So, they proved this file is true for. For the single items of the type XP minus YQ equal to copy. So this type of single items, they correspond to homogeneous of single fibers. And so then that the comparative Hacobian of the greater piece of the perverse pilgrim, there is a large symmetry given by the double, given by the rational Schuyler algebra, and they translate this kind of state. And they translate this kind of statement to like, the combination of the arguments involved like 100 pages, and they calculate more like the perverse petration for this singularity directly. And then, yeah, just let me say for the film and Mollik, myself, and the first thing that we have to do is to make a family. The paper I can show up on archive lab book. Among others proved that this is far true in general without using concrete generation results of the cohort. Okay, so our approach also provides a proof. So using, as I said, So, as I was saying in the last five minutes, and actually continues, is that this proof also gives a proof of p equal study. Okay, so do I have two minutes also? It's a consequence. I think she doesn't explain more details, but it's a consequence of the same framework. So it basically says that for a nice class of families of abelian fibrillation, for example, compatible Jacobian fibrillation, then there is a Fourier transform which is compatible with there is a convolution product and also compatible with the purpose patrons. And then these And then this structure will give you the proof of this one and this. So, in some sense, in some sense, this is harder than people. So, the original two groups of people more or less can be thought of learning with the homogeneous cases. Because in this case, the comparative batch of covariance are generated by topological classes or the chunk classes. So, then it suffices to just attack every topological classes derived. Technological classes directly, which can also be beneficial of work. But in order to achieve a general similarity or maybe labor, general heating systems, then there's no, it's not clear what kind of a label card is enough to generate the entire thing, like in the GLM case. So in particular, I hope this framework can provide some understanding of the geometries there, even if there is no Markman type ideological path. So just maybe two minutes. So maybe two minutes. Let me write on what's the structure hidden behind for ideas. So there are three ingredients. Let me just finish reading this kind of black board. So the first ingredient is as a theory of core transform. So like in the story. So, like in the story of the radio conflict, so it's not the same, but the same Mukai transform of Mukai to the Chamote or Chong groups, and this gives you interesting structures. And this is the same thing we do here. So, let me just focus on the case of family of abelian competitive vector cobrian vibrations, just for notational convenience. So, you have this F and F inverse with four transforms, which The third transforms, which acts on the cohomology, or more precisely, on the push forward, the everything's relative. So everything's actually relative the most physicist, but I would not state right now in that generality before kind of like, or if you're more comfortable, you can think of this as that. So the first thing is that you write out the Power transform using Using our linkings, our link is for Mucca, or more precisely, autoduality for db coherence of JC bar. So, but I want to use there's two technical difficulties one is there, but I want to Colleen is that Arenki's formula is not very precise. It's essential. When there are three fibers, you get a Lie bundle as an open orte. And I can show that you can, there's a comma-coding extension. So that the outcome is only a coherent sheet. It's not, so it's on a relative product of the competitive code, which is a singular, it could be a very singular variety. And this Arinkus Fernka kernel is not a perfect complex. In general, it's unbounded. In general, it's unbounded. And yeah, and the second removal, this space is tutular. So, for this, one basically have to use the call cost in a sort of studular model for getting that this operator of more precisely cycles, which act on the co-model in the second. In my point of view, it's the hardest. This is the hardest thing. As once you write down some cycles, you need to show. Write down some cycles, you need to show that they give you something like a Wii conclusion, which is that you have to show their own projectors. So, this is about proving certain topological relations. Because in the original something, so just because I don't have much time, so the shape is something like. So the shape is something like fi composed with fj inverse is equal to zero where i plus j is not equal to, for example, two times b. So this is this is crucial in the study of real evaluation, whose proof relies on the multiplication by n map of the abelian geometry, which is missed when there are singular fibers. So in order to overcome this, one has to use so to use the atom operations. To use the Adams operations. But I just feel like I don't know why. I believe Chichen will elaborate this. So we use Adams operation to. So first, we need to find a correct. So this generality may not be correct when there are single fibers. So first part we need to find a correct or more manageable statement, which is enough to produce your projectus, and then proving that using. And then proving that using Adam's operations. And certainly, we need to show that now, once you get projected, you get motivated decomposition. So then we have to show that this motivated decomposition or the corresponding associated filtration gradualizes to the perverse filtration defined topological in the first place. And this is given by angles of protein. Which shows that the motility configuration of two will imply will specialize to the perverted function. So, okay, I'm a little rushing the last part, but I hope the Netflix will provide more. Provide more details. I'm stopping here. Thanks.
