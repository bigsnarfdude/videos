Letting me go. Despite my absence for one day, I'm really glad that I made it and that I can talk now. Right, so this is joint work with Mona Merling, Laura Murray, Carmen Groffy, and Julia Simikini, almost all of whom are here. So does this have some work? No. So, the background or like part of the background of like cutting and pasting of manifolds is a classical topic. Manifolds is the classical topic of status congruence for polytopes. So, this is a very classical question asked, like maybe in the 18th century. So, if I have two polygons. Okay. If I have two polygons, is it possible to cut the first polygon with? Cut the first polygon with a straight cut, of course, so that I get different pieces, and then I glue them back together in a different way so that they get the other polygon. So, is this possible for any two polygons? It's a very, very old question, and it was answered a very long time ago. So in dimension two, like for these polygons, this is indeed the case. Like, I can cut and paste any into each other whenever the area is the same. And this is called that. Is the same, and this is called that P in Q or scissors congruent whenever the area of P is the area of Q. So what happens in dimension three was the topic of Hilbert's third problem. So in particular, he asked whether if I have a regular tetrahedron, is it possible to cut and paste it into a number of cubes? So that I could say, like, well, the volume of a pyramid, for example, I can just give like as a certain number of cubes because there was like a four. Number of cubes, because there was like a formula, but it was like a proof is by a sort of exhaustive method. And he wanted to have like a cut and paste argument. So this was actually the first of Wilber's problems to be solved by a student Dane. And it's actually not the case that we can cut and paste the tetrahedron into cubes. And what's preserved is what's called the Dane invariant. But these are enough. So when I have two polygons in the I have two polygons in dimension three, p and q, then they're sits as congruence if and only if their volume is the same and their Dane invariant is the same. Okay. So in dimension four, it turns out much later in the 70s that the four volume and a generalization of the Dan invariant are again enough to classify whether four-dimensional polytopes are systemic congruent. But in dimension five and higher, this is still. But in dimension five and higher, this is still an open question. So it's a very interesting topic of study. So, just a bit more formally, we can define SCN of X to be the grotenti group of polytopes in X up to this equivalence relation of scissors congruence. So X could also be a hyperbolic space or a spherical space or something. So there's been recent new work on this by Jonathan Campbell and Inazark. By Jonathan Campbell and Ina Zakareevich, they built k-theory spectra that recover these groups SA and X on pi zero using formalisms called disseminars and subtractive categories. Okay, and sort of this is inspired like a bunch of work. For example, Kerry Malkowicz recently showed that these K-theory spectra are TOM spectra. So only this is in this field of siso congruence, there's new approaches. A congruence: there's new approaches that use categorification of the classical groups. Categorification means that I now start with a group, but I lift this to a space or a spectrum or a category. So I have like a more complex object that captures maybe more of what's going on. So, what we're interested in here is doing a similar thing, but now in the category of manifolds. How manifold system congruents. So, as Carmer already described, I take an n-dimensional closed manifold. I cut along a codimension one sub-manifold with a trivial normal bundle. It has to have a trivial normal bundle because otherwise a boundary in a manifold always has to have a trivial normal bundle. So, if I cut along something that doesn't have trivial normal bundle, I don't get like a nice manifold with boundary. A nice manifold with boundary. And then I glue back the pieces along everything that I cut, but with a different diffeomorphism. So for example, I can start with two tori and get a sphere and a two-dul torus. So I call two manifolds m and m prime sk equivalent if they are obtained in this way. So if m is two pieces m and m1 and m2, glow do. pieces m and m1 and m2 glow dot glue drop of phi and m prime is the same two pieces but glued over psi and now skn is n-dimensional manifold up to this equivalence relation of sk equivalence and this forms an abelian group where addition is disjoint union so for sk n itself i don't even need to take a grotendy group but in in the following i will take a grotendy group um i'm here talking about i won't say this again uh I won't say this again, compact-oriented manifolds. And in this case, I'm talking about closed manifolds. Okay, so let's try to compute what this is in a couple of cases. So let's go to dimension one. If I have the monoid of manifolds up to diffeimorphism that are closed and compact, then this is just generated by the circle. And if I take this generator, the circle, I can cut it up. I can cut it up and glue it back together so that I get two copies of the circle. So the generator is centered twice itself, and therefore it's zero. So SK1 is zero. Okay, so how about in dimension two? Well, this is also an example that Carmen already gave. Like if I get a torus and I can cut it up into two tori in the very same way. And this is the sort of thing that I said before. And this is the sort of thing that I said before: two to a sphere and a two-hole torus. And in fact, the equation that we have here is just the Euler characteristic. So Euler characteristic of the torus is zero, zero is zero plus zero, and zero plus zero is two plus minus two. So the Euler characteristic, or in dimension two, the Euler characteristic divided by two gives an invariant, it gives a map to. A map to the integers. So, Karis, Krag-Neumann, and Osta in the 70s showed that Euler characteristic and the signature are, in fact, the only SKA invariance. And I will discuss a little lemma that went into this proof in a bit. So also, in the way they prove this, they actually compare to another classical equivalence relation of manifolds, which is cobordis. Of manifold, which is cobordism. So, how are SK invariants and cobordism invariants related? Well, if omega n is my classical group of n-dimensional manifolds up to cobordism, again with disjoint union as the operation. Then I can form SKN bar, which is n-dimensional manifolds, the common quotient. It's manifolds, optical borders, and SK equivalence. I have two canonical quotient maps, and they can ask what are the kernels of these quotient maps. Of these quotient maps. Okay. So first, let me start with two SK coefficient manifolds and try to build the co-borders in between them. Then what I can do is I can take, so here, like I'm sort of representing like M1 and M2, and I don't think of them as having extra boundary. I'm just seeing them like sort of from the side. All of their boundaries glued over phi and over psi there. over psi there. Okay. Now I take two n plus one imaginary manifolds with boundary, which are m1 times the interval and two times an interval. Then I glue them on one end by phi, on the other hand by psi, but I can't quite glue them in the middle. So what's left over here is like, so I have here a cobordism, okay, but I have some sort of free boundary, okay? And that free boundary is exactly of the shape boundary of M1 times an interval. Boundary of M1 times an interval, boundary of M2 times the interval, which is this diffeomorphic, and then glued by phi here and psi there. Okay, so this is exactly the mapping towards T phi psi inverse. So I see that my two SK equivalent manifolds, M and M prime, are cobordant if and only if this mapping towards is no cobordant, because if this mapping torus is no cobordant, then there is some manifold with this boundary that you can glue into this hole. Can glue into this hole to make it cobordised. So, in particular, this means that if inside my cobordism group, I just kill all mapping tori, so I artificially add the inverses or I add the nil cobordisms of mapping tori. Then all of my SK manifolds become cobordins. Okay, so the map from cobordison to SK bar. From co-borders into SK bar has the subgroup generated by mapping to RI as the kernel. Okay, so now I want to present a classical lemma, which I think is very nice lemma in the SK book, which is the surgery lemma. So suppose that M and M prime are two manifolds, and they're related by a single surgery. So what does that mean? So what does that mean? It means that gluing a handle from to get from m to m prime. That means that I'm cutting out s k times dn minus k, and I'm gluing back in dk plus one times sn minus k minus one. Okay, so these two manifolds have the same boundary, the boundary sk times s k, s n minus k minus one. And I have a little picture here. And I have a little picture here. I have a little picture here, but like if I have M and I have A in it, and I glue that out, I cut out A and I glue back this other manifold B. And what I see is that in the middle, I can think of having a little disk here. Okay, so if I take A, union B, and this is the boundary of this strip. Uh, of this strip uh dk plus one times dn minus k. Okay, so the boundary of any sort of ball is just sn. So, this is always the case by if I call these these sort of pair of handles A and B, they together form a sphere. So, another way of thinking about applying a surgery is that I can now think of these manifolds as being cobordant. These manifolds as being coordinate through what's called the trace of the surgery, and it's very easy to form the trace. Namely, I take just my manifold m times the interval, and then I attach this strip that I had before. I attach it along A. Okay, and now smoothing this out a bit, squint my eyes, and I see that this is just a cobordism here from a circle to two circles. Two circles. Okay, now consider the following manifolds. If I take m disjoint union a sphere, well, m is just, well, m delete a and glue a back in, and the sphere is a union B. Okay, now consider the manifold m prime, disjoint union as k tant and s k. Disjoint union as k tant and s n minus k. So m prime was m delete a glue in b and I can see if I if I glue a to a I get s k times s d n minus k glued to itself along the boundary. I do these dn minus k. So just two hemispheres they glue into an s n minus k. So this is exactly a union a bar. Okay. Oh, I can't see that. You can't see that. So here, if I look at these two manifolds, what I've done is I've exactly swapped what manifold I've glued. So here the gluing of A goes on the other side, and here the gluing of B goes on the other side. Okay, so it's swapping two pieces. So this is exactly an SK operation. So I see that N plus a sphere is in SK the same. Is in a scale the same as m prime plus this product of spheres. Okay, so let's apply this to n being the sphere. On the left-hand side, I get two times the sphere. On the right-hand side, I get, well, if I have this type of surgery on a sphere, I get sk plus one times sn minus k minus one. You'll have to. times sn minus k minus one you'll have to believe me on that plus this other product s k times s n minus k okay so let's evaluate this in a couple of cases so i can choose my k i can i can choose what surgery operation i do but what k handle i choose so if k is zero i guess twice as n is as one times as n minus one plus as zero times as n Plus S 0 times S n. S 0 times Sn is just two copies of S n, right? So I get, I obtain the result that S1 times Sn minus 1 is 0 on Sk. So in fact, this sort of lines up with what we've seen before, that in fact, any manifold times S1 becomes 0 on SK, because I can cut it up and glue it into multiple copies of itself. And in fact, Copies of itself, and in fact, I don't even have F to be a product, I can also fiber over S1, which is the same as being a mapping torque. Okay, well, if I then evaluate this formula again, but now for K is one, I get the twice the sphere is S2 times Sn minus two, and then this is the factor that disappears again. So, what I get is that such a product of spheres as k times Sn minus K. Spheres, as k times Sn minus K is either twice the sphere with K is even or it's zero of K is odd. Sort of inductively applying this formula. Okay, so this is for a single surgery. So if I have a single surgery, m is m prime plus s k times n m s k minus the sphere. k minus this sphere as k times as n minus k is either two spheres or zero spheres so if i apply a single surgery m is m prime plus minus one to the k times the sphere that's after doing a single surgery being cobordant means that i apply a whole sequence of surgeries being cobordant is the same as being related via a sequence of surgery steps Of surgery steps. So I get that if m and m prime are cobordins, then m is m prime plus a number of copies of the sphere. And the number of copies you can actually also describe is Euler characteristic of the manifold m minus Euler characteristic of a cobordism. In particular, if m is no border, so it's zero in cobordism, then that means. zero in comportism, then that means that m in sk is the number of copies of the sphere. Okay, so I've now derived for you that the kernel from sk to sk bar is generated by spheres, which is something that we also saw in Carmen's look. Okay, so just completing these two exact sequences, I have fn goes to omega n goes to skatebar, and in the Script bar and in terms of invariance, like these are sort of all mapping tor. I picked up whether the something is a mapping tor is if the signature is zero. Cobordism has many invariants, like the order characteristic modular two, the signature, and other Steven-Woodney and von Dragon numbers. This group of spheres in SK is either zero if n is odd or z if n is even. And SK, the only thing that remains in SK is already characteristic in the signature. And the only thing that remains in SK bar is the signatures. So, in terms of groups, for the orientable case, we sort of get simple groups, but they're still interesting construction. So, just another link with something that Karen was talking about. So, there's another group called Another group called SKK, which is a refined version of SK. Okay, so just to sort of repeat the definition, maybe play it differently. So now instead of saying, so I have two kind of based equivalent manifolds, M1 M2 glued over phi and M1 M2 glued over psi. Instead of saying that their difference is zero, I say that their difference is the same if I used other pieces N1 and N2, but I glued over. Other pieces n1 and n2, but I glued over the same phi m psi. So there's a clear quotient map to SK. It's just sort of it's a less sort of strong relation. But SKK, as Carmen mentioned, is pi one of a coboretum category. Where a cobordism category is something that has objects, n minus one manifolds, and morphisms, n dimensional cobalt. Manifolds and morphisms and dimensional coordinates with topology. So we have several different sort of links between cobordism and SK groups. And in fact, this is a different representation of nice braid that Carmen gave you. So if I have these two exact sequences, then SKK sits exactly there and surjects onto omega and SK. Omega and SK, with sort of the kernel of going into omega n being now spheres generated in SKK, which is a group that rejects onto this IN. And this middle sequence is what Carmen was also talking about, and it also comes about in the longer-set sequence of homotopy for the Ganauer sequence, if people know about this, for comportion with boundary. Okay. So this is all about the classical groups. Now, sort of something that we do in modern maths is like categorifying classical invariants, right? So if we saw a group somewhere, what we want to do is we want to make a space or a spectrum out of it. Because this lifts, like, you know, if we just had a group, then we can think of this as pi zero of some space. And we can think of this as pi zero of some space, but now we have all of the higher multiple groups to work with. So we get more structure. We might be able to find new invariants. And then also, of course, if we saw a homomorphism of groups somewhere, then we want to make this a map of spectra or a map of spaces or categories. So just the cases in which this was done. So as I said before, the classical sisocongruous groups, polytopes, Congruence groups, polytopes, or extended to a K-theory spectrum by Johnson Gappel and Inter-Karevich. And another example is like if I have my coborising groups, and these can be thought of as the connecting component of this coborising category that I talked about. And the higher homotopy groups of the coborism category have been found by Glattis, Matson, Tillman, and Weiss to equal the homotopy groups of the MTSO spectrum. Of the MTSO spectrum. So we have a spectrum here that represents sort of higher comportism. And the hope is, of course, that we would do a similar thing for SK and the very rich theory in either of these fields would extend in some sense to this situation as well. So the goal of our first project was to define a K-theory spectrum that recovers these SK groups on pi zero. By zero. Okay, so just a little sort of overview of K-theory, right? So just the ideology behind it. So K-theory gives you groups Ki associated to X, which is maybe like a space or commutative ring, or maybe a Walthausen category. So Waltha category is something, a structure that has a category with a zero object. Certain methods that are called for. Object, certain method or co-furbations and certain weak equivalences with some conditions, of course. And I can think of these ki of x as being the homotopy groups of k of x, which is some spectrum. And now, in the general, even for like both topological and algebraic theory, the idea is that k0 is saying something about how things are glued out of smaller things. So, for example, in topological the So, for example, in topological K-theory, even though topological and outbreak K-theory are generally quite distinct, right? But in topological K-theory, I give you a space, and a K0 of a space is generated by isomorphism class of vector bundles over the space up to the condition that, well, it's group completion, really. Like the sum of two classes is the class of the sum. Okay. And now. Okay, and now in algebraic K-theory, for example, for a Walthausen category, K0 of the category is generated by equivalence classes of objects, objects in this category, up to A plus B over A is B, for a cofiber sequence A to B to B over A. Okay, so this cofiber sequence is also telling me something about how do I glue a big thing out of two smaller things? And the equivalence relation, sort of win. And the equivalence relation sort of witnesses this just on k0. K0 sort of deletes everything except for some sort of cutting and gluing relation sense. Okay, so problem one compared to like the polytope scale, right? If I take a polytope and I cut it up, then I get polytopes. If I get a manifold, If I get a manifold and I cut it up, I get a manifold with boundary. So my pieces don't live in the same category. So if we want to apply anything on the scope of K-theory, which tells me sort of how different objects are related by cutting and gluing them, I really need to instead work in the category of manifolds with boundary. Otherwise, I can never do anything like K-theory. Okay, so in our paper, we define SK boundary to be an element of manifolds with boundary up to an SK boundary equivalence. So what is SK boundary equivalence? So I take a manifold with boundary, I cut along a co-dimension one sub-manifold, which would have your normal bundle in the interior, and then I glue back everything that I got. Everything that I cut. Everything that I cut. So, in particular, this SK boundary cutness preserves boundary. And there was also an SK boundary defined in the original SK book, but ours is a different kind of version. And this means that there's a we showed that there's a shortcut sequence of SK including at the SK boundary, projecting onto CA minus one, which is just the boundary. So it's the group. Just the boundary. So it's the group completion of bounding manifolds of the dimension n minus one. Okay. So problem two has something to do in a sense with iterated cuts. So if I take a polytope and I cut it sort of multiple times, doesn't matter how I cut it, I always get something that's polytopes again, like all the small cuts are polytopes. Cuts are positive. If I iterate cutting a manifold, then I'm very likely to get a manifold with corners. So I'm again leaving my category. So that in particular applies to the previous frameworks that were used for the Cisco Crongman's K-theory don't apply. So the solution is to instead apply what's called K-theory of squares, which is a new formalism for K-theory, again, developed by Kampo and Zakoravich. Campo and Zagrevich, which has a sort of more controlled way of cutting and gluing. So, what is k theore squares? Very roughly, I get an input that is a category with squares c, and my output is some k square of c. So, a category of squares is a category together with certain distinguished squares. Let me just take you to the definition quickly. Through the definition quickly. So a category of squares has a base point object. It has two subcategories of morphisms, CC and F C, and it has distinguished squares that have one of the morphisms horizontally and the other morphisms vertically, which are commuting squares. And the conditions are that C has a cold product and my distinguished squares as a set is closed on this co-product. My squares. Product. My squares composed vertically and horizontally, both morphisms that contain all isomorphisms. And in one square, or in a commuting square, if either both the horizontal or both the vertical morphisms are as morphisms, then the square, the commuting square has to be in my class of distinguished squares. So it's a bit, you know, in spirit, it's a bit like doing a wild housing category, but like with a A wild housing category, but like with a different setup, and what is my output? So, what I get as an output is an infant loop space that is built using these squares. So, how do I build this? So, first, I build a bisimplicial set that is given by composing squares in two directions in all possible ways. And I know that these squares compose, so that allows me to give. Me to give the structure of a simplicial of a bisemplicial set. Subsequently, I take this bisemplicial set, I realize it, and I take loops over it once, based at the space point that I have. So this is indeed an infinite loop space. Why does this deserve to be called K-theory? So if C is a wild housing category. So, if C is a wild housing category, and I set C C to be a co-fibrations and F C to be all maps, and the special squares are commutal squares that are we could equivalent to a pushout. Then I get that if I now apply my k squares construction, I get back my Waldhausen k-theory. So k-square. So, k squares is something that generalizes Walthaus and K-theory, in a sense. If I have a Walthausen K-theory, then I can get back the Walthausen K-theory of that category. Okay, so moreover, so this is about what is K0 in terms of sort of just making things out of smaller bits. If I have some small conditions on the category, Some small conditions on the category, then this k square of c satisfies the property that k0 of c, so that's pi naught of k squared of c is given by, or it's spanned by the object of c up to a square relation. A square relation being that whenever I have one of these distinguished squares A, B, C, D, then I said A plus D is B plus C. So think back in terms of sort of my cofiber sequence. So, my co-fiber sequence is like a different way of cutting and gluing something up, but I'm gluing it in sort of two bits that are glued over A. So, for example, if I have a pushout here, then in terms of like sort of a pushout in spaces or something, then this makes sense because if I take B and I take C and I glue them over A, that's D, then B plus C is D plus an extra copy of A. So, this makes sense for our push-up. Okay. So, now how do we apply this to manifolds? So, we define a category of manifolds with squares, objects of which are smooth, compact, and dimensional manifolds with boundary. Morphisms are what I call SK embeddings. Embeddings. So it's an embedding, a smooth embedding of manifolds in such a way that what happens here, the boundary components of my origin either go entirely into the interior of the target or entirely to a boundary component. They can't sort of like go to the boundary a little bit and then go off. So these kinds of maps for manifolds with boundary, if you think of it, you can. Boundary, if you think of it, you can think of them as like gluing on an extra piece along the boundary, which is the complement. They're also exactly the kinds of maps that make sure that Novikov additives. Like inclusions of colour neighborhoods, because that's one way to think of it. Oh, great. So, yeah, so the boundary component has to go into the interior with as a sub-manifold the trivial normal boundary. Submanifold the trivial normal bundle, okay? Yeah, sorry, I'll see that. Um, so my squares, I had to give you like a set of distinguished squares. Um, so these are squares, commuting squares of these SK embeddings that are pushouts on the level of spaces. So not all pushouts exist in manifolds. Not all push-outs exist in manifolds in general. If I try to like glue manifolds together via push-out, I will sort of most of the time not get a manifold. But I'm just taking the squares that are push-outs. So this indeed satisfies the conditions for a category with squares. So what I get is a spectrum k-square of manifolds. And now the theorem is that this. And now the theorem is that this spectrum on k0, on pi naught, indeed recovers my sk groups with boundary. Okay. So what we've done now is we've constructed a spectrum that could categorifize the cut and paste groups. So you can think of this as sort of, in a sense, hopefully a cut and paste version of the MTSO spectrum, of the Matzen thermal spectrum. Hopefully. Hopefully. Of course, we just have a spectrum now, but we want to know things about the spectrum. We want to sort of derive things. We want to categorify the maps, the maps of groups into maps of spectra. These are the things that there's lots of questions here still about what this spectrum actually is. So now I will tell you a little bit about subsequent work comparing different spectra. Comparing different spectra. So, one thing is that, like, in the original paper, we already realized that, like, if you take chains over the integers, this gives you a map of categories from manifolds to homologically bounded chain complexes over Z. And this gives rise to a map of spectra from k squares of manifolds to k squares of chains over z, which is isomorphic to k of z. Of C. Okay, so on pi naught, this gives me a map from k0 of manifolds, kk squares of manifolds, which is sk boundary, to k0 of z, which is just z. And this map is the Euler characteristic. So that's sort of the first categorization of a map. We found a map of spectra that Of spectra that lifts the Euler characteristic invariant. Okay, so follow-up work just with Carmen and Julia. We looked a bit further at sort of this diagram of exact sequences of groups. And in particular, what we wanted to do is build a spectrum that lifts SK bar bound. lifts sk bar boundary together with the lift of the canonical quotient map from sk boundary to sk bar boundary to a map of spectra and we did this using cubes of manifolds like firstly i need to tell you so so i've defined sk sk boundary right but how do i actually define sk bar boundary so sk bar uh i tell you remind you was manifold up to both sk equivalence and cobordism Up to both sk equivalence and cobordism. Okay, so now I have manifolds with boundary, so I need to think of the appropriate sort of cobordism relation to quotient by. If I just take cobordism with boundary, then it's quite easy to see that all manifolds are coordinated to each other. So if I allow sort of free boundary, if my boundary can be anything of the cobordism, then this is, for example, if I take any m times. m m times the the interval sort of and i have an open end and then i go from m prime times an interval to m prime so you have a cobordism between any m and m prime and a similar thing works if m and m prime have boundary okay so this is a very sort of trivial relation having open boundary in cobordism gives you sort of a it is sort of it's a study theory but it's um mostly for higher cobordisms because this is a sort of a group. This is the trivial group. And the appropriate notion actually is trivial boundary cobordism. So, a trivial boundary cobortism is a cobordism that on the boundary of M is just the same as a mapping cylinder. So, just the interval times the boundary. And this exactly corresponds to doing surgeries on a manifold with boundary, but on the interior of my manifold. So, if I just think about this surgeries on the interior, then I get an alternative version of the surgery lemma with boundary. So, suppose m and m prime are related by the surgery on the interior of m. So both m and m prime have boundary. So, m prime is now just the same as m like taking out a gluing back b. Now, I don't, I'm not touching the boundary. Now, I'm not touching the boundary, so m and n prime have the same boundary. So here's a little picture. And then again, I have that m and n prime can be thought of as being coordinated via the trace. I glue in it exactly the same way, m times the interval, and I glue this strip in, which is the this trace strip. I fudge it a little bit, and what I get is exactly a trivial boundary coordinate. Now, if I apply the same sort of kind of based argument that I had before, I now get that m plus sn is the same as m prime plus s k minus the times this m minus k in skate boundary. So I see that if I apply, if I define escape bar with this trivial boundary comportism, then the canonical Borders in then the canonical quotient from sk boundary to sk bar boundary again has a kernel being uh generated by spheres okay so zooming in a little bit more on uh this uh trivial boundary coordinate um so if i quotient manifolds just by trivial boundary cobordism i don't i don't get a group now i get a i get a monoid because i can't sort of cancel my boundary Monoid, because I can't sort of cancel my boundary. And it's actually, it's a monoid that's also non-cancellative. So if I define this to be omega and omega and tilde, and then omega, and it's just a grotenti group of this sort of cobordism, genuine cobordism group with trivial boundary. Then I have the following lemma that if I go from normal cobordism into this trivial boundary. Into this trivial boundary comportion group. And I subject onto having boundary, but this map now has a kernel given by twisted doubles. Why is that? That's because a twisted double in this monoid is a non-cancellative element. So I give you sort of the following diagrammatic picture. I can give you trivial boundaries above it from n together with. Together with this twisted. So, the twisted double is just M glued to M with the opposite orientation via some self-defemorphism of the boundary. So the twisted double plus m, and the result again is m. Okay. So I see that, like, you know, this is this should say in the monoid. And then in, yeah, in the group, this, this, uh, Yeah, in the group, this element will vanish because it's non-calculable. So, if I define SK bar boundary as manifolds up to SK boundary and this trivial boundary cobordism, and what I see is that SK bar boundary actually becomes isomorphic to this trivial boundary cobordism group that I defined before. And that's because this kernel that I had before, this Fn, is also quotiented out by Is also quotiented out by doing this quotient decode completion. So I have like an isomorphism of short exact sequences from omega and modulo fn. So omega and trivial boundary to this boundary component, which is isomorphic to Sk bar, the SK bar boundary, so Cn minus one. So this is analogous to this sort of exact sequence that I had before for S. Sequence that I have before for SK. Okay, so that just tells me this is also split because C and L minus one is free. So this tells me that these are all, well, for SK bar and SK, these are minimal extensions of having a boundary. It's just I have the group, the original group, and then I add a boundary component. So what remains? um so what what what remains of my uh of my two sort exact sequences when i have boundary is uh these uh sort of well this is a short exact sequence but a very trivial one okay so now how do we categorize this sk sk bar boundary so we do this using cubes of manifolds okay so in the categorification of sk In the categorification of SK boundary, we used squares of manifolds, which are used cutting and pasting square with SK embeddings. And now we're still building cubes out of manifolds. So a standard cube of manifolds has sort of on the front and back face, it has a square of manifolds. Going into the page, I have trivial boundary coordinates. Going into the page, I have trivial boundary combordisms. And now, sort of on the faces, I have, in a sense, a big canopy square of manifolds. So I have an SK embeddings, an SK embedding on the trivial boundary comportism. So, in a sense, I could think of this as just being a square of trivial boundary comportisms. Of trivial boundary comportisms, a cut-based square of trivial boundary comportism. And again, I require that this on the level of these comportisms is a push-out square. So again, before I had this bisemplicial set, and I showed that my k-theory, the k-squares theory, loops of the realization of sets recover the constant k0 sk. Recover the K0SK boundary. Now I get a trisimplicial not set, but space. I really need sort of to have the more topological version here. And I define the k cube of manifolds, this bar representing the topology, to be loops on the FAT realization of this trisimplicial space. And what we show is that. And what we show is that k0 of this spectrum, we show that it's a spectrum again, even though the k-squares formalism doesn't quite work, it's sort of a different formalism. But k0 of this, so pi-0 of the spectrum, recovers my s-k-bar boundary. So looking at the stress of visual space a little bit again, I have two sort of clear inclusions. sort of clear inclusions of like simplicial conclusion the inclusions of uh of other uh simplicial objects so if i look at x00 dot so that means that i i don't do anything in in the sort of horizontal and the vertical direction i just go into the page and of course just going into page gives me the nerve of cobordism category with trivial uh boundary uh so this gives me a map of spectrum So, this gives me a map of spectra from loop speed of trivial boundary cobordism to my spectrum. However, so on pi naught, which is pi one of the cobordism category, this is not recovering any sort of non-trivial interesting map of groups because this map is zero. I can think of another nice I can think of another nice simplicial object that sits in here. Namely, I don't go into the page, I just sort of look at the front face, I look at x.0. And here I get sort of a topological version of my Bauchen-Place-Set that I had before. So s bar dot dot, topologize the s k squares. Again, I can do my squares k theory on this. So that's loops. That's loops of the federalization of this bicyclical space. And we show in the paper that this again recovers on pi-naught sk boundary. So you could sort of think of this and the other one as being, so this is like a topological version of this spectrum. So it's a little bit like looking at the coborism category and looking either at the topological version or looking at a discrete version. There's two different spectra, which sort of on pi. Sort of on pi zero give you sort of the same thing, but like there's a topological version and a discrete version. Now, this inclusion of this bisemplicial space gives me a map of spectra from k squares to manifold bar to k cubed manifold bar. And this on pi zero lifts my map from sk boundary to sk bar boundary. So that that lifts the canonical surjection. Can I clarify? So how does pi watt of B cob relate to, I guess you called it, omega bar boundary earlier? Or omega boundary earlier? Is there no connection there? No, because it's pi one because I've taken loops once. So this is sort of like the shift that I also have between the Matt and Tilmer spectrum and the cobordism category. So like this loop, this, well, the trivial coborism. Coborism monoids would be pi zero of this category. Pi one is sort of like a trivial, well, if it would hold in this case, it would be like a trivial boundary version of SKK or something. But in any case, this map is not very interesting to study. Or at least on Pi zero, it might be interesting in higher. With the higher multiplayer, yeah, right. So I maybe I'll quickly go okay. So I just wanted to go over just to close off with a nice proof. I wanted to go over lemma that features in the proof, both of k squares being sk boundary and also k cubes being sk bar boundary. cubes being sk bar boundary namely that um manifolds up to manifolds with boundary up to sk boundary equivalence uh is like thinking about that sort of equivalence relation is the same as thinking about manifolds up to a square relation right because it's case k squares k theory had it on k0 had this square relation whenever i have a square a b c d i have the relation a plus d as b plus c so this is also known um well i'll go over the proof Well, I'll go over the proof. Okay. So, first, take two SK equals manifolds. I define D to be M and M prime glued over phi and D prime to be nm prime plued over psi. So now I can form a square that glues d because I so I'm gluing over some boundary. I'm thick, fattening that boundary up a little bit. Fattening that boundary up a little bit. And then I included into m and I included it into m prime. Here I use my map phi, phi times an interval. And then if I glue, I get exactly d, which is nm prime glued over phi. So now I can also build a square that lose d prime. So I take the same object here, but now But now I'm including here using psi. So see, I've color-coded like how I'm including things, like swapping what I include here. And then of course, because I'm taking a push-out, I'm now gluing over a different sort of image of my sub-manifold. So I see that what I get as a result in the push-out is D prime, which is m and m prime glued over psi. So, if I now look at sort of my square relation, so here I have a plus d is b plus c. So, d is b plus c minus a. Here, like the objects are the same except for d prime. I'm not sort of saying, you know, k0, I don't see the maps. So, here I get this correlation a plus d prime. I get this square relation a plus d prime is b plus c. So I get d prime is b plus c minus a. And in particular, that implies that d is d prime. Okay, so the square relation implies that sk equivalent manifolds are equated. Let's go the other around. So I take a square of manifolds. So now A can be sort of a more complicated manifold. And let me just I've color-coded A in a particular Coded A and in particular N, which is the boundary of A going into the interior of B. Now let me sort of define two auxiliary manifolds. I define the complement of A and B together with this little manifold n times the little interval. And M prime. And M prime is A and C. So now let me glue these manifolds like this along what I call the identity. So now I see that if I glue these manifolds vertically, I get A glued in with B minus A, which is B, and I get C with a little. With a little added boundary, which is just diffeomorphic to C. I'm posting my diffeomorphism here. So apparently, M glue to M prime gives me B plus C. So now let me glue the other way around. So now A glued with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of A glued with a little piece of boundary just gives me A back and C glued to B minus A gives me the pushout D. So indeed I get that like these two manifolds are SK equivalent and this is B plus C and A plus D. So apparently SK equivalence also implies the square relation. So that's sort of a little nice proof about. So, if a little nice proof about wasn't would be nice to discuss. Um, and I'll stop here. They're gonna take that mic and get your new mic. Oh, oh, did people not hear me at all? Oh, no, this is just the process. Okay, great. Any questions for Renee? I was wondering if this process made by Carmen to construct TQFT, where they consider the invertible ones, there is also TQFT, but open. is also tq of t but open close that when they consider the the open part inside they consider the the three boundaries i think this is not uh the context of your talk yeah because uh but uh it's it is possible to adapt the the karmic process in order to say something about the invertible open closed tq of t adapt the karman For for the boundary. Yeah, for the forum. Uh another type of thing that would get bigger boundary. So speaking boundary and space is going to have to be around it. So if I go straight into that. And we talk about other things. Um but what do you mean there probably do for other things? I don't know, but maybe interesting in this context is that you can think about like trivial boundary cobordism a bit more in terms of cobordism categories, and then you can. In terms of cobordism categories, and then you could also think about like TQFTs on those. So we have like a classical Ganauers sequence, which includes like cobordism without boundary into cobordism with boundary, and then like looks at the boundary. So it's a bit like sort of the analog on cobordism categories of all of this exact sequences that we've been looking at. And then, well, sort of trivial boundary cobortism sits inside this as a pullback of. This is a pullback of categories. So we get the same sort of multiple fiber. So we have a normal cobordism going into trivial boundary cobordism going to some sort of like trivial monoid. Maybe this is interesting in this kind of. Yeah, but maybe, well, the sadness that mentioned, Carmen, I don't, this, you, in one of those, your slides, you have that sunmap from the fundamental group of big coughs. Of big cough boundary to SK is trivial, so yeah, maybe that is the sad the sadness that yeah, that is the sadness. Yeah, that's exactly the same. Yeah, I don't think we quite understand this yet, or like what, yeah, but we haven't maybe thought it was thinking like. If I didn't want to feature any code, which would be different or when you have a feature, it's the assay of the difference. Strange behaviour of this changing memory as a good point for the communication, it will also just be standard media or the rights. Yeah, thank you. I had a question that was maybe also related to this. So, so yeah, I see it vanishes when you're having the like the PCUP with the trivial boundary. Did you think about or like what was motivating requiring it to be trivial boundary? Because like the, so I guess like the next or the picture that you showed with like the Genauer sequence, like that didn't have the trivial boundary component in the bordism direction, right? So yeah, it's it's So yeah, it it like sits inside this this it sits in uh it sits inside the whole boundary like trivial boundary sits inside the whole boundary so the the motivation I think for yeah like is a little bit no I'm too far yeah I think yeah that's that's one thing indeed like otherwise you don't if you change the boundary you don't preserve signal Boundary, you don't preserve signature because I mean, the group becomes trivial, right? Sk bar boundary with three-boundary cobordism would be trivial because this quotienting might free-boundary cobordism is trivial. More questions? Carlos, did you have a question? Okay. Okay, well, let's thank Renee again. Okay, well, let's thank Renee again. Thank you very much.
