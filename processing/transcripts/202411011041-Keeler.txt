And these are undesirable for a number of reasons, these waves, and they can cause erosion to riverbanks and they can also reduce fuel efficiency. And so, the kind of broad aim of this project is to see if we can choose the shape of this boat which can minimize these waves. Can we, in effect, produce a stealth boat? In terms of what's traditionally done, well, these Kelvin weights can be described, traditionally described as. Described traditionally described as a completely linear phenomena. And there is an incredible amount of literature on this. But up until recently, it's really mainly been on, as I said, a linear phenomenon. And this makes sense. I mean, from a computational perspective, the full three-dimensional problem is hard. And it's really only since the turn of the century and more recently in the last 10 years where people have started working on the fully non-linear Working on the fully non-linear problem from a computational viewpoint. So, with that in mind, how are we going to go towards modeling the non-linear problem? Well, we're going to start off with the weakly non-linear forced Kp problem equation. This is an equation for the three-surface eta in terms of some forcing function sigma, which I've highlighted here. And this sigma, it could represent some kind of external pressure distribution. External pressure distribution, a boat, or it could represent some kind of topographic forcing on the riverbed. This is derived from the Euler system under the assumptions of small amplitude, weakly three-dimensional. You can see here there's only this wide derivative on the right-hand side here, and the Frod number is close to one. So, this is quite a fast-moving body. And the game we're going to play here, the really kind of almost trivial game we're going to play, is Trivial game we're going to play is: can we choose this shape of this sigma force in which eliminates the Kelvin wake pattern? So, before we do that, it's really instructive to understand how Kelvin, linear Kelvin wakes are generated for a generic type of forcing. And this is well known in the literature, and it's basically this rather kind of straightforward three-step process. The first step is we're going to solve the linear problem, the steady linear problem. Problem: the steady linear problem using Fourier transforms, and we can do that and we write down the linear solution for the free surface in terms of this double Fourier integral. I've introduced polar coordinates here. For a generic force intern, this is kind of as good, we kind of have to stop here, but we can do some asymptotics in the far field to determine what the waves look like far downstream. And so, step two is we're going to identify. Step two is: We're going to identify the pole in this integrand, and that will allow us to do the contour integration for this first inner integral with respect to kappa. Our next stage, after doing that asymptotic approximation, is to look at this oscillatory term and do stationary space approximation. And after doing that, we can do the outer integral and we get this really neat kind of closed form asymptotic approximation for what the waves look like. An approximation for what the waves look like in the far field. So, what do I want to emphasize here? Well, the amplitude of these waves depends on the forcing. So, here sigma hat is the forcing in wave space. But crucially, the wave pattern doesn't. I've highlighted here in green because you know the exponential, the oscillatory term. The wave pattern does not depend on the term on the forcing, it's just the amplitude. And this is going to be crucial going. And this is going to be crucial going forward. So, what do these look like non-linearly? Well, we're going to benchmark our results by using a Gaussian forcing. And when we solve these numerically, we find there are two types of Kelvin waves. We get the subcritical ones, where we get these transverse waves going along in the Y direction, and also these divergent waves. Whereas for supercritical flow, we just get the divergent. Flow, we just get the divergent waves, and far downstream, we get this shadow region occurring. And this is great actually because this tells us that this force KP model equation, at least it's producing the qualitatively correct wave patterns, because this is what you would expect from the fully non-linear, fully, yeah, the Euler system. Jack, we can't see the bottom of your slides. No? Okay. Can you can you okay, I'll should I keep on going? Okay. Okay, should I keep on going? Okay. What you can't see the bottom of my slides? The very bottom is cut off. If you make it maybe full screen in a different way than it currently is, it's like the very last the box. Yeah, okay. That's okay. Sorry, sorry about that. We'll have to go from okay. Okay, so fundamentally, how do we get these waves produced? Um, how do we get these waves? How are these waves produced? Well, mathematically, it's really the existence of this pole on the real axis. That's what's causing these waves to produce. And fundamentally, if we have no pole, we have no waves. People, I'm going to go back to the presentation. I don't think I have much on the bottom of the slides anyway. It's just going to make it more confusing. So, can you see all of this? Yeah, I totally. Yeah, okay, great. So, let's go back to the so. Go back to the um, so we get no poles and we get no waves. Um, so let's so let's use this as a strategy to eliminate this Kelvin wake. So, here is my linear solution again. I'm going to write it down in Cartesian coordinates this time, unlike before. And this is almost like embarrassingly trivial now. We know that we can choose this however we like, because it's only going to affect the amplitude of waves, not the wave geometry. And so, the simplest way to choose this sigma is to just make it cancel out the denominator. Just make it cancel out the denominator on the bottom. That's where the pole is. And we're going to multiply it by this kind of arbitrary function f, which has to decay sufficiently in wave space. This is almost embarrassingly simple. And there are many choices which we can use for F hat, which can model a finite boat. For example, if we choose a simple Gaussian for our F hat and wave space, it really isn't difficult to show that when we substitute that. Difficult to show that when we substitute that into our Fourier integral, we get a second derivative of a Gaussian as our linear solution. And this is wave-free. In terms of the non-linear problem, this is the beauty of using the force Kp problem, is that we can write down an exact solution to the non-linear problem by just keeping the free surface as the linear free surface and then making a slight adjustment on the Adjustment on the top on their pressure on their force intern. So, what do these look like? Well, it's like a kind of one-minute MATLAB job. On the top row, we have the wave-free steady state, which is a second derivative of a Gaussian, whereas on the bottom, we have our special force in term, which is representing our boat or our topographic feature. So, really, I mean, this is this is this is, as I said before, this is almost embarrassingly trivial to derive these. But really, what we're looking at after this is, is it stable? And could we actually see it? Because really, this is the kind of more important thing. You can construct this very simply. Can we actually see it? And so, we're going to solve the fully non-linear time-dependent problem to see what happens. We can do this numerically. To start with, we're going to benchmark our. With, we're going to benchmark our results by again using a Gaussian forcing, similar to what Lord Kelvin did all that way back. And then when we run the simulations, we find that the system very quickly returns to this V-shape, which is exactly what you'd expect if we just chose a Gaussian forcing. We can be more exotic. We can choose dipole forcings. And again, when we run the simulations, we get this distinctive V-shape happening. And that's because the geometry. And that's because the geometry of the wave pattern is independent of this forcing. So now let's choose our clever forcing, which is like this. And before we press enter on our computer, we cross our fingers and hold our breath and see what happens. So initially, you think that this V-shaped wave pattern is going to occur. And then instead of the V-shape emerging, these waves kind of broaden out and you get these kind of Waves kind of broaden out, and you get these kind of circular ripples which get emanated far downstream. And then we test this within an inch of its life. And this is numerically converged to as sure as we can be. And this is remarkable, really, because this is really answering the question, is it stable? Well, the answer is numerically at least, we've got some pretty strong evidence to suggest that it is, which means that someone probably could design an experiment. Could design an experiment to model this. So, the main results really are that we found this wave-free steady state and it's stable. We can also show, so these are results very hot off the press, so we can show that this happens in the fully non-linear 3D Euler system as well. And really, the key question is: do we see these in real life? Thanks for listening. And apologies for the.
