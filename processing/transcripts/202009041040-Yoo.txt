So I'm a little bit tired, but let's start. Let A be the over the rational, and by the model-based theorem, the group of relational points is finitely general of relational torsion points. This is what I want to study, and so the motivational question. So, the motivational question is: Can we compute the rational torsion subgroup of A for any abelian bright defined over Q? And well, the dimension one case is easy. And that is all if the elliptic curve is given, then the group of rational trucks and point is one of these 15 groups. This is proved by Like is the main object in the generalization of this type of question is so let A be an abelian variety of a Q of dimension at least two and then how can we compute this group of relational torsion point Tossion point. This question is difficult in general. So if you have, like, for instance, the abelian variety over Q of dimension, for instance, 100, then how can we compute this group of rational torsion point? And however, if A is somehow modular Jacobian variety, I mean the Jacobian variety of the modular curve, then there are some known. Then there are some known leaders. Let's talk about here. Maybe the B n, B of N in the true shadow, which are upper triangular modular N and X t of N be the modular curve. The group of rational torsion points of J0 n is actually equal to the group of cospital group, the group generated by the image of degree zero cospital dividers. This conjecture is only for n, which is a prime. So when n is a prime, our major proved that A major proof that this is in fact true in 1977 is this conjecture for arbitrary n what actually he proved first this gender the group of rational torsion point Torture point to this cosplay group. And then he studied the Eisenstein distance, and Eisenstein quotient has a model variable zero. And then he proved that this x-star of the set of rational points on x-star of n is actually finite. At that time, he doesn't know the model's conjecture. And then he proved this. He proved this x1 and the rational points of x1 and is consist of consist of only cost so here so what is the generalization of oaks for any positive integer n there are possible integer n the possible generalization is the job n is actually equal to the rational points of the cospira group but the problem of this conjecture is that the left-hand side is very hard to compute we don't know how to compute it but if we know the this conjecture there is still some chance to compute this group by computing this cosplay group and then finding the And then finding the rational point of this cosplay group. But this is still difficult. If the n is large enough, then I don't know what is the order of this group. Yeah. And I propose the following and let C of N be the rational cost parallel divided by class group of X0. Subgroup of J0 N generated by the image of the rational cospital divisor, which means you know the absolute colour group of Q. So this rational cospital group consists of points, which is rational point, which does not mean it is the image of the rational cosplay dividers. It is just cospital dividers. It is just cosplay dividers, and the image turns out to be rational after the in the Jacobian. So, this true statement is different. And in fact, the C of N is actually a subgroup of this group. By definition, when n is the type of two to the r of scale m one two three then all costs defined over q so in that case these two groups are equal and recently uh wang and yang proved that these two groups are equal. That these two groups are equal when n is of the very specific form, which is not sphere-free. Anyway, so combining these two, what I want to propose is this thing. So we want to prove these two groups are equal, and then, or equivalently, for any these two. These two groups are equal. So for the experience, when this equality holds. So the conjecture, just say just conjecture O for mean I mean O and for any indig in particular integer n and a prime L a pair n comma A pair n, l is og valid. That's all I want to prove. So if I prove this thing, then that's these two conjectures follow. So digression. So in this conjecture, we don't know how to compute this right-hand side. But Is we know how to compute this rep that and so this L primary part of rational cross-parallel I found some very specific generator of this Some very specific generator of this group, and then I prove they are all like somehow orthogonal to each other, and they span this whole group. Excuse me, Hua Xiao? Yes. We're having a hard time hearing you, and I was going to suggest that you might try turning off your video, and that might give a little more bandwidth to your audio. Okay. I mean, fortunately, your slides are great, so that's helping us a lot. But if maybe I us a lot but if maybe if i could ask you to just go back to the last slide because i think you were saying something quite interesting about uh the ease or difficulty of proving uh both sides and i'd like to hear that again okay from can you hear me yes we can hear you okay in this In this conjecture, yes, in this conjecture, we don't know how to compute the right-hand side as well. Like, we don't know the left-hand side, definitely, we don't know. And in this, if we believe this conjecture, and then what I want to say is we can actually compute this C of n for arbitrary n. And that's the That's what I proved last year. And this is there, there is actually a very specific generator to describe in that case. And I know how to compute the and they spend this this order is very Actually, some product of this type of integers and then the numerator. And this because this L primary part, so we take the valuation and then exponent of L. So anyway, what I want to say is the structure of this L primary subgroup of rational cospital divider class group. Tibet class group is known. So if we actually prove this conjecture, then we know the L primary subgroup of rational torsion subgroup. So let's review all the known results. First, major proof that primes n and l. That's what I want to say. That's what I want to say. And then next, maybe if the 125, then this conjecture is true. And then later, Rowering proved that when n is the prime power, and this prime is not congruent to 11 modulus, and then this is true for all other prime L different from P. Prime L different from P. And later, Ling proved that this assumption is superfluous, but he cannot prove the N equals 3. So this what after more than 10 years, OTA proved that this n comma L is all valid for any scale. For any unscale integer natural. And I proved some missing case and level is three times p and l equal to three, but this is not quite happy. But anyway, later Len proved that n, l is og valid if l does not divide this number. not divide this number and in that case the ref the group of rational torsion point does not have this l primary points except zero so and joshia also proved some specific case and if you use a computer you may prove some a small but that there is not for instance i mean the general result i want to prove some more kind of general To prove some more kind of general legality, what is the main theorem of this talk is for any positive integer n, a pair n, l is og valid if l squared does not divide this 12 times n. So all arbitrary integer n. And my proof, so this contains the result of Lorentzian ending. Of Lorenzini ending, and my proof is completely different from theirs. And I think, yeah, let's talk about the proof. Before proceeding, I want to remark some on the assumption. I use I use this assumption when L is odd and L. The Akinen involution introduced in I use the Akuneno involutions. So this OTAS idea use the fact OTAS idea. The fact uh Ota's idea used to the fact L is odd, so this excludes the case equal to and L s k if l squared does divide the level n, then the modular curve over F L is not semi-stable. So it has it has so the Jacobian the special fiber of the narrow model of Model of very complicated. So it has actually unipotent part, and I don't know how to analyze this narrow model. So in the assumption L squared does not divide the level n, then the geometry of this narrow model is rather simple. So I can use the previous result, and that's what I use. That's what I use in the proof. So let's move on. For simplicity, let B n is the group of rational torsion point of job n. And by my intrinsic theorem, the image of cospital divider is always torsion. So, So this rational torsion possible division is always rational torsion. So C of n is a subgroup of B of n and so and idea so when p exactly divides the level n, then level n, then we can use Akinen operator instead of Heke operator. So that is very crucial in my proof as well. So let's introduce various notations. And S0 of n is the set of primes which does not divide n, the level. The level. And S1 of n is the prime exactly and S2 of n denotes the set of primes whose square so and T P and T and t involution for with respect to p and t of n is the hecke algebra generated by the hecke operators primes in s0 and s2 not s1 and then the we add arcane involutions for such primes so this generated by So this generated by such operators in the endomorphism ring of J0 M and T L is the just localization and what is the major idea to study this rational when p does not divide the level then by Does not divide the level then by Ikloshmura on a map at P plus the dual of flobinous operator on the special fiber of Jacobian variety. And then this rational points, rational torsion points, maps injectively to the special fiber, so you can. Special fiber, so you can actually this rational point the provenance operator acts trivially, so you get this tp minus p minus one annihilates this group of rational torsion points. So he the meaning of Eigenstan idea comes from that this way two Eigenstan series, the eigenvalue is one plus p. And for any positive integer n, let this i generate by all primes in S0 and the Tp minus P minus 1. So by this theorem, this module is actually T mod I module. This module is T mod use this completion. This is semi. Completion, this is semi-local, so we can decompose as a product of all kinds of the local links. And then we decompose this module into the that this module has also has the decomposition with respect to this strategy to prove this theorem is that first. Theorem is that first he computes the order of the C of cospital group, say n. And in this case, n minus 1 generalization of his strategy is just compute this order and compute the dimension of this eta part. The dimension of this actile part. And in the first two steps, then this sum of cos one over T L mod I. And so it is quite big as a T L mod I module. And the step three means if this Three means if this if the dimension is one, then set of the rational torsion points maps to this module after taking the corner of n. So it is actually free n most length one. If this is one, then this module is also and And this is already full of length one and submarine, so they are actually equal. This is the basic strategy is generalize, approve this all like steps. So let me explain the autas work. Ota's contribution is he used Akinen operator instead of Hecke operator, and he compute and he computes that this dimension is actually one using this strategy so I Let me rational Eigenstein primes. If M is paining sub L, then it has very specific eigenvalue. For instance, because WP is involved. Because Wp is involution, so all eigenvalues are either plus one or minus one. And TQ for Q in S2, which means Q squared divided the level. In that case, the eigenvalue could be 0 or 1 or Q. This 0 is like, if you, yeah, as you know, the new form whose New form whose label is divisible by q squared, then the eigenvalue is zero exactly divide the label, then a q eigenvalue is one or q in the eigenstein case. So meaning kind of from new form uh from new form and one and cure maybe old form. Maybe all the values. And this TA is semi-locally, we have such a decomposition. And this maximal ideal is of the like this very specific form. So let assign of this. This and then job epsilon alpha q and consider this eigenstein idea contains all eigenvalues. Eigenvalues for so in that case, this idea containing all these eigenvalues, then we can compute the index. So I actually computed this index up when L squared does not divide 4n. divide 4n. I explicitly compute this index. And we can also, if L squared does not divide 12n, which is our assumption, then we can prove that the dimension of this so we can prove this corner prove Prove the L primary part of B and L primary part of C are proof. And if you take the corner of this Eisenstein idea, which is somehow we add these two specific maybe various conditions, then this after apply such an operation, then you get the same thing. And then how to get And how to get how to kind of remove this some functions? What I have to do. Suppose that n is square free. In this case, and so this j of epsilon is like that, this very specific form. And this is involution either this hole since any element cannot both belong to the maximal ideal. So one is belongs to the maximal ideal and the other is not. So in this local link, one One of them is uni. So you can invert, and then you get this operator actually zero in this local link. That's very crucial in this decomposition. So in this quotient, these elements actually in this here without any. Dear without any elements like that primes, TP minus P minus one for the primes not dividing the level. So that if this eigenstein ideal contains all the eigenvalues, then we can compute the index and blah blah blah. But if not, then But if not, then we cannot like proceed. So, if you use Achinena involution, then we may proceed in these ways. This idea actually contains all compute so we can do that. So we decompose in these modules and then as above we can prove this thing position you get actually equality of this module and this module. That's what we want to prove. This is generalize this to arbitrary level. Die better. What is the EG theorem? It's because we have in general level n, we have operator tq for q in s2. So which means q squared divided the level. And we don't know the eigenvalue of tq in the whole like Eigenstein idea, but we let's take this. Idea, but we restrict this case, restrict to this. This is epsilon is just an ideal generated by TQ in this idea and J zero. And J0 is without this Akineno involutions. Then we say a pair is auto-valid if this quotient, this number is prime to L and the dimension equal one. This is what I ex major strategy. If This proof is almost the same as this OTAS strategy move this condition and what Ota did, he The idea, like this type of ideas. And what I have to do is, I have to, I want to remove these some conditions. And my strategy is kind of this inductive argument. Suppose that n over p, l is all valid for any prime p in any prime p in s2 and suppose further that this n comma l is auto valid this is kind of the inductive step for instance like n is times some another prime p then this is true by otas Otter's work and statement like this true statement we can if we can prove this true statement which is relatively easy then the result follow excuse me we're yeah we're running we're running a little bit tight on time i'm just going to suggest that maybe you uh skim over the proof of this sorry sorry i focus So I forgot. I I thought I sorry, I I already over time. So the idea is how to operator I use such a thing. So you can see my slide. I wrote Jean, are you speaking or are you done speaking? Thank you very much. So you can see my slide. So I didn't know I kind of I didn't know. I kind of misunderstood the time. Sorry. No, that is quite all right. And we are so grateful for you staying up.
