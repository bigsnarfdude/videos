Thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. So, basically, what I want to talk today is about higher geometry, in particular higher simple geometry. So, there are for me three different worlds that have to do with physics, another world that have to do with geometry, and another world that have to do with geography. And another world that has to do with such a and probably this is the first one that appeared in the literature and when I talk about physics here I'm talking about whatever said or n human false. Here in the geometry side I will talk about the group points And in the algebra side, we have maybe derived differential stacks or n stacks or whatever, or hyperstacks. And what happens is that these three walls are not completely independent, so they are related. So they are related and or they are conjecturally related, let's say. And the way that you pass from Lie-group points to Q-manifolds is by differentiation. So basically there is a Lie factor that gives you the infinitesimal object of a Lie group point. That's supposed to be a Q manifold. And this supposed as well that giving a Q manifold, you can integrate. You can integrate it to a LieN drupoid. And then the way that you pass from Lie and Drupal to differential stacks is here, you think into Morita class. And the other way around is like you think as stacks or Lie groupers to be at the las for hydrostatics. And the And the takeaway of this picture is that all these four arrows, as far as I know, they deserve some explanation. They are not easy to... or they deserve some clarification. So there are ways of passing from one to the other, more or less explain it heuristically, but if you give me some of these concretely, normally it's difficult to produce one of these and if you give me one of these to produce. And you can leave me one of these to produce one of these. So in that, Chris Rocher will talk more about this side in the next talk. So what I want to point here is that the three worlds have a symplectic notion or have many symplectic notions that you can put, for example, here, and I will say that this is a PSC or basically S-bars or Or basically, as bars or physics, we're putting symplectic structures on Q manifolds. That's known. Here, I will note Getzler as the one that put it here symplectic structures on Ilian groupoids. And here, for example, we have the work of PTB, Fanten Torf, Becky, and Mesochi. I want to say that there are more than one option to put in each side. So there are different kinds of symplectic structures that you can put on Q manifolds with different compatibilities. I will try just to talk about one of them. And then the takeaway of this diagram is just that one needs to be a bit careful from passing through one of the worlds to the other. So the goal of today So the goal of today so the goal is basically give examples of these symplectic things of symplectic on AMB. So here on CD I will not say Here on C I will not say so much. I'm not an expert there, but I can say something on the A world and on the B world. And that's basically what I want to present today. And basically, there is one example of symplectic manifold that we all know. That is, if I have a manifold, I just can go to the potential bundle of that manifold, and that gives me a symplectic manifold. So, in some way, So, in some way, that simple acting manifold is the most relevant, even for physics, for the mechanics, for whatever, for groupoids. As well, we have the cotangent groupoid that we know that is interesting to do quotient representation. And even more, we can do symplective reduction on a cotangent bundle to produce new examples of symplectic manifolds. So, somehow, cotangentially. Somehow, cotangent bundles here and here is what I want to highlight of examples. Okay, so let me try to start in the A world to be a bit more detailed. So Q manifolds. So what is a Q manifold? A degree and Q manifold. Q manifold MQ is a pair such that this M is also a pair. It's a rigid space here satisfying that locally this shift. This shift can be just given by the functions on my open. This u is an open here. And then I have the symmetric algebra, the graded symmetric algebra of some vector space B and this B is concentrated, let's say, in degree one to n, and these two n's are the same. are ten here and this is ten here that I have and then what one can say is that locally I can use coordinates so this say infinity of u looks like just the say infinity of u attached with some Some extra variables, and these new extra variables are just formal variables satisfying that they commute or skill commute according of degree that you put them. And it's J. I hear J, I'm sorry. Right, so basically the only way to think of these q manifolds, or one of the possible ways, is just that you enlarge your definition of functions to adding new fermionic variables that they commute or skill commute according to degree. This is why they are fermionic possible. Now I need, I just defined this part, so I need to define the q. For that, I need Q. For that, I need to recall that I will denote the vector fields on my manifold, and these are, by definition, just the derivations of degree i of same infinity fm. So recall that an element here is just something that will its two functions minus one degree of minus one degree of f degree of x that is i in this case and this is g and this fg are just functions here so in other words I can locally as well describe this so if I have my coordinates this same thing in the these vector fields on M are Are locally expanded by the vector fields that are partial, partial psi i as a symphony model. Okay, then what is a Q manifold is just so the Q is Is something that is a vector field of degree 1 on my m such that squares to 0. That is the same thing as saying that the computer of the vector field itself is equal to 0. Observe that this is non-trivial because right now since this half degree one, this is just exactly twice the q squared as you probably know. As you probably know. So, this thing basically, what is doing this Q-manifold, is just a homological setting. So, we are having something that looks like the symmetric of some vector space or some vector bundle, and then we are putting a differential over there. I think that more or less this is standard, so let me just right now enlarge this with the symplectic structure over. The symplectic structure over there so a symplectic UMIF is just a triple and then I put here the omega but many times I will switch between omega and their bracket and I have that this thing. This thing is a Q manifold, and then this bracket is just a quasi bracket. So let's say a Q manifold of degree n and then I have my Poisson bracket that have also, I will assume here that the two degrees are coincident, so i plus j minus n of m, and this satisfies. Of m and this satisfies the useful thing. So graded skew symmetry, skew symmetry, graded delay needs and graded Jacobi. So this is the standard thing, and then I will require that this symplectic, so locally there There exist coordinates such that the matrix of Ci Cj is invariable. So you can ask, is D by D psi i, does it have degree zero? Yeah, so that's a really good question. So how is this thing defined? D d of psi i. d epsi i of epsi j this is delta i j and therefore that forced me that the degree of the epsi i is equal to minus the degree of epsilon but so you denoted by xi i coordinates of positive degree right i'm denoting so now you have to cool degree zero coordinates along the way so let's say that that xi's will be That F size will be all the corporate. Yeah. So this filtration of the X i's, it does negative degrees actually. So these things, so yeah. So let's say that I have these coordinates, but I'm also denoting by by f psi the coordinates on on my manifold then, and then I I'm just denoting by f psi all the coordinates. By that side, all the coordinates. So, this, if my manifold have degrees 0 to n, it have generators in minus n to 0 by just adding the extra coordinates here. A bit confusing to call them also Ïˆ i's. Maybe you should call them xi's or something. Yeah. So you have to go on your qi's. Go the set of all the coordinates. All the coordinates. I mean, it's all. Okay, yeah, yeah, it's all the QIs include now also the XII. Yeah, and the Xi's. Yeah, so Qi so the set of Qi are the Xi plus the Psi I. Okay. So what I have here is just basically locally that this is invertible. I can define it in another way, saying that something from the tangent to the potangent is an isomorphism. But I think that this local expression probably is easier. And then there is a compatibility with the symplectic structure and the and the symplectic and the q. The symplectic and the Q structure. That is just that the Q is a derivation of the symplectic structure. Okay, so basically this is the main definition on the A side, this symplectic Q may hold. And now, probably you already saw it: this fancy table that always appears saying. Saying that if n is equal to 0, this is just a symphlectic manifold. If n is equal to 1, this is a Poisson manifold. And if n is equal to 2, you have a current algebra. Are symplectic manifolds not particular cases of possible manifolds? Yeah, they are, but the way that you saw with them into this hierarchy is different. So basically here, what you see is that any one manifold that have a symplectic structure should be the cotangent of a usual manifold with the canonical symplectic structure, and then the Q because And then the Q becomes a function of degree 2 that is just the Poisson structure. So, probably you already saw with this table, well, the question is, is there something else in this galaxy? Is there anyone interesting? So, we created a whole theory to nothing, or we can do already anything. Okay, so what I want to present today is the easiest case of going higher that is just to That is just to try to see higher potential bundles of other objects, and then we will try to see if they are interesting or not. But minimum, we have the possibility to say that there is something. Okay, so suppose that I start with my Q net also. So, right now, what I do. Right now for that. So I have my Q manifold not half degree n so now I assume that the coordinates here are my qi okay the objective now is that for k greater or equal than n we can define Define this shifted potangent bundle of my manifold M with the canonical symplectic structure and it have also a Q structure here that is a lift of that. So that's what I want to define. So the first definition is using coordinates So, the coordinates of this new manifold Qi Pi that are the delta delta of Qi but right now what I do is I change the degree of the Pi and I put it in the minus degree of Qi plus Of qi plus k. So, what I'm saying is that the manifold that I'm defining, if I have a manifold, I have a new manifold with this kind of coordinates, and the p's have this degree, but the p's are not arbitrary. If I change the coordinates q, I know how the coordinates p change, because they are dels of the coordinates q. And then I can. And then I can define all the structures Qi, Pi, Pj is delta Ij. So this is the canonical. And then the other ones are zero. This is probably zero. And then the Q part of Qi I'm just defining. I'm just defining as Q of Qi and then what Q half of the Pi's this is just Q with partial partial Qi where this is the usual bracket of petrospace so what I'm saying here so the thing that I'm saying is that So the thing that I'm saying is that this is easy. But this, I think again the P's as partials, then apply the bracket of vector fields that give me another vector field, and then the partials then convert it into p again. So that's how the physics think this quadrant bundles. And then let me try to give an invariant description That is that the functions in this cotential bundle of my manifold M, this is just the graded symmetric algebra of my vector fields on M, but I'm shifting them by k. So that means that So that means that if this was in degree, so and this explains why I just can't define it for k greater than n if I'm working on n manifolds. Because if these have negative degree minus n at most, then I'm shifting here and I'm putting them in positive degrees because the k is greater than n. So this is what I'm doing. Then I have something in positive. Then I have something in positive degrees and then I'm just taking the symmetric algebra of this thing. So those are the functions. The canonical thing become the shifted Scouten bracket. So this is the Scouten bracket but shifted and then my Q hat is just the lead derivative of Q. The lead derivative of Q. So this lead derivative is just Q acting on this. So this symmetric algebra, this graded symmetric algebra, I need to think them as multi-vector fields on my original manifold but shifted. Therefore, this is why this is the scalp bracket. And what I have here is like the least derivative with that q that half degree 1 because this q half degree 1. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. Hi, Tima here. So you're basically saying that your Q hat is the Hamiltonian lift of Q? Exactly. Yeah, that's. Don't you want to add a magnetic term? Something that only depends on. I I will say that in a moment. Okay. So the thing is that if I start with a Q manifold, I'm always kind defined this thing. I'm always kind defined this thing, but as you are saying, I can twist it as well. And I will explain that in a moment. So thank you. So is there any question? So this is basically the most important definition of this site, this cotangent bundles. And right now is just to arrange examples of these objects to see what they codify. So So, you see, already what we are doing here is just we already have symplectic manifolds on all the degrees, maybe the trivial ones that are the Kodanche bundles. And now the point is: okay, these descriptions are like classical. So, can we do a classical description of these objects? It is my earlier question. So, if you use syntactic, can you do this construction to include them? Construction to include them or yeah, if I see symplectic as Poisson, the only thing that I'm doing is just inverting, and then I have a degree one manifold that is basically the cotangent or the tangent of that. Is that a quick question? Sure. So when you just take the cotangent bundle of sort of the ordinary smooth manifold, that somehow comes up with its own syntactic structure, as we already. Syntactic structure, but you already need to assume that the base has it, the Q or so I can assume that half the Q's, the zero structure. So let me do this case then. And then we saw it, what happens. So examples. So as Charlotte was suggesting, Lot was suggesting, I just can consider M e fall M that sits in degree zero and therefore since I don't have vector fields of degree one, this is a perfect valid Q manifold. And then for these objects, I can define T star k of m for all the k that are greater or equal than zero and then And then I have here the canonical, and then LQ that is this Q hat is again 0. So what happens is that for K equal to 0, I just obtain the usual cotangent bundle of my manifold. And here I have like a structure. Structure, twist, and Lagrangians and some associated field theory. So here I don't have any possible twists because I also don't have vector fields of degree one. The Lagrangians are usual Lagrangians and then the And then the field theory is classical mechanics or mechanics. Then for k equal to 1, what I have is that I see this as the tangent of my manifold with the canonically algebraic structure. And then the possible twists on this case are just. This case are just quasi structures. So, this is the example that we have it on k equal 1. Because it happens that any symplectic Q manifold will be the cotangent of a usual manifold. That's what I was saying. So, this is just, if you want, T star one. Okay? And then all the possible key structure. All the possible Q structures are Poisson structures there because it's the functions of degree 2 that I have here that are the same as Hamiltonian vector fields over there. And then the Lagrangians here are quisotropic some manifolds and the field theory is the Poisson sigma model. And for hierarchy, what I have Have great or equal than two is that these codangents here apparently they are a bit uninteresting even though they have some interesting features. I don't have any twist again and here the Lagrangian Q submanifolds are just some manifolds. So these are Q Lagrangians. So they are compatible with Q. So manifolds and the field theory I don't know what. The field theory, I don't know what field theory they have associated. Probably some higher thing that maybe can have some topological interest. I don't know. Yeah. I sort of think in k equals 1 that it should be t star and 0. Yeah, so that's always the same thing. So I can think that this corresponds to a symplectic manifold. Or a symplectic manifold, if you want, or rather. You see, this is theta star. So, what I'm doing here is really looking at this as a vector bundle. And you can look into the cotangent with the canonical symplectic form and the zero bracket and the zero Q structure. So, this thing is codified in the symplectic form and the Q structure. The Q structure is always zero. And if you dualize, it's And if you dualize, it happens that the bracket is. So there is this duality between degree 1 Poisson and Lyalge approach, or Q manifolds and Lie Algebra. And I prefer it just to denote it as a aspect. Does that answer your question? So if you want, they can say probably something else. So T one M is just the manifold that have M as a manifold and here are really multi-vector fields on M as their functions. And it have this canonical bracket that really goes to the usual scouting. Really goes to the usual scouting bracket of my manifold. And the Q structure that I have, since I'm lifting something, is just the siever structure. So that means that I can say that this thing corresponds to a Lie algebra that is the tangent Lie algebra, or I can say that this thing corresponds to a symplectic manifold that is the cotangent of a symplectic manifold. And now, why the Poisson structures have the twist? Because I can pick any degree two functions here that are just like vector fields, and then they should satisfy theta theta equals zero. And this is just a degrado function, so this should be a pi. And that's telling you a disposal. And those are all the possible twists. I don't have anything that's not there. I think that's what we are. Okay, so let's go to the second example that is Allie algebraid. So suppose that I start with a Lie algebra and then this, I can see it as a Q manifold just by making A shifted by 1Q and therefore I can consider for example I can consider for k greater or equal than 1 all these manifolds. Cotangent k of a1 with the canonical symplectic form and this lifted potential that are just lead derivative in the direction of k. So let's see what I have here. So, I have again the same table, structure, twist pure granchuans and the fifth area. So, for k equal to one, what I have here is just Here is just the dual of my Lie algebra with the linear Poisson structure. That's what this manifold is codifying. If you want something more concrete, this is even codifying this BB algebra. So this BB algebra is the one that is codified by T star1 of A1, that is. And just summarizing here as this. The possible two is that I don't know. I was trying to compute it yesterday, does not succeed. Probably it was too late. So the Lagrangian sub-manifolds are linear, isotropic. isotropic that these are the same as Lie algebra on the dual or sorry Lie sub-algebraids on A and this field corresponding the field theory is like a linear Poisson symbol this is the first This is the first thing that we already have it. So you see, it's just that I'm adding some linear thing, but this is again the cotangent of a one-manifold. So yeah, that's right. For k equal to two, what this thing is codifying is A plus A star, that is the current algebraic. Term that is the current algebra. And right now I'm just showing the current algebra as you have a Lie algebra and you can take the double with the zero Poisson with the zero Lie algebra here. So this is the double as a Liebi algebra where you put the zero algebraic structure on the dual. And then all the possible twists are the so-called this process. The so-called this proto Levi algebraids. So I have Levi algebraids and I have twisted quasi-Levy algebraids and I have even a more general thing of that. The sub-objects here are the Dirac structures. So this includes what this includes. This includes what this includes in the case of the standard current algebra are presyncic and Poisson. So here I'm saying Dirac structures. So in this conference we saw with just Dirac structures on Tm plus T star M. I'm using Dirac structures by something that is the same button A plus A star. And here this is something calling the current sigma model. Something calling the current sigma model that is a three-dimensional field theory. And now for k equal to 3, I have this thing here that is as well a higher current algebra and that I will do as together with k bigger than 3. So in general, you will have k minus 1. k minus one of a star so this is our higher current algebraic and the only difference on these two cases are the possible twist so here the possible twist is a three-form plus a vector bundle metric And here all the possible twists are just closed K plus one forms. So these are not independent. There are coherent conditions between these structures and the Lie algebraic structure as well. But this is suggested, well, I will say it in a moment. So here we have higher Dirac structures. And this includes, as particular case, of closed K forms and on the other side, the generalization of Poisson that are Nambu structures. And here, the kind of theory that you have is a BF-like theory. And what is interesting here is that since you have a vector bundle metric, in this degree 3 case you have a four-dimensional 4D TQFT and if you use this vector bundle metric you can try to include gravity. And Catanio was and his students were really studying this kind of relation, so it's quite interesting. Of relation, so it's quite interesting. So, the picture is that for a Lie algebra, I have all these higher current algebraids that fit together. And well, it's a bit disappointing to see that the higher Dirac structures are somehow a bit restrictive, but it is what it is. I cannot say another thing. I can say that there are other works, for example, by Enrique Burstin, trying to do other work. In trying to do other approaches to higher Dirac structures that includes other things, but I think that this is the most conceptual one, including in a big framework. So what kind of equations does this actual model matching satisfy? Yeah, so the kind of thing that it satisfies is that you are on a Lie algebra and these things, you saw it as a twist here. As a twist here, and it satisfies something like right now, all the possible twists are like the h, that is the three-form, plus the q, plus the metric, and you want this equal to zero. And if I okay, if I don't remember, if I remember well, Melchior Gruzman was doing something. Grossman was doing something called like twisted Lie algebra H or something like that, and he already find this kind of equations. So it's a compatibility between the age, the metric, and the key. I can say it later or precess, but these are the kind of... Yeah, maybe you could tell me more later because I would like to see it classically what our colleague actually short. Okay, so this is the picture that one finds there. I want to. I want to say another thing. So we have a handler. Right now we studied the current sigma model here for Levi algebraids, when we include here Levy algebraids just. And then we find that there's a dimensional reduction between the current sigma model here of the Levy algebra and the Poisson sigma model of the Poisson group point that integrates that Levy algebra. So you reduce one. So, you reduce one. So, this is a 3D field theory, this is a 2D field theory, you can pass from one to the other. So, that's also another interesting statement. Okay, let me say something. Oh, okay, sick, but on time, but anyway, let me try to say something on the higher things so. The third example that I want to include is suppose that I have MQ, a degree and Q manifold. Then I have this one, this particular one, I want to consider right now. So just the cotangent bundle, but instead of degree. But instead of degree n, degree n is the minimum that I can take, I take degree n plus 1. And then what is interesting here is that the twist of LQ are in one-to-one correspondence with omotopi-poason structures on my manifold. So this is a work. Manifold of them. So, this is a work that was done by Rush. And then, how you see this is that all the possible twists are thetas that are functions of degree m plus 2 on your cotangent of m plus 1 of your m, such that satisfy this theta theta equal to 0. And what happens is that these functions decompose as just decomposed as just functions of degree n plus two and m, vector fields of degree one on your manifold m, bivector fields of degree minus n on your manifold m, and so on. So your theta will look like h plus your original q, that's what you put in degree one. So this h leaf here, the q leaf there. The Q lives there. Then you have a pi 2 living here, and so on, a pi 3, blah blah blah. And then the equation, this equation will tell you the homotopy equations for the higher query conditions. So the important example of this is that so the important motivation of this example Of this example, or one of the motivations to study this, is that if you start with n omega q, a symplectic q manifold of degree n. Then I pick a Lagrangian, here Q Lagrangian, and then the wasting tubular And the Wainstein tubular, so this QLA branch I satisfied that covers all M. This is not strange. So the only thing that I'm saying here is that I have, for example, a Dirac structure that do not have support. So this is quite standard. And then what happens is that the Wainstein tubular neighborhood, it identifies me. It identifies me this thing the other way around. So I can identify this codangian bundle with L. The fact that it's covering, it doesn't have to support, it guarantees me that this cell is a degree n minus one manifold, so I'm in the previous case, and therefore what it happens is that the formation The formations of L are encoded by Maurekartan elements of the homotopy Poisson structure. So what happens is that the Q that you have here, then under this isomorphism, becoming Q on this codangent bundle. The L is n minus 1, so I'm in this case. So the Q. I mean this case. So the Q becomes an homotopy Poisson structure, and therefore this omotopy Poisson structure determines an L-infinity algebra and the deformations of these Lagrangians are more recartent elements of this homotopy Poisson structure. So in particular the formations of the RAC structures we saw with yesterday are encoded by Are encoded by these things, or this is a work of Markov theory, it's called Almanicho. So they didn't make it in this language, but this is what they, the meaning of their deformations of the agrastructures. And the second example that I want to say is that if I have a current algebra, the Poisson vertex algebra of a current algebra. Was some vertex algebra of a current algebraic that is this manifold maps from P1 S1 into my current algebra. This as well have a motopoission structure. Okay, so this is everything that I want to say, and I say it already too much, about this world of Q manifolds. So let me shift right now to the symplectic world to see what happens later. So for Lie and group points, so let me say that the starting point here is as simplish manifold. So this is just, I can think it as a factor from the From the category of finite ordinals to the category of my manifolds. So I have just a manifold for each number and then I have the phase and degeneracy. So there. And there are two important simplicial sets that I want to consider is just the simplicial. Here is just the simplicial simplex that this half just goes from here to here and satisfy that ADFJ or ISO and J. And then I have the hormon that is a subset of the simple shadow. Of the simplicity of the simplex, and it satisfies this thing. So I have j minus 1, then j plus 1 L. And what I demand is that this is not contained on this set here. So okay, so this whole thing is a little bit different. Okay, so this horn what it's doing is just taking on the L simplex the J phase and the interior of the L simplex and that's the geometric interpretation and this is the mathematical corporation. And now what a Lian group point is Lian group point is just a simplicial manifold, K And then it satisfies that this whole projections, so I have Lj, that goes from the home of the simplicial L simplex into K. So this is just nothing else than K L and this goes on the home of the horn L J of K and the Okay, and the demanding to be a Lien groupoid is that these are surjective submersion always and a diffeos for j less or equal than n and this end greater than n. So this end here, so this Okay? So this end here is this end. So the first thing is that if you heard about, okay, let me say one more word, that is what is a Lian group. So if k0 is equal to a point, this is just a Lian group. So if you heard So if you heard previously before about League groups, that I think that you heard it, so I think that this year is 150 years of the Erlang-Grem program of Felix Klein, so we know about Lie groups pretty well, is that this definition of Lie groups, it doesn't seem like you have something like a multiplication or higher multiplication and things like that. So where are these kind of things encoded? These kind of things are encoded that this condition This condition guarantees me that on the level n, I have an energy operation that is completely fulfilled. But that's the only thing that I have there. And then all the other things are like, you know, implicit on this definition. The fact that this is objective means that at the level n I can always find something, and the submersion thing is what gives you the leap on this definition. On this definition. So, do not worry if this definition looks a bit strange. I think that Chris Roger will highlight it in his talk better than me. So, let me try to give a basic example of how much time do I have, the minutes? Great. So, the basic example is So the basic example is just if I have a Lie group, this is a Lie1 group. So G Lie group. I'm just thinking on the nerve of G and that gives me a Lie1 group. Another example is if I have a graded vector space, then I can take Bj equal to the sum, so this is I equal to 0 to N. is i equal to 0 to n, the sum of this, of bi, and then how many copies I put, this j over i copies of this, and then I can define interface maps here. This is another example, this is an abelian example of a higher level. And now let's go for the symplectic notion. So in order to define symplectic, recall that since I have a symplectic Recall that since I have a simplicial manifold, what I have is a double complex of the round double complex. And then the simplicial objects here, the phase and the generacies, so the phase maps, just give me the delta, that is the simplicial differential, and then on this direction I have the ramp differential and then the total complex. This was delta minus i. This is the minus i of D. And then asymplectic, so let me, so this is important definition, so an M shifted symplectic L and groupoid is just a K with an omic. With an omega, and this omega lift where is a collection of sum of elements from 0 to my m of omega i, and this omega i live in between 2 plus m minus i of k i. And then to be as simple as this should satisfy that is what normalized Normalize, what is normalized? This is just a technical condition that is the pullback via all the degeneracy maps is equal to zero. I have a closed form that's easy. We already have a candidate. And non-degenerate, and this is the difficult one. So, in order to define non-degenerate, I need to define the tangent complex of a DNA. Tangent complex of a DN group point, and the tangent complex at the level L. So, this is a complex of vector bundles over my zero part. So, this is the kernel of T over L of restricted to K0. And then the differential here is just the last phase map, T and then by the definition. And then by the definitions, since we are asking that these are defaults for L greater than n, it guarantees me that this complex is just concentrated in degree n to 0. And then I can define what is being non-degenerate. So suppose that I have an element in my tangent complex. On degree i, another element on degree j, then I can define this i am paywidth that is just the sum over all shuffles of ij of minus one, the shuffle omega m of t sigma minus one the two sigma sigma minus i minus i of my b and then I have the other shaft of string I arrive sigma zero of my W and then this pairing is a pairing on the tangent complex so this tangent complex has a differential so what I divide is that this defines This defines a non-degenerate pairing on the common chain of the tangent complex. So I understand that this not so easy definition, but it is what it is. But it is what it is. Basically, this definition was given by Getzler some years ago, and with Chen Chan, we were working on this. So, let me give some examples of this definition. So, examples So M equals N equals zero shifted, so these are examples of M shifted symplectic Lie and group weights so. So, if I have a zero group point, that's just a manifold, and I'm putting a symplectic structure on my manifold. So, this is just a symplectic manifold. Now, for m equals zero, n equals one, this is the same as I have a Lie group point. I have a leaf group point, and now this non-degenerate condition will force me that the group point that I have is a foliation group point groupoid with a transversal okay, with a twofold, so with a twofold A two-form that is non-degenerate, a two-form on M, on the race that is non-degenerate on the transversal directions. So, this is also called a zero shift that's simple at the start, where you're Shifted symplectic star, Rayer Sahamar was studying them quite a lot. Sorry. I was too far. Thank you. Now, another example is M equal 1, N equal 1. These are called twisted press-inflected glucoids. And those are the global part of the RAC structures and was integrated by Enrique Burstin and Marius Kreinik and Paula Machean. Another example here is that any Poisson structure can be integrated. Be integrated to the m equal 1, m equal 2. So you cannot integrate it to a group point, but you can always integrate it to a two-group point, but the symplectic form is still often one. So let me just end probably with these examples. So for a quadratically algebra or a Or a dramatic realge of I have my G having and this I have two different integrations. One is the nerve of G where you put the Cartan three form and these two form And this to form that is just the pullback of theta left, the pullback of theta right, and this forms an M equal to M equal 1 symptom. And you have another integration that is this loop loop pg over a point and here And here you put the symplectic structure of the roots. And this is m equal to n equal to loop point, and both things are simple acting maritime. And you can decide to integrate a quadratically algebra whether to this finite-dimensional model with Dimensional model with something that is not symplectic because you have a three-form controlling the defect, or you can integrate it to an infinite-dimensional on a symplectic manifold. And then the last thing that I want to say, that was probably the main to arrive there, but I didn't arrive, is that one can study it, or one should study, quotangent bundles for Lie and glue points as we did it in the infinitesimal level. Infinitesimal level. So I tried to define the cotangent bundle of a lead to group point. And up to now, the best that I can say is that I need to make some choices. I didn't find it a canonical way of defining it. So I hope that probably we can discuss this later. Thank you. So, say that you have the definition of the three kinds of bundle of even with choice? No, no, I I I'm not able to produce it without choices. Sure. Let's say that you have a CPG something, and then you can construct the cotangent bundle of a DMP. Of a two-group point, I check it and I think that my construction can extend it for us. For us in the restaurant, before you lay an undergenerative condition by saying that hey, because if this work gives you the amount between 100 and 400, even in that case, can you choose some, have you checked that under Genesis condition phrase in terms of yeah, that's a really good question. I do not have an answer. I want to expect that that's the correct definition of. That's the correct definition of saying that it's mandatory. So I would expect that that's right, that you can do it. I don't know if you can or not. Should be something like a linear hypercover between the tangent and the cotangent of a y-end loop. So I expect that that's the right definition of the non-determined. Could you remind me, please? What was this? Ng? So Ng is just the nerve of J. So this is a simplicial manifold. So at level I, I just put I copies of my group and then the phi and the generacies are by the multiplication. Second and last bullet point, can you say what it means? What it means. This? Yeah, kind of a complete sentence. Yeah, so what I can say here is the following. Yeah, so what I can say here is that you know that for any Poisson manifold, I can look into the cotangent path on it. On it, then the omoto piece defines me a foliation on cotangent path, and then if picking transversals to this foliation, I can define M, a two-group point, whose base is my Poisson manifold. Then on the level one, I have the transversal to these foliations, and on the level two, I have some products of these things. You know, products of these things with monodromies on these objects, and this group of it here has a symplectic form that is non-degenerate in this sense. If you have like the how is it, the k exterior power of a cotangent model, of a vector model, you have this canonical UP work for that you can differentiate and then. That you can differentiate, and then you have a two-fold example of a contangent model in the first? I think so. So what happens in the Q manifolds is that all the symplectic manifolds that are greater than one, that are greater or equal than one, have already a potential. So they are exact always. And I think that what And I think that what you are describing is just economical. Did you say anything how you go from one work to the other problem? Yeah, that's... I probably can say something of that in the discussion. Okay, that sounds good. The first world, the oh, sorry. Eisen Tan. Hi Zen Tan. Hi, hi again. Hi. Yes, Charlotte. Um so I was a obsession of thinking like how uh how to um it so so you have you have this code engine, code engine proprietary, right? So whatever you're looking for, but somehow you have it in your mind already. Yeah. And tangent with propriet too. Can you imagine this omega without descent to the infinite test? Without descent to the infinitesimal level of this omega on the level, already introduced you some weaker comments between tangent upa and co-engine upay? Yeah, I think that that goes in the direction of what Christian was asking, and I think that that's right. That the symplectic form on the Cotanchen should induce a weak equivalence or a Morita equivalence between the For a Morita equivalence between the tangent and potential. Oh, I didn't hear that. Right. You have a concrete, concrete. We can talk about later. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Thank the speaker again. So you know how like minus one structure symplectic structures are presented. It doesn't fit into this definition, so it doesn't fit. So how is do you have an idea about the time? No, but I think that you see in the Q manifold you can take set Q manifolds. And then here I think that what you should do is pick a simplicial manifold due to different possible manifolds. Because you need something in the added that is... Like sort of a bi complex? And then once you do that, probably you are able to see the minus one. Wow, okay. Sounds more complicated, actually. Yeah, it sounds easier. Okay. Anything else I wanted to ask about? Yeah, okay. So here you have all these different pieces that make up the symplectic form. In the cumulative world, you just have one symplectic form that's just a two-point. Do you have any idea of like when you're doing the integration and the differentiation how so what I can tell you is in this example uh you can apply the Vanessa mark. You can apply the Vanessa map and this carton 3-4 goes to 0 via the Vanessa map, and this gives you 9.
