I am very excited to tell you about something that didn't work that I've been working on. But essentially it's kind of what's in this picture, that monophomology isn't able to detect something. And I kind of feel like that's fairly surprising. And yeah, I mean, I'll tell you a little bit more about it throughout the talk, but I think the picture starts to describe maybe some of the stuff that we saw this morning with these twist-spun knots. In this case, they're not knots describing discs, so it's just Describing disks, so it's just the bottom half of those dots. And on the left, we see the zero twist spun disc described by a band move. And then you would cap off the two resulting unlinks, or two resulting unnots that you get. And then on this one, you're seeing kind of the twisted version of it. So I guess this would be the two twist spun disk. Yeah, so let's get started. I'll throw up maybe the theorem that we ended up with. I mean, not really so much a theorem, I guess. Not really so much a theorem against the result that we didn't get kind of got. So I'll call it a theorem. And this is with Jeffrey Meyer. And it's that Kibano homology does not detect. Um the M twist spun disks for, and this is just one example, we're hoping that it works for other examples, but for free one, connect sum, it's fingers. And I'll throw on at the end up to smooth isotopy rail bum. Rel boundary. Yeah. So I feel like this is fairly interesting. We'll kind of get into why it works and how we went about showing it. But yeah, I mean, this is the first time that I've done something with Cavanohomology and not gotten anywhere with it, which I feel like is maybe good to know its limits. But yeah, okay. So I'll try to describe maybe all of these words in a little bit of detail and maybe the most important thing. In a little bit of detail, and I think the most important one to start with is what is Kobana opulent. Okay, so cobatomhomology is a functor. It acts on the category of link cobordisms. So let's start with maybe just a picture of a link cobordism. I think maybe we know what they are, but it's good to have a visual as well. As well. So here's some cobordism between two links. Today I'm going to be viewing cobordisms moving downward. So it will start with this link L0 on the top, move down to this link L1 on the bottom, and so I'll draw an arrow between them, and then I'll call this cobordism S. So it's moving downwards. Sorry for the symplectic here. I know that this isn't the best choice, but it's how it's working in my head. Okay, so what does Gibbonophomology do? So, what does Kibanohomology do to these things? So, they're link organisms. We think about them under isotope-URL boundary, and it takes these things and it spits out some map. So, what happens is links are going to be turned into R modules. I'll call them for today. I'll work with Z modules. So, monophthongology of L0. Won't really care what it is in specific detail, but it's some Z module, so you can think about it as a group. And then we get a map that goes to. And then we get a map that goes to the motorgy at the bottom, a one, and we get some associated map between them from the surface. One thing that I want to point out about these is that they are bi-graded maps. So we'd start with maybe I and J up here, I being homological and J being quantum gradings. And the map actually gets shifted by the Euler characteristic of the surface. So your homological grading will stay the same. Your homological grading will stay the same, and then J gets shifted by another characteristic of S. Okay. And this is mostly just so that we can do a few computations and see why we're kind of getting some of the results that we have. Okay, so one of the more important aspects of these maps, in order for this to be a functor, it has to actually kind of act like a functor. And the important property is that it The important property is that the map is invariant under isotopy of the surface. So, a theorem from kind of a large group of people, but I'll say Jacobson, Barnaton, Kavanov, is that this map is invariant under isotopy retail boundary. And I should probably be. And I should probably be a little bit more specific, smooth isotopy robot. Yes, so yes, up to sign. If you add in another paper, kind of maybe a lot of different papers, you can get rid of the signed defendants as well. Yeah. We won't really need that today. We won't really need that today. But yes, all of the calculations that we did have the sign problem as well. Good question. Other questions? Cool. Okay, so why are these things important? I think we've kind of heard this. I'm going to erase this a few times today that they detect lots of things. So, recent applications. Things. So recent applications, just to point out a few of them, they detect exotic slice discs. So you can detect pairs of exotic discs. This is with Kyle Hayden. Um And I feel like this is kind of maybe why I think that Kavanaugh homology should be interesting to a lot of people. It's a smoothen variant, so you're able to actually get some of this exotic behavior out of it. And I think maybe is a little bit of a motivation for why I'm studying these infinite families, which I'll say more about in a sec. But then also another application, we can detect exotic site surfaces. Sighting services. And this is with Kyle Hayden, someone, Maggie, Jung-huan, and myself. Okay. And again, exotic kind of pops its head into this. So monohomology has this interesting ability to expect, to detect. To exact, to detect exotic phenomena. Can I ask a question? Yeah, so this is just straight up. This is my colonophy and spectral sequence, all that stuff. It's in the TQFT. Yeah, that defines colonophilology. Yeah, this is a great question. I feel like this is maybe one of the mysteries that I am still surprised by every day, is that it's literally in how these induced maps are defined. And that boils all the way down to the TQFT level. Yeah. T level. Yeah. So when you said detect earlier, when you said they can't detect like the untwisted things, you mean like differentiate? Because often when people didn't say detect, they mean like it says that if something has this invariant, it is that thing. Ah, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. So differentiate, distinguish. Distinguish. It's not differentiated. Maybe that's the terminology math as well. Yeah. Yeah, this is true. Yeah. Finding the right word might be hard. But yeah, I guess what I mean is that the pairs of surfaces that are distinct, we know from, like, I guess. Distinct, we know, from like, I guess, ziemens. All of them still induce the same map. Other questions? This is great. And induce the same map means removal disk, a ball, a non-disk. I mean, to get you, are you, oh, I guess you can just go to the empty. Yes, exactly. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'll draw a picture for that in just a sec. Okay. Okay. Okay, so one other thing I should have maybe said this is also pairs of surfaces. I mean, there's some work for getting infinitely many, but it doesn't use Kibano homology that I know of. So yeah, I think a good natural follow-up question here is, does this work for any infinite family? Infinite families of surfaces. And maybe even more specifically, can we do this for any exotic families of disks? This is super, super helpful, but because Cavano Homology has this ability to Cavano homology has this ability to detect exotic phenomena. Maybe this is like the thing that would be able to do it. I have no clue, but yeah, as far as I know, there aren't examples of infinitely many exotic select disks out there. But you're the crowd, you would be able to correct me on that. Okay, so let's maybe get into the approaches that we use for these, and then I'll maybe compare that to how we can use this to get infinite families, or apparently, how we won't. Or apparently, how we won't use it to get influenced families. Okay, so I'm just going to change this picture and describe what we did in these types of papers and the types of induced maps that we're working with. So the approach that we did that kind of Kyle and I came up with for this exotic paper is you take a surface in the foreball and you represent it as a link aborted from your link to the M. From your link to the mth. So here we have some link abortism like this. And what you do is, if you want to distinguish pairs of these things, you take another one of these link abortisms. Maybe I'll call this S1 and this S0. And we look at the maps that they induce. And in this case, they go from And in this case, they go from the commonohomology of L down to the Kavanaugh homology of the Hunphilink. And that's whatever your ground ring is. So in our case, we're going to get Z. I should also maybe point out that this is actually supported in the 0, 0 grading. Everywhere else, it's trivial. And what that means is if this is a map that's bi-graded, then the only possible way for this to be Then the only possible way for this to be a non-trivial map is if we started with something in the zero Euler characteristic of one of these surfaces. Shifts down by negative to get to zero. Okay, so that restricts where we're starting from. And the process that we do is we just choose some element inside of our monohomology of Mata. And hopefully, these two maps map it to two different. These two maps map it to two distinct places. So maybe I'll take some class phi, and with one of these surfaces, it'll get sent down to zero. And with another surface, so maybe S1, we'll send this down to one. And these aren't the same. And so their induced maps are distinct. Yeah. And both of these live inside of the integers. So that's the base strategy. Coming up with phi is a bit. Coming up with fee is a bit of a, as Kyle and I like to say, an art more than a science. There's not really one conclusive way of how you're going to do it, but it's actually, once you get a little bit more familiar with phonochomology, you get lucky quite a lot, and you're able to find them pretty quickly. So you can get a fee, and for these exotic disks and for these cybered surfaces, you can cook up one that gets sent to distinct places. You pick the fee first and the disks afterwards? You pick the disks first. Afterwards? You pick the disks first. And then, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, so you could come up with. Not like a universal fee. There isn't a universal fee. In some cases, like if you start with special types of braids, you can kind of find a fee that's always going to get mapped non-trivially with certain types of surfaces. But yeah, usually you want to choose your fee in some way that's a little bit clever, that it has this asymmetry where one of them kills that element and the other one sends it somewhere non-trivial. Yeah. That sends it somewhere non-trivial. Yeah. Um, rail boundary. Yeah, rail boundary. Yeah. And the examples you had with Kyle, are they isotopic if you can move? So we did kind of soup it up so that you get that they're non-isotopic ambiently as well, but that doesn't come from the Kavanaugh. Yeah. From Kavanaugh Homology you only get the um braille boundary. Yeah. Great questions. Okay, I still have a little bit of time. So maybe let's talk about how you would change this approach. I just love that Patrick gave this talk this morning because it set this up perfectly. So what we're going to do is we're going to change this picture again and kind of use these twist spun dots. These twists, fun diagrams that you can come up with. I'll draw another picture and maybe tell you what I mean by that. Okay, so here's our 3,1 connect sum. It's inverse, and then I'm going to take another copy. And what we're going to do is inside of this product, we're going to perform a twist, as was talked about this morning. So maybe I'll write it like this. We twist, and then we cap off on the bottom with the slice disc. So up here we have our M twist. twist and down here we have our spun disk and I didn't use the the best notation because I think this differs a little bit with what Patrick did but I was going to call this TM just this isotopy I'm sorry does this is this super cringy no it's it's good enough okay cool and then I'm gonna call this a disk D so really what we're doing is we're we're taking Really, what we're doing is we're taking this slice disk and we're factoring it into a composition of link abortisms. And why is that good for us? Well, on the level of Kavanaugh homology, that means that our mass factor, what we get, is something where we start with the Kavanaugh homology of this knot K, which is three-wheeling connecting its inverse, and we get some map that gets mapped down to, well, the Kavanaugh homology of K again, and then down into Z. Okay. And maybe I'll write down this is H of M, and this is H of D. So how can we change our approach for this? Well, we have a little bit of wiggle room. We have this entire isotopy that will induce an automorphism on covanochomology, and then we can map these things down. So maybe as a Things down. So maybe as a first start, you'd want to find some class that gets mapped at least non-trivially down here. So you'd want to find some, let's put alpha inside of here, that gets mapped down to, let's say, one. And this is actually super possible. You can do this. You can actually find two classes, alpha and beta. And through a little bit of computer work, I don't want to slide this too far under the rug, but you can show that these are actually. Far under the rug, but you can show that these are actually distinct. And you can show that alpha and beta actually generate the commonal homology in the 0 s 1, negative 1, creating. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Yeah. And this is good because we have two candidates. They get both sent down to some. Both sent down to something non-trivial. And so, what you would hope is that if you're going to distinguish this infinite family, that maybe what's going to happen is if I start with these up here, that alpha gets mapped to like M alpha under the twist spin. Yeah. That's like the goal, right? That's what you want to happen with these. And after, you know, working with this for like two or three days, doing calculations for it, what you end up getting is that alpha gets sent to. Is that alpha gets sent to alpha and beta gets sent to beta. So this is the non-detection, right? We found the only two things that we could work with, and they both get sent trivially in the end, which is a little bit sad. Also, not to brush this too far under the rug, this computation is a little bit heavy. You have to work with all of the possible randomized removes that describe this twisting. So it's a little bit of work, but yeah, it's kind of. Bit of work, but yeah, it's kind of surprising. This is the first time that I've actually seen this happen. So, maybe some good follow-up questions for this are: well, what happens in other cases? So, we have other infinite families to work with. When you say if you work with all, you mean you have to write down an explicit, complete sequence of items. Yeah, like every possible way of doing it. Yeah, sorry, yeah, that maybe was the and that's why oil connects some mirror and not knot connects some knot. Like a mirror. Like you have like 'cause it's easier to draw. You had, like, because it's easier to draw. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it's also kind of why we did 3-1, right? Because fewer Ritemeister moves, yeah. And if you've worked with Cavanohamology and you've done any Rita-Meister 3 moves, they're not the best. You can get through them when you have time, which is why I say work on it for like three days. But if you are really inspired and you want to be able to do this, then you can do it. But yeah, you don't get all that. But yeah, you don't pick all the way. Was there another? So, this was like a by-hand computation, not like using the computer? Yeah, so there isn't a computer program for this. I think it sounds like there's people who are interested in writing them. There might be a couple people who are working on this, which would be fantastic. Because these are so computationally heavy, doing it by hand takes a lot of time. So, having a computer program do it would be excellent. The computer program that I did use is one that distinguishes elements in cobanomal homology. Homology. But I had wrote that for my dissertation or as part of it, and works pretty well, actually, especially in this case where you have a low number of crossings. Other questions? Yeah? What if you just pay attention to that? So, in other byte readings, it won't make a difference because you have an isotopy. And so, you're only going, you won't shift your. only going you won't shift your your byte grading yeah so you will you end up get getting some trivial otherwise yeah great question these are kind of the things that like we were trying to play with to make this work is that like you have to change something so that this works but it really just doesn't yeah um okay so a few follow-up thoughts um just to wrap things up um so so do other isotopies Isotopies induce non-trivial automorphisms. I feel like this is maybe the big question that I feel like working on with this. For any not. There's no example note for any knot. I don't know. I think that there are isotopies that induce ones that induce non-trivial automorphisms. The ones that I'm thinking of are like some, you just like twist the entire diagram and you come back to something that's like, you don't do like a full twist, you get some symmetry of the diagram. Yeah. But for these types of diagrams, For these types of diagrams, where you're kind of extending slice disks in this way, I don't know of any that would actually distinguish infinitely many families yet. So some of those that you might try are like rolling or like roll spinning, I guess. Yeah, so yeah, it's a problem. This is a calculation that I'm working on. It's a little bit more intense because you have a lot more Rademeister moves. But then also, does Then also does this, let's see, twisting work for any other knots. So I have a computation going for 4, 1 and x sum x inverse. So you have more randomized removes. In this case, you'd have. Removes. In this case, you'd have three generators to work with, all of them get not non-trivially by the disk, but the isotopy is kind of a mystery. And maybe conjecturally, it could be possible that you don't actually get any non-trivial, or you don't get any non-trivial automorphisms. But we'll see. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, sorry. Hammond? No, I was going to ask if they were saying I got an idea. I guess, well, okay, so here's maybe, I don't, I haven't really thought about this, but like, is somehow maybe the fact that like, like, the Cobano epsomology isn't like, like, noticing the twist, like, I don't know, maybe if it were, would it be weird? Because, like, the one twist is like the unknot. Is like the unknot when you. I don't know. It's some, I don't know. Maybe, like. But the zero twist isn't the unknown. I know, but I don't know. That was just like my immediate thought. Maybe for some reason, like, it wouldn't be bad down the line because of that. So I think that, at least for Cavanohomology, if you did like the two twist, it's just stacking on another twist and that factors as an isomorphism. So it wouldn't matter in general. I think if I'm understanding your question. I think if I'm understanding your question, correct. Yeah, I don't know. That's just a thought. All right, does anyone else have any better questions than me? I've already started. Two quick questions. One is, what about if you found the other way? Ah, so I don't know. Going the other direction is generally much, much more difficult. And the problem is that complexity rises as you go through these maps, which is why I like thinking of them going down. Yeah, so it's possible to do that, and maybe. So, it's possible to do that, and maybe if there are these computational tools that would calculate it, you'd be able to do this very quickly. But yeah, it seems possible. This is also just, sorry, tangent, but this is why I wrote a program that distinguishes classes, is because you get some class up here and you get another class up here, and it's like they look like a disaster. How do you compare them? So, yeah. My other question was: I was wondering, go in the same direction that you chose. Features potentially look at the stable homes of the type race with real homology, but have things like a hope map or something, but it's not visible by homology. Yeah, yeah, I don't know anything about, or I don't know if those would work. Yeah, yeah. There is also potential for changing Kimano Phomology entirely and like doing, I don't know, Kimano Versansky or like this universal Kimano phomology. And maybe you get something that's detected. Maybe you get something that's giving you a little bit more info there. Yeah. Great questions. There's a couple things. Do you have any idea of like if you, let's say it works for the figure eight, do you have like any particular thing you want to like do with that? Because I guess what does that say? It says that like the disks are not isotopic rel boundary. But is there anything in particular that you have an idea of applying to be on that? I don't have examples, but it would be great if we could find information. But it would be great if we could find infinitely many exotic slice disks. Yeah. That's kind of the, at least my goal for trying to approach this is that it's just unknown in Kavanaugh homology seems like a computational tool that has the possibility of doing cosmologically as a topic. They would be helpful. Aren't right. I have no idea. These ones aren't an example for that. I don't have an example to try. This was just like a toy. Just to see what get your feet in the ball. Just to see what you're featuring a lot or two happens. But if any of you have examples, if you want to try it, I'll let you know. Yeah, it's kind of a weird question. You mentioned vitamin A3D problem. I wonder if you have an isotopy from a dot fact to itself that doesn't evolve any vitamin A treatment, is it possibly automatically uninteresting to like isotopes? Oh, you know, trivial and uninteresting. I don't know, or are they interesting? I don't know how that would translate to homology though. I mean, yeah, just want to make it easier to try to home like Ritemeis 3 for 3. Yeah, I mean, this has been the goal for the whole time. It's like find slice discs, hopefully they're ribbon, and then only use Ritemeister 1 and 2 throughout. And that's like all of the And two throughout. And that's like all of the examples that we came up with. You won't see a ridomycer 3 anywhere, and it's because we're afraid of time. It's like it's Halloween. These are the scary things. But it is possible that if you look at all of the automorphisms that you get, that maybe Reitemeister 3s are kind of the things that have the possibility of giving you something non-trivial, but the other ones won't. Yeah. I was going to ask if you go the other way. Is there a surgery formula? Go the other way? Is there a surgery formula like Ian and Andrasha or not floor? Because if you just wanted infinitely many circuses distinguished by Kavanaugh, like presumably the same ones. Or if there's a surgery of one yellow. Not one that I know of, but remember a surgery from what? Like you remember surgery and like you would get like some sort of branch cover. I look at the like I mean they showed that the knot floor map changes according to like the knot you use to do ring surgery. Like the knot you use to do rim surgery analogous to what happens to cyber-witten invariants, maybe like torus surgery? So, I mean, yeah, Lisa, do you have something that could? I mean, so yeah, my hesitation is that like this isn't an option because Kavanaugh Multi only really works in certain manifolds. And so like looking at branch covers and oh, sorry, I shouldn't have said branch covers. Like I was thinking about the Taurus region thing. Like them is just not part of more than maps, but I don't remember how to turn it. Yeah, yeah. It would be cool if there was more. Yeah, it would be cool if there was one. I don't think there is one, and yeah, yeah, I don't know. There's work by this guy, Arna Mortier, that's an I related to you. And then there's coffee and some
