So I want to give you an update on work we've been doing for a few years now. So Zhu Miao was a PhD student of mine at the University of Edinburgh. Likewise, Parmos Carl Clamanos did his PhD with me and is now a postdoc and password with you in the audience. So I just want to give a brief outline. So for motivation, I want to talk briefly about the scalar case, so the one component case. We did quite a work on that using a geometric approach. To work on that using a geometric approach, I want to just show the Lagumo equation as a prototype and outline the strategy that we used in describing the Lagumo equation with a cutoff. Geometric decimalization of Loa plays a crucial role there. And then I want to move to the two-component case. So we've looked at three models, I would say. We have some preliminary results. We formulated sort of the generalized model that we want to study going forward. That we want to study going forward. So, I'm going to discuss that and then I'm going to conclude. So, the motivation for these cutoffs in general is that you often want to consider reaction fusion models as a large-scale limit of an n-particle system or a mean field approximation of a microscopic model. And if the number of particles or agents is large, then typically you have a good approximation. However, if you consider small port particle numbers, then Particle numbers, then the quality of the approximation deteriorates because of random effect, because of stochasticity. And in particular, in these models, we are often interested in propagating fronts, right? And for those propagating fronts, you take the speed, the propagation speed that you obtain from this reaction diffusion model as an approximation, and you see that you misestimate the speed that you would find in the discrete n-component n-particle system. So here is just an example that I took from. An example that I took from a paper from 2003 where you have the front league and the continuum approximation and the simulated front, which you see lags behind. And so as a quick fix, a sort of an ad hoc way to address this issue, Bruné and Deridaine in 1997 suggested that if you look at n fixed, so if you fix the number of particles, you really shouldn't have any particles if your concentration, phi, in the reaction. Phi in the reaction diffusion model is below a certain threshold, epsilon, which is like 1 over, right? And so the idea is then that you say, well, in that case, you cut off the reaction kinetic. So there's no reaction kinetics, so you simply have diffusion. I also want to point out that I found a similar idea in a paper from 1996 by Timbring et al. on RNA virus dynamics. It seemed slightly more ad hoc than Winnie that it all certainly gave an analysis using natural symptoms. So I do not know what the primary So, I do not know what the privacy is here. I just want to highlight it as something that's interesting. Okay, so if you go with that approach and you include a cutoff here in this reaction diffusion equation, you multiply your reaction kinetics f of phi with a cutoff function theta. So theta depends on phi and epsilon. And a priori you only want that this cutoff function is much less than one if the concentration is much less than this cutoff threshold epsilon. Than this cutoff threshold epsilon. And if phi is larger than epsilon, you simply leave the reaction kinetics unchanged. And so the main goal here is then to find the correction to the propagation speed, the front propagation speed, that is due to this cutoff. So the propagation speed in the cutoff system is typically going to be a function C of epsilon. And so that is the singular speed, the speed in the system without the cutoff, plus some connection delta C that will depend on epsilon. And, you know, Depend on epsilon, and you know, you're specifically interested in the nature of this dependence. So, what will the structure be of this delta C? How will it depend on epsilon? So, there are various approaches to finding this correction or finding the asymptotics of this correction. René and Derrida did some asymptotic matching in the original paper. There's, I would say, a Chilean school that uses a variational principle, basically formulates a functional and then finds the speed as a minimum. Then finds the speed as a minimize or maximize of that functional. And then there's this geometric approach that we started, I think, in 2007. So it was Fred Ginrotier, Casso, and myself. I should also say that, as I indicated, this cutoff function is quite general, so you do not need to set the reaction kinetics equal to zero below the cutoff threshold. So this is one option, this is the the heaviside cutoff. Option, this is the heavy side cutoff. You could have something like a linear cutoff here, right? You could have something more general. So, in particular, in the context of the so-called Fisher-Komogor equation, it does not really matter to leading order what the cutoff function is. So, that is something that Riné and Arida postulated, and then we showed geometrically in 2007. The Nagumo equation, I think, is a useful prototype in this context. Context. So that is the classic equation that we also, you know, teach our undergraduates. So there is a cubic here. You can look at the heavy side cutoff just for simplicity. When there's no cutoff, you have an explicit solution. You can realize different propagation regimes here. So I would like to say it is sort of a minimal representative, as Stars said, not quite a normal form. But you have this parameter gamma in the equation, and as you vary gamma, you can find different front propagation regimes in different speeds. Different speeds. So, but the general strategy, of course, is well known, right? So, you quote your Cobo reframe, you formulate an equivalent first-order system, and then the front is basically equivalent to a heteroclinic connection between steady states in your system, and you also add epsilon as a trivial variable, and then you have a foliation in epsilon, right? So, with varying values of epsilon, you foliate the phase space of this model, and that lends itself naturally to a phase space analysis, right? Analysis, right? So, in particular, when you have this cutoff, you're going to have three regions. So, you're going to have an inner region where the reaction kinetic is cut off, so where u, I call it phi, but p I call it u, is between 0 and epsilon. You have an outer region where the reaction kinetic is unchanged, where u is between epsilon and 1. And then you have an intermediate region where this transition happens. So, you have a discontinuity at epsilon and And the way you approach this problem, of course, is as always in perturbation theory, you set epsilon equal to zero, you find the singular connection, and then you show that this perturbs if epsilon is sufficiently small. And geometrically, you're looking for an intersection between the unstable manifold, let's say, of one steady state and the stable manifold of the other. And so, this construction is global. You typically find that the cutoff makes the front solution unique, even if you have no unique. Solution unique, even if you have no unique thrust solution without a cutoff, and you're able to find the asymptotics of this correction, delta C. So the approach that we have been pursuing is based on dynamical systems and also on blow-up. I'm surprised that I'm the first one to maybe say more in detail about blow-up, but this is just in a nutshell. If you look, for instance, at the very simple example, so that the planar fold, right, epsilon x dot is minus y plus x squared. is minus y cos x squared. y dot is minus 1, so you have the slow formulation, the fast formulation. You find the reduced problem and the layer problem. And then the critical manifold in this case is very simple, right? It's just a parabola y is x squared. And so you see that the left branch is normally attracting, the right branch is normally repelling. You lose hyperbolicity at the origin. How can you now understand what the flow will do? Well, you expect from the singular picture that because of y dot is minus one, the reduced flow is directed towards the origin. Flow is directed towards the origin, and then once you've reached the origin, you cannot follow the critical manifold anymore, and you leave under the fast foliation. So, to show that rigorously, you can do this blow-up at the origin. And the blow-up is basically like a zoom. So, you zoom in on this singularity at the origin. It is like a coordinate transformation. It allows you to regain some hyperbolicity. So, in this case, that is slightly atypical because. That is slightly atypical because we're using this blow-up to deal with the non-smoothness, with this discontinuity here. So, we're going to use the blow-up in this intermediate region to deal with the transition between the unmodified and the cut-off regimes. So, in terms of the blow-up, that is the so-called projective chart, the phase-directional chart. So, you can imagine you come in with the unstable manifold of this steady-state equilibrium. Steady state is equilibrium that is, you know, let's say one, so out with the cutoff region, you attract that into a neighborhood of the origin where the dynamics is cut off, and so you need a transition between these two regimes, and that is accomplished in this phase-directional chart, right? In the projective chart. So, you need to fix basically the propagation speed to allow you to make this connection. So, you need to find a transition. Connection. So you need to find a transition map between two appropriately defined sections in this intermediate region, and you bring to bear all the various techniques that you have from the Nemetral System Theory, like normal form generic manifolds, and so on. And so if I go back to this Nagumo equation, for instance, you see that you can classify the various types of front solutions that you have. So you have pulled fronts, right? So like in the Fischer-Kromogorov equation, which you can find basically for gamma is equal to minus one in the Naguma equation. Is equal to minus one in the Naguma equation, where the correction is of the order one over log squared. You have other pulled regimes, and then you have a transition to the pushed regime, and finally the bistable regime. In those regimes, you have something like a power of epsilon for the correction to the propagation speed. These powers can depend on gamma, but you see that the cutoff can slow down the front, it can also speed it up. The effect of a cutoff can be quite strong, right? Cutoff can be quite strong, right? So that's what Renee Deridau observed: that the effect of this cutoff is quite strong in this pool regime, it is quite weak in the other regimes. So all of that you can find in this Nadouma equation. And so the question then was, what happens when you move to two component systems? And we didn't really see much there in the literature. So when I started looking at that with June Yarr in twenty nineteen, Yeah, in 2019. We found a new paper by Samstrom and Mendes from 2005. And they considered this piecewise linear kinetics, or Tonelier-Gasnet kinetics, where they basically had a piecewise linear function f and a piecewise linear function g in the reaction kinetics. So they had those had a discontinuity at some point A, so U is equal to A, right? So there was a discontinuity. Is equal to A, right? So there was a discontinuity. And then you can also add a cutoff there. So you have an interplay here between the discontinuity in the reaction kinetics and the discontinuity that is due to the cutoff at this threshold epsilon. Okay? And so now you see that if you go to a co-moving frame, you get a four-dimensional system. So even though it is relatively simple, this higher-dimensionality doesn't introduce some complications, right? Because the methods from, you know, a The methods from a planar face plane analysis that we like to apply become more involved. I mean, they're still quite elementary, but they become more involved. So, in this model, again, you have two steady states. You want to match unstable and stable manifolds. You can do a blow-up, and you can construct these heteroclinic orbits. So, you see a feature of the cutoff in these two component systems, of course, is that you cut off an entire strip. So, if you do the cutoff in these. Entire strip. So if you do the cutoff in V, you see it affects the propagating front globally in U, depending on how it approaches the origin. So that is, of course, different from the scalar case. In retrospect, I should say that this choice of example, this choice of model was maybe not an ideal one because this is very simple. It's piecewise linear. So you can approach it using matches in the simply by patching exact solutions in the various regions. If you do this geometry, Regions, if you do this geometric approach and you blow up, you actually make the problem non-linear in the chart. So it is sort of maybe a bit of an overcomplication from that point of view. What is interesting is that, as I said, there's this interplay between A and C, or A and epsilon, which also gives you then an interplay between A and C, so the propagation speed. So you have a relationship between A and C, which is also affected by the cutoff. Which is also affected by the cutoff. So you see that basically you get something like a seller node verification in the C A plane. So depending also on the diffusivity, for a given value of A, you may have two propagating currents with different speeds. So one of those will be stable, one will be unstable. And then as you increase the diffusivity, that vanishes. So this was not really conclusive in the sense that we managed to give a geometric interpretation of what had been done before. Had been done before, right? Sorry. What had been done before, but we did not find a complete picture here. We also did not find the correction to the propagation speed in terms of epsilon explicitly. So there's an interlude. This is quite a simple model that got us thinking about FTPP type models. So in this model, this is actually from Murray's book, right? So Murray, my Actually, from Mary's book, right? So, Mary, in my experience, has quite a few models that I think he just stumbled upon while talking to collaborators or something. So, sometimes there is discussion of something that I haven't seen anywhere else in the literature. But so, this is a LTPP time model where we basically have a population of dispersers that diffuses and the population of non-dispersers that does not diffuse. So, if you look for France there and introduce a total population, then you see that this naturally decreases. Then you see that this naturally decouples, right? And then you have the evolution of this two-dimensional subsystem on an invariant plane. And so here you can then do a relatively standard low-up analysis and you reduce this to the FKPP equation, basically depending on this probability of dispersal. So if P is equal to 1, you literally have the FKPP equation. So some of these models you can actually reduce to the standard scalar case in some regions. Scalar case in some regimes. And so, together with TASO, we then looked at this model, this proper coupled FKPP-type model that was suggested actually by a group in Edinburgh. And so, what they did was they looked at two sub-populations here. So, this population NSA B carries a certain trait and it passes the trait on to this population NSA B. So, beta is the rate of exchange of this trait. Is the rate of exchange of this trait. And then you also have these interaction terms, these cross terms here. And so the interesting thing that they found was that if you just look at the total population, right, so the total population, if you add these two equations, is going to simply satisfy an FKPP equation, and for that, you simply have the standard FKPP speed selection. Okay? So, the traits then hitchhikes on an expanding population. So, if you introduce a sub-population with a trait, it will spread, and the trait will be transmitted to the population that does not carry it yet, also with a certain speed, which is going to lag behind the speed of the total population. So, in particular, what they found was that it makes a difference whether you introduce a trait into an established population that is at its carrying capacity. That is at its carrying capacity, or whether the population is expanding. And so, in particular, what was interesting to me was that there's a coupling between the trait wave and the total population wave at the tip. So, that the wave is going to propagate at the larger speed, right, initially, which is the speed Vc, and then settle into the speed that is predicted by FPPP type analysis. And so, this also in this paper is actually related to this idea of anomalous. Is actually related to this idea of anomalous spreading, which Oltzer and Schelen also looked at before. So it is not as simple as in the scalar case. So you really have to look at the interaction between these two waves in the propagation. So that led us then to generalize this further. So this is now with Tarso and Panos. So this is basically And Panos. So, this is basically the model considered by the Edinburgh group, where we now introduce a cutoff potentially in both u and v. So, we have these cutoff functions phi and psi. And so, the dependence here on u epsilon and u of epsilon is basically to capture also these piecewise linear cutoffs. So, we've started looking at that, and we do not have definitive results. Have definitive results yet. But again, if we look at co-moving frame, we find three equilibria. And so you see that if there is no exchange of the trait, if beta is equal to zero, then you basically have the extinction state, and then you have these two states where one of the subpopulations is extinct and the other is at its carrying capacity. So that is not the interesting case. The interesting case is where there is an exchange of this trait. And so again, taking And so again, taking motivation from this previous example, this simple model with dispersers and non-dispersers, we find that we can reduce the dynamics here to certain variant planes. And so you see that, for instance, you have heteroclinics, you have funds between the states Qv and Q0. So QV is the state where V is at K and the other species are at zero. Is at zero, and the origin, the extinction state. You also have a front from this, let's say, coexistent state QU propagating into QV. But then interestingly, you also have a front that propagates from the coexistent state to the origin. So if you look at these invariant planes, right, so these two fronts that I mentioned first, they basically satisfy Riscale Defkin. Satisfy Riscale de FKPP equations. So there you simply have the standard correction here that is of the order 1 over log squared. There's not much you see there. The interesting one is this front that connects QU to Q0. And so here we again see, like in the scalar case, that the cutoff actually makes a qualitative difference to the propagation of this front because without the cutoff what you find is a non-monotonic front. Is a non-monotonic front that is unphysiological because E becomes negative. With the cutoff, you remedy that. With the cutoff, you have a front that is monotonic and physiological. So that is again an example where the cutoff makes a difference to the global qualitative dynamics of your system. So that is something we want to explore further. So, that is something we want to explore further, also, in particular looking at these effects that I mentioned before, this spreading, right, that we need to consider, I think. So, I would say that we've made a start, a modest start, at considering cutoffs in two component systems. The challenge here is this increased dimensionality. Again, I think this coupled FKPV type model is a suitable prototype. Hopefully, we can again. Hopefully, we can again arrive at this kind of classification where we have a cut-off reaction diffusion model that we can study in the phase plane using geometric designerization or BroA, and then arrive at the classification that gives us not only these various propagation regimes in the two-component case, but also allows us to classify the correction, the asymptotics of the correction, the different propagation speed, and the sign of the coefficient minimal. I should say that. Okay, I should say that we have also looked at stability in the scalar case. So, Panos, in his thesis, did a stability analysis of the scalar Fischer-Konogorov equation with a cutoff. And he found that basically it is going to be spectrally stable in some suitably defined, suitably weighted space. So the question is, then can we look at nonlinear stability? Can we also look at stability in the two component case? Stability in the two-component case. And finally, I should say that we have also assumed, maybe somewhat naively, that here the cutoff threshold is the same for the two species here, U and V. So one could easily generalize that, and one could consider two independent thresholds, and that would lead them to a two-parameter singular perturbation problem, which would make this even more complicated. Yeah, because I think that's a good question. So your last example, it was four-dimensional in E, and you were showing us an invariant plane where two of the components were zero always. And then we had stuff that was attracting. And so, what happens if I go out of that planet? Would that QU? Out of that planet, would that cue you, for example? Would I have an unstable manifold? Is there dynamics that takes you away from here and then perhaps takes you back? Or is it actually a boring case that all these equilibria are here and that's what all the... Yeah, yeah, these are quite boring, yes. Yeah. Okay, pity. It is a pity. Another question. Yeah, sorry. I don't know whether this fits into the model. Into the models that you described now, but if I imagine some general reaction diffusion model of some species on some domain, if the domain is somehow large enough, then I would imagine that at some point it could happen that all of my density falls below the threshold and somehow my entire dynamic is being killed by the threshold. Is that something that needs to be taken into consideration? Well, I mean, basically, the Basically, the orbits that we have in the system without the cutoff, you know, they basically show us where we're going to end up more or less in the phase plate side. Am I misunderstanding your question? So, for instance, in this model, without the cutoff, we have these fronts that connect these states. So, basically, we know where we have to do the designularization and where these interactions are going to. Singularization and where these interactions are going to happen. Maybe I have a different model in mind now, because I don't know exactly the formulas that you showed for the model that you were considering. But I always kind of imagine some physical domains. Reacting and computing. And diffusion over time, you know, decreases my distribution. Yeah, but I'm I'm looking at propagating fans, right? I'm not looking at the general use part. So how to phrase this? You have a hammer and then you like to use it. But you show there are all these other ways to approach the problem. And so could you elaborate a bit on why your approach is so much better? Bit on why your approach is so much better than all the others, or perhaps I did not say that at all. That's what I want to hear. Okay, so I think in the scalar case, are you talking about the scalar case or just in general? Well, so are you saying that in general your approach is the only one that really works? No, no, no, I'm not saying it at all. I did not claim that. Well, maybe you should start with your answer. So, I think what I could say, I think, in What I could say, I think, in the scalar case, which is quite well developed, the geometric approach, I think, has the benefits that if you look, for instance, at this Naguma equation, right, you can classify with this. I'm not claiming that you could do it any other way, but you basically see the reason for the sign of the correction to the speed without the cutoff. Without the cutoff and the asymptotics in epsilon, very naturally from this blow-up transformation. Because the blow-up transformation imposes on you a scaling between these various variables, which then when you describe a transition map, basically imagine these two manifolds mandates what this correction is going to look like. But then to do the blow-up, you have to somehow be very good at guessing how to do the scalings, right? Yeah, well, this is okay, so that is a different problem. Okay, so that is a different problem. So that, you know, as Peter said, you have to do a bit of guesswork sometimes, or you're inspired by what others have done using matches in total analysis. There are some systematic approaches like this, a new polyhedra, for instance, that you can apply. But I would agree, so there's a bit of, you know, there's a bit of maybe art involved and guesswork involved in this. But once you do have this blower, once you have the scaling, then all of The scaling, then all of this is basically obtained quite systematically and almost algorithmically, I would say. I don't know if we have time, but I have two questions. So the first one is just this table. So in some world, there is, so the cutoff is coming from some modeling, right? From some small particle limit remote. So in some world, there is a truth. Somewhere there is a truth, a truth answer to the question how fast do these things spread, right? So, which one is it out of the stable? I think what has been... No, I think just like these are very hard submissions. Yes, I think what has been found is that, you know, maybe I'll be correctly if I'm wrong, but what has been found is that the cutoff reaction diffusion equation provides a better approximation to the propagation speed in these uh multiparticle systems in some cases. Multipartic systems in some cases. Right, some cases because there's time scales, right? The speed of the pull, for example, is like varying over time significantly depending on how your distance correction where the speed is like one over. So do people agree on what, so they say the hard cutoff for so I think this is this is literally, you know, it is one, I would say, quick and dirty, you know, attempt to address this discrepancy. It's something, you know. As something, you know, it is something that is, I think, motivated by, you know, what you can discern from this multi-particle system that you simply do not, you know, have particularly. This is the limit of a branch. Yeah. It's exactly these corrections. That's how it's proved. Which makes me think why do we need corrections then? Proving the continuum result going back to the particles. I think what I've also read is that simulating large multiparticle systems is very expensive, and so if this provides a better approximation to the propagation speed, for instance, then it is worth something. But I don't think there's a rigorous correspondence I I don't think a rigorous correspondence has been established between the you know multiparticle systems and this this approach, which I think is a little bit interesting. If you get to chip in a small piece of information from combustion theory, where you also have these fronts, there you have this additional variable, the energy, the temperature, and the cutoff actually doesn't come from small particle units, but it comes from the heavy unit, which then goes into a different regime and just doesn't react anymore. There it's a very good approximation, but it has to be in the switching in the temperature. Yeah, so not the the course it's not unstable. Maybe my second quick question we have a quick answer. So in the anomalous spreading, is there a because they're not frauds. In Matt's paper, these are not good spreading, it's not governed by coherent structures by frauds. Do you have any guess what the correction is? Is there a correction? This is still a question. I have no idea, but it's something that we need to look at going forward. Actually, thinking about how to prepare this talk and then looking at some of the literature, I realized that it is much more complicated than I thought it was going to be. Thanks a lot.
