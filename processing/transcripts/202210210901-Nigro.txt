He was just with us. It was just us. Okay. He'll be here very shortly. Okay. Well, welcome around to the last day. Thank you for being here. And we only have one talk and then we'll probably do just chatting around. I know it's new reports in the schedule, but it's like if we don't have enough people to talk, just like kind of like chat around for the party. And our speaker for today is Antonia Nibra, and she's going to talk about. Today is Antonio Nibra, and we're going to talk about our molecule. Thanks, Laura, and thanks to organizers for the education and for organizing such a wonderful conference. So today I'm going to talk about joint works with my colleague Alexabel. And so before beginning, I'd like to just make an idea how this we get. Vague idea of what is we got here. So we were working with Vodura Log and so eventually we found this algorithm which characterizes chronic symmetric functions through these functions, through set of rel relations. And motivated by the study stem conjecture, we we were trying to make uh this algorithm uh work. These are going to uh work uh to in such a way to make these texts uh uh positives. But uh it we feel we feel that uh we tried a lot, but we think it's it's uh it's gonna work. So the next thing maybe try to do is maybe try to enlarge your so because there is the this relation with geometry and with SML variety, maybe you can try. Maybe you can try to enlarge your set of spaces where you will play with the homology. And so this is when I will start to talk about the loose cigar ID. Okay, so let's fix Labores of Groot of but I will always think about Taipei, so you can touch the flags. Flags. And so let's start with a flag with the NOTY V bullet and consider IJ is the usual conditions to out intersect with a fixed flag. our flag B. So super varieties can be described like this. You fix remote nation W you fix uh permutation w and uh you look for uh flags uh such that uh that have this intersection with a fixed flag fj fj okay so there is a this way of putting this into the language of league groups so you can you can do a couple of modifications so instead of playing with another fixed flash Playing with another fixed flag, you can move your original flag by twisting it, by multiplying it by x. And so, and this is the condition. You conjugate by g minus 1, x, and you ask that this counts from the start of some element in the group? Yeah, so x is, I would always assume. X is a I will always assume it's a regular semi-simple element of the GLN. Okay, so an important class of permutations for us is I think also for you is the co-dominant permutations, which is permutations which are characterizi characterized by this pattern uh avoiding, so permutation which avoid three, one, two. Which avoid 312. The good thing is that they are once you have a permutation, you can build the SMER vector, also a deep path, and which reverse. So what is very simple? What's your like a You just put the dots up and you stay as high as possible. This is the first available slot which is not taken. And you go here and you go here. Okay, so why are COVID permutations particular? Because it's a way to recast recasting SMA varieties, right? So an SMA variety. So an SMA variety uh is uh is um remember definition when the documentation is co-dominant this uh gives uh inclusion conditions. Yeah. Okay, okay, so you use I mean yeah, you can figure that that answer the question, sorry. Yeah, I mean here I maybe I should I should uh it speaks enough. It's uh it's not uh subject uh it's not varied. Subject so far. So thank you. Is it true? It's the same as the one that X V V and X V are in the closure of the device L corresponding to the closure. Okay, so uh this definition works uh in general, not only for with regards to misinform and you get more complicated things. Complicated things. And so we have that. We can consider. So this is the Hessenberg variety definition, the why. Are you just showing us that you can identify it with a loosely variety? Yeah, so yeah, it's clearly a class of example. Okay. Yeah. I mean if you look at the implementation If you look at uh the permutation metrics and the record conditions, you will always have conditions of the kind of the kind uh Vi. I mean, it's always maximal, so it has to be included. It just is dimensional condition is always maximal, which means it's included. Okay, this go down. Okay, so Okay, so given these lucid varieties, like super varieties, they are similar in general. So if you want to try to play similar games like we saw this week, like with the dot action and computing forbidden factor, you need the interaction. And the natural thing to look at is the monologue. The monodomy action. And so you can, you know, defines this character and this result, which is actually already obtained by Lustric, which says that equals the character of a certain element of the Kazal-Lustig basis of the K algebra, which we will talk very quickly in a moment. It's in like character sheets, like one, two, three. Character sheets, like one, two, three, four, five, six, one of one of those things? Like, where is it in this thing? In one of those character sheets? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think it's not five. I'll be it's in one of the first. But it's like really hard to dig out. Oh, yeah, of course. In fact, it happened that we went to when we finished the result, we discovered that. No, but I think it should be a different proof. I cannot guarantee there's no way of understanding what so many steps. Okay, so so when W is uh is predominant, there is uh result of uh T MOP and um of And of Mathieu that this character equal the omega dual of the chromatic symmetric function. Omega dual, that's good. We talked about these things already. Okay, so I will not really talk about the rest of the talk, but I think just to give you an idea. So I think Matthew the other day. I think Matthew the other day t was talking about the brave derivations, right? And so actually I'm just passing from the permutation group to the group algebra. And then we want to tweak this relational that this dependent functions. This i squared equal to one, one mean E. I should write here T E and so this thing is also. So there is this thing, of course, if you look at refreshment, it can be like random, but there are good reasons why this is useful. So of course I will not tell you, but so in the end, so Tw is defined in this way. You take a reduces expression for your permutation, and I mean, of course, you can do this more generally for the While group or coxeter system, yes. So this is how you define Tw. And so there is an evolution which we can define in this way. It takes Tw to the Twelver minus one and Q to the one-half to Q minus one, one half. And so you get a lot of things which are basically very similar to the case of when Q is equal to one. So for example, you get that. So, for example, you get that irreducible representations of this algebra are by partitions. And it's just a difference in terms it's a CQ vector spaces or those models. So, these elements are characterized by this property: you want the evolution. This property, you want that the evolution fixes them, and you want this that you can express these elements as with zeta equal to w in the raw order with certain polynomials. And of course, you have to calculate the degree here is easily more or equal than the degree of this minus this will be very better. Okay. Okay, so the way I important probably became very popular because these polynomials measure the singularities of the issue of varieties in a very precise way which is measured by the intersectional homology, which you see which computes the machine which are related to the or at the other singularities. So, in a way um So in a way uh I just say it's this okay so uh theorem of uh m um Mark, the collaborators, they prove that when the W is codomiant, this character of Hadza Lucig element corresponding to the codomian permutation is uh equal to omega dual of Equal to omega dual of the quantity symmetric function of the corresponding indifference graph. And also, actually, they did it for also in general for smooth permutations. So, the conjecture here of Iman is this the character of this Kazan Lucy Galent, independently of this W, is always H positive. Always h positive, and of course, this recovers the standard stamp, right? Because it's W is co-dominant. So H positivity with omega 12, we consider E positivity and okay, so parabolic loosing varieties. So let's recall the definition of loosey varieties. Of Lucy varieties. So, as I said, it's like the one for SMM varieties, except now we are looking for differential varieties. We don't just look for inclusions, which usually give you, always give you like towers and bundles, smooth things. Before you go into this uh I just had a question about the um the previous conjecture, Heyman's conjecture. Previous conjecture, Heyman's conjecture, is this. Has there been computationally checked? Have you computationally checked this conjecture much? Or for non-smooth permutations, for example? No, no. Like n equals eight, you don't know. But but yeah, I mean No. But but yeah, I mean no. Actually, I mean of course it's sort of a contra example example, just expectations were a bit too optimistic, but nothing wrong with this conjecture. Yeah, well hopefully, yeah. Sorry, what did you sorry? So he's referring to the result that we had that was I'm a conjecture that uh Yeah, I'm a conjecture that uh for W whatever, it's it has to be a a sum with one without uh coefficients of uh characters of uh condominiums. But that turned out to be false. But this one is still true, as far as we know, yeah, but like a matter of like whether it's checked like whether it checked at n equals eight to some I mean, I guess there are a lot of permutation. A lot of permutation. Yeah. We did. Okay, so we have, let me recall for you the definition of positive variety. So as I said, it's the same, just that now instead of inclusion, instead of saying, you know, variety, just okay, so it is a defined analogy with two rights. So now we would like to do the same thing. So now we would like to do the same thing with parabolic, right? For example, we would like to have a similar parabolic sh Grasman, Schubert, varieties, things like that. So we fix a parabolic subgroup and in a lot of JC the complementary of the actually in this transpositions, simple transpositions. And SNJ. The uh SNJ is uh uh the set of uh minimal representatives when you quotient uh send by the parabolic on the left. So this is again classic definition for people playing with uh partial flags. So this is a square variety inside a partial flag variety. See the the conditions of course the Conditions, of course, the F is a full flag, and instead the V is a partial flag, and you are intersecting these chains of vector spaces with this fixed full flag. Okay? Okay, so as I said, this U dot is just uh general. Okay, so now we can try to be naive and uh try to extend this definition, no? Try to understand this definition. So the thing is that I have, for example, let's go in an extreme situation, like in projective spaces. So there we just have v1 and xv1. But there is not much we can do with intersecting the two things. So if the intersection is zero, we get sorry, if it's if it's one, If it's one, or greater than equal to one, one dimensional, we get the fixed points. Otherwise, we fixed lines, which corresponds to points, boundary space, and otherwise we take all the rest. So, okay. So, this is the this is the the idea and the idea The idea is to refine your flag, your initial flag, playing with it, and in this way. So if you start with this, you start generating VI1 intersect with X V I, then you intersect with X V I two because V I one is inside V I two this is induces this inclusion and so on until we you arrive to V i k. So you see you're To Vik, so you see you're refined, because they're here. This was your original star, right? So you're putting between all the species. And so every time you get a more complete flag with more pieces, and you so and you keep you so uh so you do this process and you get a new slide. And you get a new flight. So collapse the things which are redundant. And then keep playing the game until this sequence stabilizes. And you get an element of the partial signal that you were considering at the beginning. Because the it's it's changing the parabolic, right? Okay. Because we are you are not adding more pieces every time. So is it some is it like uh something that would contain J? Yes. Okay. Yes, exactly. It would be J. So aren't you just using so any pair of partial bytes can be given right and there is global order and allocosity. Well, that's that's uh that those are the things from which we we begin, right? From things in the double cosets. Right? And then we create maybe I can play this this game with an example. I don't know if maybe Um so we with uh this example J is one three four so we are projecting to the graph manager G25 so I look here so the dimension of the intersection is zero and I want to play the game of we saw before so I take v2 intercept it x v2 which is inside v2 Set the text V2, which is inside V2, and then I sum them up. So we know that this intersection is dimension 0. This is dimension 2, and because this is dimension 0, this is dimension 4. So I will call by before this thing. Is this all independent of X? Yeah, yeah, I think it's X is regular semiconductor. X is regular semiconductors. So this is V4? It's depending on how X sits relative to V2, though, doesn't it? For everything's diagonal, I think it will diagonal. It's diagonal. This is the standard thing. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. That makes me think. So now we look at X V4 to set it with X V2, right? Now, and it tells me that it's a maximum. And it tells me that the dimension has to be one. I look at the xv2 intersected v4. I see that the dimension has to be two and the xv4 intercepted v4 and the dimension has to be three. So um okay, now I iterate the the process. I take this flag and uh I do the thing that was in the previous slide. thing that was in the previous slide. And so I get V2 inside intercept2 effects V4 inside the V2 inside V2 plus this thing, which turns out to be V4. So now this thing is one-dimensional. So I put now also V I have a V one and X V one and I keep looking at uh I collecting just because I call that thing just because on the condition that now I introduced by introducing V1 in the flat. So we get XV1, the set of V1 0, right? So XV1 has to be inside the V4, and so on. So um so now we have uh So now we have uh yeah, just uh rewriting this with this notation and we reiterate again the process and now we get that V2 plus V4 V1, that's dimension 3. So this would be my last element of the flag. Put it here and here and And here, and this is the condition. This will be one inside the X V tree. Because the dimension has to be one. This is one dimensional, so it has to be contained. Okay? Pair of partial flight is complete. Okay. So whatever condition you're putting. So whatever condition you're putting right, but but how to describe the once you fix a condition how do you describe explicitly the shape the things in terms of the original flags? You can explain. I mean we can you can explain me later but I'd like to okay so this is probably a list a complete list of conditions which determines this open set of the variety. And so I mean it doesn't look great maybe I think Look great, maybe. I think it's gonna be hard to describe this combinatorily in an efficient way. Who knows? Maybe. So here is a complete list of examples in Gasmania, which might be interesting. So I compared the partial closing varieties with the corresponding sugar varieties. Each were varieties. So here we have only xb2 fixed by b2, so it's six points. And this is the corresponding Schmidt variety. It's just a point. So here you can play this game the way we did before. And we get these conditions. So V2 has to be As to contain a fixed one-dimensional vector subspace and is contained in a fixed three-dimensional subspace. So this should give you 12 lines. And so this is just one line, no? So we can sorry, I'll be one of lines, I mean. Lines, I mean. This is also, sorry, twelve uh keywords. So this is just one of the V tools that contains a fixed one-dimensional space and should give you four uh V tools. So this is likewise this condition, which is your V tool here again. Here again and so and then this is the device or not this this condition this is a bit more complicated to visualize but it's a it's again a blow-up followed by by a contraction and the area of the last one which coincides so it's not separate in this case. And uh you can compute the Frobilius characters and this is what you get. Notice that like in the expression of SML varieties, if you sum up the coefficients, you get the polynomial of the corresponding Schubert variety. Okay, so now there is the special case, this example with the projective space. So we looked at the look at the at the set of minimum representatives of uh sent by J, which J is maximum this part one. So these are the representatives and so these are the varieties you get. So which is turns out to be equivalent to say ask the view. out to be equivalent to say ask that V1 is contained in a k-dimensional subspace which is fixed by X. So right, so if X is simple, it's the diagram matrix for example, then you get that this is the union of the coordinate planes in the projective space. So, I mean, changing name, then you can look for the normalization map, which just separates these things, right? And it's useful because you want to compute the intersection homology of the thing below, which is computed by the actual homology. By the actual homology of the normalization. So you get this connected thing, union of things, and you have a natural action, OSN, which permutes these things into the Fabian scale, create it, and this is what you get. It's not appearing here. I just say that this thing is equal to ih star of this film. But does it depend on the oh no. Oh, nothing. I mean, just I'm just looking for one of these general varieties and I'm looking at the action, this natural action on the component, and then looking and taking the components halfway. In fact, this is the only thing I'm doing. It depends uh on w on on the the case that you fix it. And fixing H H K was defined in the previous slide? In general. Oh, in general, what you want to do next, you mean? For arbitrary purposes. Oh, I mean, well you will see it probably. I just understand what's the general how general is your class function? I mean, but allows for that. Let's see. Let me see if I if it's uh okay uh so okay, so we have this theorem. I don't know if this is correct. So we now want to project from the full flag here to the parabolic to the partial flag and uh so just forgetting the some terms of the VI's and uh And so there is a position here, and it gives you, it tells you that the homology of the actual homology of the push force is isomorphic to this point. Um so the LZ Z W J are are local systems. Um so this is similar to uh what happened Similar to what Em was talking yesterday. So the difficulty, so here this is nothing, no, it's a job very important here. The thing here is to guess what are the things in support and the local systems. And so the theory of LUSIC, we get that what happens. That what appears here as a result is the new signal right. And our result here is to have an idea more precise about what those local systems and it turns out that they are induced by a certain subgroup of the group of SN. So the conjecture is here is So the conjecture is here is that these local systems are representation representations. So that means that for me this character is H or it's some kind of H? Again, the action, because here there is no dot action, at least I mean not the usual thing because Because these bases are singular, it is one of the requirements by GKM. So the thing is the original thing that Luzig was looking at is not doing actually. Does this imply Heyman's conjecture? Or if it was true, yes. So So here is a example without computations. So consider this Lucy variety and project to the Rasmanian. So you want to check that writing explicit equations, that the map is 2 to 1 generically. This is important. This is important because it's what the visor omega is. And so if you consider the local generically two to one colour, you can consider the local system given by permuting these two sheets. And so this is L corresponds, of course, to the regular representation, it's just soppling them. And so in this more complicated concept. In this more complicated construction, you should see this as embedded the diagonally to S4 like this, and this would give you the persistence. So the thing here, again, we did this precise computation to look how the direction stratifies and this is what arises. But the thing is that now after you compute explicitly the things, so you can compute the Explicitly the things, so you can compute this by subtracting to this the rest of the expression, and what you would get is that this thing will not be e positive. Okay? So, quite simple that it's gonna be find maybe a contraxable, but uh we believe that this was because the way we projected was not uh We projected was not the right one. Okay, so speaking of which, this is probably the way one may hope to things, right? So the idea is to project, to forget one thing after the other. So in this case, you have a more a grip on the description of the of the group which induces the local systems which is like this and so basically always happens that the varieties becomes irreducible so you can you can divide the contributions. You can divide the contributions and then induce this representation on the on the on the SN format that the Franco was telling you the first day here. So the hope here is that once we project in this way, if and you start with W colombinat, then Then unless Zeta is also prodominant, the DOCA systems are zero. So they will not show up in the support. So let me show you an example, maybe illustrate how this works. So we start with the permutation, which we have a setter element, which so corresponds to the path graph and which is a And which is a point everybody's familiar. And so these are the conditions. Notice that, of course, corresponding to a hodomy permutation, the conditions are inclusion conditions. So we forget, we start with forgetting before. And so the this is the image. This is the image, okay, which contains this locus. So this mark is birational. In fact, it's an isomorphism over the complementary of this inside P, inside here. Okay? And here the fibers are P1s. And so this the homology the composes like this. The composites like this. This plus this times q. So now we want to compute these things. This I would this we will do it uh inductively. So now we will take care of of this and uh so this is uh the condition. This is uh the condition. So notice that this two three one and four five. So four five are the first two things where you can see your permutation like breaking, right? This two three one just in a square and then it breaks up there. So so notice that this is the this is the path. The common this is the path now on three vertices, right? Which as very well known I always hope this just press close it you have to tell the full screen to make to do it. And L goes back to full screen. So it splits and and so it it becomes uh this and actually we have uh you have uh two copies which we can permute and the in the end and it's uh get it's uh h2 that's a good question like back back back when the first theorem were some kind of dig using the oh sorry I'm just going Oh, sorry, I just got it. And then you make that conjecture. Maybe that conjecture. Yeah, okay, so if you take, if you go to the parabolic as the whole group, so you just map down to a point, that just corresponds to standards. Local systems, yes. But those local systems. That is the original conjecture. Conjecture is just, that's just the standard. That is the original conjecture. I mean, with the cube, the Resmax family's terminology is a payment conjecture. Precisely. So maybe one way to So maybe one way to view it, what your conjecture is, is like a way to go partway, like try to go halfway. Yeah, exactly. Like one step. Yeah, and try to go step by step. This is the only thing that we could think that might work. As because you saw that is a control, then it's trickier otherwise. Even if you have a permutation which is permutation representation. Potential representation, it can give negative. That's what you were saying in the next slide. Right. But that doesn't mean you're, oh, you said that. This thing, as a, you see, it's a problem, as a decent local system, but it gives negative. Well, can I just try and repeat to make sure I'm understanding the goal is to find the right sequence of parabolics. But there are a lot of things that we. Uh things that uh we we d we don't know. Yes, one one idea is that one idea is to characterize this class L. We think that uh if you project sorry I can get lost if you project it in this way every time that the positivity so so here we are so you So here we are. So you can keep going with this computation, and now, sorry, I think to forget B3, and now you get these two varieties, one is inside the other. And so you look at this permutation, which splits here, because this is an unconsecutive thing. So this is what the complete graph from two vertices, so it's just a graph with. The path with and so we get this format for the here times H3, the three representation of the three representation. And so instead this we keep projecting and this is probably the last step. So we get two things, one is inside the other, and so the map is a log. And uh so the map is uh blow up actually, so the fibers are retrieved on the the point fixed uh lines. Put up everything together and you get the known expression for the coincidence function in the h. Plus, if you do the omega dual, it's actually the coincidence function in the ease. So now uh we want to do something uh in the completely in the opposite direction. So now we were uh forgetting every time one was one thing, now we want to go all the way to PL. Okay, so we just we forget everything but the d1 so so you had to again you request the elements. Had to get into quizzes theorem, so the HI's, as we saw, are particularly nice, right? And so now it's a matter about describing the L i's and computing their character. Okay, so because these, because of the little computation I presented before, the HI's are just this coordinate planes, right? Which have intersection. Right, you have intersection, but when you take normalization, they disconnect, and you get this. So the goal here was to find a communatorial description for this character. And so now I would open to spend the last minutes for a bit of communatorials. So just to have a better grasp on what is gonna On what is going to appear. It will be interesting, I think, to remind this result of Stanley, which gives a description in terms of our sums of the chromatic symmetric function. So consider this set of permutations, you can think as functions, and their graph is below the Estenberg vector. Or M. Okay? So now take the second decomposition of sigma and I mean if you just want to write this formula you're done. Okay? So I mean this is the sum over things which are below Things which are below the big path, take the decomposition in cycles and you sum them up, those P lambdas. That's that's it. So for that, doing the thing that we want to do, instead we keep the game. So every cycle now we order it from in we put at the beginning the the smallest element, okay? And we order the cycles in such a way that uh In such a way that those initial elements are ordered increasingly. Okay? And then we get something like this, and then we remove the parenthesis. So we get a new permutation. Okay? So if you do this, you get this formula where I still Where I still have to tell you so, what is this and what is this? So, this is the weight of sigma. So, remember, we started with sigma, which is without m. We did this game, we remove parentheses, we get a new permutation, sigma c. And now we want to take the number of inversions of g, in this. Of uh G the in the first graph of sigma c? I guess it must be pi. Yeah, of course. Thank you. And and rho also is defined inductively like this, just instead of taking n, you take n cube. Okay? So those are the rows which are substituting the p. The rows which are substituting the piece, and this is the weight. Okay, and this rows should be very, some very ultra simple specialization of some McDonald thing, but I don't know anything about it, I guess. So, before going here, I just want to say I think because of the oldest, maybe who be interesting. Maybe it would be interesting also to notice that. So we have this formula omega of CSF of Gf is equal to that sum, that weight and here we have roll album. And the thing is that LLT of GM is equal to the sum, Q, the same weight, but now we have Q. But now we have uh q minus one to the L minus uh uh the length of sigma times uh E lambda. So the difference is literally substituting this into this formula. I don't know if you can so um So the theorem is that if we call the if define by the robin g k of g m the omega dual of the character and k can be 0 till n minus 1 so then we get this explicit formula. Notice that the formula is very similar to the one before. To one before. It's just that the first, yeah, okay, because this is real weight. So it's very similar, just that instead of P1, you have H with this index. LK is that local system that you get from the on the on LK is capital L K is the local system that you were getting. Yes, yeah, just once that the K points the The correspondence of the K-plane, the fiber, the K-plane, the union of K-planes is multiplied by that local system. Yes. Exactly. So now, so a few considerations. Of course, this is a very specific polynomial, and it's obvious that it's second to compute the degree of this function. It's of course asymmetric because it's defined in terms of sums of products of symmetry. With in terms of sums of products of symmetric functions. And so this is the formula with Q. Again, the same weight as before. And just substitute the P by the rho. So corollary, we can write the chromatic symmetric functions in this way. Okay, so it's n minus i q e n minus i g i and this is because of that formula before, right? Computing that character. Remember, there were these things which were splitting, so we had this part, and it was remaining this to compute, which is exactly what we did before. So, because this is a character of a function, this is really true positive. Okay? But I think it is an interesting problem to prove that this is true positive homeotorial. Actually, we really don't know basically anything about this G case. It really. I mean your conjecture is your conjecture from back conjectures from back back there conjecturing that it's a positive I mean if the k equals one of the almost extreme cases is conjecturing that it's e positively break it now oh okay um so yeah so so I mean it's already a problem which is very surprising already we don't know also what what are they counting in the monomial expansion. What are they counting in the monomial expansion? Just to give you an idea of, we don't know much about this. Okay, so, but we can do something explicit in some cases. Actually, in when you have the path graph. So this is what we get. This is the jerting functions for the gk of pk plus 1 and And of course, so of course this is straightforward to see that this is E-positive because it's just as far as the series form. And of course people which have worked on these things will recognize immediately the similarity with the original Stanley work and the work of Michelle and John, two versions in in their seminar paper on the In their seminar paper on the chromatic quasi-symmetric function. And yes, so we get the positivity for the leading coefficient for q equal to one of in the expansion of the g ka of the g k m uh the the highest uh The highest this is degree k, so it's E K. And by that formula, that before, the very simple formula, especially in the symmetric function, is the sum of E n minus i times G I, this um of uh of uh the positivity of uh the coefficients in the expansions uh the things of uh length two. Things of length in the and of, I mean, I I thought I wrote it a lot different. So, oh yeah, but it's here, yeah. So, the conjecture is that this this is also impositive and of course would imply understand which. Question about varieties. Which kind of varieties? Yeah, because it wasn't clear what is the input variety, right? So we want to apply this this computist for Benjamin's character of the USIC varieties, which we introduced at the beginning. And I'm interested when X is regular semi-simple. Yeah, right. So you have something. So you said you will introduce something for a border, right? Oh my god. But we said like We said, like, oh, we position, and then we repeat. These are just the projections that I have. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right. You can define them, well, I think if you know, right? No, I don't. Yeah, you can define them as so you take a W in WJ, okay. Um notice that but anyway, so and define So, and I define so I have digs on W of a fixed an X, okay? And I take the image with projection to the parabolic with the parabolic PJ and this is this is ellipsoid W J of X. You can this is a little bit of a I One curious thing is that here if you take another representative, you fix you fix a class, W, and if you take another representative, then you can get not the same thing, something inside, which is not true for supervarias, which instead you get the same thing. Which one of your papers contains the material? No no no. Can you go back to that path graph expression? Uh with the E no, further with the E E expansion or E generative function. I think the right-hand side up there has an at least a oh this yeah oh yeah I know that when you when you expand it in the monomial basis you get polynomial derangements yeah no it shows that in the paper with the mean crew we have uh at least interpreted as a acyclic orientation Oh, yeah. And that should correspond to some type of colourings. Maybe there's like a colouring interpretation with some restrictions. Yeah. For example, G0 computes syncretic orientations which have a single sync as it is at the vertex one. Yeah, that's poor English. I mean explicitly yeah. But in some cases you could. Not always. No, not okay. No, no. But you don't know the LK is, but you know you know the other part. The other part is I mean your theorem. Yeah, we don't know what the candidates, the list of candidates, but then what List of candidates, but then what exactly is going to show up? We don't. No, but I think what Anton is getting at, you know, you have some variety, actually, like family of varieties times these local systems. Yeah. But those families of varieties are like smaller hasenburg varieties and they're parabolic. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's zeta. In this class, I think I wrote it explicitly, though. Because there was something actually. There was that theorem where you said, like, you know, you did the composition theorem, but I mean, there was something. I think you went to the car away. The way you wrote it was like Yeah, 'cause those Y Z J X yeah yeah. J X. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. It's links here. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just wondering. So using different projects, you can get different ways to decompose the components of that exam. Yes. Can you make a using, for example? Some kind of conjecture that would be fine input. It's already finding right. No, but for instance, you can ask: what if some there is a way to isolate every project using this instruction? Um so if you start with the smooth the smooth case, um then then you don't it's not really intersectional co-watch, but are the things on the right possibly singular? Yes, yes. Oh, so even if you start with smooth case, you get singular case. I think he has started with the smooth case, then. No, I mean not still this theorem. This theorem is not, but uh yes. When this is very interesting, it's when you start with codominant, and it was just conjectured that we expected uh less the thing. Expected less to think that you get below the size of a dominant system and so you that's what your comments had a reversed one.
