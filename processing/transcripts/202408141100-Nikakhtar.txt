Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. It's a great meeting. So, you all know about the problem that we are interested in in cosmology and astrophysics. I'm going to talk about the reconstruction. I'm muted. It's not in the mic, right? It's okay, it's good. Perfect. So, yeah, as Nikhil said. Yeah, as Nikhil said earlier today, in the universe, we have dark energy, we have dark matter, and regular matter. And I want to talk about two big questions today. One is the famous question that Nicola and Bruno told about. How can we move back the evolution of the cosmic structure? Like if we have a full simulation or observations and we have the cosmic evolution, how can we reconstruct the initial condition from one simple snapshot? One simplest net. And another question that I'm interested in is: how can we quantify the out of equilibrium characteristics of galactic systems? So, in general, galactic systems is like if we zoom in in one single object here, there are galaxies. So, in these cosmological pictures, every single dot is like a dark matter halo or a cluster of galaxies, a very large scale that we treat them as single points. But if we zoom in, each point here. In each point here is like basically a galaxy. So we have stars there. There are the disk of the galaxy, there are these arms, there are interacting objects like dwarf galaxies or satellite galaxies, or these, I don't know if you can see, but there are some streams, right? So that's a zoomed in problem. And the older scales are more related to dark matter, while the larger scales and the evolution of the universe is more. And the evolution of the universe is more related to dark energy and you know expansion. So, these are the two questions I'm trying to talk to you about. And so Nikhil talked about Desi. And this is a movie of a picture Nikhil showed you. So again, each point here is like a galaxy, right? And you observe these galaxies. And we observe these galaxies with dark energy spectroscopic instruments, the one which is in Arizona. So everyone, one thing which is famous about DESI is that DESI is going to map the universe. It's going to be the largest 330 map of the universe. We're going to observe like 40 millions of galaxies. And so we have some galaxies that are close to us. There are different types of galaxies at different distances. Distances, different redshifts, or and as you know, galaxies that are further from us, they are there for the time where the universe was younger. So basically, the distribution of matter or distribution of galaxies as these regions are like less evolved than galaxies that are closer to us. So, this is what Desi is famous for, but Desi also observes. But this also observes stars. It also observes around seven millions of stars that are inside the Milky Way. So very, very smaller scale, just around us. So these contours are basically the Milky Way, the overall shape of the Milky Way. So the center of the Milky Way, if it's there, we know sun. This is the edge on phase. This is a ZX, for example, and this is a phase, right? So if the center of the Milky Way is there, we know. Center of the Milky Way is there, we know the sun is about to distance from the center of the galaxy, and so what we observe is like local around us, right? So, we cannot observe everywhere in the Milky Way. We have a local sample of the stars that are around where we are, right? And so, for the galactic dynamics problem, or that's understanding the equilibrium of the Milky Way or how much. Or, how much like stationary we have in this system, in this galactic system, we want to use these stars. The main difference observationally, the main difference between galaxies and the stars is that the galaxies are very far from us, right? So basically, if we are lucky, we can observe their position, but not their velocity, right? Yeah, there are different types of galaxies. So, for example, I mean, we call So, for example, I mean, we call the closest one names or labels that we put on different types of galaxies. So, the closest one are brightest galaxies, or people call them BGS, bright galaxy sample. Other LRGs are luminous red galaxies. They're galaxies that are more red. ELGs are emission line galaxies. They're the galaxies that meets lines or some specific features in the spectrum. And QSO are quasars, basically. So, they're different types. It's like so there are different parts that the way that we observe, yes, the way that we observe because we want to observe spectra of each of these objects. So it's easier to observe some one type of the galaxy at a specific distance. There are different tracers, actually, that we use. But yeah, so for galaxies, we know the position. So it's like the 3D problem that we know X, Y, Z of these objects. We want to do, for example, reconstruction, the problem that we've Reconstruction: the problem that we've been talking about since morning. For stars, we know positions and velocities. So it's like a 6D problem. We have xyz and vxvyvz, right? So that's where we go to phaser space. And we want to, for example, do something with the with the actually the goal is understanding the potential of the military. That gives us something about the dark. So these are. So, these are probably, I'm just repeating some basics again that you heard about this morning. So, for cosmological reconstruction, we have this problem of how can we move back the evolution of the cosmic structure, right? So, we want to start from this final snapshot, and we want to reconstruct the initial condition, which is uniform. So, and this is very similar to this cross-sound problem, right? We know the location of some bakeries, we know the location of some cafes, how we want to distribute. Of some cap is how we want to distribute cross-son from bakeries to capital, right? So that's the main connection to optimal transfer. That's the either. If we want to go to some more details and just to set the terminology, we want to say that initial, whenever I say Lagrangian, I mean the initial condition. And they usually show the position of the particles in the initial condition with u. So we know that position and there is an initial velocity. That initial velocity Velocity, that initial velocity, as Nikhil explained very well, it's basically gradient flow, and this potential is the Lovich potential. And so, I mean, it's obviously we take the divergence of this initial velocity, we get this Laplace, and it's like the initial density, it's Paulson equation, the initial density of the Lagrangian space. But the actual trajectory of the particles, they don't move on a straight line. Move on a straight line as like the simplified version that we discussed by Nimoni. They have actually a trajectory. They move on a trajectory, they can start orbiting around each other, right? And they finally end up in a position, which we call X, and they have a finite velocity. So if you just connect these Q positions to X positions, there is like a vector, a true displacement, right? By reconstruction, what we want to do is to reconstruct things. is to reconstructing actually, you want to get as close as possible to this true displacement, the reconstructed displacement field. You want to get a displacement which is as close as possible to the true displacement of the partners. We do not care about orbit reconstruction. We don't want to take, we do not want to reconstruct the actual trajectory of the partners. So Bruno mentioned about throwing away the potential part of the action. The potential part of the action, right? So, another way to think about that is that when we want to run simulations, right, we have this Poisson-Neutron system. We know the Poisson equation, we have conservation of momentum, and we have continuity of mass, right? So, in these two equations, we have R. And so, having the potential means we need to know something about the gravity. So, because for reconstruction, we want to be as We want to be as agnostic as possible about the model. We want to be as model-independent as possible. That's another, I mean, that's another support for not looking at these two equations when we want to move things back. If we want to reconstruct the actual trajectories, basically we need to solve all of these things backward. So, because we just want to get this displacement, we only care about the kinetic part of the action that Bruno showed, or we just want to solve a concept. Showed, or we just want to solve a continuity equation, and so this continuity equation is basically Mon-Jam-Pere equation, or the linearized version of that is what Nikio showed. Just a divergence of displacement is negative of the density. So, just the different perspectives to this problem of why we want to solve a continuity equation and not doing anything with these two other equations because we don't want to deal with the potential. You don't want to deal with the potential. So, you all know about Jar's theorem, and basically, what we get when we do this OT problem is like the red points are our final positions that are clusters or that are scattered. And the blue dots are perfect greed points. This is a discrete, discrete form of the problem that we talked about. And this is not a new idea. And this is not a new idea. These two papers that Bruno also showed proposed this idea of solving this assignment problem. And we know the cost function here is like a quadratic cost function. In the discrete, discrete case, we can play with the quadratic cost function. We can add more terms or modify that. But we get basically two dual potentials, right? One potential is the potential that is defined. One potential is the potential that is defined on one module, and the other one is defined on the initial connection. And these two are Legendre transmode. But so one issue with this discrete, discrete form is the complexity of diagram, right? It's a slope. It's an S squared log n. And so we cannot do anything to make it faster. But the idea that Nikhil was talking about is that we know particles do not move that much. know particles do not move that much, right? So we cannot do anything with the NS squared log n. And ns squared, well, basically, when we put things on a grid, it doesn't matter how many objects that we have, the number of grid points is that n that we have, right? But we can change the coefficients of this complexity, right? Because we know we don't want to search all the grid points. Particles just move locally. So that's one thing we want to do for a discrete. For a discrete phase, if we want to make it faster. But another idea that Bruno talked about, there is another motivation for semi-discrete. And that motivation is that what we observe, they're not single particles, right? We observe like a cloud, like a galaxy. And so we know these galaxies are not coming from one single point in the initial condition. They're coming from the patch. They're coming from the patch. Basically, we have a patch in the initial coefficient that is collapsing into one single object that we observe here. So, if we're doing reconstruction, I mean, if we want to think about the reconstruction problem as a semi-discrete OT problem, in addition to getting displacement for each object, we can also ask for, you know, what's that patch, or what's that cell, or what's the region that each object is coming from. Object is coming from. And that's a possibility that semi-discrete reconstruction gives us. We do not have that in the discrete, discrete case, or we do not have that in the case where we put everything on a system. So between discrete, discrete, semi-discrete, there's a trade-off. Well, speed is one thing. And the other thing is that, I mean, do we want to get these shapes of the cell, initial cells or not? Or can we become, okay, so another. Can we become okay? So, another thing from this side is that the semi-dispute reconstruction, the L2 norm, like the quadratic cost function, is a crucial thing for it, right? We cannot play, cannot play with the cost function in the semi-discrete space because we need to have those probably surfaces, right? Probably surfaces that do not show. But we know in real life, in actual observational data, the quadrature cost function is not the perfect. The quadratic cost function is not the perfect cost function, and we need to play with it. We need to, we cannot, we need to have an anisotropic feature in the cost function. So, again, that's a plus for doing it with a synchronization. These are the two things I wanted to talk about, but so again, semi-discrete. To better understand the evolution or the dynamics of what we do for the semi-discrete reconstruct is that, let's say, if we start from this game that we have like. This game that we have like the same number of blue and red points, blue points on a perfect grid. If we, instead of the one-to-one map, if we do it one to four, or if I just go to finer and finer grid, you see there are some cells, there are these shapes, right? And so these are the exact shapes that Bruno was talking about. These are Lagers. Like what these are Lagers. They're weighted Voronoid areas. And weighted in this case is that if the mass of each red point is similar, you want to have the same area for each cell. And it's called like power diagram, modified Bernie diagram, or logarithm. And just because it's a partitioning or tessellation is a geometrical process. Call process basically doing this for a number of cells, it's like n-login, it's much faster than discrete. That's a gain we get in the speed if we do semi-discrete reconstructions, not the discrete discrete reconstruction. So, to just better understand this evolution or the dynamic of the objects, Bruno mentioned that it's nice that, for example, each point doesn't need For example, each point doesn't need to be inside the cell. And the physics of that is that, for example, let's say this is a patch, right? So all the matter which is in this patch would end up in this final position. So by doing this reconstruction, what we are capturing two things. One is the collapse of these objects, and one is the movement of the center of mass, right? So particles are collapsing and So, particles are collapsing and moving. That's what's exactly happening in the universe, right? So, for example, when we want to see how one galaxy is formed, it's not like that all the mass around that region has collapsed into a single point, right? We have collapse and motion, movement of the matter to form objects basically. Black holes and all these things are very small scales, uh, like objects, right, or or properties. And so everything that I'm talking about here is just about dark matter, or basically when I say galaxy, I mean dark matter halos. The galaxies form like all the process to the astrophysical process that are involved with gas or pressure and forming stars and galaxies and then black hole at the center of the galaxies. Then, black hole at the center of the galaxies, they're much smaller than the skills of each of these objects that we talked about. Here, everything is dark matter. But when we want to move to observational data, we observe galaxies. We do not observe halos, for example. So, there are some subtleties of how we want to group galaxies to form something like a halo, and then reconstruct that group of galaxies. So, yeah, this is just the dynamics of structure formation that we see in the OT language. So, I mean, collapse and movement is two different things that we see. Halos, basically, yes, a group of galaxies, basically. Yeah, a group of cluster of galaxies. And so, to better see this, I can show Bruno's. I can show Bruno's fancy uh reconstruction code real time. So this is like a 2D simulation of particles. And so basically what the construction does is this map. We start from a uniform distribution, it's mapped this clustered prompty. This clustered clumpy cosmic web pattern that we see. So, if we look at the if we look at the key, these are the displacement fields. These are the displacement vectors. So, again, if I just play with the time, these are displacement vectors that we see. And if I rotate this thing, I can do it. I can do it easily so I don't have a okay good so again this is the map that we have right and so this surface here yes here this surface here is basically that Surface here is basically that effective potential from which we take the gradients, it would map everything to the final position. So that's the, you know, that's the dynamics of this O3 construct. If you want to go backward and forward, this is what we are doing, basically. So, good. Okay, so everything I said was in 2D, and the area of these cells were like the same because the mass of each red point is equal. But what we actually have, we need to do this in 3D. And this is the 3D example of this semi-discrete reconstruction. And in 3D, And in 3D, different particles or different halos have different masses. So, here we have some of these big thumps that are like massive halos, and we have some tiny particles that are just dark matter particles that are not even in the halo. We call them field particles or dust particles. And so, when we do semi-discrete reconstruction, we get large patches or large cells or large halos. Or large halos, and these tiny cells in between or the particles that are not inside the halo or the dust part, right? And to do that, well, if you want to apply, so going from 2D to 3D was the biggest step, doing it in a weighted way, that we weight different objects, different mass was another step. But to do that, we need to know, I mean, if we want to operate on real data, real observation, we need to know the mass. We need to know the mass of every single point that we have, that we observe. That's a bit tricky from the observational side to estimate the mass of each galaxy that we observe. And also, in the real universe, we do not observe everything, right? We only observe galaxies. We do not observe, for example, dark matter particles or even very small mass galaxies that are, I don't know, not that bright. We have a brightness limit, for example, for our observation. For observation. So, this is the missing mass that Nikhil told us about. So, there are these two points. One is knowing the mass of every single object. Another thing is the distribution of the particles, the remaining mass, the particles that are not inside the halo, or that are not inside galaxies that we observe. It's called these dust particles or field particles. So, these are two open big problems that we have, or we are trying to deal with. And there are some, there are some. And there are some raw ideas that I will bring up later to open up a discussion and see if you have interesting ideas to deal with these issues that we have in our and okay, this is a 3D print of this figure. This is me. I made this 3D print and you can just see the reconstruct of the universe in your hand. This is a 3D print with all these placeholders. All these placeholders, just cutting these holders, to get that cubic box. So, thank you. But anyway, so you see, this is exactly the same thing that we have here. And so, you see, some of these cells are like very straight cells, some others are like more isotropic spherical cells. And Some of them are like more pancake-y shapes. So, this shape analysis is also something interesting that we are working on. So, for object to object, halo to halo, or individual galaxies, what's the shape evolution of this? It's the same shape. Good. Yes. So, just to see how well this reconstruction works, actually, right? So, this is one single halo. They're all the parts, these blue particles are all the particles that form one single halo. And so, there's a specific mass. That means 10 to the 14.7 solar mass. And this is like the center of. And this is like the center of mass of this single halo. So we know all the particles that are inside this halo. We can trace them back and see where they are in the initial condition. These black dots are the exact same points in the halo, but in the initial condition. So in physics, we call this patch, in Astrophysics, we call this patch the proto-halo. This is the patch or region finally ended up in a halo, right? But it's like Right, but it's like in the initial tension, same particles in the initial temperature, and so the cell that we reconstruct for this specific halo is this cell. It's one single cell, and all these things that it's a 2D projection of one single cell. And these things that we are seeing here, these polygons, are faces of that lager cell to the neighboring cells around us. So, one thing that we have done is that to see how close. See how close is the purple cross, which is the center of mass of the black dots, this green cross, which is the barycenter of this cell. So that's what we tested to see how close we can get those two center of masses. But in general, we can try to quantify these shapes and see how similar are these two shapes, the shapes of the proto-halos and the shape of the reconstructed cells. Shape of the reconstructed cells. That's one thing a lot of the fuel speech distributions is planning, but doing a proper shape analysis of these options. So basically, what we have in this reconstruction, we have three different vectors, right? Because it's a simulation, we know the true answer. We know the Lodge displacement, which is just the initial velocity, but it's not totally correct for this. For displacement objects, it's just the initial velocity. It's one vector field. We know the true displacement, which is the exact, when we connect the exact position and the initial position to the final position, in the final field. And we have the OT reconstructed displacement field. And we have the initial density frequency. So these plots are just R of K. R of K is the plot that. Just R of K. R of K is the plot that Nikki was showing in the morning, is just the cross-power spectrum divided by the auto-power spectrum between any two fields. So basically, from top to bottom, we see, okay, so it makes sense. We expect to get one for initial condition and theta, I mean, the divergence of this vector, minus of the divergence of this vector. So we expect it to be one, which is one, which means initial condition and the divergence of the low-witch display. Of the Dovich displacement field, they are exactly the same thing. We have two displacements and the OT displacements in the second. So, this is what we want to focus on. How close are the displacements and through the OT displacements and through the space, the divergence of those two? And the other curves are different combinations of these three things. I just want to highlight that, you know, you had a very good. Good match between the OT displacement and the fluid displacement, and it's better when we work with halos actually than single particles. And the fact is that, for example, when we want to focus on single particles, particles start, they have a trajectory, they start rotating around each other, orbiting around each other, right? So if then we want to reconstruct them, it's possible to mismatch those particles to the initial condition, right? The position that we had in the initial condition. The initial condition, but we when we average over a region, when we work with like photo halos to halos, it's like we're averaging over some particles and we just focus on the trajectory of the center of mass of those particles. So that trajectory of the center of mass is more like a straight line than trajectory of every single particle. So working with halos with bios tracers has this advantage for us. Um and so yeah, this is the work that Sasha, um, one of our PhD students at Yale is working on. I just want to focus on the fact that okay, we have power spectrum, we have correlation function. Uh, this is this is a specific feature in the correlation function that people are really interested in in cosmology. And basically, you see, when you look at the power spectrum, there are some Vigo, right? And we know power spectrum is the Fourier transform of the correlation functions, and so those Vigos are like a delta function somewhere. Or, like a delta function somewhere in the configuration space, then we take the Fourier transform. And this is like a specific feature that we can easily observe. And that's basically the standard ruler Nikki mentioned in the moment. And so the idea is how well we can fit this reconstructed correlation function, or how well we can infer our parameters, our cosmological parameters. And so this middle panel, I just want to say. Panel, I just want to say that we have Lagrangian photohalos, we have halos in the Eulerian space, but when we combine the delta reconstructed and this divergence of the displacement field that we have from this optimal transport reconstruction, get much smaller error box. And people, cosmologists, usually get so excited when they see a smaller error. It means better constraint on cosmological quantity. Sure. It's basically simulating up to now: 13 points, yes, yes, yeah, 13.2, 8, 13.8. Yeah. Great. So, yeah, so done basically. All the everything I wanted to show you. I just want to open some. Show you, I just want to open some interesting questions that we do not have a good answer in the workload. It's one problem: dust modeling, right? So, basically, this is the full matter. We observe halos, and this is the dust. This is the particles that are not inside the halos, right? So, basically, when we observe, we are observing something like this: dusted, over dense, very bright regions. But we need to have an estimate of these particles if we want to do balanced. Because if we want to do balanced OT, right, if we want to map everything, so there are those problems that you know, how can we write a model with partial optimal transfer, right? Or unbalanced OT. I mean, if we just want to map halos, can we map them to like some regions, but not the full Lagrangian space, not the full initial function, or semi-balanced or two. If you have any ideas along these lines, we would be more than happy to chat with you. Lines would be more than happy to chat with you. So, we have done some tests for sure. It's like we try to what happens if we put uniform dust, right? What happens we take just halos is the generated dust model. It's like we take these halos, we smooth them with the Gaussian pair known, and we fix the amplitude of that, right? That would give us, for example, this generated dust. That's not that bad. I mean, it's still correlated with the true dogs, but you see it's very blurred. But you see, it's very blurred, right? So, for doing better reconstruction, we need to have a better model or doing something like an unbalanced. We don't need to care about us. So, that's one thing. This is a comparison. Okay. This is what Sebastian has done. It's a comparison with standard reconstruction, the linearized continuity equation that Nikki will show. But when we want to do standard reconstruction in real Do standard reconstruction in real data, there is an additional term which is related to redshifted space distortion. So, what that is is that this is a plot, this is like a galaxy survey that you think you might observe, but what you actually observe is this, right? And the reason is that galaxies, while we cannot measure their velocities, but they have. Not measure their velocities, but they have peculiar velocity, they are moving, right? So, for those that are moving towards us, we estimate the distance, it's like a Doppler ship, right? We estimate the distance differently from the ones that are moving away from us. So, basically, this is the observed field that we have, and there are these distortions, and all of these lines are along the line of sight. If we are here, they're all radial effects. How can we fix it? How can we fix that? And the effect, for example, in the correlation function, you measured, you saw the plot of the correlation function that was like pair counts in 1D. We can plot it in 2D. It's like, if we are here, I can try to measure the pair counts along the line of sight and perpendicular to the line of sight. So this is like the correlation. It's a 2D correlation function. And so in real space, like if we didn't have this. didn't have this distortion. The correlation function was like this beautiful ring. Everything was a spherical isotropic line. But just because of this effect, because of this particular velocity of the galaxies, what we observe is this anisotropic shape of the correlation. So in reconstruction, basically the place that the distribution that we start from is this distorted. And we want to fix that, we want to remove that distortion. To fix that, we want to remove that distortion, and so just writing some equations, this is this would be just the cost function that we have, it's not quadratic anymore. So, for example, if we want to run, that's the limitation of semi-discrete. If we want to run semi-discrete on real data, this is a problem how we want to deal with this anisotropic term. So, for example, the iterative algorithm that Bruno was talking about is about dealing with this problem. But for synchron, for example, the main reason we started thinking about a synchron algorithm with Nikki is that with synchron, if we can run it fast, this idea that particles do not move that far, we can easily add this piece to the cost function of a synchronous, of a discrete discrete algorithm. Okay, so I think I have like five minutes. In the last part, I want to talk about those that smaller scale part of Smaller scale part of the world that I'm interested in. So, this is a galaxy, right? This is our sun, and we have so many objects. This is like a star stream around the Milky Way. And this is another image. So, we are here. What we observe is just locally around us. We cannot observe, for example, this end of the Milky Way. But as I said, we can measure the position of the stars and velocity of the stars. We have 60 information of the stars. Right, so we have 60 information of the stars, just like this phase, right? And but we have only one snapshot of this phases, and we are interested in doing trajectory inference, right? We want to get the trajectory of that's basically why I asked those questions, Caroline, after your talk, that's how we can infer trajectories if we only have one snapshot. But we have velocities too. It's like we have something more, we don't have only positions, we have position plus velocity, but it's just one. Position plus velocity, but it's just one singular snapper, it's like snapped at time t. It's because we need to wait stars move and we can observe them. And so, I mean, since the very first time people have observed stars, it's not like that we can take two snapshots of the Milky Way or they don't, they're far. They move fast, but they're very far. So we know in phase and space, we have the loss of the equation, right? We'll talk about. Right, we'll talk about loss of Koker-Planck equation. And so, the idea is that we want to this phi. This phi here is like the galactic gravitational potential. It's a potential that is sourced by all observable matter and also dark matter that we cannot observe. So, in so many methods for years, I can say 100 years, first time that Jeans' equations appeared in physics literature. Physics literature, people need to assume that this part, the DFTT part, the partial derivative, is zero. We need to assume a stationarity to be able to solve for phi. So the idea, the very first idea of solving this equation is taking the moments of second. If we take the second moment of the velocity of the velocity equation, we get this genes equation or genes model that would connect potential to variance of the velocity, the velocity dispersion, basically, which is something easy to. Which is something easy to measure. It's an easy observer. But based on what we have observed in recent decades, we would say, we know Milky Way is not in a stationary condition. There are huge satellite galaxies that are falling into the Milky Way. There are these stellar streams that are moving around. And it's not in an equilibrium. We are sure that the Milky Way is not in an equilibrium condition. So, one problem is that how can we Is that how can we get, for example, potential without assuming that the partial dft is zero, right? Or even how can we quantify this out of equilibrium characteristic of the milkway? How can we say that how much milk weight is out of equilibrium? And so, yeah, this is the plot that Bruno showed for the rotation curve. And as I said, getting the potential would tell us about this profile of the matter in the Milky Way. Of the matter in the Milky Way, right? It would help us to better understand the nature of the dark. And so, yeah, the things that we've been thinking about of how optimal transport or how a gradient flow can be modeled in the Pasar space is that, for example, there in the Pasars, we have a Hamiltonian, like a scalar, right, as a function of x and b. And so, if we take a gradient flow in this space, if I, I don't know, if it might be a very bad. I don't know if it might be a very bad notation for mathematicians, but I'm taking the gradient of Hamiltonian in the phase space. It's a six gradient basically, in the 60 space. And so we know that the first part is like minus dv dt and the second derivative is dx dt. So if we want to connect basically the derivative of the position in the phasor space, the gradient, we have this simple structure. simplicity structure of the middle. So but one question that we are interested in is that in OT, I mean if you want to work in phasor space, what's the proper cost function or if you want to model this gradient, this gradient flow in the phasor space, how can we, I mean, let's say we have, imagine in simulations, we have two snapshots of the phase space, right? How can I map this one snapshot to another with the grade, with this type of grade? The grade with this type of gradients is OT is an answer as an answer for that. This is also another interesting question that, if anyone has any idea about that, we'll be more than happy. And so finally, it's just to show you how out of equilibrium system can be, is that, for example, it's a photo and this is like a satellite galaxy. But if we want to estimate the history of that galaxy, this is what happens with all the stars and everything that this dwarf galaxy. Everything that this dwarf galaxy or satellite galaxy has. So the situation of the Milky Way is basically like this: you know, when one satellite galaxy is falling into the Milky Way, there are these shells, there are so many stripping of the stars because of the gravitational potential of the host. And, you know, that core is still orbiting around MTA. We have some star streams that we see, we observe today. And finally, we end up, for example, in one position here. And this is, for example, one single. Here. And this is, for example, one single satellite galaxy that we observe. So, for sure, we know that a system like this is not in a stationary, in an equilibrium situation, right? So, how can we deal with? How can we quantify that or not? Perfect. That was everything. And thank you so much. And I should say, I'm also funded by DOE and all these things. What do we do with that? Do is that we say we know we have halos, right? We need to have a model for dust, so we generate some fake particles or fake dust for a distribution of the remaining mass that we do not observe. And the way that we do that is just saying this map should be highly correlated with this map. So we just smooth this map, scale it correctly with some some uh some subtleties, and then we generate, for example. And then we generate, for example, this field. I mean, this was what I would now call dark matter. You're calling dust. It's yeah, it's part of the dark matter that is not inside the halos because there is some dark matter that is inside, that are inside the halos, right? So they are fine. We have yes, yes, yeah. It's like some grouping on galaxies that we observe. On galaxies that we observe, and we can estimate of the mass for that group of galaxies, yes, including that. But what I call dust here are, I mean, in the dust, there might be some baryonic matter, like regular matter too, but because they are not that bright, we cannot observe. Just the remaining mass that we cannot observe, we call dolls. I just wanted to clarify maybe when you say that you want to study gradient flow with a Hamiltonian flow. Do you mean to look at the Hamiltonian flow as a gradient flow? So in terms of the terminology, if I don't want to say something wrong, what I mean is that let's say we have. No, what I mean is that let's say we have two different snapshots, two different snapshots of the phases, right? How can I map? Can I think about the map between two snapshots as an OT map or not? And if it's an OT map, is it a gradient map with respect to the Hamiltonian or not? Do we include the effect of general relevant keys? Well, no, and we don't want to do that, to be honest. And the main reason is that we want to be, as I said, as model independent as possible. So what we solve in reconstruction is just solving mass construction. So you're saying that it does get the observed. Can't be observed, uh, no, it cannot be observed. Yeah, we have a brightness limit for what we observe, for example. Yeah, it's in simulation. So, here, right, because it's a simulation, right? This is a full matter field, right? I can try to find the overdense, like highly overdense region. They call them halo, but these are like very bright points in this, and basically, this plus this. And basically, this plus this would give me this mass. So, this is the remaining mass that is not inside the helium. So, in observations, we have a similar situation. We only observe galaxies. There is remaining mass that we cannot observe. The question is, how can we model this? If we want to do balance built, if we want to move everything, if we want to reconstruct everything, there might be some ideas that we would love to learn more about. Can we just reconstruct these? Can we just construct this field as a as a as an unbalanced OT, as a partial OT? Right? So, this is the result of other models. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Thanks.
