Mario for the invitation. I also want to take this opportunity as the last speaker to say thank you to Jennifer and Mario for organizing this workshop. It's been fantastic. So on behalf of all the participants, thank you. So yes, I'm talking to you today about surface embeddings in R3 by the lens the crease set. By the lens, the crease set. This is joint work with Bill Monasco. Maybe more technically, joint work in progress. We don't yet have a paper posted, but hopefully we will by the end of the summer. So this is essentially we're building some new technology for studying surface embeddings in R3. This new technology is what we're calling the crease set. Is what we're calling the crease set. So let's just start off with defining what this crease set is. So we're going to be thinking of this as we're sort of motivated ultimately, thinking about these surfaces as ultimately being in some not or link complement. So that's sort of motivating everything going on here. So with sort of a choice of not or link, you have your choice of not or link projection. Of NAT or link projection. So that's sort of where we're coming up with this projection P. So we're going to be thinking about how we embed our surface in what we're thinking of as R2 cross R, how this surface folds when we project, where sort of the critical points of this projection are. So if we take just a standard embedding of a sphere that looks really nice and we project to, say, the XY plane. Say the XY plane, we just get our projection itself looks like a disk, and the crease set is this single curve that sort of is the pre-image of the boundary of our disk downstairs. So I'm going to generally be thinking of our crease set as living up here in our original surface, but I will also occasionally But I will also occasionally speak of it as though it's living in either, you know, are on the embedded surface or in the projection plane. One thing I want to note here is that I'm going to be assuming that our projection is sort of sufficiently nice so that we're actually getting these collections of simple closed curves as our crease set. So we're just sort of So we're just sort of perturbing our embedding so that we're in some sort of normal form, normal position. The other thing I want to say is that if you think about just take a torus as your surface embedded standing on end, and you think about projecting that, the projection will again look sort of like a disk, but you'll actually A disk, but you'll actually have two crease curves. You'll have, um, well, maybe you need to perturb this slightly. You'll have one that sort of looks like this. And then you have one that sort of does some funny business where it sort of looks like it has corners. It's sort of folding over itself. So I'm going to, you get sort of this. You get sort of this two crease curves that project to look like a square inside of a circle. And I'm going to, for the moment, ignore this. You can, again, perturb any projection or any embedding where you're getting these sorts of weird folding, what we call corners. You can perturb your projection along Along a collection of arcs, just a small amount, and get rid of all of these corners. So I'm going to assume that we don't have any of these. So let's look at some more just nice examples. We're going to focus primarily on the sphere here. Sort of, we don't even need to worry about this torus picture. So this is our standard sphere. We can alternatively sort of pinch in, cinch in. Pinch in, cinch in a belt around the middle of our sphere, and this suddenly results in three crease curves. We have these three sort of bands, one for the belt where we cinched in, and then one on top and bottom. So, this gives us a crease set where we have a collection of three closed curves, even though our projection down to the plane still just looks like a disk. A disk. Here's something else that can happen. You've taken your ball and you've sort of your sphere and you've tied it in a knot. You project it down and the projection itself looks kind of funny. You're getting a disc with three poles in it. But if you're paying attention to the crease set, you see that you have this sort of, you sort of recover the shape. You sort of recover the shape of your projection, just that or your embedding that you started with. Two more examples. So this is similar, this crease set of this embedding looks exactly like our cinched sphere did. But now instead of cinching in with a belt, we're sort of hollowing out and making a bowl. So this is sort of a key pair of examples of these. pair of examples of these the crease sets look very similar but they're really sort of distinct embeddings um what i mean by distinct embeddings uh just sort of from the point of view well we'll get to this more in a moment um from the point of view of the crease set these are the same embedding but sort of they're fundamentally different and then our last example is where things start to get really fun and really interesting so i've interesting. So I've taken, how have I built this example? I've taken essentially two of my bowls and I've connected them by a yoke. So I've just added this band between the outer edges of my two bowls, this sort of double-ended ladle maybe. And when we project down, we see that we get five crease curves. We get We get our sort of inner and outer curves from both of our bowls. And then when we sort of yoked our two bowls together, that connected the third crease curve from the two to give us this sort of third curve that isn't embedded in the plane, in the projection plane. So this is a embedding that has a creaseet consisting of five curves. Set consisting of five curves. All right. So this is our crease set. What do we want to do with it? What are our goals here? Well, first off, we want to classify this crease set. What can we say about the geometric and topological properties that these curves have in relation to each other, in relation to the surface, in relation to how they look in the projection, number of components we have. Number of components we have these sort of form a configuration in the sphere. Can we say something about the difference if you have you know them nested or something else going on? That's our first goal. And that's what we're going to focus on mainly in this talk. Our second goal is to exploit the structure of the crease set to be able to simplify our embedding in some way, to be able to. In some way, to be able to say, here is an isotopy of my embedding that somehow simplifies what the embedding looks like vis-a-vis the crease set. So in some sense, we're trying to use, you know, hopefully come up with a way of simplifying the embedding so that it becomes obvious in the projection. So if we're thinking about a knot or link projection, we might Or link projection, we might ask for this. Is really getting towards the third goal here. We can use this to hopefully study links or knots. So if we have a split link, we could hope to be able to say, I can take this sphere, realizing I have a split link, and isotope my embedding, keeping track of the crease set as I go to actually be able to see this, obviously, just see that my sphere is. You just see that my sphere is there with my crease set is just a single curve, sort of this nicest example of an embedding and a crease curve. So we're not going to talk at all about this third goal today, besides what I just said, but that's sort of our long-term goal with this technology. We'll talk a little bit about this second point, but I'll just get to it at the end. And the amount I can say will sort of be limited by how much time I have left. I want to really Have left. I want to really focus primarily on this first goal. So I want to classify or characterize what this preset can look like. We saw a bunch of examples with a bunch of different behavior going on. Let's see what we can sort of glean from that. So I said we want to be considering, you know, doing these simplifications by some isotopy of our embedding. Isotopy of our embedding. I want to be able to sort of keep track and some of these embeddings, be able to say, when I'm classifying my crease set, I want to say what is my crease set up to some notion of isotopy. This is what we'll call a regular isotopy. So this is an isotopy of your embedding where your crease set is preserved by this. So as a collection of curves in your original surface, the crease set isn't changing. The crease set isn't changing as you do this isotopy. So, here is a cartoon of such a regular isotopy. We have two, we have our nice sphere with a single crease curve. And we can take our nicest embedding of it and do what you think you would do to make our sort of pretzel embedding. Lengthen the sphere into sort of a tube and then wrap it around itself. tube and then wrap it around itself tie it in a knot and you can do all of this while just sort of well while preserving the crease set so this is this is allow this is sort of what you should think of as being a regular isotope so this isn't going to change the number of crease curves that you have um that's sort of staying constant it's not going to change the configuration in your surface um oh Oh, yes. And this is just, we'll say that two beddings are regularly isotopic. Use this to say that. So let's return to our goals. Goal one, classify our potential presets. What can these look like? So I'm going to approach this goal with three questions. The first is asking what geometric and topological data can we read off. And topological data, can we read off of a creaseette? Is there something that we can immediately see about our surface just knowing, you know, if we're just looking at this collection of curves in the projection plane, we don't even know what embedding it came from. What can we say about the surface? Question two, what data are sufficient to actually determine our embedding up to this notion of equivalence, up to recula? Of equivalence up to regular isotopy. So, of this data that we read off for question one, what is enough to actually completely determine optoregular isotopia embedding? And then question three, which configurations arise? Which configurations can be realized of simple closed curves in our service, can be realized as the crease set of some embedding? And are there restrictions? And are there restrictions on these configurations, on the sort of data that comes out of this from our first and second questions? So let's start with our first question. What data can we read off of our crease set? So, this is our first theorem here, which is telling us something about the, well, okay, it's telling us. Well, okay, it's telling us about the image of our crease curves under first the embedding and then the projection. So, what the projected crease curves look like. We can immediately read off what the turning number of each of these curves is. So, the turning number is like the winding number, but you're looking at it in the tangent bundle. So, for example, if we have So for example, if we have our double ladle, our turning number for our four sort of nice just clean circles, those all have turning number one. So you go around in your tangent bundle, you're just turning around once. But our fifth curve, the one that goes across our yoke, as I've been calling it today, that has turning number negative three. That has turning number negative three. And any regular isotopy, this theorem is saying if you perform a regular isotopy on this embedding, you're not changing the configuration of your crease set. And so this theorem says that these turning numbers won't change. How this picture looks might change a lot, how the projection looks, but if you actually go and work out what the turning numbers are, those are fixed. Numbers are those are fixed. And this is what I just said. The turning number is preserved by regular isotopy. So we can say more precisely what these turning numbers are. They have to satisfy these two conditions, which is saying something about, so this first condition is saying, so we're focusing specifically on the sphere here. Specifically on the sphere here, the sum of the turning numbers of all of your curves have to sum to one. And if you look at these sort of flat subsurfaces, so you take your sphere and you remove your crease curves, each of these, each of the remaining components projects, if you follow the embedding and then the projection, that's, you know, that lets you. That lets you measure the turning number on the boundary of that. You're counting your crease curves. And there's a relation between what the turning numbers of the boundary components are and the Euler characteristic of your subsurface. And the idea behind this is just an application of Gauss-Binnet. Of Gauss-Benet gives you this tight connection between Turning number and Euler characteristic. One thing I'll comment: so these two conditions let you sort of determine just sort of working inductively from your innermost crease curves have to bound disks. And so they have to be have turning number one. And you can use this then with your subsurfaces. use this then with your subsurfaces to actually build up what all of your determine what all of the turning numbers have to be okay so that's question number one question number two which crease sets actually arise which configurations of curves in the sphere actually arise from some embedding as the crease set of some embedding so we can't So, we can't quite completely answer this, but we can at least say, well, this is actually fairly complete, at least for this sort of formulation of the question. We need an odd number of curves, and we need these to sort of satisfy the conditions from our previous theorem on the turning numbers. Previous theorem on the turning numbers. So we need to specify, be able to specify these turning numbers and have them satisfy these conditions. But as soon as we have that, we can build an embedding. We can build an embedding that has this configuration as its preset. And the idea is that we can build this. The idea is that we can build this, we can build the embedding by using the turning number data to build each sort of component of the sphere minus the crease set, build all these sort of flat-ish subsurfaces, and then glue them together. So this was the crease configuration for our double ladle. I'm doing this example again, but you can do this with all sorts of things. Of things. So step one is to determine that okay, we're good, we have an odd number of curves and we have this valid Turning number function, Turning number assignment. So we use that to build our flat subsurfaces. We get two pairs of pants that have to wrap around like this in order to get the correct negative three turning number on one of the components. One of the components, and then four flat disks, and then we glue them together and get our double ladle. All right, so question three, what data are sufficient to determine this up to regular isotopy? So this is where we don't quite have an answer yet. We conjecture that this should be completely characterized by the crease that can be... Characterized by the crease set configuration. As soon as you nail down the crease set configuration, you should be good to go. Although the tone of my voice maybe suggests there's a little bit more to this, remember these two examples that we looked at at the beginning. These have the same crease set configuration, but they're not regularly isotopic. There's a little bit more data that we need to keep track of. That data is what we call folding orientations. So which way the surface is folding. The surface is folding at a crease curve. So here we just fix some convention for which way is a positive fold and which way is a negative fold. You can orient the embedding of the sphere by which way bounds a ball in R3. We're just living in R3. And then say, okay, if I'm folding the inside to the inside, that's a positive. I'm going to say that's a positive folding. Going to say that's a positive folding orientation outside to outside is negative. So we conjecture that this should be enough. I'm leaving out a little bit here. We need to also say plus, you know, some sort of obvious obvious symmetries. If you take this second picture and just reflect through the x, y plane. Reflect through the XY plane, you're getting something with the same that's essentially the same embedding, but there's not going to be a regular isotope taking them to each other. So, we want to sort of add that in as another condition. But we conjecture, and we have, we really do believe this conjecture that this should be enough to completely determine the crease configuration, the embedding up to regular isotopy. So, going back to our question of which crease sets actually arise, we answered this when we didn't take into account folding orientation. But if we take into account folding orientation, it becomes more complicated because not every folding orientation assignment is going to be valid, is going to sort of actually give rise to. Actually, give rise to an embedding realizing it. So, this is a more complicated question than just can we build an embedding with a particular crease set? Can we take into account these folding orientations as well? So, I have very little time left for this second goal of simplifying the creaseet. So, let me just sort of go through this briefly, and I'll try not to flip through too many slides too quickly. So, our goal here is we want to, first of all, remove excess crossings from the projection. So, remember, you know, we have these two regularly isotopic embeddings of the sphere with a single crease curve. One of these we like better than the other because there are no, in the projection, there are no crossings of the crease curve with itself. So, the idea of how we can approach this. How we can approach this is to use something called what we define to be these transverse foliations. They're singular foliations that we define by using choosing some horizontal direction and looking at the level curves in that direction. So, on our left sphere, this gives us just a bunch of circles. And we have two. And we have two singular leaves that lie on the crease curve that are just points. Our right-hand picture, we end up with a bunch more singular leaves where we get some that are these figure eights. Here's just a single one, but otherwise the leaves are all circles. So this is just sort of a cartoon. So this is just sort of a cartoon and I really have one minute here. So the point is that this lets us see sort of, let's gives us another lens to view these, our embedding and these crease curves, how they're arising, and where these intersections are coming from. And we can count the singularities of our foliation and along a given curve, we have this inequality. So I don't have. Inequality. So I don't have time to get into where this is coming from. But the point is that roughly speaking, no, if we don't have excess crossings, then we actually have that this inequality is an equality. So on the left, we had two singularities, which corresponded to two times the turning number was just one. On the right, we still have turning number one, but we had many more than two singularities. More than two singularities. So our goal is to use these transverse foliations to sort of see isotopies that we can perform. And it turns out that we can really do this pretty well to remove these excess crossings. The second sort of aspect of this goal is to reduce not just the sort of excess crossings. Not just the sort of excess crossings and the projection, but reduce the number of curves. So we would ideally like to be able to, you know, turn this left-hand picture into the right-hand picture. The way that this is sort of sitting here, it seems pretty clear that, you know, okay, we have this annulus here going around. And if we just, we can sort of describe relatively well, it's not going to be a regular isotopy, but an isotopy. Isotopy, but an isotopy of our embedding where we're just shrinking our annulus to move these two crease curves together. And then we get something that looks much more like our right hand embedding. And I'm not going to get into this picture here because I'm already over time, but this is just another sort of simplification we have in mind that. Simplification we have in mind that involves essentially finding some nice cross section that doesn't intersect the preset too much and doing some sort of surgery along that to cut this and then turn it into something simpler. So I will stop there. Thank you very much. Thank you to the organizers again for this wonderful workshop. Okay. Well, let's. Well, let us thanks. Just wondering what else are we going to do after this, but let's thank Margaret in the meantime for this very last talk of the day. And do we have any questions for Margaret? Well, I do have one question. Do you think it's possible to generalize this kind of embeddings? But instead of working with embeddings in R3, with embeddings in a knot complement, just in a way that you can draw the embedded surfaces like in a knot projection plus criss curves, a bunch of crease curves, something like that. Yeah, so in fact, this is sort of Yeah, so in fact, this is sort of where we started with this: if you are familiar with Monasco's work on alternating knots and alternating links, he has this sort of standard position for putting a surface in your knot or link complement. And when we started working with this, we were working with that and sort of picking saying, we can see from this way of putting your surface in this form. Surface in this form, you can see these crease curves from that. So, we're very much doing this with the idea of working in a knot or link complement in mind. And, you know, when I'm describing these sort of simplifications very briefly, it is really with an eye towards, is this something we can do where there's an obvious way to sort of preserve the, you know. The, you know, some aspect of the underlying link projection or not projection, where we're, you know, hopefully not changing the, you know, not increasing the crossing number, for instance. Okay, thank you. Yeah.
