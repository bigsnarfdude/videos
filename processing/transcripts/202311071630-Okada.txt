Okay, so today I'll be talking about the weakly spherical representations and the weak either packet conjecture. Okay, so let me start the talk with some motivation in case you're not familiar with weak either packets. Okay, motivation. Okay, so the motivation comes from a paper by Warbash and Morgan in 85. Okay, so that's Maybe five. Okay, so the setup there is a complex reductive group G reductive group. Okay, G check is its Langlands dual group. Okay, and let O check the nilpoint norbit of the dual group. Okay, so in the 85 paper Okay, they attach to this nilpoint orbit a packet of representations. Okay, so as follows: so they attach to OCHeck a bucket defined as follows. So let E check H check F check be an SL2 triple. Thanks for our check and define IO check of G to be the set of irreps of G satisfying two conditions coming from the nilpoint orbit. Okay, the first one is that it has left and right infinitesimal character left, that's right. That's right. The decimal character one half h check and the wavefront set of pi is bounded above by the Barbarosh-Bogen dual follow-check. Hopefully, that's clear. Okay, so roughly speaking, the way front side has come up in Baying's talk yesterday. Talk yesterday. Roughly speaking, the wavefront set measures the size of the representation. So in their paper, they prove a lower bound. So among representations with this infinitesimal character, this is actually the smallest possible wavefront set achievable. So roughly speaking, this packet consists of representations with this infinitesimal character of minimal Gelfan-Grive, sorry, Gelfan-Kirillov dimension. Okay, so they're the smallest representations. So they're the smallest representations in this packet. Okay, so let me just say quickly, roughly wavefront set measures size. Okay, so this packet is the minimal ones. Okay, so the motivation for considering this packet is the study of the unitary dual. Okay, so Barash and Vogen were interested. Okay, so Barash and Vogen were interested in understanding the building blocks of the unitary dual of the complex group, and these building blocks they call unipotent representations. And in this paper, they were inspired by Arthur. Okay, so the unitary representations of arthriti. Of arthritipe what they found was that the uh the building blocks blocks were to be found found in these packets. Okay, so what do I mean by that? Okay, so what do I mean by that? So, in the context of complex groups, I mean all the unitary representations of either type could be constructed via parabolic induction from certain representations defined in these packets. Again, they have the so-called special unitary representations which have come up already a few times. Okay, so notably for us, actually, this packet is an either packet. Okay, and what happens in the real case, okay, so notably. Notably, pi check of g is nice to pack in. Okay, and for the real case, you can define an analogous thing. You can define representations with infinitesimal character one half h check. And you can put a similar bound on the wavefront set. Okay. Similarly, in the real case, what we get is the following. In the real case, what we get is the following. In the real case, we have that the packet attached to our check is actually a union of R2 packets. So it's R2 parameters on the V group times SL2 G satisfying Satisfying that it is trivial on the C cross part and the SL2 part corresponds to O chick. Okay. So this was this was shown in the NAPV. So these are the so-called So, these are the so-called unipotent arthriters. And I believe Lucas will talk about this in his talk: somehow the unitary representations of arthriti can be constructed via parabolic induction and cohomological induction from the representation found in these packets. So, somehow, these packets contain some of the interesting building blocks for the representations of our isotype. Okay, so the goal of today's talk. Goal of today's talk. The goal of today's is to see if we can do the same with pediatric groups. So, all of these invariants can make sense of. We can make sense of yes. I don't think so in my unnecessary. I'm not an expert on the real picture, so don't take my word. Okay, so with the motivation, let's introduce some notation. So now the main thing that we need to do for the p-adic case is get a replacement for the infinitesimal character. So the wavefront set makes perfect sense for p-adic groups. So we just need to replace the notion for the weight for the infinitesimal character. So let's define that. So let f be a finite. F be a finite extension of QP. Okay, WF, let me write the separate groups. WF is the V group or F okay, and then G is some connected reductive group. For the talk, let's assume inner to split. Inner to split. And we're going to write G for the F points and then MathFact G for the Lie algebra. And then for an irreducible smooth representation by And define, we're going to write for the Langlands parameter when that makes sense. Okay, we'll assume we have Langland's correspondence, and we will in the cases we're interested in. And then we define the infinitesimal character of pi to be the following. We define the infinitesimal character of pi to be the infinitesimal character of the list. Character or the associated L parameter, which is by definition a group from the vague group, so a homomorphism from the vague group into the dual group given by this map that we saw in the second talk today as well. Okay, so it's defined as okay, so this gives you some of it a decimal character. Okay, let me set up. Okay, let me set up some a little bit more notation. Okay, so for an a parameter, psi from the V group cross SL2, let me put a superscript D for the Delane, Delane, and SL2, A for the Arthur. Then, of course, we have the associated L parameter, which is Which is, we've, of course, seen before, which is just given by. And then finally, the infinitesimal character of psi is the infinitesimal character of its Langlands parameter. Actually, one more thing I want to associate to the L parameter is the nil powder orbit. Okay, so the SL2 restriction of the Langmans parameter to the SL2 factor, of course, gives you a nil-powder orbit via the Jacobson. They'll put an orbit via the Jacobs and Mars theorem. So I'm going to define aug check pi or aug check of the L parameter, depending on context, to be the standard thing. Okay, it's the orbit of this. Okay, so it's just the usual Okay, so this notation is set up. Let me tell you about the kind of representations we're interested in. Okay, so we'll be interested in unipotent. Representations of G. Okay, and an unfortunate clash of terminology, unipotent here does not mean the unipotent of the Barbash and Bogen, which were intended as the building blocks for the unitary dual. Unipotent here means of unipotent reduction. So if you look at restrictions to power Horic and then the resulting representation of finite groups, as we saw in Jessica's talk, these will all be unipotent representations. Be unipartin representations. Okay, so we call this category unit for G. And in terms of L parameters, these correspond to parameters which are trivial on the inertia subgroup. So pi is trivial on the inertia subgroup or the vague group. Group of the v group. And so since the quotient is just the integers, the infinitesimal character in this case, we identify it with the image of Rubenius. Okay, so this is just the semi-simple element which we denote s of pi, and this is the s that. And this is the S that comes up in the Karstan listic triple for the parametrization of unipotent representations. Okay, so with all of this set up, we can define what the weak arthur packet should be for p-adic representations. Okay, this was originally done in work in 2022 with Dan Shubataru and Nicholas Mason-Brown. So definition, I'll define it here. Okay, so definition. So fix a nil-point orbit. Nilpoin orbit of G check. Okay, and then we set psio check to be the SL2 homomorphism integer check corresponding to the following. Okay, so the lean part corresponds to our check. Again, it's trivial here. Trivial here, and this corresponds. Trivial here, and this corresponds to quite check. The weak arthur packet, let me put a superscript WA for weak arthr packet of G, is just defined to be the set of representations as unipotent representations such that the infinitesimal character of pi. Character of pi is equal to the infinitesimal character of psi o check. Okay, explicitly, the infinitesimal character of psi o check is just q to the one half h check. Okay, so rather than one half h check in the complex in real case, we get a q to the power of in the in the piadic case. And of course, the wavefront set condition stays the same. I kind of messed up the presentation here. Okay. Stop the presentation here. Okay, the wavefront set of pi should be less than or equal to the Barbash-Vogan dual of check. Okay, so I haven't really told you what the Barbash-Vogan dual is, but I will shortly. Okay, so let me say a few words about what we already knew about this Arthur packet. So this is maybe shorthand notation. So the infinitesimal character of psio check is just you have an SL2 homomorphism and it's just q to the one half. just q to the one half q to the minus one half uh psi comma one okay and then we write a shorthand q to the one half h check and this kind of makes sense if you think about it as well but it's not too important more to stress the analogy with the real case okay so let me say a few words about this so in So in 2022, Chibutaru, Dan Chibutaru, Lucas Mason Brown studied and myself studied studied this packet, and we made a few observations about it. So we showed the lower back. The lower bound on the wavefront set holds. So, indeed, the representations satisfying these conditions are the smallest representations with this infinitesimal character. And we conjectured an analogy with Barbash and Vogan and ABV that this is So this is a union of arthrpackets. Yeah, and this is what I refer to as the weak arthur packet conjecture in the title. Okay, this is the weak arthur packets conjecture. Arthur Packets. Yep. Yeah, so it's actually an equality. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. And we actually did a bit more, we gave an explicit description of the L parameters of the constituents of the weak arthapak. This was somehow a simple consequence of the work that we'd done on the wavefront set previously. Okay, so we actually showed the following the weak Arthur packet. Packet attached to our check of G can be described as the set of representations of the form. It's the Obese-Levinsky dual of all representations pi with infinitesimal character equal to Q to the one-half h check, together with the property that the Barbash-Wegendual of O check pi is equal to. Pi is equal to pi-bashfogen dual of O check. So, in other words, this condition is the same thing as saying O check pi lies in the special piece of O check. Again, I'll explain what that means shortly. Okay, so this is a starting point for my work with Max. I should say the weak Arthur Packet conjecture was pretty. The fighter packet conjecture was proved more or less at the same time. But they actually wrote a paper. We haven't written this down yet by buying a UN. Oh, shit, I forgot. And it is postdoc. Sorry, I should have written it down. Okay, so this. Yeah. Correct, yeah. Correct, yeah. So easy to value will preserve the infinitesimal character, preserves the category of unipoint representations as well. Yeah. Okay, so this is interesting for multiple reasons. So special orbits and special pieces play an important role in the Springer correspondence and finite groups of lead type theory. It's interesting to see that this came into the picture for the pianic groups as well. Okay, so this is the starting point. Let me Let me explain our proof. So we prove it for sp2n and so2n plus one. Okay, so before I go on to the proof, let me have an aside on special pieces and by showing duality. Oops. So, the section might be very familiar to some of you, or maybe not so much for others. So, Barbara Vogen duality, roughly speaking, is a map find as follows. So, the Voguen duality is a pair of maps in between the nil point. In between the nil point orbits of G. Let me just say in this section g is complex again. Okay, so it's a bijection between the nil podin orbits of g, which I'll call n sub O, okay, and the nil podin orbits of the Lie algebra of the dual group, which I'll call NO. Call NOCheck. Okay, I'll drop the subscript BV. There will only be one duality that we'll see. Okay, and an example of Barbash-Rogan duality is the case when G is GLN. Then the dual group is also GLN. And the nilpoint orbits are just parametrized by partitions of n. And then And there the duality takes the form lambda goes to the lambda transpose. So it's some combinatorial duality on the diagram. So the nil point orbits are, of course, described by the Jordan blocks. Okay, so I call this a duality, but this is a slightly misleading name for the Barbash-Wögen dual because it does not satisfy p squared is not the identity. Not the identity. Okay, so the situation for GLN is a bit of a red herring. So there it is indeed a bijection, and d squared is the identity. Okay, in general, it's not the case that this holds, but d cubed is equal to d. Okay, so it's close to being an involution. Okay, we also have, maybe let me list the properties. So d cubed is equal to d. Okay, and we also have d squared is always greater than. Squared is always greater than or equal to the identity. Okay, so if I take a middle point in orbit, I apply Barbara-Vergan duality twice, we get what's known as the special cover of the orbit. And this implies it's a bijection on its image. On its image. The image we call the special nilpotent orbits. Okay, so image of the bio-fogendule, either special. The Barfogen dual are the special null point orbits. And we denote it by sp superscript. Okay, so let me give a slightly more interesting example. So when g is sp2n, and g check is so2n plus. G check is SO2n plus one. The nil point orbits are now parametrized by partitions of 2n, which are symplectic, which means odd parts with even multiplicity, even multiplicity. Okay, and the dual side parametrized by partitions of 2n plus 1. 2n plus 1, and we're even parts with even multiplicity. Okay. Just to give a quick example in case you haven't seen symplectic and orthogonal partitions before. Okay, I should also tell you what the formula is. I'll just briefly state it to show that it's slightly nasty. It to show that it's slightly nasty. Okay, so we have dualities going both ways. So lambda from the symplectic side to the orthogonal side, it gets sent to lambda transpose plus B. And the other direction is lambda transpose minus C. So what this means is you take the transpose, you add one to the largest part, and then you take the B collapse, which just means The B collapse, which just means the largest orthogonal partition less than or equal to that partition. Okay, so these are the equations. So for instance, if we take, this is an example of a symplectic partition, the odd parts in this partition are three and it occurs with multiplicity two. Okay, and then lambda transpose you can easily compute is five five three one. Okay, lambda transpose plus you add. Lambda transpose plus, you add one to the top part, which is six five three one. And then the collapse is just given by five squared three one squared. Okay, so there are algorithms for computing all of these steps. Okay, so what are the special pieces? So this third condition that I wrote down on the other board means that the fibers of the Barbash-Ougen duality map can be described as follows. Okay, so the special pieces Pieces are defined as follows. So the special piece of a special orbit, so for O and the special and important orbits, the special piece is defined as the closure of O, takeaway special O prime. So, you can you take away the closure of all the special orbits below O. Okay, so roughly, just to give a quick example, so for SP6, okay, the nilpodin orbits are parametrized by the following partitions. Let me just see how I'm doing for time. So, we have the following partitions: three squared. 2 cubed 2 squared 1 squared yeah I didn't leave enough space unfortunately 2 1 4 1 to the 6 hopefully everyone can still see this yeah let me just mark out the special orbits okay these are special uh this is special this is special this is special okay so the closure of this is everything below it and then it's its own special piece And then it's its own special piece. Okay, here you take everything below it. This is special below, so the special piece for this is this. And these are all of the special pieces. And what is remarkable in the classical case is that these special pieces are actually very well behaved. So I should say these are exactly the fibers, by the way. So these are the fibers of the Barbershwegen tool. Okay, and you can't really see it here because everything's like one or two, but in general, special pieces are always a power of two, KSI is power of two. Okay, and they actually have some nice geometric properties, and they were extensively studied in 1989 by Kraft and Priseski. I'm sure I didn't say that correctly. Procesky. They studied special pieces. Okay, they studied special pieces. Special pieces for classical groups. And they gave the following very nice characterization of the special pieces. So I'll give that in a second. That in a second. Okay, so we need to define raising and lowering operators. Okay, so for partition partition lambda and an integer c define Define the lowering of lambda at c to be lambda takeaway c plus one, c minus one, and then union c squared. And we define the raising operator to be the inverse of this lambda takeaway c squared union c plus one c minus one. Plus one, C minus one. Yep. Yeah, sorry, I guess otherwise that would be a very silly definition. So as an example, so what would be the lowering of the partition 5 squared 31 squared? I've just introduced some notation, 5 squared just means 5 repeated twice. Just means five repeated twice. Okay, we take away five and we take away three and replace it with four squared. We get a four squared, one squared. And of course, the raising operator will return us back to where we were. So hopefully that's clear. Hopefully, what's also clear from these things is that if A and B. If A and B have the same parity T A, T B, T A U B commute whenever their composition is defined, right? So this only sees something one larger than C and one smaller than C. So if they have the same parity, they differ by at least two. Have the same parity, they differ by at least two. So, as long as the compositions are defined, they're going to have to commute. Okay, so for any set J of integers of the same parity, here we define t j to be t of a T of A1 composed of T of A2 T of AK where J is A1 up to AK. Okay, and similarly, if I is V1 up to BL, we compose this with the raising V1. Okay, so these raising and lower operating, lower. So, these raising and lowering operations will be crucial for what we're going to do. So, these exactly govern the geometry of the special piece. So, what Kraft and Processi showed is for a special partition partition partition lambda in a special piece okay we well okay let me say we can decompose lambda into a union of partitions okay still increasing so we're just chopping the partitions along at certain points and there exist integers c1 uh c k such that the lowering and raising Such that the lowering and raising the lowering operator is defined for each lambda i. So, for special partition, we can decompose and exist such that special piece of lambda is equal to j of lambda per j contained in c1 c k. Okay, so you just take a special partition. You just take a special partition and you lower them. And as long as you can do this sort of maximally in an independent way, this gives you the whole special piece. Okay, so just a very quick example. Okay, so if lambda is one, two, three, four copies of one, three squared five, okay, then the way we would decompose this partition is we'd first compose it like so. Okay, and then And then C1 would be two, and C2 would be four. Okay, so the special piece was we could either first lower by this, so Tc E2 of lambda would be, we'd collapse this and we get three copies of one. And then this would not change. Okay, we can lower at four, and this will give us four copies of one, and then four squared. And then 4 squared, or we can do both. In which case, this gets three copies of 1, 2 copies of 2, 2 copies of 4. Okay, so the partial order structure of a special piece is extremely well behaved. Okay, so particular, the size of a special piece is a power of two. Is a power of two. Okay, and the partial order structure is essentially that of a hypercube. So the inclusion of middle point orbits is just given by the inclusion of the lowering operator, the sets which we're lowering by. So in general, if we want to describe a special piece of a non-special partition, in general for arbitrary Lambda, okay, there exists sets I naught, J0, such that the special piece which Lambda belongs to, okay, now I'm abusing notation a bit, but this just means all the partitions in the same special piece as lambda can be described as t i j of lambda. I is a subset of i naught, j is a subset of j naught. And actually we can specify And actually, we can specify precisely what these sets are in terms of some combinatorics, but okay, I don't want to go. Yep. No, these are very, okay, so I just didn't want to write down the definition for, oh, these lambda i's. Yeah, you can also, you could partition them. There's a particular way of doing it, but. Way of doing it, but okay, but there's a more precise definition. I just didn't want to go into the combinatorics, otherwise, there would be some complicated parity conditions. But this is like the moral of what the special piece is. Okay, so the remarkable fact that makes this whole proof tick is that there are lowering operations for arthur parameters as well. Okay, so there are also lowering operations operators or eight parameters. Okay, so to make sense of this, let's briefly interpret the A parameter as a representation. So an A parameter SL2 SL2A DG check, let's for the moment assume trivial here. Okay, then what does an A parameter? Well, it's some irreducible representation of SL2. Sum irreducible representation of SL2 cross SL2. So we can decompose it as a sum of irreducible representations. Okay, where these are the AI dimensional representation of the SL2. Okay, maybe I should write square box. Yes, yeah, yeah, so you can assume G. Uh, yeah, yeah, so I've assumed G classical. I should have said that from the start of this section. Okay, so let me say G is sp2n for SO2N plus one, the split form. Okay, so we interpret these eight parameters as this direct sum. Okay, and so for if all the Bi are equal to one, then this is a tempered parameter and this is exactly the case. This is the case for for um Parameter psi O check that we're considering. And moreover, if O check corresponds to lambda, then lambda is equal to A1, A2, AK, this situation here. Okay, so the parts of this partition are just the dimensions of the first SL2. Okay, now note that if C minus one C plus one is contained in our partition lambda, then we can define the lowering operator on the arthur parameter CR check to be this subtracted by C minus one. One could be somehow the key observation is the following very basic fact is that the internal tensor product of Vc with V2 is of course isomorphic to Vc minus one. To Vc minus one direct sum Vc plus one. Okay, so the key observation is that this has the same infinitesimal character. In particular, the infinitesimal character of psio check is equal to the infinitesimal character of the lowered arthrit parameter. The following is the key lemma for the proof of the weak arthropactics conjecture. Proof of the Regiopactics conjecture. I should also, of course, say that the nilpotent part of the language parameter associated with size are check, and the nil-potent part of the length of the size of the size The nilpotent part of the Langlands parameter associated with the lowered arthrit parameter is equal to the lowered partition. Okay, so the following lemma is the key lemma. Again, this is a because it states that if p is a is an L parameter with infinitesimal character. infinitesimal character u to the one half h check okay and d of r phi is equal to d of our check okay then there exists a subset j or this set j0 associated with lambda such that e is equal to the l parameter associated The L parameter associated with EJ. IO ch Okay, so in some sense you have yeah, okay, so you have this so every every L parameter in the weak arthur packet comes from an arthur parameter obtained in this canonical way. Okay, so somehow one takeaway from this is if you look at the Vogon variety associated with this infinitesimal character. With this infinitesimal character, the partial order structure on the nil-point orbits there is in general different from the partial order structure on the nil-point orbits in the whole nil-point variety. This is saying somehow at the, so this is your voigon variety, this is the open orbit, somehow it's saying like if you're sufficiently close to the top, the partial order structure is exactly the same as the partial order structure on the nil point coin. Okay, so that's another takeaway. Okay, so that's another takeaway of this lemma. Okay, of course, we get as a direct corollary of this lemma. So I'm just checking time. And we go to the direct corollary. And this proves that AZ of the weak arter packet will check pi. is contained in the union of is contained in the union of either packets right because each one of these either packets contain the L packet for the associated L parameter and we know from the work in Chibatari Mason Brown and myself that this is going to be contained in here okay so Okay, so what remains to show to prove the weak arthapaket conjecture is the reverse inclusion. Okay, so the reverse inclusion inclusion we use relies on the machinery of Atobe. So, I won't go into the details exactly of the combinatorics that he develops, but roughly speaking, what we need to show is that if you're in the arthur packet, if you don't lie in the L packet, okay, so roughly if you lie in the artha packet for one of these parameters, okay, but Okay, but not in the out packet. Then there exists a smaller J such that you lie in the A packet for that J. So then there exists a J prime strictly smaller slash that pi lies inside of the a packet for tj prime psi check g okay and then noting that since with j Since if J prime is the empty set, then the either packet is equal to the L packet, TJ prime. So I check. This is just the tempered A packet. Okay, so you just induce on the size of J. Okay, and this gives us the reverse inclusion. Okay, so this concludes. So, this concludes the proof of the weak eye-packet conjecture. This is the gist of it. It does involve rather intricate combinatorics with the toe-based combinatorics. But there's a number of natural questions you can ask then. Okay, so there are a number of some natural follow-up questions. So, the first question. Okay, so the first question is: do the A packets in the weak Python packet generate arthritis representations? Okay, so we saw in the complex, in the real case, that the packets that you get are somehow fundamental. They're the unipotent ones for arthritis unitary representations. Okay, you can ask the same question. I guess you get a bunch of arthr parameters from the weak arthr packet. And there's some series of procedures you can use to build all arthur type unitary representations. Of course, one consequence of this. Consequence of this result is that the weak arthur packet contains unitary representations, which is not at all obvious from the characterization given in the definition, right, in terms of wavefront sets and infinitesimal character. Okay, the other question you can ask, which I'll spend the last part of this talk talking about, is, okay, I won't answer this, I don't know the answer to this. But we say set The collection of irreducible representations of G is A generated by a subset if two conditions hold. For every representation pi in the collection, there exists another representation. Another representation in the small collection, and an arthur packet big pi A containing both of these. Okay, so second condition states that for all representations in here and arthrit packets containing pi pi A contained in here. Hopefully, this definition is clear. We just say. Hopefully, this definition is clear. We're just saying a subset of curly C A generates it if you look at all the Arthur packets containing the smaller set. And the question is, do you get everything in curly C? Okay, and we saw in Baying's talk, there was a conjecture of Cloiselle, which said that the tempered A packet is A generated by the spherical constituent. It may be, yeah, so. Maybe let's restrict our attention to this case. So when J prime was zero, this was the anti-tempered A packet with infinite decimal character Q to the one-half H check. And Closel's conjecture said it's A generated by the spherical constituent of it. Okay, I think. Hopefully, I haven't butchered it. Okay, you can ask, does the weak Arthur packet have an interesting generating system? Arthur packet has an interesting generating set. Okay, and this was the first part of my talk's title. Okay, and it turns out, yes, and this is sort of the gist of what we've been working on, but also the shortest part of this talk. Okay, so theorem. And myself, is that the weak either packet attached to our check. Attached to our check is A generated by the weakly spherical constituents spherical constituents of Just the anti-tempered weekly spherical representations with infinitesimal character q to the one half h check. Okay, so I haven't defined what a weekly spherical representation is. I did in the abstract, but let me define it now. And we call a representation pi weakly spherical. If there exists a maximal compact open subgroup, such that pi contains fixed vectors. Okay, so this is exactly analogous to the definition of a spherical representation. So for spherical representations, you take the hyperspecial compact open subgroup. And you ask, does it contain fixed vectors with respect to that particular one? Okay, and as we know, these spherical representations play a very important role in decomposition of automorphic representations. Okay, so this generalizes this definition to any compact open subgroup. Okay, so for example, for sp2n, of course, if you fix Fixed pinning. The hyperspecial maximal compact, I mean, denote that by K0, is just sp2n RF. Okay, but there are many other maximal compacts, okay? So they look like this in general. So these are blocks. So these are block matrices of size R, R to N minus R. Okay, so here I've chosen with respect to the form given by the symplectic form given by ones on the antidiagonal and minus ones. So roughly speaking, there are a whole lot of other maximal compact subgroups for sp2n. Of course. sp2n. Of course the reductive quotient of this is sp2r cross sp2n minus 2r over fq. And the same goes for so2n plus 1, but somehow for sp2n since it's simply connected the maximal compacts are just the maximal parahorics. Okay but in general the maximal compacts do not necessarily have to be the same. Okay so for sp2n Maximal compact equals maximal poweric. But in general, say for SO2N plus one, then the maximal perihoric Might have index two in the compact. So I've omitted the modifier maximum, but okay, hopefully that's understood. So let me see how much time I have left. Three minutes. Okay, great. So my proof sketch is three lines long. So hopefully I have enough time. One minute per line. Okay, so how do we show Per line. Okay, so how do we show this? Okay, so we want to show that the weak arthur packet is A generated by the weakly spherical constituents. And roughly speaking, the key observation is, of course, weakly spherical representations, that you will hoist spherical representations. So you can transfer it to get a representation of the Hecke algebra. Okay, so let me call. Okay, so let me call that m of pi. This is a module for the Hecke algebra, okay, the Ahori Hecke algebra. Okay, and you can restrict it to the finite Heke algebra, okay, coming from the hyperspatial compact. You can take the deformation as Q goes to one of that module. Okay, and this gives you a collection of representations of the Vowel group. So we call this process, or we denote this process pi restricted to W, and these are the W types. And these are the W types. Okay, and since all of these representations have real infinitesimal character, being weakly spherical is the same thing as containing the W types of a W type of the form k, n minus k times the empty set. Okay, remember W here is Sn semi-direct product Z mod 2 to the n. Okay, so they're parametrized by Okay, so they're parametrized by bipartitions, and of course, the trivial representation corresponds to k is equal to zero. Okay, so if k if it contains this, then it then is spherical. Okay, and then so you need to study these structure of these modules, and it turns out they're just total homologies of springer fibers. So it boils down to understanding some special values of double Kostka polynomials. And these are generalizations of the famous Kostka polynomial. The famous Costco polynomials without the modifier double, which describe the transition matrix between Hardy-Littlewood functions and Schur functions. Okay, and then I should say this final step relies on some work done by Wasperget in 2019 and generalized by Rubin La, a PhD student. A PhD student of Danjibataru, now a postdoc in Hong Kong, to SO2N, where they compute some necessary and sufficient conditions of the non-vanishing of these special values. Okay, so that concludes the end of my talk.
