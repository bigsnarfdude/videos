Okay, so here we are. No, okay, so this is number two. Good. So, as I was mentioning, topological fluid dynamics is a subject that was inspired in the 19th century and then developed mathematically in the 20th century by a number of people. 20th century, by a number of people, including Vladimir Arnold, who considered the geometry of infinite-dimensional groups of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms as applied to ideal fluids, namely the Euler equations. In 1970, Eben and Marsden used this concept to obtain sharp existence and uniqueness theorems for the Euler equations in their famous and very well-known paper that was published. Very well-known paper that was published in 1970. And following this, there were many people who worked on topological fluid dynamics, just a few names, Sasha Schnellman, Darlon Holm, Tudor Ratio, Boris Haysen, and as a standard textbook now published in 1998, the book of Arnold and Haysen, which was updated in 2021, Topological Methods in Hydro. Topological methods in hydrodynamics. And for me, which is particularly interesting in what I'll be discussing today is topological magnetohydrodynamics, which was a subject much developed in the 1960s, 70s, 80s in Cambridge, and in particular by Keith Moffat. So this is the background. The background of the magnetic relaxation equations, which I'll be talking about. Next slide, please. Okay, so to remind you of the equations of ideal MHD, here they are written. These are equations for the magnetic field B, which is a vector-valued function of space and time, the velocity field U, which again, Velocity field u, which again is a vector-valued function of space and time. And these vectors interact via this system of equations. And this is ideal MHD. So we have no viscosity, no magnetic diffusivity. These two vector fields, divergence of, satisfy divergence of u equals zero, divergence of b equals zero, and are coupled as you see sitting here. So now, So now, something that is well known, but just to point it out again: if we consider this system and consider the magnetostatic equilibria for this system, let's call it a vector field B bar, it satisfies the equation that we see here. The gradient of P bar is equal to B bar dot grad B bar, and the vergence of B bar is equal to zero. If we now consider this same system and we look for an Euler equilibrium, Look for an Euler equilibria, namely, we assume that the magnetic field is equal to zero and there's no time dependence, we get the equation u bar dot grad u bar plus the gradient of p bar equals zero and the divergence of u bar is equal to zero. So we have exactly the same equations that for b bar, a magnetostatic equilibria, and u bar an Euler equilibria. So if we could find by one means or another, By one means or another, magnetostatic equilibria, we have also found Euler equilibria and vice versa. But just to remark, the stability properties of these equations, the ideal MHD equation or the Euler equation, the stability properties are not quite the same. Both from the point of view of linear instability, if we look for the spectral properties, which is about an equilibria for the MHD or for Or for Euler, some of them spectral properties are not the same. And for nonlinear stability, instability, also, it's not the same. But if we can find, by one means or another, a magnetostatic equilibria, and that is our goal in this magnetic relaxation problem, we have found an Euler equilibria or a whole family of such equilibria. So next slide, please. Next slide, please. So, as you know, there are many examples of three-dimensional Euler equilibria. Here are just a few: Hill spherical vortex, Hicks vortex with swirl, Keeter's elliptical vortex, which are also classical. And then actually a very interesting recent paper by Gravilov, which gives an example in three dimensions of an Euler equilibria with With compact support. Whole families of Euler equilibria, chaotic flows. One example of those would be Beltrami flows. In other words, in three dimensions, the eigenfunctions of the curl operator, particularly interesting and challenging for many reasons and have been used. And have been used for many reasons recently in such things as convex integration. But as Vladimir Arnaldo observed, there are not enough Beltrami flows to cover every conceivable topology that might be used as the initial field for our MHD equations, or for that point to put it, the Euler equations. So, next slide, please. Next slide, please. Arnold introduced this concept, which was also followed through by Keith Moffat, among others, of something he referred to as a magnetic relaxation procedure. So this procedure preserves the streamlined topology of an initial divergence-free vector field, V0, as it evolves under the frozen field equation. So here is written. Equation. So here is written down and read here. The frozen field equation, which is the first equation of the MHD system, called frozen field because certain topological constraints are frozen into this field. In particular, something called helicity is preserved. So consider this equation in red here via a vector field U, which is related to B, not necessarily, in fact, not. Necessarily, in fact, not by the MHD equations, but by a suitable constitutive law that has the property that in the limit as t goes to infinity, u goes to zero, at least formally. So if u goes to zero, then what we are recovering is an equilibria of the MHD system. So next slide, please. Then this brings me back again to the work of Keith Moffat, and this dates to papers in the 1980s. But also I recommend to those of you who are interested a survey paper that Keith published in JFM in 2021. So the latest from Keith about these magnetic relaxation procedures. Relaxation procedures. And he, as opposed to this notion of topological equivalence, which came from Arnold, he proposed a magnetic relaxation procedure which preserves the streamlined topology of the initial divergence free vector field, as did Arnold's MRE equivalence. Equivalence, but abandons the constraint that it has to remain smooth as t goes to infinity in this procedure. So, this allowed for the appearance of discontinuities, among other things, discontinuities in the current sheets, the current be, of course, the curl of the magnetic field. So, discontinuities are possible, and experimentally in MHD, discontinuities have been observed. Have been observed. So the thought is consider a magnetic relaxation process where discontinuities in the current sheets are allowed. So next slide, please. So here is a sketch taken from this paper of Keith Moffat. This is a thought experiment. Consider a hopflink. So we have two untwisted. So, we have two untwisted but linked magnetic flux tubes in the first part of the picture on the left-hand side. And now, consider this relaxation process going on where the total volume is conserved, the topology of the magnetic flux tubes is conserved, not the magnetic energy that is not necessarily conserved. In fact, that's decreasing by this process. So, what will happen? What will happen? The volume of these flux tubes are conserved, but the flux tubes are now getting closer together and getting fatter. These donuts are getting fatter. And we see in the second picture, what's happening is the contracted state when these flux tubes actually make contact, which of course in the first picture they do not have. So when they make contact, of course, these magnetic flux tubes will have discontinuity. Are will have discontinuities at the surface of contact. In particular, the discontinuity will be a current sheet on the surface of contact. So this relaxation process can give rise in this thought picture, thought experiment, to discontinuities of the sort that have been observed. So, next slide, please. Okay, so now we come to the PDE. So, this is the specific PDE that I will be discussing, which is referred to as the magnetic relaxation equations. So, here we have the first equation, this frozen field equation for the magnetic field B, and what we're looking for is We're looking for is a constitutive law, a relationship between u and b, which gives us our non-linear system. This is an active vector equation because u is related to b, and we're making a choice of the relationship that hopefully will give rise to this magnetic relaxation process, whereby the topology of the initial Of the initial field for B is preserved. The energy is not preserved. In fact, the energy is going to dissipate. But the process will give rise to an equilibria providing u goes to the magnitude of u goes to infinity as t goes to zero. So this is a particular choice of a constitutive law. And then, well, does it work? And that's what I'm going to try to persuade. And that's what I'm going to try to persuade you. It has very promising features for this constitutive law. So again, divergence of u is equal to zero. The divergence of the initial field, B0, is equal to zero, and that is preserved by the frozen field equation number one in my slide. So now note that if we substituted for u from equation two into From equation two into equation one, we've got an equation that will have a cubic nonlinearity since U is determined from equation two in terms of B plus the condition that divergence of U is equal to zero, from which the pressure is determined as a function of B. So we have a cubic nonlinearity in our In our evolution equation, the MRE equation system, which is, as I say, is an active vector equation. Now, this equation two is one choice for our constitutive law, but from a mathematical point of view, it can be useful to have some regularization in dealing with this PDE. So, another choice of the constitutive law. Another choice of the constitutive law might be 2a, whereby we put in this minus the Laplacian to the gamma as a smoothing term when we come to studying the PDEs. And the whole system still preserves the topology of the initial vector field B0. So, next slide, please. Well, as I say, this system of equations, magnetic relaxation, Of equations, magnetic relaxation equations, has certain properties by basically our choice of the constitutive law. And in particular, we see the dissipative nature of the MRE by doing the usual energy estimate, take the equation for B, dotted with B, integrate it over the region. And as far as all the mathematics goes that I'll be discussing, we're considering. That I'll be discussing, we're considering that we're in the d-dimensional torus where we're most interested in d is equal to 3 or 2. So here we have the magnetic energy estimate. We don't have conservation of energy, as we see by doing the usual integration by parts and using divergence-free condition. And now plugging in for B dot, plugging in for B is quantity B dot grad B. This quantity B dot grad B in terms of U in our constitutive law, we obtain the expression that you see on the screen now, that the rate of change of the magnetic energy is given by minus the L2 norm of U, sorry, not the L2 norm, the H dot gamma norm of U. So providing U is not identically equal to zero, the To zero, the magnetic energy as governed by the MRE equations is strictly decreasing. So, again, this is a property that we wanted to happen. We want the energy to decrease, not to zero, we want it to decrease, but to decrease to an equilibria. Furthermore, the same, approximately doing the same sort of usual technique for taking our evolution equation, we can find a global. We can find a global lower bound for the L2 norm of the magnetic field, which is sometimes referred to as Arnold's inequality. And here it's written as, this lower bound is the magnetic helicity, the magnitude of the magnetic helicity of the original B0, so the original vector field B0. And the magnetic helicity for this problem is concerned. This problem is conserved under the evolution. And the magnetic helicity here is defined as the dot product of A and B, where A is the inverse curve of B. So if we start off with an initial vector field B0 that is topologically non-trivial, and one way of defining non-trivial is that this initial helicity of the magnitude. Helicity, the magnitude of helicity, is non-zero. So, if we start off with something non-trivial topologically, we have this lower bound on the magnetic energy. So, this is a promising feature of these MRE equations, given what we want them to do for us. So, next slide, please. Well, this system of equations has received a certain amount of interest from the PDE point of view, but not a great deal, actually. So one of the papers, nice papers that was published, this is 2014, is a paper. No, I think you're moving forward too fast. Okay. So this paper by Jan Brenier, who looked at the two Brenier, who looked at the two-dimensional problem without regularization, so gamma is equal to zero in this case, and he defined admissible dissipative solutions satisfying an energy inequality, which is stated here, and ignored the problem of local well-posedness for the problem, but proved uniqueness of smooth solutions among all dissipative solutions for any prescribed smooth initial conditions. Smooth initial conditions. So that's a nice result, but a somewhat limited result. Let's move to the next slide, please. So now, what have we proved? As I mentioned in this paper that was published in 2022. Well, we considered several problems for this PDE system. So the first one we proved. So, the first one we proved was local existence in Soblet spaces for all gamma, positive or not. So, we didn't need the regularization of gamma in order to prove local existence. And here is the specific statement of local existence starting P0 is in HS, divergence 3, and S is bigger than D over 2 plus 1. Then there exists a T star bounded, as I've shown, such that Bounded as I've shown such that the MRE has a unique solution in this function space with society with an associated velocity u and the h dot s norm of the is bounded and the energy inequality as stated by Jan Brenier is satisfied. So we have local existence which is nice but what the whole concept of MRE is to understand MRE is to understand the behavior as t goes to infinity. That's where we're hoping to actually discover interesting Euler MHD equilibria. So next slide, please. So now the next issue that we looked at was global existence. Now, for global existence to get any results, we did. To get any results, we did need the regularization parameter gamma to be bigger than d over 2 plus 1. And we made use of that in our global existence result. So as the theorem is stated here, you see let gamma and s be bigger than d over 2 plus 1, our initial conditions in Hs, divergence-free. Then T star is it. Star goes to infinity, so we have a global existence result, and furthermore, we have a bound on the time dependence of the H dot S norm of B, as you see here. And those constants in that expression with the exponential bounds depend on the constants gamma, S, and D. And our proof of this. And our proof of this result was via showing that the Lipschitz norm of U is integrable in time and the Lipschitz norm of B is square integrable in time. So next slide, please. And we also had, we were able to prove the result that as t goes to infinity, again for gamma bigger than d over 2 plus 1, we have a result concerning the asymptotic behavior of the velocity. Asymptotic behavior of the velocity, that's u, under the conditions of the theorem, and a zero mean velocity u associated with the magnetic field B according to that constitutive law relating B and U. And this has the property that in the limit as t goes to infinity, the L infinity norm of the gradient of U goes to 0. norm of the gradient of u goes to zero, which is again what we're looking for in this problem. However, it is still open whether this decay is actually fast enough to ensure that the L infinity norm of the gradient of U is in L1. And this is what we would need to be sure that the magnetic field B itself converges to something. Is to something. If it does converge to something that is in a suitable function, B bar, then it's going to be in all equilibria. But without knowing that the decay of the gradient of U is fast enough, we were not able to prove that for a completely general problem, looking at the MRE equations. Um, looking at the MRE equations, that in fact we are guaranteed that B converges to a function, a satisfactory function. But if it does, it's an Euler equilibrium. So now, why might it not be a satisfactory function? Well, that's what the rest of my talk will address. So, next slide, please. So, we looked at some very special examples. Some very special examples of our MRE equation. We looked at, first of all, we looked at the very simplest example that you can think of, so that the initial, we're considering the stability about a very special steady state and the 2D stability about this special state, namely a constant vector. So that constant vector here, as you see at the top of the screen, is denoted by a unit vector E1. A unit vector E1. So in one specific direction labeled E1. And the associated U for that is just zero. So now we're perturbing about this very, very special, simple steady state of the MRE equations. And gamma is not necessary. The regularization is not necessary for the results. So for simplicity, we set gamma equals zero. Gamma equals zero. So now we're looking, we're perturbing about this special, very special steady state. And the perturbed vector fields are labeled little b and little u, as you see here. So we substitute that into the two-dimensional MRE equations. Here we have the equation for the perturbation. So these are non-linear equations, the full non-linear system for the equation. system for the equation perturbed about this constant steady state. And you see the equation here, the equation for little b and it's the coupled velocity field for this simple simplest reduction of the MRE equations is still fairly complicated. So we see the course the nonlinearity sitting there because of the sitting there because of the v dot grad b terms and the b dot grad v terms where v is v dot grad b plus the gradient of the pressure. So of course we have this cubic nonlinearity persisting but the problem is a problem in two dimensions which gives us some simplicity and we see this term the d1 squared the second derivative in this constant direct Constant direction operating on B with a minus sign. So here is rather more explicitly this feature of a dissipative role of the treatment of the nonlinearity of our MRE equations. So this is good, but as I point out here, if we're looking at functions b or if a sum Looking at functions b, or if for some reason we're in the situation where b has no dependence on the particular coordinate x1, this term will vanish. So how to handle this system of non-linear coupled with cubic non-linearity system of equations. What we did was actually motivated by a paper of Tarek El Gindi. A paper of Tarek El Gundi on an active scalar equation that comes from the incompressible porous media equations, which also had this feature that there was dissipation coming from a second derivative, but only providing the function had dependence on one coordinate. So following through this, the ideas in paper of Tariq. In the paper of Tarek, we were able to prove results in terms of the stability of this very special steady state. And we did this by projecting onto X1 independent and X1 dependent components of the vector field B, which is a function of X1, X2, and T. So next slide, please. And we proved for that, we were able to prove for this very special example both stability. Example, both stability and relaxation. So we proved that there exists a unique global in-time solution for the problem for these perturbations, little b and little v, where the L2 norm of little b was less than a quantity epsilon, and epsilon was the magnitude of the initial perturbation. The total velocity u goes to zero as t goes to infinity, exactly as we want to happen for the Exactly as we want to happen for the MRI equations. And the total magnetic field B goes to a small perturbation of our initial steady state. And it goes to a small perturbation where the HK plus 2 norm is bounded by the magnitude of the original perturbation times 4. And both of these convergences take place with respect to strong topologies. So here we have stability, relaxation, Stability, relaxation, but sort of in some sense, good behavior of what, on the face of it, is a rather tricky system with cubic nonlinearities. And stability, relaxation does happen and with respect to strong topologies. So at least we have one example, although one could say this is a pretty unexciting example where we'll Exciting example where we're perturbing about a constant steady state. So, obviously, we do not have any interesting topology in this particular example. So, next slide, please. So, then what can we say about the three-dimensional MRE equations? Well, as I said, we have a result in terms of global existence for our three-dimensional problem. Existence for our three-dimensional problem, but in terms of stability and relaxation, that is, and in what norms we might have stability and relaxation, that is still an open question. So now what I'm going to talk about are some very special examples that are exact solutions of our 3D MRE equation. And this was somewhat motivated by results. Results that date back to Viktor Judovich and have also been observed over the years by various groups of mathematicians interested in fluids problems. So think back to the three-dimensional Euler equations. So now we're in the, you're looking at the equations. du by dt plus u dot grad u is equal to the gradient of pressure and divergence of u is equal to zero. And the divergence of u is equal to zero. So, um, this, as you all know, this system is a far from simple system. But many questions are extremely interesting, in particular, questions of stability and instability of this, of the 3D Euler equation, or even of the 2D Euler equations. So the So, what I've written down here is this very special but exact solution of the full nonlinear 3D Euler equations. So, consider this particular type of solution. So, here is U. It's written in terms of a vector field, a steady vector field that is the horizontal. Vector field that is the horizontal component of our velocity field u, together with a vertical component, a component in the direction that is not horizontal, and the horizontal component of our exact solution is a steady state. In fact, it's a steady state of 2D Euler. So it depends only on the horizontal variables, and it is a steady state of 2D Euler. It is a steady state of 2D Euler. The vertical component that I've labeled g is a function of time, but its dependence on space is only a dependence on the horizontal component of space. So V is a steady state solution of 2D Euler. For example, V could be written as we have done here. Perpendicular gradient of a scalar field phi, where the scalar field satisfies the horizontal Laplacian of V is a function. Laplacian of v is a function of v. So we have whole classes of those. Interesting steady states are 2D Euler. And then, so that we have written here an exact solution of 3D Euler, the function g, scalar function of g, which is a function of x, the horizontal part of the spatial coordinates and t, must satisfy the equation that I've written down there. dg by dt is v dot dg by dt is V dot rad H operating on G. So it's a transport equation. So if G satisfies this linear transport equation with initial conditions, then that expression for U is a steady state solution of Euler, which is easy to see, just plug it in. And as I say, this was an observation, I think, originally made by Viktor Judovich. I think originally made by Viktor Judovich, but has been made by many people. So now, if you consider a very special steady state for V, let's say that it's shear flow. So in other words, V has, can be written as this expression in the example that I have on the slide. Function of x2 in the direction of x1 and 0 component. And zero component of velocity in that direction x1. So shear flow. So you can plug in shear flow to the problem for g and you see very easily that now our exact solution of 3D Euler has the form that is written at the bottom of my transparency. Okay, so this is a function which is a bounded Which is a bounded function in time if this function g0 is, of course, a bounded function of its arguments. So we have a very nice solution. The velocity is bounded in L infinity. However, if we calculated, for example, the curl of u from this expression, then we bring in derivatives of the function g0, which depends on x1 minus t. Which depends on x1 minus t of x2. We bring in derivatives, and so providing g0 isn't constant and v isn't a constant function of their arguments, the taking a derivative, in particular, say taking the curl of u, brings out a factor of t. So therefore, this exact solution, although the solution itself is bounded, the curl of the solution, the vorticity, actually grows linearly. Actually, it grows linearly in time. So that is, I think, the main interest of this example. We have an example of an exact solution of 3D Euler that has non-linear instability. In this case, an instability growing with time. So now, the next slide, please, returning to MRE equation, which has similarities. Which has similarities, certainly, to the 3D Euler equation. We looked for an analogous exact solution for 3D MRE. And I've written it here. Again, we're looking for a solution to the equation for the magnetic field B, which is coupled to U via the constitutive law. So again, look for B of the same sort of form as I've written in the top line there. We have a horizontal. We have a horizontal part that is steady and a vertical part that is a function only of the horizontal spatial variable and time. And then u, the analogous u, which comes from the constitutive law, is written there. So now if we plug that into the 3D MRE equations, we obtain an expression for the scalar field G, functions of the horizontal spatial vector. Horizontal spatial vector in t of the following form. d by dt of g is now v dot grad h squared as an operator acting on g so what we have inst is a rank one diffusion equation for g whereas in the euler case we have um uh um uh just dg by dt is equal to um Is equal to a vector value of function times g. So very similar, but that square makes it somewhat different that we have there. So again, so it's not a transport equation for G. It's a Rankine diffusion equation, but still it's a linear PDE. So in particular, now if we consider a shear flow as our example. A shear flow as our example, plug in the shear flow on the equation for v dot grad h, and we get the equation for g that you see sitting there for this example, dg by dt is equal to the square of our function v of x2, and then the second derivative with respect to the variable the first variable x1 acting on g. So now we can get So now we can get exact solutions to this. And in particular, if we choose an initial condition of the sort that's written here, we have an exact expression for the solution to our Rankhund diffusion equation, as I've written there. g of x1, x2, and t is that expression, which now involves the exponential, an exponentially decaying term in time, as I've written in that equation. In that equation. So clearly, if we look at what's happening as t goes to infinity, u goes to zero because g is going to go to zero because of the exponential of minus lambda squared e squared t. And b goes to, well, b goes to our initial little v of whatever. So the shear flow that was our initial condition. Flow that was our initial value for v. So, nothing terribly exciting is happening. We're getting exponential decay to really a very uninteresting vector field. But if we now look at gradients of our vector field B with G explicitly given there, we find that in fact there are infinite time growth in the gradient. Infinite time growth in the gradients of B, sort of very much analogous to the linear time-dependent growth given non-linear instability in the Judovich examples for 3D Euler. So next slide, please. So, and this statement that I made on the last slide is justified by this belief. Is justified by this specific example. So we're taking very special choices of those functions G0 and capital V, the shear flow, in terms of sines and cosines. We're looking at periodic sines and functions of x1 and x2. So we can now just explicitly calculate what that function g of x1, x2, and t is in this particular case. We can explicitly calculate. Particular case, we can explicitly calculate what B is, and in particular, we can explicitly calculate what the second derivative of the B3 component is, and you see it's sitting there. And so now we've got a completely explicit functions of all our variables, x1, x2, and t. We can calculate various norms, and here I've written down the answers to computing for the second derivative. For the second derivative of the component B3 with respect to the L2 X1 X2 norm and with respect to the L2 X1 norm and L infinity X2 norm. We can calculate those quantities explicitly in the limit as t goes to infinity. And you see that both of these norms actually grow as powers of t. So although we have relaxation. Relaxation in L2 for the quantity for the norm, L2 norm of B, which is a solution for the magnetic field in our MRE equations, we actually have nonlinear instability in stronger topologies. So, for example, in H1. So, again, we have relaxation, but we have instability. And this is, of course, just And this is, of course, just one very, very special example of the MRE equations. So, next slide, please. And we could do the same thing with a rather more interesting 2D steady state that we're imposing for our horizontal dependence as far as the spatial dependence goes. If we could think of sine x1, sine x2. Sine X1, sine X2 flow, so that's a hyperbolic flow. We have separators in the flow along the axes. So we have actually hyperbolic stretching in this flow. Here then, the equation for G is the same as the equation before, but now we have our operator V dot grad V is rather more exciting than the shear flow. Shear flow. And we can obtain for this flow in which there is hyperbolic stretching that are now a solution for the MRE equation based on this function g of x1, x2, and t has the following bounds. It's bounded by, bounded, has exponential bounds both above and below for the For the L infinity norm of the gradient of B. So we actually have an example of exponential growth in the gradients of an exact solution to the MRE equations. So clearly, the possibilities for MRE are complicated and I think deserve more study. So, next slide, please. Next slide, please. So, my concluding comments: well, I hope perhaps I've convinced you that the MRE system is a challenging and unusual system of PDEs, an active vector equation with a cubic nonlinearity. And there's still many open questions. For example, can we prove global existence when gamma is not greater than d over two plus one? Greater than d over 2 plus 1. And given a global solution, does the limit as t goes to infinity of our vector field B go to a steady state V bar that's in L2? This we have not proved, and our very special examples suggest that there could be difficulties. So we know our 2D, or we could call them two and a half dimensions. Or we could call them two and a half dimensional solutions show that generically we cannot expect magnetic relaxation with respect to strong norms, but with respect to weak norms, yes, possible. And another question, what is the asymptotic structure of our end result B bar as T goes to infinity when the initial field is chaotic? Will we recover the chaotic structure? Structure in the limit as t goes to infinity. We know we're going to recover some of the topology, for example, the helicity is conserved. But how different will it be from a chaotic field that we started with? So many questions and a few answers. So next slide, please. So thank you. So, thank you. Thank you very much.
