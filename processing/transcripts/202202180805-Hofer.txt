It doesn't work. The other screen, because we're seeing, yeah. See now? Okay, good. But now it's cut, it's cut, it's cut, it's chopped on the side and below. Ah, so what can I do here? Let me just try something. Try again. Is it better now? No. No, it's the same. No, it's the same. Maybe I just run it out of. I just try to make this as large as possible. Maybe did you try to did you try to unshare and share again? Yeah, that works. Yeah, that works. Oh, great. Good. Okay, thanks very much. I would really like to thank all the organizers for organizing this conference. Maybe it will be memorable as one of the last conferences online, hopefully. And well, we'll see. So today I would like to talk about a joint project we did with Warren Chomchik, who's the transplantation immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a big transportation immunology. University of Pittsburgh, which has a big transplantation center. So Warren has also seen patients actually. And all the experimental work that you see was done by Foluk Sajebekovich in Warren's group. And from my group, all the mathematical modeling was done by Matthias GÃ¼nter and there's very interesting single-cell transcriptome analysis by Alessandro and Greycock. So what are we talking about? This graph for host disease. I have to rearrange a little bit here, otherwise, I can't see my own slides. And I think that's a well-known phenomenon: that if you receive a bone marrow transplant for treating leukemia, the sort of general strategy is to not match your HLAs completely, or if you match your HLAs, to at least have some other allogeneic component. Some other allogeneic component of the graft simply because it's it turned out that allogeneic grafts, and this is just some one statistics from ALIL, one survival statistics from lymphographic leukemia, they just do much better due to an effect that's called graft versus leukemia effect, namely the T cells in the graft from the donor fight leukemic cells of the resident, of the recipient. Of the recipient, sorry. And so, autologous stem cell transplant are not as good and actually tend to be avoided. However, this comes with a price, as you will all know, also know, I think, that of course the T cells from the graft will attack not only the leukemic cells, but they will also attack healthy body cells. And that depends, of course, on what they see there. But this is generally known as graft viscous host disease. Known as Graftross and SOAS disease, and in all cases of allogenetic stem cell transplantation, this has to be kept in check. It can be more or less severe, in many cases, it becomes chronic. So, people are then under chronic immunosuppression of some sort. So, the typical antigens that are seen in GVHD depend on the time of the graft. If you have an HLA mismatch donor, it's mainly the HLAs that are recognized of the recipient from the donor T cells. From the donor T cells. And in cases where you have an HLA-matched donor, and this is the situation where the mouse model I will be talking about from Warren School will actually pertain to, there are other ubiquitous tissue antigens, it turns out, that are called minor histocompatibility antigens, minor HAs, that are quite ubiquitous peptides and assembly of them that are actually presented on both class one and class two. And in my talk, I will the explain. In my talk, I will. The experimental data are all in CD4 cells in class two presentation, but there's very similar experiments and very similar outcomes also for class 1 and CD8. Okay, one interesting finding that I think is largely unexplained is that the T cell response, despite this chronic antigenic stimulation, does not exhaust. So you really have a chronic inflammation through these T cells. And as already said, this requires treatment with immunosuppression. Treatment with immunosuppression, and the current immunosuppression that's given to this patient is completely systemic. So, it has all the bad side effects that we know come with systemic immunosuppression, all the negative effects. And so, the goal of this whole sort of line of work, of which I'm sort of showing the first part in the mouse now, is to try to understand better how graft resource disease is actually maintained. Disease is actually maintained in the host, in the recipient of the stem cell graft and of the T cells, and whether a better understanding of the mechanisms of maintenance of the disease can also give us ideas on sort of more targeted and treatment strategies that may get away from this systemic immune suppression. Of course, with a view towards extending the range of The range of applicability of these sort of allogenetic stem cell transplantations, which otherwise are really quite beneficial. So I think graft host disease is the main cause that sort of limits their application in many cases. And this is the framework we'll be looking at. So we're looking at the major tissues in which GVHD is present. So it's the gut, different parts of the gut, the liver, the skin. Often it's also in the lung. Um, often is also in the lung. Uh, in this particular case study, we're not looking at the lung, but we're looking at finely resolved tissues in the gut, in particular. And of course, there are the secondary lymphoid organs, the spleen and the lymph nodes. And the sort of overarching question is, once you establish graft host disease, do you need actually feeding from secondary lymphoid organs? I hope you can see my mouse to maintain the disease. So, this is some systemic. So, is it some systemic mode of maintenance, or is there, in fact, local maintenance in the tissues? And of course, my title already says there's local maintenance. And so, the rest of the talk, I would try to sort of provide you with the arguments why you think there's local maintenance and how we got there. So, the first sort of naive idea was now to distinguish between these two sort of broad alternatives. Of course, there can be spectrum in between, and we Spectrum in between, and we're trying to quantify this spectrum as well, is just to sort of do clone analysis. And that came from our 2013 work with Dirk Bush, where sort of Dirk engineered the system where it can follow the immune response of single naive T cells. And we thought, let's apply this to a graph of the host disease. And this is a little bit blurred because I don't know for what reason, but it's also quite good as blurred because it's a really naive expectation. I can explain it in simple words. Explain it in simple words. Is the idea is if you sort of follow individual clones, maybe under systemic maintenance mode, we will find the clones everywhere. Each clone will be in every tissue. But under local maintenance mode, we will find sort of more localized presence of T-cell clones. So this was the starting point of actually doing clone analysis. And as it turned out, the expectation was very naive. And I will show you this in the next slides. So that's the system, it's mainly the system. So that's the system, is mainly the system that was described in our 2013 paper, sort of enriched for some other markers, GFPs, also used here, that allows us to sort of take a mouse, and this is a mouse model that has been done in Warren's lab, that expresses a particular peptide of hemagglutinine in every tissue. So that is sort of mimicking a minor histocompatibility antigen. These mice don't have TLB cells, which is not surprising. Which is not so problematic because they're irradiated anyway. So that's sort of, and that would anyway lead to sort of suppression of the endogenous immune system of the mouse. So they irrate it and then they get this bone marrow graft. And the bone marrow graft, of course, has bone marrow, but it also has T cells. And in this case, I said we look at the C D4 T cells that are T cell receptor transgenic. T cell receptor is raised against this minor HA type antigen. Type antigen. So they will all recognize this antigen in all the tissues presented on NHC2. And this is done in such a way that we give sort of a fair number of cells sort of as a bulk, which is quite a good disease. And then we sort of spike in nine marked cells that sort of give us our clones. Clonal recovery in these types of systems was unexpectedly high, which is already telling you that under these situations here, in the E-rated recipient, that is devoid of any endogenous. That is devoid of any endogenous T or B lymphocytes, these cells are activated very efficiently and expand. So you actually find the clonoprogeny with sort of more than 80%, almost 90%, 90% of the cases. So a very high efficiency. That's already, if you think a little bit, that's spelling bad news for the clone analysis. And this I want to sort of substantiate here: clones get in all tissues. Clones get in all tissues. I mean, they get in, they are activated, they massively expand, they get in all tissues. And I have to shift the thing around a little bit. And you see this here in the statistics. So these are all the individual clones we have after week one, two, three. So these are still early time points. We think seeding sort of finishes at about week two. And what you see here is that after week one, there's hardly any clone in every tissue. And after week three, more than 40% of the clones are in every tissue. More than 40% of the clones are in every tissue, and more than 50 are in every button. And there's very few clones that are in a small number of tissues. And these tend to be small clones. And so we're not quite sure that this may be also a sampling effect that we just can't sample these very small clones in other tissues. So the seeding is really systemic of the disease. So that seems to confound our basic idea of sort of following individual clones because clones just die. Because clones just are everywhere. So, just to do this a little bit more quantitatively, this is looking at the clones in the two secondary lymphoid organs that were probed, namely the mesenteric lymph node and the spleen. And you see there's this sort of diagonal here, and there's clones that sit above the diagonal, below the diagonal, and there's clones that sit on the axis. And obviously, the clones that sit on the axis are private to the particular tissues and they are private to the spleen or not. That they're primary to the spleen, or not sampled in the other tissue, but some of them are so large that we're really convinced they're primary to the spleen. But then there are other clones that are primed in the spleen because they have the high frequency after one week, but they enter the mesenteric lymph node, but they have lower frequencies, so they're being diluted there. And you have the converse in reverse phenomenon: the clones originating in the mesenteric lymph node, primed in the mesenteric lymph node and to the spleen. Okay, some clones private to display private to Clones private to the spleen, private to the mesentery lymph node. And obviously, there could also be other priming locations, and we see this. So, priming locations that have not been sampled, we still see this in the data. So, this is week one, and this is week two. So, everything is homogenized after week two, which is really interesting because it means that lymphoid homing phenotypes must exist that are exchanged via the blood. Okay, and we see this, we see 62L positive cells also in the blood. Cells also in the blood that then get into the other secondary lymphoid tissues and also expand there. Because obviously, we start with a single cell, so priming can only be at one location, and then they have to spread to the other lymphoid locations. So, if you look at the if you now look at the target tissues, so this is the sorry for the slightly cryptic, this is the lamina propria lymphocytes in the lamina propria in the small intestine. And I'll give you a complete And I'll give you a complete overview of the target tissues in the next slide. You see that there's some clones that are early on on the diagonal with the spleen, so they come from the spleen most likely. And there are some clones that are below the diagonal. And if you think long enough about it, they must be primed in other locations than the spleen, including the mesenteric lymph node. But we also see clones that are reasonably large that are not found in the mesenteric lymph node. So they must come from other priming locations. This is interesting. Locations. This is interesting not only with respect to that, it confirms the idea that there's really systemic distribution of clones in the whole organism, but it also shows that there's no real sort of privacy of lymph nodes for particular tissues, which has also been argued in the literature that there are certain lymph nodes that supply certain tissues. We don't find any evidence of this. We find clones get throughout the whole secondary lymphoid system and they get in all the tissues. And you also see that. The tissues. And you also see that then these clones are distributed along the diagonal at week two, so everything is sort of averaged out. And you see this for all the tissues, bone marrow. And bone marrow is interesting in the sense that there's a little bit of evidence that this could be some clones that are actually primed in the bone marrow. It's not entirely conclusive, but it's the only other priming location that we find. There's no evidence of priming in all the other tissues, as you would expect, the liver, the colon. The liver, the colon, small intestine, lamina propria, small intestine, intraepithel lymphocytes, the epidermis, and the dermis. Okay, so clones get everywhere. We can then do some statistics of where things are primed and just sort of by these arguments that I showed, just simply counting where clones come from. And you would think that about 50% come from locations that we sample, namely the spleen and the mesochron of lymph node, or have been primed in these locations, I should be saying, while 50% have been primed at other sites. It's quite interesting. Primed in other sites. It's quite interesting. And there's some experimental evidence now, if you sample other lymph nodes, that there's also clones that have been primed in these other lymph nodes. Okay, so the seeding is systemic. So what can we expect now in terms of maintenance if the seeding is already systemic? Well, obviously, the cell numbers that we're dealing with in each tissue is very high. So maybe you looked at the clone frequencies, they go down to 10. Looked at the clone frequencies, they go down to 10 to the minus 6. So, we're talking about 10 to the 6 cells in the tissues that we sample, and there may be more. But this is a typical dimension. We have sort of a couple of tens of cell divisions, and you can go through any model sort of clonal dynamics, stochastic clonal dynamics, that will tell you that neutral drift or drift with these numbers is completely negligible over the time scales we look at. So, we do not expect clonal drift to play any significant role. Any significant role. And then, of course, you can look at the deterministic expectations, and it's very simple to show. This is just really trivial symmetry arguments: that local proliferation or local loss of cells will not shift clone frequencies ever. Of course, under the idea that everything is neutral, and we have evidence for this. And the only thing that shifts can shift clone frequencies is influx. But then we say the influx is coming from secondary lymphoid organs that anyway. Secondary lymphoid organs that anyway communicate. So, if there's influx that still sort of plays a role after week two, it should just sort of even out the clone distributions even further. These are the expectations. So, either they will not change, and in the case of continued influx from secondary lymphatues, it should even become more similar. So, what do you think? Sorry, can I ask a clarification question? Please. So, I missed something. So, you say the total population is large, 10 to the Population is large, 10 to the 6, yes, but per clone it could be still small. That's the, I mean, that's right. So then how did you argue that drift is not playing? Sorry, yeah, I'm just trying to reconcile. That's a very good and valid question. So the typical clone size is 10 to the 3, just to give you a feeling for it. And so we're still in a regime. And so we're still in a regime that I think the clonal drift itself, and you can see this if you actually look at the models. We think clonal drift cannot explain what I will show you on the next slide. On this time scale that we're talking about. Okay. And of course, we do see evidence of drift because clones are disappearing, as you would say. So small clones are disappearing, and this is a drift phenomenon. So we would agree. So, we would agree that, of course, for very small clones, we would see drift. But just hang on a second, and I'll show what we think are the phenomena that are to be explained. And so the phenomena are to be explained is first is, do we continue to distribute clones equally or evenly among tissues? And the answer is interestingly, no. So, week three is the maximum. And after week three, we actually get clones moving back. We actually get clones moving back from tissues. So we find less and less clones in all tissues. And this also concerns large clones. So this is not just a loss of small clones. It is a loss of small clones to some extent, but if you look at the data carefully, it also concerns large clones. The other thing is look at the individual clone frequency distributions in the tissues. So do they stay where they are or do they even become more similar? Or do they even become more similar? Of course, we can't sample the same tissue at two time points because it's destructive, but we can look at frequency correlations between tissues. And if the tissues stayed where they are, the frequency correlation shouldn't change over time. And we just quantify this by just this sort of perpendicular to the diagonal, the spread. So just doing some measure of spread perpendicular to the axis, which we look at called clonal divergence. And if you look at Divergence. And if you look at clonal divergence, this is one example. You see that with time, it actually becomes larger. Okay. And this is very significant, as I'm showing you here. This is the tissue that shows the largest clonal divergence, the intraephyl lymphocytes. Other tissues show less, so there is some gradation of clonal divergence. But this is not the only tissue. The colon, for example, so this is the small intestine. The colon shows a lot of divergence. Other tissues less so. Tissues less so. So, but let's focus first on this divergence. Thomas, what's the y-axis? What's the number? This y-axis here. So, this is basically, if you look at the log space, so this is the ratio of the difference in the log space and looking at the variance of it. Okay, so it's very simple quantification. Okay, and so this is going up with time with respect to all other tissues of the To all other tissues of the intra-epithelial lymphocytes. And this is again to Sid's question. This cannot be explained by the loss of small clones. Okay, so that's, and in particular, you can appreciate this here. I hope you can see my mouse. Large clones diverge. Okay, and these are clones that have 10 to the 3 to 10 to the 4 cells when we started them. Okay, so there's something good. So there's something good because theory, theoretical expectation, as naive as it may have been, is wrong. So, what do we do? So, and of course, I think the answer is already suggested by the title, but let's just go through the two steps. First, let's see whether we can sort of be a bit more sure whether drift does play a role or not. So, let's just sort of construct models where we have T cell dynamics that. Where we have T-cell dynamics that are driven by influx, turnover, and then local proliferation. And let's do this to different degrees. So, from 100% maintenance by influx to 100% maintenance by local proliferation and anything in between. And we can estimate this delta parameter from our data quite well. We have proliferation rate measurements and so on. So, we can sort of plug in realistic parameters in this. And we can start also with experimental initial. Experimental initial conditions, we can just take the clone size distributions at week two and then ask, this is the disease has been established. We're just asking about maintenance now. Okay, not making a model of the feeding phase, just maintenance. And of course, the global maintenance model doesn't give you anything in terms of clonal divergence. So the data go up. These are the data, the gray and black. And the simulation goes down. So things become more and more similar if you keep on feeding the disease by secondary lymphoid tissues. By secondary lymphoid tissues. Sorry. Sorry. But also, this, oops, something, sorry. Response time is too slow. But also, if you just do local maintenance, but in this sort of uniform situation with the cell numbers that we sort of estimate, this would be sort of a pure homogeneous drift model. And we're doing better. So we don't go down with our, so we don't become. Down with our, so we don't become more similar, but we sort of maintain our sort of differences rather than becoming more different. So that's just by way of simulation. And of course, we need some solution to this. And these are these interesting cases where you have to come up with a plausible solution. And we discussed it a lot. And then we thought the most plausible solution probably is that the long-term dynamic. Is that the long-term dynamics of the system is not determined by the bulk of the effector cells that we see? Because otherwise, we have no way of explaining this divergence. So we just simply, out of desperation, postulated that there's a small population within these effector cells that we currently don't see, and that this small population will explain the long-term dynamics. So these will be progenitors of effector cells. Of effector cells that we sort of replace dying effectors. So that was our idea. Then we get to small cell numbers, then drift is important, and we can sort of very easily describe the data. So at the time when we did it, and that's a couple of years ago, it was really a solution that was born out of desperation. We had no other idea. Okay. It's not such a bad solution. I mean, things like this have been described. I mean, not in this context, at least. Okay, and just to show this. Okay, and just to show this, so now we can go through the models that have a hierarchy of progenitors and effectors. There's a small progenitor pool that's sort of, I think, I think assumed here 5% or 10% or something like this. It needs to be large enough to be able to sustain things. And you can go through the situations. And these are now from left to right, what's from top to bottom here. 100% global maintenance doesn't give you anything. But even this kind of mixed maintenance, where you sort of maintain from the secondary lymphatic organs to some. Maintain from the secondary lymphat organs to some extent and locally doesn't really give you the clonal divergence. But if you then switch to practically complete local maintenance of the disease after the seeding phase, then we can actually mirror the data from this relatively small progenitor populations. Okay, so at this stage, we understood that this was a solution that could work. Could we get evidence for this? evidence for this and the first ever the first type of experiments that that warren thought about was parabiosis experiments which are forbidden in europe but apparently allowed in the us and uh and parabiosis the idea is you you sort of couple two mice that are different stages at the same or different stages i'm just showing you for the same stages of graph of this sort of graph versus host disease model okay and then you ask so you have congenital markers for one or the other and then you ask where the cells are swapped between the mice Are swapped between the mice in the tissue section. And the data I'm showing here are now relative to the blood because everything has to go through the blood. So you're asking the question: relative to the blood, do the tissues actually in some sense equilibrate with the blood content of the cells that are coming from the other mouse? And this is shown here first for lymphoid cells, CD11B positive cells. And you see, equilibration is pretty good. It's not good in the bone marrow, it's not good in the spleen. Marrow, and it's not good in the spleen. It's sort of moderate in the skin, but in all the other tissues, they equilibrate really well. So, if they're myeloid cells, none of the tissues equilibrates really well the T cells. So, this could look like that there really is local maintenance. Okay, but can we go a little bit further and can we sort of get a hunch of what this progenitor population might be? And for this, I mean, this is not really proving it, it's just proving local maintenance. Really proving it. It's just proving local maintenance. It has nothing to do with progenitor populations. What we're saying is there's local maintenance value small progenitors. And so we turn to single-sera and ASAC, hoping to discover progenitors in our sort of bulk populations that we isolated from the tissues. And this is just a simple dimension reduction here, but this is supported by more sophisticated clustering approaches. If you now take all the, so these are just cells. If you now take all the, so these are just cells that were isolated, I think, at week four when graphical host disease was well established and maintained in all the tissues from these different tissues: colon, interactive olympocytes, laminar progress, skin, and spleen. And I mean, this is just an illustration of a fact for which we have much more evidence: is that the dominant signature of the transcriptomes is the tissue of resonance. Okay, that's really interesting. I mean, all of these are antigens, the T-cell residents. Antigens, the T cell receptor transgenic T cells that respond to the same antigen. But if you look at a transcriptome, the dominant signature is tissue. So that made things difficult because we didn't see any progenitors in here. We just saw the tissue. So then we sort of followed a sort of divide and conquer strategy. Now we looked at each tissue separately and looked whether we saw subclusters in the tissues. And this is just an example of the spleen. Is just an example of the screen, and these are the clusters you see. You can annotate the clusters. And there's two sort of effector-like clusters, there's cell-cycle clusters. And interestingly enough, there's a cluster expressing TCF7, which is known from sort of exhausted immune responses that these could be exhausted progenitors. And they also express R7 receptor alpha in this case, which is also a known sort of progenitor type marker. And there were some other markers. And this is in the spring. Organs. And this is in the spleen, but now we can look in each. And you see, this cluster is relatively large in the spleen. So now we can look in all the tissues. And this is now already the sort of summed up analysis for all the tissues. And what you see here is there's, in fact, a large cluster of cells. I mean, this is now clustering clusters from different tissues. Okay. So the idea is we get rid of the tissue-specific signature. We just sort of identify clusters in the tissues. Identify clusters in the tissues, then we ask: do they show some similarity? So, just forgetting the other genes that make tissue specificity. And there's a large effector-like cluster that has participants in practically all the tissues. There's a large cluster that is simply proliferating cells, and this we know, I mean, this is a feature of these things there are NASA cells in cell cycle that are not in G1, they have a different signature. But there's also a large cluster of clusters that have these progenitor signatures. That have these progenitor signatures, and they are also found in all the studied tissues. So, this is sort of our hint now: that there may be progenitors in every tissue, despite these enormous differences in transcriptomes between tissues. And of course, TCF7 is a good marker, TCF1 as a protein level. I should also show that this is an interesting prediction here before I go to the last slide, an interesting prediction here that the content of these progenitors in the different tissues bio. Of these progenitors in the different tissues by single-cell transcriptomics could be very different. And this slide largely corresponds to our level of decorrelation we see on the phenotypic level of the clone frequencies. So intraepipathyal lymphocytes diverge very, very strongly. Colon diverges quite strongly. Spleen doesn't diverge very much. And we see also the different proliferation rates in these. But now that we have a putative marker that is known actually from other That is known actually from other sort of cells. So, maybe this cell is not so different from sort of progenitor Lyme type cells you see in chronic immune responses towards chronic infections. We can now sort of try to sort them, and this is just a sorting strategy. You can't sort for the intracellular staining for TCF1. Warren now made a reporter mouse with this. But what is used here is we exploit the fact that there's an inverse correlation of TCF1. There's an inverse correlation of TCF1 intracellular staining with CT39 expression on the surface. So you can sort CT39 negative cells or low cells that tend to be TCF1 high. You can now make a competitive transfer experiment where you transfer low and high cells into the mouse and you ask the question, which of these cells will go into the tissues and sort of reconstitute the inflammation in the tissues. And this is after four weeks. The initial time. Weeks. The initial time point I'm not showing is very equal, but after four weeks, the only population that's really left here are the CT39 negative population that's been transferred. So these are the TCF1 high. These are the other ones that were TCF1 low. And if you look phenotypically at these, they reconstitute both TCF1 high and TCF1 low populations. So just to wrap up, I think we've seen that in GVHD, at least in this In GVHD, at least in this mouse model, I think it was very challenging to validate this in humans. Now we have systemic seeding, even communication between priming sites and secondary lymphoid tissues. However, then when the disease gets into the maintenance phase, when cells have entered the tissues, we identified a TCR1 positive progenitor population that actually spawn effectors in the tissues and sort of can sort of recapitulate the disease by adoptive transfer. By adoptive transfer, while TCL1 negative fraction cannot. The frequencies of the progenitors differ very much between tissues. We have no idea why this is so. Is this due to signals? So that's the only mentioning of signaling in this talk, I'm afraid. So I apologize for that. Is this due to niches for these cells? I think all of these are very important but unknown questions. And of course, in terms of practical approaches, can we sort of get evidence for these mechanisms that we established? For these mechanisms that we established here in the mouse and humans, that would help us also move towards more localized and tailored treatment approaches. Thanks very much. Let's start with the questions on Zoom, maybe.
