Putting together the schedule, we thought one of the things that was important is actually being able to continue doing our work through having money. But it turns out, like, we're not just some astronomers and subplants. We're people from different parts of the world, different parts of the country. And we thought that there are lots of different ways of funding these opportunities. And there's also other things besides funding that's important in these studies. And so. Studies, and so what are they? And maybe we can put something together. And the idea was not that we put a bunch of slides together ahead of time. This is more that we can sort of put something together so that when we're trying to progress the field, we now have some resources to go to and go, ah, maybe this is something we should consider. So this is very unstructured. There's a few emails that were sent around. Emails that were sent around, but not many. And we thought we would break it up into sort of basically two categories. And I don't have the review of my. So we figured it's always important in my mind to start with the early career researchers. And frankly, that way, once we get to the more infrastructure type stuff, you guys can go to sleep. But no, I think again, there are like two years. But no, I think getting early career researchers involved, not just in the science, but also in thinking about the funding is good for long-term careers in academia and beyond. So we came up with just a few suggestions of what are the ways some of us have tried to fund some of these interdisciplinary societies and or succeeded. And we came up with just two, which isn't a good sign, which means that they start and Derek's gonna add some. Knows some and Derek's gonna have some. And so I'm gonna try to do this somewhat live. I'll tell the quick story. Paulian and I have been on three variants, four variants of a Create Grid. We don't know at this point, where we've tried to do various things regarding sort of the intersection of statistics, computing, and astronomy, in some guise or the other. And we always, so we put in these creek, we asked Creek. So, we put in these create grants. Create grants are basically to create these networks of training for graduate students. That network can be at an individual university or that network can be across universities. They're a great way to train early career researchers if you can get them. But when you try to do a pan-Canada create, you still have to have a lead institution. And almost every time we put this through. This through it tends to get killed, even not even before getting out of the university level. Often, because, in my opinion, person acts in a field that isn't this says, oh, my field already knows how to do this, or we're already doing this. And so, we put these together, but we haven't had much success. Maybe we haven't found the right university to push it through, but this is something we can sort of think about: is there some approach to create grants for those of us who are in Canada we can do to? For those of us who are in Canada, we can do to actually maybe come up with some astrostatistics network across Canada. The more successful funding, at least in astronomy, I've found, has been MyTax. And MyTax is great for getting researchers to come here, but many of the researchers don't know that you can actually get funding to go to some other international location with a MITAX. And so that was one that we definitely wanted to mention. And I highly recommend. And I highly recommend that, as a graduate student or an early career researcher, postdoc, whatever, you look at my tax funding for these types of opportunities. And there's just a wide variety of them. Derek has some other ones. I'm going to try to go. So, okay, so I've had a lot of coffee, so I'm going to speak super quick. Oh, wonderful. So, okay, so in the U.S., the Create Grants are a lot like the REUs, is it? So you can be able to. So, you'd be able to run a training program at a university or university. It doesn't have to be a single one. So, that's the common one. So, for the U.S. folks, that is pretty good. So, just for a little bit of background, MyTax used to be an acronym that had to do with mathematics and industrial research and and it got moved from just mathematical sciences to something that was broader. And so they kept the name, which is kinda weird because it doesn't really give any information. Because it doesn't really give any information. But what it does allow you to do, so if I was working with David, for instance, in the UK, I could send a student there and they would chip in, I don't know, $10,000, or I can't remember the exact money of this student working with me. So for graduate students, if you want to do an exchange or you want to go work with somebody in different countries, it's not every country in the world, but there are approved countries. And frequently, there's an exchange program that's allowable too. So there's either granting. So there's either granting on the other side, there's an MOU, a memorandum of understanding of some sort that allows whatever funding agency, there's usually a partner funding agency when there's an exchange, they'll fund somebody that basically makes the whole thing awash. And anyway, it's kind of cool. And within that, I will say within Canada, actually, I'll say one thing that's out there right now. So you'd have to be doing this. Is anybody applying for a PSAP grant in the US? So PSAP is an. So, PSAP is an acronym PSAAP, Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program. So, it's a U.S. thing that is funded by the Department of Energy. And they have a call. They've just started talking about it. They fund five, usually five, well, let's say three to five major sites for five years that are able to do different things. So, I was on one grant that had to do with uncertainty quantification for radiative shock hydrodynamics. Radiative shock hydrodynamics. So, some space weather folks on that as well as weapons people because you get radiative shocks from different sources. So, that program would not be on it right now, but will fund an entire center for five years. So, it's convenient for the small centers, it's $1.5 million a year, and the big ones, I think it's $5 million a year. So it's a lot of money if you can. And folks dealing with the broader envelope of Envelope of space science of they had one on re-entry vehicles for one of the programs and things like that. So I'm not sure where astronomy would fit in, but it's a possibility. So PSAT is one. Within Canada, there's also the Alliance Grants and Alliance International, which allows you to work with folks in other countries. MyTax. And this group for the Canadian folks and the US folks, because these can go And U.S. folks, because these can go. I think the opportunity for folks here, and I don't think everybody, and probably not me, but if you get together, every X years, I don't know what X is, in Canada there's something called the New Frontiers Research Fund, which usually funds big projects. But the call comes out, and you know, it would come out in May, and we have to have this project grant written by August for the initial screening of it. Or initial screening of it, and you're like, holy crap. So you'd almost have to have it ready. So, this is really the message I'm sending to you: is think about writing, if you had to write a million dollar grant in Canada in astrostatistics or astronomy where there's statisticians involved, things like that, you want to be thinking about this and who your collaborators are going to be early. You don't want to wait until the full month period comes up. You want to be thinking, you want to have that sketched out already, like 50% of your proposal already. Like 50% of your proposal already sketched out, so you're ready to rock when that happens. And some universities have internal processes that begin well before any of these actual due dates occur. And they get inklings that these are about to occur because there may be some draft release or something like that. So it's not like the call will come out of the blue and you will be shocked that this is coming. There's also sometimes a little bit of a schedule. The schedule. So I think that preparing for that beforehand is probably Molla's idea. The other places I can tell you about, the Caden Space Agency does have money in the same way that NASA would, just divide it by 10, or more. And for a lot of folks, again, Canada, I know the Canadian system more. I will say that there's the Math Institutes slash Physics Institute. Institutes/slash physics institutes. So there's something called the Discovery Institute DIS program. I don't know what S stands for. But so that includes the Canadian Physical Sciences Institute, where Quinn, myself, and Edward works on this project, and Radu, and Tony, well, lots of people here. And David, yeah, actually all of us. I have a collaborative research team grant through the Canadian Cisco Sciences Institute. Institute Institute. So is this different than the NCERC Discovery Institute's? That's what it is. Yeah, it's Discovery Institute. Yeah, there is. Yes, it's through that. So that includes the so there are these collaborative research team grants. They're called collaborative research groups if you're applying to the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which will probably come next. It includes Beals Institute and the Sanso de Research Mathematique in Montreal. I think you should, you know, depending on where you live, you should cycle through these as you can. Cycle through these as you can to fund research programs. They fund postdocs as well and a lot of it. So, postdoc funding comes from there. Finally, I'll say the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and I will also say, gosh, there's that new, if anybody can remind me because I've now forgotten it, there's the new data science institute that took the place of SAMHSI in Chicago that hosts a number. That hosts a number of things. And oh, the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation. That would be another place to be hosting workshops, playing postdocs. Do you know any other, David? No. Can you say that one? I'm not the best. The Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation. Thanks. So, those are the ones off the top of my head that I can think of. And I will say within any. I will say within Canada, there are competitive postdoc positions at those mathematical sciences institutes. I will say, depending on the institute, I will say it's either seed funding for a postdoc or close to funding per postdoc. And by seed funding, they might give you $45,000, or depending on the other one, might give you $65,000 or $75,000. So it depends on the That is my brain jump. I tried to have to watch David. Do you know if this new institute in Chicago will have any ability to do things like Sam C D? You know, it had its programs with a year or anything. So I could find information on the postdocs. So they are running year-long programs on things like I'm looking at one, so there's a program on uncertainty quantification dated in 2025 and includes several workshops. I think it Workshops. I think when I'm looking at it, because I was just asked to help with one, what I see is it's kind of like the Newton Institute programs. There tends to be a bunch of themes and a bunch of organized workshops along those themes. But I don't know. SAMHSI would hire a bank of, so SAMHSI was just ended its run as the Statistical Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, which was in research in Triangle Park. They would hire. They would hire a bank of postdocs. There would be like 10 or 10 or 12 postdoc positions with a lot of them for them. Was it four? Was that? You'll guess how many were the asterisks that I don't talk? Three. Actually, they do two, but they made an exception and hired three postuffs. Okay, so it's not 10 or 12, it was three or four. I've just had so many of them, I thought it was more than one. What's that? So there were three in the AstroSat burger, but they had more than one kind of like topic in the year. And they might have like six. Okay. They might have like six or eight in total books. Okay. All right. So they hired a bunch, and I don't know if this new S2 is. I'm assuming they must. Does anybody know? This INSI, Samsung Placement. Yeah. They contacted us and they don't have host of positions. It is a slightly different kind of thing than Samsung. Unlike Samsi, they don't have a building where they can host people. I have and have a interaction. So they said that in the beginning they are only thinking about workshops. They will find workshops at different locations. They don't have physical space for that. So they are interested in astrostatistics. So George? Sorry. No, no, no, no, I'm just trying to remember his name. I have two questions. The first is that are you planning to? The first is that are you planning to share a copy of the slides around? The original point was to come up with a resource of these funding opportunities and share it with everyone so that when you want to go apply for funding, you can start here. I was actually thinking of just taking this myself and funding. The second question I had was: I know that I think a few years ago there was an MOU issued between NSERC and NSF for quantum AI applications. I wasn't sure if I knew that. Applications. I wasn't sure if anyone here had actually tried to apply for that at all. I just checked, it's still live, so apparently it's, but I don't know anyone who's actually done it, so that's why I just asked. That'd be kind of joint funding between the two. Yeah, apparently they sort of, on the NSERF side, it's like a word is an alliance grant, not on the US side support for USAF. People at my institution have done it, but not me personally. I know a lot of people at my institution have done the quantum aspect, not the Institutions have done the quantum aspect and not the AI aspect. Well, sorry, I don't know the people that have done the AI aspect. I guarantee you there are people at my university deal with that. I also know that CIFAR has been funding new faculty hires in those fields. CIFAR. CFAR is the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Media. Something like that. It's one of those acronyms that doesn't stand for anything anymore. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. But it funds. But it funds, it's this weird sort of public-private hybrid that funds research in some set of fairly specific areas. So the astro-related one is strong gravity and cosmology. So lots of the people who do pulsars or black holes or things like that are get some funding from that. Get some funding from that. If you're invited. If you're invited, yes. And no one quite knows how you get invited. Well, well, um well for the young people there is an opportunity whose deadline is today. So I didn't put it up there. The ASREAL Global Scholars Program. I also wanted to respond to Josh's comment. Court is trying to get Court is trying to get some of that quantum funding, but they rejected a first try, saying that we weren't training enough people in quantum stuff. Does it have to be both quantum and AI, or can it be either? I don't know the details. Honestly, this is um I haven't been involved in the proposal so I just move the volume emails to my the volume folder when I get them. Um but I Folder when I get them. But all I know is that we'd get another shot with some revisions. Aria, did you have a question? Yeah, I think my question was probably this is like a basic question. But for the MITACS funding, if you have like graduate students or postdocs, is it tied to the citizenship of? Tied to the citizenship of the students? Or is it through the professors, like the professors of life, or the grants and their institution. I say boldly. That was a question mark. I think so. I have existence proof of students having visited my group and being sent elsewhere and not being Canadian. I know for a fact they definitely bring non-Canadians in. I don't know about sending. I don't know about sending non-Canadians out. I think they don't want to send you back to your home country. So if you're a French student in Canada, they don't want to send you on exchange to France. But you could go somewhere else. It's not vocal. It's on the order of like somewhere between five and ten K. Yeah, so last the last person I hosted, which was earlier this year, was Which was earlier this year was 6K. No, 6K is including the top-up that you provide. It's not great money. It's not fantastic. So it's it like to send a student abroad for like three months or something? Yes. But is it for PhD students? Said RE REU before it was in a crowd. Oh no, so create, which was the so create was the the train. So Create was the training point. I think that's like the REUs. That's our rubber thing. Yeah, okay. So is Mytex no longer, like, I thought Mitex had to be an industry partner. Is that not the case anymore? They have some more flexible things. So not, sorry, they, yeah, so there are a litany of rules and so it's hard you'd have to have a MyTax person here to say so, but no, you can, you can, there are things for work with other researchers across the world. other researchers across the global across the world. So either I think bring in international students, which I had no idea. I guess the call's open for another two weeks? For the intake one, they typically have multiple calls a year set for the different semesters. So if you want a winter student, a summer student, there may be another one. There may be another one, and so there will be different deadlines along the way. I do not know for the sending out, and I definitely don't know for the registered. Yeah, and also, there were a lot of institutions have MITAX people who are assigned to your institution, and they will often impose additional deadlines. Yes. So so one thing, oh sorry, but I'm blabbing on. You didn't have a chance to chat. Why did you uh sorry about that? I was going to talk a bit about CANSI, but if you had more to add to what we were just saying. No, no, no, please. Yeah, so I just thought I would say a little bit about CANSI because I think astronomers may not be aware of this. So CANSI is the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute and they have these things called Collaborative Research Team Grants or CRTs. And these are specifically for new collaborations. For new collaborations between statisticians and/or maybe computer scientists, I think too, fall into that category, and domain scientists. So these are really helpful if you want to start some sort of new interdisciplinary collaboration. This is like how I got a grant with Derek and Radhu and David, and we were able to hire Tony because of this grant. They're quite large, they can be up to 200K for two to three years, which in Canada I think is pretty good. In Canada, I think it's pretty good. And I don't know how, but they're not super oversubscribed. Okay, that is my, from what I understand. So if you can make a good case for a CRT and put together a good proposal, I think there's a good chance of getting it. The other thing is that CANSE has a new thing called the Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellows Program, and this provides a lot of the funding for a postdoc. Not all of it, but a good chunk of it. Not all of it, but a good chunk of it. So if you're a faculty member and you want to get a postdoc, I think what you would end up paying for that portion of the postdoc salary would be almost like a graduate student's amount. And you have to, the distinguished postdoc program, it can also be interdisciplinary. So you would have some mentor from statistics or computer science. So I think that's another useful one. And I just discovered yesterday when I was looking at this, but they And I just discovered yesterday when I was looking at this, but they have a graduate student enrichment scholarship program. So this is for stats students only, but it's to enrich their education by sending them to work with other people, possibly in other areas of science. I got one of those this year for my grad student guide. It's also for, there's like three categories. One of them is sending them away or something like that, but there's also two other categories. And my understanding is this is not competitive. At least I got one. It's basically like ask for it and if they have the competitive. Awesome. Anyone interrupt? Awesome. I didn't want to interrupt right now. No, I didn't know it was anything like that. Yeah, so that's like a real thing that results in functions. Can it be post-computed? No, it's specific. There's three very specific categories under which you can receive one. One of them, the one I got, for example, is like a graduate student in statistics being co-supervised by a senior and junior faculty, where the junior faculty is like these conditions and is taking the primary roles. It's like very, because they have top one. But I read it and I was like, wait. When I read it, I was like, wait, I'm doing that. And very easy to throw the application together as well. Yeah, so that's all I wanted to mention about Cancy. I think there's opportunities there, and astronomers are probably not super aware of it. And yeah, it's a good way to start open collaboration with Cancy. Let's see. I was going to come back to this. So. So, I know we mentioned this Discovery Institute's support grants. The program is currently closed, but this seems like this might be another thing that this group, at least for the Canadians, would want to target. And then the other one, so we've dropped the word CFI a couple of times. So, CFI is the Canada Fund for Innovation and And they're designed to build infrastructure. I put infrastructure in quotes because you read what some of the infrastructure is and some of it's obvious. You know, you want to have a scanning tunneling electron microscope. You know, you might be able to apply for CFI. But some of it is less obvious. And for instance, about almost a decade ago, we realized that one of the things you could call infrastructure work One of the things you could call infrastructure were databases. And so this led to a bunch of astronomers in radio astronomy getting together and getting a CFI, this is called a Serata, where we're basically developing the infrastructure to do a bunch of things within radio astronomy to prepare for these next-generation telescopes that are going to absolutely be a glut for us. And this was, CFIs are, compared to a lot of these other things, CFIs. Compared to a lot of these other things, CFIs are not small money. So that was that version was probably like a four or five billion dollar project. And then there's another one that we cannot talk about whether or not it's been approved, which is about a $15 million project that was to talk about, which was called Candy Apple. And there, the idea was sort of building on this idea of infrastructure. Now we want to do some of the infrastructure. Now we want to do some of the infrastructure for LSST and some more radio astronomy and then join them together. And this is work to get software developers as part of your infrastructure. And you can imagine ways to write this in a way where you can actually fund statisticians as well. The key difference with these things, you cannot do science with both. How they distinguish that is very hard to see, but you're not hiring someone. But you're not hiring someone, like you can't hire someone on a 100% independent research postdoc. But some institutions allow you to do a 50% independent research postdoc and a 50% CFI postdoc. You could hire graduate students to do certain infrastructure type related stuff, but not actually doing the research. So there are ways in which we could use that. And they have routine calls. I will tell you that since I'm involved in Tell you that since I'm involved in Cassrada and Dandy Apple, it's a lot of work. Jess, Pauline, and I busted our butts most of last winter to help get this done. And Jess, even her university pulled another one of these internal things, and yet she still stayed on, which is, thank you. But they're one of those things where you do get a lot of, you do, you do. Things where you do get a lot of, you do, you do potentially get a lot out of it. Even if you're not even thinking about the money, just the fact that you work together so hard on something is often very useful for building larger collaborations later on. And then one other thing, how are we on time? We're close to it. Okay. I just want to plant a seed in some of our minds. One of the things that has made astronomy particularly successful, both in the Astronomy particularly successful both in the U.S. and in Canada in getting funds for their field is the fact that we go through decadal processing, decadal planning processes where we say for the next decade, these are our priorities. In the US, this is ordered by NASA and NSF say, we want you guys to tell us this. In Canada, we volunteer this information and maybe they listen. But I can tell you that we recently got the government to give us about $300 million. Us about $300 million to join the square kilometer array. So they listen, they just don't ask. But if you're thinking about how to grow astrostatistics, these are ways in which you start to grow the field. You start putting out white papers when these calls come in, whether for the U.S. or for Canada, to try to get this to be a priority in these documents. Think about: is there some type of institute, is there some type of software that Of software that we could build that would generate the next set of discoveries. I don't know what the answers are, but I think we probably have not been planning a lot in the astro side of for astro statistics for these long-range playoffs. And we've got midterm reviews coming up. You could get some stuff in there, but if not, it's almost not too early to start thinking about the 2030 plan. So, are you talking about Canada? So, there's the Canadian starting LRP, but there's also the US decadal. So, in the US decadal 2010 decadal had several white papers. They can be accessed now. They are all on last copy each. So, previous decadal and this decade out, one was talking to this fen and in other with home. And I can tell you that in twenty ten, the result was Result was formation of the working group, AAS Working Group on LAST. And probably not much in terms of funding. The programs now, they also are limited, but they start showing up. So it's good to put input, but it has to accept it that the input will... accepted that the input will not be well, maybe it would be better now, but uh histo historical um other priorities take place. Putting something in isn't a guarantee you get something out, but not putting something in is almost a guarantee that you won't get something out. Just you know, we've been putting this for a while already, right? So there is nothing out there. There is material out there, so people can go and see what was it in the past. I was wondering about private money. Is there any private money in this? I mean, there's certainly private money in U.S. astronomy. There's not too much private money in Canadian astronomy. There's a tiny bit. And I guess the Simons Foundation funding the Center for Computational Astronomy and the Humans are most of that money is going to Flatiron Institute. Which will it exist to start selling the Flatiron Building? Um what about something like the Moore Foundation? Is it like a private institutes like yeah, I think those um I think, yeah, I think those, I don't know if you're in Canada if you can apply those, but definitely in the US they have things like they funded my normal stock that you don't use. Simon and Sloaner I don't think so. But they're very upgraded. That reminded me of something else I was going to mention is I think a lot of universities now they have you know like a data science institute or something under that name and often there's internal funding through that. So I think if you're a graduate student and like definitely I think if you're a graduate student, definitely look into opportunities to apply for other might have scholarships and things like that if you're doing kind of interdisciplinary things. I think we're past time. First of all, thank you, Gwen. Thank you, Derek. And thank you all for participating. We will make this available, but I don't want to make this available as a static document. In other words, please, I'm going to give everyone the access to edit it. Everyone had the access to edit it. If you think of something, add something. And don't feel afraid to share this with others. I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but so the European Research Council, has that been mentioned at all? It hasn't been. So there is something called the ERC Synergy Grant, which is meant to be multiple PIs, up to two to four PIs, of which one of them can be in a non-EU country, which I believe Canada is, God says, a non-EU count. Canada is consistent and not EU. Is that right? No, no, no. Sorry, I mean, not part of the European Union Research Council. So what do they call it, Ken? It's called a synergy grant. ESG? EU European Research Council. These are like major 10 million. Yeah, these are like 10 million Euros over six years, up to six years. And you would have to have significant... Years. And you would have to have significant European partnerships. Exactly. But one of the PIs could be outside of, doesn't have to be associated with the ERC. It could be anywhere. Thank you all. Thanks, everyone. Wait, there's more. Why don't you guys do this so that I can do the editing at the same time? Yeah, I can do this. Before we get to this, the self-organized discussions, we did have one person who wasn't able to be here for the lightning talks this morning. Dame, do you want to come introduce yourself? Just to myself. Yeah. Unless there's anybody else who wants to okay. James first, because she's got a slide already and A slide already, and there you are. Yeah, my name is Yang Chen. I'm a statistician, currently assistant professor in the Department of Statistics and the Data Science Institute at the New York Michigan. I was trained as a Bayesian statistician, but gradually I kind of got driven to more frequentist approaches by my colleagues at the University of Michigan. So I used both the frequentist-based approaches and Bayesian approaches. Approaches, and Bayesian approaches to solve a lot of astrophysical problems, and more recently, on space weather problems where it studies the interaction between the Sun and Earth. I'm interested in astronomical locations, spatial temporal data modeling, large-scale imaging data, and I want to learn more fun astro statistics problem from all of you and also try to find future collaborative opportunities. Hello everyone, my name is Paul Bo Ho and I'm a fourth year PhD student from my main research interest is causal inference and machine learning with MC data. So I really look forward to finding some interesting data with machine data. I think that's everybody. Is there anyone online? Okay, cool. All right, so you probably all saw on the schedule that we have a lot of self-organized discussions for this week. And so the first two are happening tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow afternoon, and we thought we'd try to give like a little bit of structure to help you get going. But we expect like later on in the week you may have some groups that you're, you know, kind of working on something. And so I think the later self-organized discussions will be more self-organized than tomorrow. So to get things started, what we've done is we've created just a small Google survey where you can, we've sort of brainstormed some ideas that could be potential discussion topics, but we want to add those. So, Greg has. Want to add those. So, Greg has the survey open, and we want you to shout out ideas, put up your hand, whatever, and he will add them to the survey. And then, once we're done, that maybe we'll take like five minutes or so to do that, and then we'll send it around to you, and we want you to actually fill it out like right away before you leave for dinner. So, yes, this is gonna be pretty interactive. The first question, let's see, we'll make this. So, the idea is that we'll see how the poll comes out, but we'll take the most popular topics and then split up into groups. And then split up into groups. So there'll be one room that will talk about model fitting, if that's one of the most popular topics, and another room that will talk about forecasting or whatever. If everybody picks the same first choice, I guess we'll all stay here. I don't know. And we broke this up. Here we've got some statistical methods topics. There's another page for astronomy topics. So these are just, you know, just to know that these exist, but we can start. To know that these exist, but we can start with one. Yeah. Those are the actual formats. Yeah. So the statistical ones. If you can't read it from where you're sitting, we've written down classification, data fusion or aggregation, forecasting, high-dimensional data sets, large data sets, MCMC or Bayesian computation, model fitting, noisy, biased, incomplete data, simulation-based inference, and time series analysis. So, does anyone have something they would like to add? They would like to add. So, how many can we say razor advanced to? So, you're going to vote through the Google survey. Right now, we just want to know if we should add anything to the list. Yeah. On the Google Survey, you'll be asked what's your first, what's your second? Yes. I'd like to actually not have foreign statistical technique to analyze this. Because we have an item called model 50 that includes everything about statistics. So should we X that one maybe? I was actually going to vote for that one. That actually sounds like an interesting question. I do have a link to that. Yeah, David, yeah. Might be interesting to have one. To have one. Point processes, yeah. That's awesome, yeah. It's not going to be done on that screen, but it's being done on the screen. Yeah, this is a screenshot, so we won't. Yeah, Jess. What about explainability from changing? Oh, like in changes. Yeah, that's a good one. I will warn you that the later ones are not going to be in alphabetical order, so. Yeah, Arya. How about like dependence? Dependence. Oh, okay, yeah. Oh, okay, yeah. Dependence modeling slash copulants. Sorry. Dependence modeling slash copulas. C-O-P-U-L-A-F. Copulas. Simulation-based inference you mean ABC, likelihood-free computation? Yeah. This was like simulation-based inference we noticed. This was like simulation-based inference. We noticed it was on quite a few slides, like in the lightning talks, so that's why we put it up there. But I mean, likelihood free computation. Likelihood, free computation? Yeah. It's a question of procedure. So a lot of these have a lot of overlap. I was wondering, so like, would it be the case that, will it be the case that groups will be made with maybe? Be the case that, like, groups will be made with, like, maybe you guys could talk about these four related topics. Or, like, yeah, I'm just asking, because, like, model fitting, yeah, as Yang said, like, everything is model fitting, right? But but the, but it still is an interesting topic to talk about. Yeah. What are some techniques that you should try for like fitting new models there? So I'm just curious. So, I mean, I guess we could do that if there's, I mean, there's a lot of things I could see of close tie between topics, and maybe if the two topics are related, we could combine them. Yeah, high-dimensional approach. Yeah. Yeah, high-dimensional approach. This is why it will probably take us five minutes to figure out what's is there any any other things for this or should we move on to the astronomy?
