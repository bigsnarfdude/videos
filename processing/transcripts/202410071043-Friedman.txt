Okay, so I'm going to give you a sort of a brief picture of many things because I want to convince you that there's a lot of exciting things for mathematicians in modeling various medical Medical diseases. And you can extract good mathematics as well. But you have to start with the biology. So the columns are all involved with the three boundaries. Tumer is an example because the boundary is changing. So just as an example, So just as an introduction, as a three minutes introduction to free boundaries, here are some classical problems. Okay, so the Stefan problem. So this is the problem of melting of ice. Theta is the temperature. Theta is a temperature, satisfies the usual heat equation. This boundary between ice, water and ice is changing as flux of heat, this energy, is used to move in this boundary between water and ice. Okay, so this is an old problem, I think. This is an old problem, I think, maybe 150 years ago. This is the Hillysaw problem, which occurs under different physical assumptions. One is that we have a fluid between two plates, and the distance between the plates is very small. You make a lot of approximation to the... You make a lot of approximation to the Lier-Stokes equations, and then you get the pressure, using the pressure, in the water due to the pressing upon two flat surfaces, satisfies a Laplace equation, a very simple equation. But on the boundary, we have a funny condition that the pressure is proportional to kappa, which is a mean curvature. And the normal derivative, the flux of the pressure, is the one that moves the boundary, V. This is a time-dependent problem, by the way, even though you don't see T here, except here, omega sub t, because v is a velocity which depends on time, since originally, initially, this is not a sphere. This could anything. Sphere, this because any domain, and then V is the velocity that moves the boundary, and the steady state of this time-dependent problem is a sphere. Okay? There is a unique local web sphere. Now, okay, so that's maybe one more comment. Maybe one more comment on this is, maybe I'll just go a little bit further. That if you have initially something which is not a sphere, as you go to t goes to infinity, it converges to a sphere. The sphere is stable. And the configuration is stable. Take any initial values, solve the really sol problem in time. The limit is a sphere, somewhere in space. Okay? Now let's take a very simple model. So now cancer has a lot, so it depends upon the kind of cancer. You have a different kind of model. But this is something very, very simple. Very, very simple. For the purpose of mathematics, we take a cancer where all the thing inside is full with cancer cells and the density is constant, constant velocity. But they are moving because the boundary is moving. Cancer goals. So the tumor cell density is Density is constant uniform, and but there are nutrients coming from the blood across the boundary, the concentration of the boundary is constant, and they're coming in and being eaten as a source for the cancer cells. And as a result, the cancer cells are the cells. The tensile boundary grows. There is a velocity here, and this velocity, there is a velocity presumed everywhere here, and it is this velocity that moves the boundary forward or decreases. So this is an amount of density, sigma, minus some, there is a critical number, sigma tilde, which is less than one. Which is less than one. So if sigma is bigger than this minimum, then this is positive, the tumor will go. If it is less, the tumor may decrease. So depending how, you know, if you are starved, you get thin error. So small error. Okay. Now this is the conservation of mass, except there is usually here the part the derivative of the density with respect to time plus the divergence, but since the density is But since the density is constant of the tumor cells, then there is no, it's just divergence V equal to that. So mu is how effective the growth of the velocity is under the same nourishment. So I guess if toggle were ever larger. Okay, so now we go here. So, this is how the nutrients is a nutrient equation. This is a heat operator, and if you think of put this sigma plus sigma, put it on the right left hand side, on the right-hand side, this is a sigma is. Sigma is decreasing. And this term is consumption. This is a consumption. Okay? So this is the second equation. There are two equations. Now, we make another assumption that the velocity is, so this is like a torus medium, which means the velocity is proportional to the pressure. This is the pressure of the cells. Of the cells in the tissue, P. Okay? And then you combine, you use the, remember there used to be here divergence v equal to mu something. Since V is the gradient of the pressure, this is Laplacian. So Laplacian of P, or Laplacian of P, is equal to this. So two equations. Equal to this. So two equations. One is for nutrients, one is for the pressure. Okay? This equation and this equation. And then there is a boundary condition set. The nutrients are constant. The pressure we assume is proportional to the mean curvature. And the velocity is the velocity. The velocity in the normal direction to the boundary is. Boundary is E dot n, a norm, a number alpha number, okay? Which is, because of the first equation, and because V is here, so the because no minus the gradient P, so you get the minus the P d N. So this is a very simple model of cancer. What happens if mu is zero? Then Lausanne P is zero. P is proportional on the boundary, the curvature, the velocity is this. So this is the Helioshock problem. The classical Hilly Shock problem is a very special case of cancer that doesn't go. Not aggressive, which doesn't do anything. So that already shows you, this is a very, very simple model, that you have opportunity now to develop lots of interesting mathematics. And so the first question is, and this is something that we asked some. That we asked some years ago with Beiru is what happens, what happens if you, first of all, is what are the shapes, the steady state of the cancer. What are the spherical shapes of the cancer? So, in the spherical case, there are solutions, and this is a radius the radius of the and the space the radius of the The radius of the tumor depends on the sigma tilde. And the solutions given for the nutrients depend just on the use. But the pressure, of course, depends on mu, the aggressiveness of the tumor. So here we have a parameter mu, and for every μ and for every μ it's the same for the same sphere, the same μ. So, what happens if you change the μ? If μ is 0, you are going to get the initial problem. Not very interesting. So, what happens if mu changes? It turns out that we have bifurcation. Bifurcation from symmetry. So, here is the whole thing about bifurcation from industry, all kinds of theories. And you see, there is a first buffet, second one, and so on. And three dimensions, this is two dimensions like that. Start with Rs plus epsilon something. In three dimensions, Rs plus epsilon, some static harmonic function. What about stability? Well, here, for me, all they are unstable, all of them are unstable. All they are unstable, all them unstable. On the left side, so mu small is very much like the Heli show. Mu zero, the sphere is stable. If mu small, it's also stable. But at some point, it stops being stable. It could be when this point reaches the first bifurcation U sub two, but it can be earlier. But it can be earlier. So, this is a joint with who, and so. And that depends on what was the size of the spherical steady-state solution. If it's bigger than some number out about or less than some number out above, if the outbound And the unbound is given by a solution of some exponential transcendental equation. And at this point, you have bifurcation, but it is resembling hop bifurcation, but it's still different. So, this is one example. And what would be an open problem, a large set of open problems, what happens if you instead of arranging What happens if instead of having just cancer, with steady, just cancer cells with constant velocity, you have a little bit more realistic, say cancer cells, normal cells, T cells, T cells that kill cancer cells. And we'll assume the total density of the cells is constant. What happens then? What happens then? Well, let's simplify. Let's suppose that the T cells that kill cancer cells is constant. Let's start with two equations. It's constant. Constant will be some number eta. Yeah, it will be eta. Okay. So seriously, if So serious equation of cancer cells and eta kills cancer cells. The delta zero are death rates. So the competition between cancer cells and normal cells under the cancer cell proliferate more than normal cells. The political Normal cells, they're polycharging people, but they're under being killed by T cells. Are they steady states, are they stable, and so on? So there are some partial results in the case of two. And since the sum C plus N is one, you actually can eliminate one of these equations and deal just with one equation. That will be complicated. It will be complicated. So it's always good to think of either you ride on two horses or on one, but there's an extra burden on this one. Either work with two or three. And it's good to do both. So, anyway, I will not go into results here, actual results, but I just mentioned that they are actual results. Okay, second. Okay, second thing is uh I didn't know if Elvian is going to give the talk so I thought I will talk about some John Papers with him. I mean he has a misfortune to be a colleague of mine kept telling him here is a problem we have to work on. And we simplify the model so that we work on, we make mathematics out of it, otherwise you cannot do that. Okay, so for Okay, so fun guy. They can be pronounced in England differently, and Scotland differently, and probably Western Canada also. So they are eukaryotic cells, that means that our cells that also have the nucleus and And they are everywhere. In the soil, in trees, but also in animals' body, particularly human body. There are so many different cells, so many different kinds of fungi. But the most studied are those that are more pathogenic for humans. And albicans is that class of fungi. Of effrunga. So I'm going to talk about C alphicans, especially pathogenic, and enter the blood, can enter the blood, penetrate into internal organs, and then it becomes life-threatening. It doesn't cure as much as malaria, but it does kill some people. But it kills also mosquitoes, sleepy. Transgenic fungi, actually. It's what? They clue mosquitoes as well. Anyway, so it confronted the immune system. And the immune system consists of innate immune systems that are always in the body, ready to attack anything. And there is an adaptive immune system. There is an adaptive immune system here, there is it, that comes in when the disease doesn't, cannot be, the pathogen cannot be handled only by the solely by the innate immune system. And these are the T cells that I'm going to introduce, because there are different kinds of T cells. Okay, so Okay, so uh here's what they look like but anyway, this is a they start from some source and they go up and in this shape that's a cycle another picture which shows how they send they move They move in radial directions, and the reason they move in radial directions is very simple: because they want to get food, nutrients, and it's lessened the competition if they stay away from others. So they're going this form. And this is another picture. Here, this is, so it depends from how far at what kind of bird view you look at the At the distribution of the fungi, so this sounds to be a little bit circular. And from what we see on our body, if we are infected with fungi, is something like that. So, this is the kind of thing I want to talk about. What are the immune systems that are involved? Primarily, neutrophils that are the most common white cells in the blood system. And they are the first one to react. They can destroy the the full guy by simply shooting granul granulus. Grenulus into the body of the cells, biotic cells. And the second one, the informatic immune system, cytotoxic T cells. And that's how what they do. Okay, they do the same thing except that with different power. Okay, so here is ODE. Note excellence, the word PDE, okay. So here is a fun guide, density. Both there is logistic oath, there's diffusion, the logistic oath, that are killed by nutrients coefficient. Coefficient eta, the arch T cells, nutrient, L the density, the strength zeta and the so what makes immune the net immune system reacts. Immune system reacts when they notice the fungi, which is a strange body, it activates them. So, this activation of the neutrophils by F, but neutrophils are always in the blood at some density N0. So it activates them above, those above N0. Those above N0, they die. Above N0, they die. Those that are the level of N0 remain zero. I could put you the source independent of F and the death rate so that, but instead I just put a little bit of this. Anyway, so this is the equation for the nutrients, for the nutrients. The nutrients, for the neutrophils. The T cells, okay, the T cells have to go through a sequence of cells until you come to the cytotoxic T cells. I just forgot all of this to simplify the model. And we are saying that they are activated either because they observe the nutrients that have come around here, they respond to the innating nutrients. They respond to the innate immune system with this strength, lambda TN and they also come independently through a series which can be justified in the model, in the biological model. Okay, now what we what happens? Here is a an interesting inequality. Inequality if the strength by which N kills F plus the strength by which zeta kills T is larger, the combination of these two is larger than the strength by which F is being growing, or say smaller than the strength by which they are unable. They are unable to eliminate the one guy and there exists a constant solution, F star, L star, T star, of this system. So this is if they are unable to eliminate the both the full guide. The fungi with an agile gold, then there is a steady state. In other words, you are all the time infected. Okay, some initial conditions. The velocity, we take to bits here. On the boundary, on the boundary of omega t, we say that there is no more, on the boundary is no f. On the boundary is no f. F outside the boundary of the full guide, there is nothing. There's no full guide. F is zero. So by continuity, f is zero on the boundary. And n is n zero, and t is t zero, which we can hide like this. And the velocity is proportional to minus to the flux of f across normal boundary. And we can take h to be simple function. And you can take h to be a simple function, for example, h of s will be s, for example, you times s or something, constant times, all like this show kind of formula, okay? And look at the Herbial case. So the question is what happens with the Can the immune system cope? Who is going to win? And if not, then what will happen? So the first statement is, so this is joint with the ADR. If as As t goes to infinity, the radius of the well infected by the fungi is finite, then it has to be that f is zero everywhere. In other words, it's cued. N will be the normal velocity, t will be the normal. Verocity, T will be the normal in health, in health, in health. So if the radius is finite, or and then you have no disease, you cure, either you are cured, or it becomes infinite. There's no other option. Now, when is when is what? So if, you see, if the strength, if the strength If the strength of killing times N0, the strength of balanutrients, balancing T cells, that is bigger than the growth of natural growth of the fungi, then it will be finite. If it's not, lambda f is larger, then then it will be infinite. But on one condition, that initial is infected already was not too trivial, was had to be about this number, fixed number here. So it's either the disease will disappear, will be controlled. Will be controlled by the immune system. No drugs are needed, or else if the infection growth is larger than what the immune system can do, and it's already started by certain theoretical numbers, and it's going to infinity. Going to infinity. And then the question is: where the ratios go to infinity, what will be the size of the infection? That's always the most difficult thing to show: that if it's going to infinity, as you can see here, then it goes to the steady state. The OTE steady state. Uh OTE steady state uniformly in bounded sets of R. We have this extra condition here about the strength of these set it's not clear if this is technical or not technical, but uh okay, so now uh so what's the conclusion if you want uh the medical sense and it's Medical sensors. There are two kinds of drugs: those that try to kill the fungi, and those that try to strengthen the immune system, which can be done with some drugs. So two kinds of drugs. And either one is going to decrease its number. And the open problem is non-circular infection. So that's a starting state with the local existence and all that stuff. Okay, let me go to the second problem. That's a Hill Wundering. That's a problem that we considered with several points of view. But let me give you here the three dimensional Dimensional version. So we have here a wound, there's a surface, thermal wound, there's a surface of the skin. And this is a wound. And this remaining part is closure around the wound. It's going to it's partially healed and it's going to close the wound. Going to close the wound. Two minutes? Two minutes? Oh my god, okay. So here is a problem that. Sorry. Okay, so you can see here that we have a strongly parallelic system and we have a free boundary problem and this is not only part of the problem. Or because this key is just one of the variables. Okay, so let me go to the Circular geometry, you can say more, and let me skip that pneumatogritis. Okay, here's an example of a where inflammation gets into the blood, into this here, the synovial called synovial membrane. That's the blood comes. That's the blood comes in and it feeds the cartilage which is here and above it in the bone. And these two bone make contact as you walk and it's an autoimmune disease and therefore the cells here, the immune cells, are inflammatory and there is no cure to it. And this is the free boundary where this is going to go This is going to go, where this is the synovial membrane, it's going to go, and the catalyst is going to disappear. And the question is, does it disappear in the system? And here is some mathematics that shows that there are two phase problems. This is just part of it. The membrane is here, and something happens here, and something happens here. And there is inflammation. And okay, this is the shape of the free boundary here, of the radius of the height of the membrane and Okay, here is some asymptotic behavior tells us that So here you see conditions under which RT goes to LP, which means all the cartilage disappeared. In other words, you need the new knee. This is partial knee. This is partially and there are conditions depending on new blood which depends on the inflammation. Depending on the inflammation, you may not need to check to have a new replacement or okay. If I have more examples here, a two-phase. As a two-phase, it's more complicated. You see, the information is given by ENF alpha, which comes from the disinflammatory thing coming from the depending on several equations and okay. Atherosclerosis is let me the last example. Here again, this is if you want to know if your cholesterol is okay, then come to me afterwards and I'll exchange This is a danger zone where this is the zone where if you have, that is the LDL and HDR, if you have a little plug developing here, will it grow or will it disappear? Or can there be stationary? So this is a question we discussed with Mary Howe and who. This is a mathematical model. This picture is more biological. This picture is more biological, from my full biological model. This is from the simplified mathematical model, where we answer the question and we talked about use the HDL, for example, bad ones and the good ones, and it's in this region, then you are going to have a stationary a stationary uh state stationary plaque. Stationary plug stable or not stable, and then there is application, but that's already some other frequency. I think the UN students did. I think that I have finished. Thank you. Thank you very much.
