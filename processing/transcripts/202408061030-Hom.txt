I don't know if I have a trick, but I guess in Andrew's email it said it could be a trick or a recurrent theme or a leit motif. And I didn't know what a leit motif was. So instead I'm going to tell you about how to use full homology to study concordance and homology concordism. I guess you could say this has been a recurrent theme in probably most of my research. Most of my research. So, I guess I'll just start by reminding you of these things. So, the comportance group, well, we say that two knots, K9 and K1 are convert because they co-bound a smooth annulus. In S3 plus I. So maybe the cartine picture is you have something like K1 up here, and then you have K0 down here, and this is happening in the S3 plus I. And then we like to study the concordance group, which consists of not an SK module of this football installation. Okay, so that's one of the main objects that we want to study. Maybe the other main objects. Maybe the other main object that we want to study will be the homology of the borders in group. So we say that two finger folds, y0 and y1, are homology co-ordinate. Okay, so they should be coordinant. So they should co-bound. We should co-bound, let's say, a smooth, compact, co-manifold W. Okay. And now we want the homology part, and so we'll be working with homology with C coefficients. And so we want W to look like a product on the level of homology. And so one way to say that is that on the map is used by efficient on homology. Ontology to etymology should be an expression. Okay, and so then you can define the homology cobordism group, theta 3C. So this consists of integer homology space, modular homology boards. And so now our calls. And so now our goal will be to use fluorohomology to study these groups to get homology cobordism and get notified variants. Maybe I'll say a little bit about sort of what we know about the homology coboris and group. So maybe your first question would be: well, is this thing non-trivial? It is. Non-trivial. It is. So we have the Rockland array that gives us a surjective homomorphism from the homology cobordism group 2C2. Right, and so I guess for a long time that was sort of like all that was known. That was sort of like all that was known about the homology of the mortism group. I guess apparently it was even conjectured that this might be an isomorphism. That's very far from the case. So in fact, I guess the thoughtless result we had about the structure of the ethology of morphism group is that it admits hold of the infinity to X mode. So this is joint with Irving Guy. Joint with Irving Guy, Matt Staffman, and another reason you might care about the homology cobaltism group is that it played a key role in Nanolascu's disproof of the high-dimensional triangulation conjecture. So, sort of the key ingredient that he proved is that if you have, if there's no homology spheres with rocks and variant one, that are according to the homology order, things. Topology will be existing. So then there's some exact ways that we rely on an earlier work of Louis Freester and Martin Boger. Okay, so now my light motif will be to use photomology to study these things. And so what is the main theme? Right, so phlohomology, so like not photomology. So, like not phletomology or hagrett philosomology or maybe pin-to-markle phletomology. Well, they two like two, it's some topological object. So you have some topological object. So say not, but it's a native hold. Okay, so then you get some You get some invariant, you get some algebraic object. So maybe a chain complex, and maybe a homotopy class of chain complexes. So, like a not flow complex in the higher flow complex. Okay, and so these things. Okay, and so these things are like, this is like an invariant about the isotopy class, what we're not, and this is an invariant of the homeomorphism type of the manifold. And so you want to try to understand, well, which part of these invariants is actually a concordance involved or homology performance, right? So out of this, you want to get some new Want to get some new homology performism or performance environments and then you probably want to use these to prove some truth or re-truth of some initial statement. Okay, so what I want to focus on today is maybe like this part, right? So you have this thing, so there's sort of like two things you need to do. You need to figure out like which part of this invariant is actually a concordance invariant, and then you need to be able to extract something you can actually. Need to be able to extract something that you can actually do things with. So, maybe you find some direct summand whose chain homotopy type is of importance and variant, but maybe you like, maybe you haven't taken Ian's algebra 3 class, and like, that's too much algebra for me. So you want like a number or something. I want something like simple, like a number or like number is a volume, actually. I can understand numbers. Okay, cool, great. Okay, so like the first step of that program is to try to understand which part of those algebraic objects is actually a concordance of homology concordance. Because it's not the whole thing, right? So like the un-knot is the only knot who's like not fluid complex, it's just the random thing, but there's lots of twice not, and they're not fluid complex. And they're not for complexities, not just the main tool to sort of suss out which part of these things is the concordance of homology for what is meaning right, right? Is local equivalence. So, this talk would be somewhat ahistorical, and I think that's sort of like a theme that we've seen. I think that's sort of like a theme that we've seen also like yesterday: is that like, you know, there were these results, and then maybe later on it was sort of seen like the big picture that we really fit into. Okay, so maybe I'll have to just tell you what kind of objects these are. So to adopt K, we have this dot flu complex. This is the outshopping dot flow. So this is the outside imaging skin. So I'll be using this thing sort of the same way Ian did yesterday. So this will be a chain complex over a polynomial min in two variables. I think Ian called them W and Z because they count the W and Z base points, which makes a lot of sense, but I'll call them U and V. All right, so that's this one. And so the three-manifold version, like the Hagar Floyd chain complex, well that's a chain complex over F A join U. Let's be fancy today and do the involvement inversion, do the system. And do the involvement infraction, do the just the chip grade. So we'll call that C of I minus. And so what kind of gadget is this thing? This is a chain complex over ethoin u cubed, and then we'll mod out by q squared. And maybe the third version I want to tell you about, I don't know what notation to use, so we'll just call it C of Y for some supply chain complex. Okay, and so this will be, okay, so this is, okay, so it's either chipmunk, and also my chest go in. Well, there's pin to. Chester Lynn, well there's Kintu formology. Okay, and then maybe you want things to kind of look like things that you already know how to work with. And so then maybe then you can apply control duality to these gadgets. And so now you get a chain complex. Now you get a chain complex over DGA. So this is going to be F adjoining UQ. And so it's endowed as a differential. And so the differential is going to be that the boundary of U is transferred. Okay. So. Does it matter that I have no idea what possible duality is? idea what because we draw ideas. I don't think. It's some equivalence of some kind of category. So you can pass some gadgets that are like, you know, these pin2 complexes of type SWF and then you get a chain output with this DGA. And there's a recipe that when you have your pin2 complex, it's like you basically tensor it with this and then the You tensor it with this, and then the s and the j action, there's like a formula for what they become in terms of actions. Other questions? Oh, the s and the j in pin two. Oh. I was alluding to the recipe to pass from these complexes to these. The recipe will not be. systems. The recipe will not be important, but there's this one. Wait. So we have these algebraic gadgets that are invariants of the isotopy or homomorphism type of our topological objects. Now we want to understand which part of these algebraic objects are concordance or homology of those invariants. And so to that end, we need to understand what A. A our local map is okay, so let's say local map between, I'll just say floor complexes, and you can think of any of these three examples that are around the globe. Okay, so should we Okay, so it should be map. I'll say morphism. So by morphism, I mean it respects whatever module structure. You have some more vision from your first complex to your second complex, and then it needs this one extra special property. It needs to induce an isomorphism on localized homology. So, local is homology is when you invert u. So, local apps. Okay, so we have this. Okay, so we have this map that has this sort of special property. So that this local estomology, basically all of these, all the examples on the board, like you can flow by information and just get a module over F of join U. So like here, in the not flow case, if you mod it out by V, then you get a module over F of Join U. It turns out that all of these invariants have a property that there's a single free sub n. 3 summing it. And so this is sort of, you should think of this isomorphism as preserving that free summary. And the key point is that having maps that preserve this free summand, those are exactly what concordances or homology cohorts is about. So that's why this definition is key to using these invariants to sort of sort of figure out which parts of these invariants of concordance or homology coordinates. So these complexes, C1 and C2, assume that they're locally equivalent if there exist global maps in both dimensions. And then the key point, which was maybe, it was observed in sort of various guises by a variety of people, but I think sort of the key person to mention is Ian is that components for the biologic organism Organism induces local equivalence. So the key point is that, well, if two knots are concordant, well then their knot flow complexes are locally equivalent. If two three manifolds are homology coordinate, then the invaluative behavior flow complexes are locally equivalent. All right. Okay, so that was step Okay, so that was step one, which was to sort of figure out which part of these invariants are components of homology components. And then maybe step two is to figure out how to extract tractable invariants out of these things. And so that's like this delicate, it's like this delicate game of like, so what you could do is you could just look at the local equivalent. So what you could do is you could just look at the local equivalence class of the chain complex. Like that would be like a very strong invariant. But then you look at that and you're like, well like I like I don't know what that means. So then your goal is to maybe throw away like just enough information so you can get something out that's tractable, but you have threw away enough information that now you can know how to deal with it. So let me tell you about several examples of throwing away some information. Away some information, but not so much information that we like to lose, lose everything. Questions? Okay, so first let's do this in the setting in the non-setting. Okay, so this is a five-minute gene complex. Over Foi and D. So, maybe the first example I want to talk about is the Tau and Ray through the Hashaf and Sabo maybe 20 years ago. Wait, so this is a number. I know what numbers are. So two thousand three. 2003. So seem really a historical because I guess Ian was probably alive, but barely. Wait. So what does sound? It has to do with the ratings. And okay, so like this is way more information than we need. So what do we want to do? Let's look at, okay, let's look at this. Looked at, if I let's look at this one, because I'm like, you don't even need the second variable. Polynomial wings are the two variables and maybe not great, but if you mod out by v, well now it's a polynomial wing over a field, so that's like a P I D, so like lots of things are nicer. So we mod out by V. We can take the homology of this thing, right? And okay, so now let's look at elements in there. Elements in there. So now this is going to be a module over F adjoin U. So you can look for elements that are not u torsion. So X is not U torsion. Let's look at all of these elements and then let's look at the This thing is bi-based. Let's look at the gradient of this thing. And then let's look at the let's put a one-half in there. And then let's take the maximum of this thing. And that's to the minus sign. That's how they normalize it, I guess. But anyway, so don't worry about all this normalization stuff. Just the point is, find out some information. So you get a module over a PID, and then you just look for the highest graded piece that's not information. And that's what this town variant is. And that's what this town variant is. It's great. In fact, not only is it a concordance invariant, it's a homomorphism onto subjective homomorphism onto the integers. It gives the new truth of the Millner conjecture about the unodded number of tar stats. So it's great. Tao is great. Alec, what are some other ways you might get out? Ways you might get out invariants from this thing. Well, there's something called oops long of k. So this takes on values in piecewise linear functions from the integral from 0 to 2. Oops. This is too good. This is due to our transpitches of Zalabo in like 2014, so 10 years ago. Okay, um how should we think about opsilon? Okay, so remember we have this moon R B I'm a topologist, so even when I'm doing like algebraic things, I still want to have a picture in my head. So when I picture this thing, I picture it like in a plane, and I see like U's and E's and V. So like this is how I picture this ring. Okay, so here we kind of like made the ring smaller. Like, made the ring smaller by quotienting out by V, well, you could also make the ring bigger. So, how did you make the ring bigger? Well, you look at this ring and you're like, oh, well, this is the first project of the plane. Well, like, why not just use like a half plane? And, like, let's get a family of invariants. Let's use a family of half planes. Right? So, like, if you like, invert. So, what do I mean by that? I mean, like. So, what do I mean by that? I mean, like, let's take like lines through the origin of slope S. Right, so I guess I'll call this R S. So, this will be the suffering of factor drawing u to the plus or minus 1v to the plus or minus 1. And then, let's say generated by u to the i theta such. B to the j such that i cross sj is greater than equals zero. Don't have to exactly. I wrote the formula right, but the point is s should be parametrizing the slope, right? So sort of going from infinity all the way down to zero, and then you're splitting at all this stuff here. Okay, so I guess maybe s should be Maybe these are many good slopes. Anyway, you parametrize the slopes for now. Alright, and so then, well, you can look at your not flow complex. You can tensor it over this ring R with this bigger ring RS. Great, so let's call this like S modified. Okay, so now we have like a full infinite family's worth of complexes that we can like do local works on. Okay, and so now we have this whole family of complexes, and now very roughly, just like do tau to like this family. So like look at the max grading of some non-tuition thing. And so that's morally, that's what the song is. It's renormalized slightly differently so that the slopes are parameterized between 0 and 2 and the grading. You have to put some normalization on the grading. The point is that each one is basically the next grading. Oopsilon has lots of nice properties. You get a piecewise linear function, so it also gives you an example of Opsilon Trefoil looks something like this. So it's piecewise linear. It only has finitely many discontinuities. So the point is, as you vary this slope s, there's like some constraints on sort of like how badly this can behave. What else can you do? So there's the concordance invariant epsilon. So that takes our values in the set negative 1, 0, 1. I define this in my THD thesis. I guess I wanted it variant that was a number, and I didn't really want that numbers. Okay, so how do you define epsilon? To find epsilon, well, okay, so let's look at these not 1 complexes. Okay, let's quotient out, right? So these things are chain complexes over F of ju. So let's quotient out by U times V. And now I'm going to declare that this is less than or equal to the mount flow complex of H. If. There exists a local map in this direction. So now you can define, we have this sort of inequality. And then, well, how does this define epsilon? Epsilon of k is 1. 1 if so 0 will be the not flow complex of the unknown, or equivalently just the remaining average or mean V by 2 times C. Alright, so now maybe you can guess what epsilon being minus 1 should be. Well, that's if that's So that's telling you you have a local map in this direction and then a zero otherwise. So that happens exactly when the not flow complex of K is locally equivalent by Dv to the not flow complex of R1. Okay. Um so that's epsilon. That's epsilon. And so, sort of, here the key point was: well, how much information did we want to spell out? We wanted to spell out like this much information. We wanted to mod out like e times b. Well, then you might say, well, okay, we're modding out by u times v, but then we're sort of only looking at this very limited information of sort of how does our not flow complex compared to the complex of the unknot. Complex of the unknown. But well, you could just look at local equivalence over the ring after joining UV mod. Maybe that's the fourth part. We'll go over once over FHA V mode. And somehow, for algebraic reasons that, like, I know from through minute. I know from two-minute work, but I don't understand why this ring has zero devices, which seems kind of bad, but somehow this ring actually makes things easier to work with. So if you look at local equivalence over this ring, it's like some equivalence class of chain complexes. But it turns out that these equivalence classes have very nice representatives. So it turns out that elements of these equivalence classes Classes. They're parametrized by sequences. So by finite sequences of integers. Wait, so I said I wanted nine variants to be numbers. Well, you know, eventually I I was able to handle sequences of numbers. That's that's still like something I can handle. That's still something I can handle. So, subframes by finite sequences of integers. So, that's great. That's pretty tractable. So, doing local equivalence over this thing is quite nice. And then, in fact, from these sequences, you can extract these invariants EI. You get a whole infinite family's worth of these invariants. Wait, these are nice because they're concordance homomorphisms. They're not related to some earlier concordance invariants. So tau is just the weighted sum of these. Okay, so that's maybe what you can do in the not setting. What can you do in the involvement of floor setting? So I guess the first thing is due to piston and chipping. They define these five invariants D, lower, and D upper. So now let's So now let's look at integer homology series. Let's look at this thing, C if I minus apply. So remember this was a chain complex that we're doing P modulus with. Okay, so now basically the idea is that you have like these two U towers. One of them is just sort of, yeah. It's just sort of, yeah, the u towers, the other one is like q of it, and then, well, there's no more because q squared is 0. So the point is, you basically have these two u towers, and then you can use those to define d lower and d upper. So, again, sort of morely like this is like the same idea as how the tower. The same idea is like how the town there is defined. We're just looking at these non-view torsion elements, or maybe non-due torsion, the image of Q. Great. Okay. And then, well, you can also play this game, right? So like, what do I mean by playing this game? I mean, well, let's look at local equivalence over. Over. When you're playing this game, well, just now it's mod out by EQ also. And it turns out, you get the same result. Elements are parameterized by sequences of, finite sequences of integers. You get these phi i invariants. Wait, so you get these phi i invariants. We've got these P i nice. And sort of, these are the invariants that we use to get the infrared length coming in the topology comparison. So now let me tell you about maybe the third sort of version of philhomology that I mentioned. Etymology that I mentioned, which is this one coming from pin to monocol and then applied closures duality. Okay, so what kind of gadget are we getting? We're getting a radiated chain complex over this DGA Q D U is Q cute. Alright. Maybe the first thing to point out is that sort of this thing to point out is that sort of this this remembers the Vauquer invariant right so I guess I have this chain complex y so to my few metal I get this chain complex and sort of the rock and many factors through here so this this still sees a lot what I'm doing Alright, so what would you like to do now? Well, I just gave you this whole menu of like algebraic things you can do to chain complexes. So let's just look at the menu and think about which ones we want to apply to this. I'm a big fan of Oops Long, so let's look at Let's look at this ring. Right, so maybe the question now is what happens when we apply the above points? Okay, so you have this men. So, how do So, how do I picture that ring? Okay, so you still have this kind of picture. Now, there happens to be like a differential here, but like you still picture the thing on the plane. Okay. And so, well, okay, so if you want to do oopsilon, then I just want to say, like, okay, Then I just want to say, like, okay, well, let's like pick some slope here and then, like, you know, include the stuff here. So this would be like q inquiries. So let's define AS to be the sub-algebra of invert quote variant. And then um I guess you look at I guess you look at generated by u to the i, q to the j, where maybe i plus sj squared u equals 0. So that's sort of like the half plane to the right of here. Maybe I'm sweeping some details under the rug. Maybe you have to be careful about whether you include stuff on the line, like on the exactly on the slope. Maybe you include half of the elements and not the half. Not that we have. But sort of morally, okay, we just have the slope s, and we're looking at all of the sub-algebra generated by everything is half plane. So that's great. So this, so you should think of this as oopsilon-like. This isn't the harmony anymore. So I didn't say to have a room. Okay, so we've made our ring bigger. Now let's do local equivalence over this ring. So let's do local for once over IS. Great. Okay, and then if you do local equivalence over this win, you notice a couple of things. You notice that there is a unique non-trivial self-dual complex, let's call it T. If you're self-dual, then you're torsion, right? So if you're You're torsion, money, sort of if you're only inverse. Wait. Right, so when I say do local equivalence over RF, I mean we're looking at this, we're looking at sort of this value. Wait. Okay. And then this summer covers the rock living variant. So how does it do that? So you can look at sufficiently steep slopes. Sufficiently steep slopes, so ones that are like close to vertical. And sort of, that's where this required is the Machuin variant. Wait, so if Y had Machuin variant 1, then the point is at sufficiently steep slope, you're sent to this unique self-dual complex. And if your Vachlan and Very And if your vacuum invariant was zero, well, very close to vertical, you were sent to the trivial helmets. What else might you notice? It turns out that at sufficiently shallow slopes, something else happens. So for sufficiently shallow Chow. Everything falls apart. Everything becomes trivial. So sufficiently, y is always sent to the trivial complex. Trivial complex is just the grounding. The trivial complex is just the boundary. That's right. Bound. Yeah. Round element. It has a differential. Yeah. It's just a ground thing. It's the ground thing. And basically, it's basically because a sufficiently small slope, sort of like lots of stuff is a boundary. It's sort of like what happens at a low slope. Okay. So I said this thing was oopsilon-like. Oopsilon had this nice property that it was a piecewise linear function, but it only had finitely many discontinuities. So there was a lot of conc. So the point of... like a lot of control so that the point of the key point of matter is that for Upsilon, as you vary the slope, things can only change in a very controlled way. That's sort of like a key feature of Upsilon. And so maybe the question you want to ask is how does this thing change as we vary? As we vary S. And maybe like a key proposition is, okay, so I haven't said that much about like this local performance gadget. Okay, I've named sort of this unique self-dual fin. I've mentioned the trivial complex, which is just the round. The round differential algebra. Okay. But as we vary the slope, it turns out you can't jump directly from t to zero. So cannot jump directly from t to zero. Okay, so maybe you're like sitting in the audience and you're like, well, that sounds like some really And you're like, well, that sounds like some really technical thing. Like, why do we care about that? And then, so, one reason you might care is that the corollary of this is a view of marolasculus adults. So, the corollary is a view that there are no order two elements in the logical. And then logical doesn't work. We're off and write one. Wait, and so all of the ingredients to prove that are on the board. So sort of here, maybe I'll highlight one other, right? So there's a unique nontrivial self-dual complex. And so the point is that, right, anyway. Every other non-trivial element is not ordered. This is sort of like the key point to get over here. Okay, and so now you say, ah, right, okay. So if I had some homology spheres rockling variant on a sufficiently steep slope, it had to get sent to this. It has to get sent to this order, this self-dual thing. And now we vary the slope. Okay, if we vary from sufficiently sleep to sufficiently shallow, we have to get to the trivial complex. But you can't jump directly from here to here. So you had to, at some slope, hit some other element, and that one couldn't be ordered to. Wait, so I guess I've been chimed. So I'll stop there. Does that tell you that this you can't detect any two portions at all, but these things? Um with like depends on what you mean by like these techniques. So like in like in the I guess the yeah I think these oops salon invariants are not familiar. Yes. But like, you know, if you just look at like um Look at like um in two complexes so local equivalences, like one supplier distributed two, so like that isn't jinx, but sort of this scoops along anything. Right. Sounds good. Uh, maybe I'll just number two. It's actually defined over Is this did you write paper and this? No, it's like sitting in shambles. Like sitting in shambles and blockbox not having public consumption in its current state.
