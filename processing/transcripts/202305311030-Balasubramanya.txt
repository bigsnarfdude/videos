Thank you so much. And many thanks to the organizers for organizing this wonderful conference here. It's really a pleasure to be here. So most of the work that I'm going to talk about today is joined with Carolyn Abbott, Alex Rasmussen, and Sam Payne. And sort of the overarching And, sort of, the overarching focus of this talk is drawing inspiration from the following phenomenon: that in geometric group theory, what we're very often interested in doing is understanding a group, but we're interested in trying to understand a group from the perspective of its action on some metric space. So, we like to import the tools of geometry and topology somehow in order to be able to understand. Somehow, in order to be able to understand our group. And there's a canonical way to do this via group actions. And so that begs the question: given a group G, can we describe all isometric actions of G on some hyperbolic space. So, hyperbolic spaces have this characteristic negative curvature associated to them. And studying group actions on hyperbolic spaces has proven to be extremely powerful in the past in terms of understanding the structure and the geometry of your group G. So, I'm asking: instead of studying one particular action of your group, can we get a Action of your group, can we get a comprehensive list of all the ways in which a group could possibly act on some hyperbolic space? And what I'm hoping to achieve by looking at this complete set of actions is that possibly different actions tell me very different things about my group. So instead of focusing on one action, if I can understand the entire set of actions, then potentially there is a much larger source of information from which I can extract things about my group. Extract things about my group. But there are some immediate pathological problems with this question. And sort of the very first problem is that of trivial actions. You can define a trivial action for any group on any metric space, and it would be an isometric action if you define it on any hyperbolic space. Unfortunately, this trivial action. Unfortunately, this trivial action doesn't tell you anything about the geometry of your group. You don't need to know anything special about your group in order to define a trivial action. So it's completely pointless from the perspective of understanding your group. And the other source of problems here are what we call parabolic actions. And for any countable group G, you can always construct a combinatorial horrible on your group. Horabol on your group. This is a construction due to Groves and Manning, which will produce a parabolic action on a hyperbolic space. Unfortunately, this action is such that it completely distorts the geometry of your group G. So again, it's not very useful from the perspective of understanding our group. So what do we do? Well, ideally, we'd like to modify our question in a way that we're forced not to think about these pathological examples. Yeah. Psychological examples. Yeah. So, in your question, the hyperbole space is fixed or does it vary? It can vary. It can vary. Yes, yes. Okay. And I'll show you that this is doable in many examples. So. So, how do we deal with these pathologies, right? We would ideally like to be in a situation where we're not thinking about them. Well, it turns out that all we need to do is add the word co-bounded to our question. So what's a co-bounded action? Well, morally speaking, it's an action where you can locally witness the dynamics of your group action. So there's a ball of finite radius so that when you translate it around. So, that when you translate it around by elements of your group, it covers the entire space on which your group is acting. So, you have local control, which sort of expands to global control on the action in this situation. And the minute you request that the action is co-bounded, it completely rules out parabolic actions. These can never be co-bounded. We can't rule out all the trivial actions, but the only ones we're allowed to have are now either the actions on a Are now either the actions on a point or the actions on some bounded space. And for geometric group theorists like me, morally, the point and the bounded space are indistinguishable because they have the same coarse geometry. The other really nice thing about introducing the term co-bounded is that it sort of allows us to completely translate this problem into the land of Cayley graphs. So if you start with a group G, So, if you start with a group G, which admits a co-bounded action on a metric space X, and I'll assume that X is hyperbolic because that's the setup I'm interested in. You can run an argument that's very similar to the Milner-Schwartz lemma. And what you get out of that proof is that there exists a subset Y of G, which acts as a generating set. Which acts as a generating set for your group. And if you consider the associated Cayley graph of your group, this is g-equivariantly quasi-isometric to the space X that you start with. The only way this proof differs from the actual Milner-Schwartz lemma is that this lemma requests that the action is also proper. And what properness buys you in this proof is that it guarantees that this generation It guarantees that this generating set is going to be finite. So if you drop the properness condition, then this generating set y is not necessarily finite. So I could be dealing with an infinite generating set. Nonetheless, you can define the Cayley graph in this situation as well. And it is still quasi-isometric to the space X in which you started. So in particular, this Cayley graph is also a hyperbolic metric space. Since hyperbolicity is a QI invariant. And so, what I can do is that instead of thinking about co-bounded actions on some generic hyperbolic space, I can think about classifying all the different generating sets of my group with respect to which I get a hyperbolic Cayley graph. And the other nice thing about working with Cayley graphs is that it sort of allows me to push forward this idea of core. To push forward this idea of coarse geometry, I don't really want to distinguish between a point and a bounded space, but more generally, if two spaces are quasi-isometric and the group has G-equivariant actions on both those spaces, I want those two effectively be the same action rather than having to think about them as being separate actions. And once we're in the land of Cayley graphs, we can do this because we have a very nice partial order on the set of generating sets. Order on the set of generating sets. So what is this partial order? So given X and Y, which are generating sets of G, I'm going to say that X is dominated by Y if the following condition is true. So I want to take the supremum over the elements of Y and write Elements of y and write them in the word length with respect to x. And I request that this is finite. And notice that this partial order is inclusion reversing. So morally, what I'm thinking here is that x is smaller in the order if, as sets, y is a subset of x. So x is the larger generating set. What that means also is that if I construct the Also, is that if I construct the Cayley graph of G with respect to X and the Cayley graph of G with respect to Y, then I basically could have done this by constructing this Cayley graph and then adding more edges to this Cayley graph to get the one with respect to X. So this has been formed by sort of collapsing equivariant subspaces in this Cayley graph. So the distance is shrinking in this Cayley graph, which is why it's the smaller in my order. In my order. And once you have a pre-order, you can define an equivalence relation in the natural way. So x is going to be equivalent to y if they each dominate one another. And this is equivalent to requesting that the identity map on the Cayley graph between these two generating sets is a quasi-isometry. A quasi-isometry. So I can now think about equivalence classes of a generating set X and just ask, given your favorite group G, what is the list of equivalence classes of generating sets such that the associated Cayley graph is hyperbolic? And this is a set that we call H. Called H of G. So this is the collection of equivalence classes so that my Cayley graph is hyperbolic. And this is not just a set, it's actually a partially ordered set as well, because it inherits the partial order from the one defined here. So, sort of, my refined question is: given a group G, describe this post- Describe this post-set completely. So now I'm not just requesting a complete list of actions considered up to course geometry. I'm also interested in the relations between those actions. When can you construct one action from another? When are they incomparable so that you can never construct one from another? And this question, although it's still very, it's very nice to state, can sometimes be. Estate can sometimes be just intractable due to reasons of sheer cardinality. There's a lot we can say about this poset in a lot of situations, but it just might be a very hard problem to answer because of sheer cardinality reasons. And to substantiate that, I'm going to state this theorem, which is due to me, Carolyn Abbott, and Dennis Oson, which states that let G be an acylindrically hyperbolic group. A cylindrically hyperbolic group. And if you know what an asylndrically hyperbolic group is, fantastic. If you don't, I'm not going to define it because I don't really need it for the purpose of this talk, but it is a very large class of groups that contains lots of interesting examples in geometric group theory. So your mapping class. Group theory. So you're mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups out of Fn, those are all examples of asylumrically hyperbolic groups. And sort of this provides an umbrella to simultaneously study all these interesting examples. And if G happens to be such a group, then the cardinality of this postet is continuum, and further, it contains Chains and anti-chains of the same cardinality Yes, continuum. Sorry, what did I say? Yes, continuum. So this postat is huge for even very well understood groups. And the source of the issue here. The source of the issue here is the fact that if G is acylindrically hyperbolic, then it always contains a subgroup of the form F2 cross K, where K is finite. And this isn't just some subgroup of your acylindrically hyperbolic group. It's a very special subgroup which is called hyperbolically embedded. Now, what it means to be hyperbolically embedded is again a sort of technical condition that I Of technical condition that I don't want to formally define. But if you understand the peripheral subgroups of a relatively hyperbolic group, you can think about that situation because to be hyperbolically embedded is a true generalization of what it means to be a peripheral subgroup in a relatively hyperbolic group. And in this scenario, when you have a hyperbolically embedded subgroup, what you can do is that you can take the post-set of actions of your hyperbolically embedded subgroup and you can. Embedded subgroup, and you can embed it into the post-set of actions of your larger group. And I would like to mention that this is highly non-trivial. This extension problem can, in general, be unsolvable. So the extension problem is, suppose H is a subgroup of G and you have H acting on some space S, the extension problem asks: does there exist an action of G on some space R? Of G on some space R, so that if you restrict this action to the subgroup H, then you witness the original action that you start with. And this is in general unsolvable. And here's an example. You can take your favorite countable group H and embed it as a subgroup of the symmetric group of the naturals. And no matter which action you consider of your subgroup H, the fact is that this group only acts elliptically. Only acts elliptically. So this is a group that can never have an unbounded action on any metric space. So if you, in particular, start with an action, say with the loxodromic element here, which is an infinite element, which is QI embedded by your action, it can never extend to an action of the symmetric group so that you can witness the original action here. So this extension problem is. So, this extension problem is sort of highly non-trivial, and doing this combines the work of Carolyn Abbott, David Hume, Dennis Oson, and then there was some work that I did with Carolyn and Dennis that goes to show you can actually extend this postet in a very meaningful way. Because what this means is that if you start with an action of this group on a hyperbolic space S, you can extend it to an action which is also on a hyperbolic space. Is also in a hyperbolic space. If you start with a co-bounded action here, you can extend it to a co-bounded action. And something that I haven't written here, but is true, is that if you start with an acylindrical action here, you can extend it to an asylumrical action of your parent group as well. So this is a powerful construction that allows you to do this. And this boils down the problem to studying this partially ordered set. And you can use small cancellation techniques to build a continuum many number of. A continuum of many number of different actions for the free group. So, this is suggesting that if we want to somehow get a handle on an answer to our question, then maybe it's best to avoid free subgroups. And that naturally leads us into the class of solvable groups. So, the question that has become a focus of part of my research Is to focus on solvable groups. So, given a solvable group G, describe the partially ordered set H of G. And here, there's been much progress that's been made in the past couple of years. In particular, we have a complete description. We have a complete description in the case of lamplighter groups. This was something that I showed. And then Carolyn and Alex considered the case of the solvable bombstock solitar groups. And they also considered the case of the Anosov mapping torus, which is Z squared semi-direct product with Z, where With Z, where the generator here is a matrix from SL2Z. And more recently, there's work of me, Francesca Fourier, and Anthony Geneva, where we can do the case of all nilpotent groups as well. And for these first three cases, which were sort of the first ones to completely ones to completely describe this partially ordered set H of G, the machinery that was used in all these situations was exactly the same. And that machinery is work of Cornelier, Capras, Mano, and Tesera, which is known as the theory of confining subsets. So let me tell you what that is. So I'll just abbreviate the authors to CCMT. Okay, and I will note that what I'm about to say is a slightly more specific situation than the one considered in their paper, but it is the one that's most relevant to this talk. So I'm going to state their work in the situation. To state their work in the situation that it's most helpful to us. So, what does their work say? It says: suppose you have a group G, which is of the form H semi-direct product with Z, where alpha, of course, is an automorphism of your base group, which is the generator of your infinite cyclic group. And we consider subsets Q of H, which are called confining. If the following three conditions are satisfied, so the very first property is the one that earns Q its name of being confining, we want alpha of Q to be strictly contained within Q. And the second condition is what will allow us to extract a generating set for our group. It states that for every element of your base group, Of your base group, there's some high enough power so that if you apply your automorphism repeatedly to H, you eventually can push it into Q. So somehow all the high powers of alpha are shoving the rest of your base group inside your chosen subset Q. And the third condition is telling us something about the structure of Q, right? Q is just Of q, right? q is just a subset, it doesn't have to be a subgroup. But what the third condition tells us is that it can't be too far from being a subgroup. So, this tells you that there exists some uniform power n0. So that if you combine q with elements from q, well, it's not a subgroup, so you may not be in q immediately, but up to applying this finite power, you are back inside q. Are back inside Q. And then what you can do is that you can consider the Cayley graph of your group G with respect to the generating set, which is Q union alpha plus minus one. Because the second condition tells you that Q along with all the powers of alpha does generate your base group. And of course, powers of alpha will generate Z. So this does give you a genuine generating set for your group. In generating set for your group, and the theorem tells us that this is a hyperbolic space, and the action of your group on this Cayley graph is what we call, or rather what Gurmov called, quasi-parabolic. So, why is this machinery so helpful to us? Well, remember. Helpful to us? Well, remember, we're in the case of solvable groups. These groups cannot admit general type actions because they don't have free subgroups. What that means is that the only kinds of non-elementary actions that such a group can have are exactly the quasi-parabolic ones. So this setup is allowing us to build quasi-parabolic actions of certain solvable groups, and something that's not contained in the CCMT paper, but is not. Paper, but is not so hard to show is that these confining subsets under certain conditions will completely classify these quasi-parabolic actions. So in the case that H is amenable, what you can show is that every quasi-parabolic action of G has an associated confining subset. has an associated confining subset. Which means that if I start with some quasi-parabolic action of G co-bounded on some hyperbolic space, I can extract from that information a confining subset so that when I construct this Cayley graph, it's quasi-asymmetric to the space that you started on. So confining subsets of the construction. Started on. So, confining subsets are classifying the quasi-parabolic actions in this setup. And this is effectively what we all used in these three situations to completely classify the actions over here. And what we realized in the aftermath of that is that there's actually a much larger framework into which these groups fit, and there are more groups that fit that framework. So, we decided to study that common framework. To study that common framework. So, what is this common framework that we ended up considering that works for lots and lots of metabelian groups? That's the following. So, in that case of the seminar, did you study all of the elements? So, like the four different types of elements, like alcoholic and the inaccessible cells? So, if this right, so I've written the group this way, but this is actually the fundamental group of an OSA mapping torus. So, phi is an element of SL2Z whose Jordan normal form is actually going to be of this form. Yeah, so it is an Anosov element from SL2Z. Yeah. Okay, so what's the common framework that we ended up? Common framework that we ended up studying in our most recent work? Well, the framework, and interestingly, the answer comes from commutative algebra. So, the framework is, suppose you have a ring R and there's an element gamma in R, which is not a unit or a zero divisor. And moreover, we want our ring R to be generated by gamma as a Z algebra. So R should be isomorphic to Z adjoin gamma. So suppose you're in this setup. What you can do is construct the group G in this situation. The group G in this situation, which is the ascending H and N extension of R, where your stable letter basically acts by multiplication by gamma. And this group, it turns out, is isomorphic to the localization of your ring R by gamma. So this is the ring where you consider, where you allow division by gamma as well. And this splits as a semi-direct cross. And this splits as a semi-direct product with C. And in order to make sure that our machinery of confining subsets works exactly the way we want, we need some technical axioms. So what do we need? Well, the first thing we need is that if you consider the ideal generated by gamma, so this is the ideal in R, this has finite index in our ring. We request that if you intersect ideals generated by powers of gamma, then this intersection is trivial. And then the last technical axiom we need has to do with the fact that R is generated by gamma as a Z algebra. What we want is that those gamma addict expansions Of elements of R are well-behaved, and for us, well-behaved means that these are eventually periodic. So these gamma-adic expansions may not be finite, they might be infinite, but in the case that they're infinite, they have a tail which repeats itself. So they're sort of Which repeats itself. So they're sort of like the rationals and the reals, which have either a terminating decimal place or they're non-terminating, repeating. No, not the polynomial, not necessarily. Oh, that's yeah. So elements here have a base gamma expansion. So coefficients are from Z and then you're allowed powers of gamma. But gamma needs to be. But gamma, but but gamma need not be of it's not of necessarily a variable, yeah. So, gamma can have storage, right? So, it's not like a filterable, like in the case of the polymer. Typically, it's not going to gamma is not going to be a torsion element because, in order for that semi-direct extension to be a semi-direct extension with Z, you don't want gamma to be a torsion element. Element it's not a unit typical of finite rank having indicated is it finite rank we have been involved in legal rank? I'm not sure I'm not sure if I'm not I'm not sure if if that implies finite rank. I mean Finite rank. I mean, okay, but I can tell you exactly what these are in the case of the lamp lighter groups and the bomb stock solitar groups. Maybe that will help. So. Okay, bomb light and examine would be the example tends to be. Yeah, yeah. That's why I said I don't think it. I believe it's finite rank. Yeah. So what is the setup in the case of the lamplighter groups, right? How does the lamplighter group fit this setup? Well, the Setup? Well, the ring R that you want to consider is so let's assume I'm considering lamplighter groups where you can have coefficients from Z mod NZ. So then the ring is Z mod NZ adjoint X. So these are polynomials with coefficients from Z mod NZ and the variable X. And gamma is just going to be X in this case. And then the localization. And then the localization, which forms the base of that semi-direct extension, these are polynomials in x and x inverse. And then g just becomes z mod n z reads z, which is exactly the lamplighter group. And what is this setup in the case of the bombstock solitar groups? Bomstock solitar groups. Well, the ring R is just going to be Z. The element gamma is just going to be the element N. Okay. So what is the mean of gamma inverse times R? So that's the localization of your ring where you allow division by R. Well, division by gamma. So in this ring, gamma is, x is not invertible, but here X is not invertible, but here you allow X to be invertible, which is why you get polynomials with the same coefficients, but you can have powers of X inverse as well. Okay. Okay, so gamma is going to be our element N. The localization of our ring is going to be Z adjoin one over N. G, of course, then becomes the semi-direct product of The semi-direct product of z adjoin one over n with t, where t represents multiplication by n. And this is, of course, exactly the Bomstock solitar group, BS1N. So in this setup, once we have all this machinery, what we also want to do is consider our hat, which is the gamma addict completion of our ring. Completion of our ring. So, what are the gamma addict completions of our rings in these examples? Well, over here, our hat is going to turn into the power series ring with coefficients from Z mod N Z. And over here, the gamma addict completion of Z with respect to N is just the N. n is just the n addict integers. So in this setup, there's a disease squared setup for this purpose. It does it does if you're well, not quite, and I was going to get to that in a minute. It almost does. It almost does, but not quite. But we have new work which will make it part of this framework. So, in this situation, there's a lot that we can say about our postset H of G. So, the smallest element in this postet is going to be And this postet is going to be the action on a point, which I'll denote in this way. There's only one linear action, which I'll denote by that notation. And where does that action come from? It comes from quotienting the group down to its abelianization, which is exactly a rank one pre-abelian group, which then acts on a line. And then sitting above this line. Above this lineal action, there are two large posets to consider. One which we call P plus of G and another which we call P minus of G. And what's the difference? Well, P plus of G, these are characterized. These are characterized by confining subsets that are confining under gamma, and these are confining under the inverse. And there's a lot that we can say. First of all, we know that P plus and P minus are both lattices. So they're not just partially ordered sets, they are lattices. And without assuming And without assuming any extra conditions in this setup, P is always the poset of ideals of our completion ring. And we have to slightly modify this postet in order to take care of the fact that our partially ordered set here deals with equivalence classes of generating sets. And the way you do that is that you consider these ideas. That you consider these ideals up to multiplication by gamma. So, provided you can use a finite power of gamma to push one ideal into the other and vice versa, those two ideals are the same for us. And up to that equivalence, the partially ordered set of these ideals are exactly in one-to-one correspondence with confining subsets under gamma. And those characterize all of the actions here. And moreover, Here. And moreover, you can put these ideals in one-to-one correspondence with certain kinds of maps, which are called valuations. And these are valuations on your localization. And once you can characterize your ideals in terms of valuations, you can actually get very nice representatives for these hyperbolic actions. These are represented by actions on trees, which you On trees, which you can construct using a construction by Brown. Now, P-, unfortunately, is a bit more mysterious and not always quite easy to get your hand on, which is where we need to introduce some slightly additional framework, which is the setting of torsion-free abelian bicyclic groups. So if you have a torsion-free Tree abelian bicyclic group, then our group actually has some additional structure that we can tap into. In this case, your group G can be written as Z to the N and an extension by T where T acts by multiplication by gamma, where gamma is now represented by Gamma is now represented by a matrix of size n by n. And we again need some technical conditions on gamma to make sure everything works the way it does, which is where Bena's question comes in. The first thing that we need is that gamma is expanding, which means we want all of its eigenvalues to have absolute value greater than one. So the Anosa mapping torus currently doesn't fit into this, but we have recent work where we can get rid of this expansion and consider maybe. Get rid of this expansion and consider matrices from SLNZ with the same conclusion. So it doesn't fit into the work that I'm talking about today, but it does fit into the extension of that work. And then the second condition we need is that if you consider the characteristic polynomial of gamma, we want this to be equal to the minimum polynomial of gamma as well. And then the last condition, which is always true up to finite index, but we just assume it here, is that Here is that Z to the N is a cyclic Z adjoint X module. And this is a fancy way of saying that I have a vector in Z to the N, so that if I apply powers of gamma to that vector, they generate a basis for this free abelian group. Now, under these conditions, P minus acquires a very nice description of, well, this is Description of will. This is the partially ordered set of invariant subspaces of gamma in R to the n. And moreover, these invariant subspaces, what are they represented by as actions? Well, you can construct actions on Heinzler groups here. Actions on Heinzler groups here, which are negatively curved Lie groups of the form R to the K semi-direct product with R. And if you assume that your group is torsion-free, abelian, bicyclic, then P plus acquires one new description as well. So in this situation, P plus also acquires the description of being the posad of divisors of the characteristic. Of the characteristic polynomial in the power series ring. So somehow the question about classifying hyperbolic actions has a framework in commutative algebra. And for many torsion-free abelian bicyclic groups, the answer is provided by techniques of commutative algebra as well. Because calculating the invariant subspaces of gamma of a matrix, that's a linear algebra problem. And there are lots of algorithms in the literature that will tell you how to factor polynomials in a power series ring. So these are well-understood problems with concrete answers that allow us to classify all the hyperbolic actions of such a group. Now, there are lots of open questions that still exist within this framework. Exist within this framework. And I will say that this was a bit surprising to us: the deep connection between hyperbolic actions and commutative geometry here. We didn't quite, I think, expect it to work out this well when we started. And we were very, very pleasantly surprised that it did. So there's still a lot of open questions in this general area. And the first question, which is what Bena was asking, is, you know, what happens if your matrix is not expanding? Like, what if gamma was a matrix in SLNZ? Matrix in SLNZ. Can we still get a classification in terms of the invariant subspaces? And the answer is yes. This is work that we're currently trying to write up. But it is true that if you drop the condition that gamma needs to be expanding, then you can still get a correspondence to the invariant subspaces. And we believe it is still possible to represent them by actions on Heinze groups. And as I said, this last condition, this is always. Condition, this is always satisfied up to finite index. And sort of one of our goals moving forward is to try and understand that if this is true even up to finite index, does the same conclusion still hold? We're not quite sure what to do with this condition. This is sort of a technical thing that Sam Payne said we should have, and we're not sure what to do with it quite yet. But in general, outside of this framework, there are still other openings. Work, there are still other open questions, right? All of the groups that I've sort of considered so far have rank one abelianization, but in the world of solvable groups, there are lots of more groups which don't necessarily have rank one abelianization. So we can ask the question: you know, what about groups that have a higher rank abelianization? Right. So if you were to take companion matrices, they will satisfy that condition. Companion matrices, yeah. So if you have a polynomic polynomial, which is irreducible, you can construct the companion matrix to that polynomial, and then that matrix will satisfy exactly that condition that its characteristic and minimal polynomial is the same. And the polynomial. Polynomial is the same, and the polynomial you start with is that polynomial. So it is, it's restrictive, but it's not as restrictive as one might think. Okay, so what about groups that have higher rank abelianizations? Well, here we can say something definite because there's other work that was done by me, Carolyn, and Alex, where we consider groups of this form. So we consider semi-direct products. So, we consider semi-direct products with z to the n, where n is at least 2. And what we do is that we develop a machinery which we call the higher rank confining subsets. So, we developed the analog of the machinery from the CCMT paper, which allows us to define confined. us to define confining subsets of our base group here as well. And what we can show is that the quasi-parabolic actions of such a group are characterized by those higher rank confining subsets. And moreover, if the base group is amenable, then every quasi-parabolic action of such a group comes from an associated higher rank confining subset. So we can really push that confining subset machinery to higher abelianizations as well. Organizations as well. And in particular, this allowed us almost immediately to be able to classify the post-set for new types of groups. So we considered generalized Bomsog solitar groups, and we could completely classify their H of G partially ordered set as well. But everything that we've done so far sort of relies on the fact very heavily that these are semi-direct product extensions. Direct product extensions. So, what can you do if G is not a semi-direct product? In this situation, so in this situation, we don't quite have this setup at all. Because, first of all, what changes is that the minute you have a semi-director? That the minute you have a semi-direct product with z to the n, you don't just get one lineal action, you will have a continuum many, because you can get z to the n to act on a line in infinitely many different ways. And so then just by quotienting this group, you can have lots and lots of actions on z to the n. The hard question there is which ones are associated to quasi-parabolic structures? So, for instance, what happens for the generalized bombstock solitar groups? Solitar groups. So, what is a generalized bumpstock solitar group? Well, it's a z adjoined one over n, semi-direct product with z to the k, where what's the relationship between k and n? Well, n manifests itself as a product of k distinct primes, as the product of powers of k distinct primes. And each generator here acts by multiplying. generator here acts by multiplication by Pi to the alpha i. So this is a generalized Bomstock solitaire group. And what does the partially ordered set look like in this case? You have an action on a point which is always the smallest. And then you have far too many actions on lines. There's in fact a continuum many over here. But only finite But only finitely many of these have quasi-parabolic actions sitting above them. And the ones that do are exactly the homomorphisms that project to your choice of primes. So the homomorphisms that pick out what is, you know, the power of pi to the alpha i, those are exactly the ones that have actions sitting above them. And this gives you only k-many actions on trees. K-many actions on trees, and those are the ones that are confining under the positive powers. And there's one additional one that comes from being confining under the inverse power, and that is an action on a hyperbolic plane. So you have lots and lots of linear actions, but not all of them have this quasi-parabolic action sitting above them. There's only k plus one many of them. Yeah, so the structure is. Yeah, so the structure is completely different. And in fact, one of the questions we would like to understand is: is there any part of this machinery that can be pushed into this more general scenario? And the answer is partially yes, because what we can show is that in this scenario, if you have a confining subset Q, then you can actually put these in one-to-one correspondence with something known as pseudo-valuations on the base group page. So, at least as far as this part of the machinery goes, there is an association to pseudo-valuations, which should also allow you to construct actions on quasi-trees. What's not clear is what is this associated ring that you can define that fits this structure and whether its ideals can be used to classify confining subsets here. We're not quite sure of that. Right. But, you know, all of the work that we've done, it kind of heavily relies. We've done, it kind of heavily relies on the fact that our groups have the semi-direct product extension. So we can ask the question: okay, what if G is not a semi-direct product? What if it's some general solvable group? And one thing we think which will be super helpful here is to study something known as the BNS invariants. So these were invariants defined by Berry Neumann and Strabel, and they're well defined for solvable groups. And in general, And in general, the question that we classify our posts at H of G is stronger than asking us to compute what the BNS invariant is. Because what happens for a solvable group is that the BNS invariant is the complement of the homomorphisms that can be associated to the quasi-parabolic actions. So for every quasi-parabolic action that you have, there's an associated homomorphism, which is called the Busiman homomorphism. Which is called the Bosim-Anhomomorphism, the complement of those for a solvable group is what characterizes the BNS invariant. So if you can classify this postset, this will immediately tell you what the BNS invariant is. But if you don't know what the post-set is, but you do know what the BNS invariant is, can you somehow then reverse engineer information about your post-set from there? That's something that we would definitely like to understand moving forward. And as your question was, we'd like to. And as your question was, we'd like to understand how much of the machinery that we already have here can be sort of developed to fit this more general framework. I'll stop here. Thank you. Any questions? So my question would be the obvious. So you give the input from PSPS in the. Input from BNS invites that help you to do this classification? Yeah, so I think the first thing that might be true is that, you know, certainly if you know the BNS invariants, then you would know which homomorphisms can be associated to quasi-parabolic actions. And then the question would be, just starting from the homomorphism, can you somehow use the structure of the group as well to find out which quasi-parabolic actions can sit above that homomorphism? So, yeah, it's a question. It's a question that we would certainly like to try and understand. First of all, is there any issue of which you now, because of this classification, know the PNS invariant where it wasn't known before? Not at present. Not at present. Like once, we didn't even know actually that for these groups, the generalized bumpsock solitari groups, that the BNS invariant had already been computed. Had already been computed. And, you know, when the paper came back from a referee process, they said, by the way, you can reconstruct the BNS invariant from what you've done, which was already known. And that's when we realized that there is even a connection to this phenomenon. So not at present, but that is part of the hope for the future. Second. So my PhD advice and you told me that you had a hard time selling stuff already. Selling stuff about medimed groups and sort of groups to the audience because the general conception is: well, sort of removes are easy and you just compute them. You just improve everything by, well, you induct on the debt. So given that said, and there is a rationale behind it, because formal groups can be composed with many ways, and there are lots of techniques available. Techniques available. Early in the talk, you advertised understanding the totality of group actions as a potentially very large pool of information that now you can tap into. So have you, again, for the solvable groups where you can do these classifications, have you proved any application, like any theorems about solvable groups that haven't been known before? That haven't been known before, like particular solar groups? Off the top of my head, do we know that off the top of my head? I don't know that off the top of my head, but in gen, but in general, it has but in general, it has proven to be very useful. I mean, my co-author is right here, so I might as well ask her, like, can I double check? Like, yeah. Right. Right. I don't know this at the top of my head, but in general, you know, this. But in general, this process of studying all the hyperbolic actions has proven useful in general. So, for many cylindrically hyperbolic groups, for example, the post-set totally understandable. The point is you focus at some point on the solvable part. Yes. And solvable proof, there is a ton of methods. So it's really hard to prove something new. Absolutely. But I think, you know, I like to think of, at least I like to think of this work as so. At least I like to think of this work as sort of like a bridge between commutative algebra and hyperbolicity. You know, and we don't often think of these two phenomenons on the same side of the spectrum, right? We tend to think of them as sort of at opposite ends of the world. And I think the interesting part of the work is that there is like this deep connection there, which could be useful in the future. So you're doing this page of the settings. But sometimes there is more circular, like people see a thing on the line, that that's really something that's not coming to set it circle. So I'm just wondering if there is any sort of research with apologies that could have done that. That is something I think we've talked about in the past. And I think the issue is that, you know, sort of this in the post-set, because everything is, you know, directly. Because everything is, you know, directly sitting above the trivial element. If you start drawing all the connections, like the distance in this partially ordered set is like two between everything. So I don't know. I think if you want to introduce some interesting topology, I think the first thing might be that maybe you delete the trivial structure from this partially ordered set, but then it could turn into something that's like completely disconnected. So I'm really not sure. Yeah, I mean, it's fine. And also, something that's known is that. Something that's known is that, in general, if you have H of G and you consider the outer automorphism group of G, this will admit an action on this partially ordered set by permuting generating sets around. But I'm not, yeah, I don't know if there is an interesting topological phenomenon then there that can be studied. But that is something we've sort of, you know, from afar, like tried to think about in the past. And the other thing is the And the other thing is the the partial order. I would be tempted to think that this, you know, saying x is related to y, not not only when there is a sort of literature map from y to x, but I want this map to be aligned with zero. I want geodesics to go quite because it's not different. Oh, I see. So I think we can get into my workshop. And the kind of outcome of that that we work at is just incredibly hard to throw this stuff under because could we can do it when we need to fairly quickly um and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of value that we could get when we get a copy it seems like a natural thing to do and we couldn't find any good application on it and the specific of just those instruments and the actions and have people satisfied with uh complicated frameworks. Yeah, I think it's a natural thing to Yeah, I I think it's a natural thing but I think like maybe our consensus was if you didn't have a good application for things to go into college. Yeah, I haven't personally thought about that, but I'm glad you have. Yeah. I have a question. Yeah. So for instance, if I take like those type of postets, like a three-order postet, that's like and I find a group that relies this post. Can you find a group that necessarily admits that postet structure? Oh that its HFG postad is isomorphic to like the post-set that you start with. I don't know the answer to that. Probably no. I want to say probably no too. Too, yeah, yeah, because I think in those cases, you always need like an auditory postet, yeah, yeah. Off the top of my head, I'm tempted to say that that's probably not doable in all situations. I think you would need like very specific postets that would be able to fit that framework. Yeah, but there's no characterization of which post-sets can be relying on. No, I don't believe we've looked into like which specifically that question, like which post-ets can actually manifest them and which ones can't. Post-its can actually manifest them and which ones can't. But I wouldn't be surprised if the answer is that not all partially ordered sets can appear this way. Yeah. One more. So far, I only have seen actions. Oh no. So actions on the hyperbolic plane, actions on R to the M plus R. Yes. Yeah. These are of the forms. Yeah. So. So what about higher rank hyperbolic spaces? I think they can appear. I think maybe we just haven't maybe touched upon examples that manifest that. But I definitely think they can appear. Do we have no more questions? I'll stop. Yes, I can.
