Frances, parameters. This transformation of the two significant. One can construct the packets. The constitution is extremely fascinating. So, in four circles, that are two. So, that is going to be two. That is not a configuration. It is not a configuration, tomorrow, but two. And repeat, and my packet, together. We are cuatro, that is also two, three. There are two circles that are and this roco, this roco is because other, this exterior. This exterior, I will do this. And I applied to this configuration and applied one, and other veterans. And they are a packet of police. It is because they are very interested by many applications and proprietors here that are some applications biological, physical applications, to understand a little bit of the function. How the mind and model is typical of things, and applications in mathematics, in the chemistry, in the parabolic chemometry, fractal, etc. Here, I think, two different applications, one is theory of numerous. We will see how things can be here, and I think. A little bit, it is a scientific approach in our application, how the nudes, how the world can endorse, part of our visitors. That is not what I say the curvature of circulation of their radio. Because they have the exterior of the circle, they can talk about the exterior. For example, we have a natural series that can package integral in whereas are integral. But if someone can infinite and I continue to serve. The infinite continuum succession will clear. That is a question very natural, is that integral is the response to exist. And the demonstration of many circulos takes two, and we are descartes. Descartes demonstrated if the case I have this idea here. 2 paradoxes, the sum of the summary. In a caden demonstración, propiamente description, but if a relationship with this princess. Princess yellow is a different cartoon, if you have this tomorrow, there is the demos. Yes, si, si, si. Curious, but if you listen, that can demonstrate that if existence in pageos Apollonius integral, however, that if I have Because if you have the screen here, go live or have this, and we are and cuadradas, they are entering. So, this toddler packet will be que yago da repetition entero yenter. And discuss muy bien. Well, general eso for dimensions more than the four percent have more dimensions. We have simple sixteen. We have a volume, that is a simple question that can relation between corporate relations, the soul that relations can be a species of general, but exists. No details, but exist but we can decide. It is a complicated because I can see a package, corbators, and initials in pages, that all the numerous primes are identified. When I have my session, I will contradict all the first. That's it. If the question is. If the question is to contradict all the natural sabbatics, I know that if they are concluded, it will be good, but interestingly, we can decide for it. For example, we have. Benablars inversion of a point that respects a circle. The inversion with respect to a circle is not because our transformation transforms. They are a circle of plants. The definition is staying, but the facility is the circle, and circulates here. And I want to construct the point inverse that it. The point that the rojo here verifies that the product of this evaluation. I result that we are going to tell circulation, I do other circles, and that is what this inverse and things that are remarkable. Second circular pass for inversion is a linear inverse that passes for the intersection. That passed over the intersection. If not, when they have the rigid, well, it is another circular queen passing intersection. If the circulo is in the exterior of the negro, you have circulos in the interior of the negro. Professor are concentric circles, in the inverse. If you see concentric, I will have concentric. And this is the. This is the last thing, it is very important for us that I have a circle where the intersect of perpendicular forms when the inversion is the same. It is invariant. But this is the role of the past day. This is important for us. So, here we have this notion of inversion, notion applies to my Possibly applied to my pancreas, tomorrow separateness, for example. Tomo circulated, for example, that assulator that the tomb very because of the center in which this circle passes and perpendicular, so if I apply a memory with On the inverse of verse, with respect to that circle, these are invariants, if we are perpendicular, and the dental, but the past. When do you agree with the inversion and going to the interior? Important. And what is 30%? Because it is very circulated, the circular grandeur is two circles, mean version that this is passed, and preserving the presentation in the book, simple view of inversions. And that I can also initialize, and that is important. The principle of Poland is only for four. Cuato, two doses, and cualcera. De calcera, for example, tome in this pueden is a little skeleton of the tape. And good inversions, and if you are circle, otherwise, we are circles perpendicular to this, there is this invariant, and everything that is taking senses. So, I can see the same, I think. The first thing with air, here we are with us, and here the interesting thing. And what interests here can verify the negroes and blanks, but the blanks are not the luminosity, they are the negroes that are the perspective, and the negroes are infinite, but many veces and the body of the negroes bid the blankets. Sympathy, ah, you know, what? We just want us to. If we can pause with these inversions, interest in numerous countries in the corporate country, I have a question. What I can generalize in dimension, is that the type of generalization of the scale. Essentially, we are. Essentially, we are breaking. To do, I am a pocket, but not very utilizing what we are doing the Lorentz space. Spatio-Lorenzian is simple a vectorial space of two. So, in its internal product, this aquí, it is productual, is the codonada. Except the cordonada is here negative. And this has to be with the physics where studying the physics per volume is negative. So it is a stamp. They are pointing in the space where its product internally is. And that essentially is localized. One of the things interesting: these vectors that are space like in this space, that when I apply the product with the same positive, that is very interesting. You are the two. The result exists a biection between the vectors space like the space of a The space of one packet of volumes in dimensions of what we have a little bit because of pervolved when you see a species of projection, I will have a space per bolt here, and that will form here formaries of bodies, but. Formaris space of volas, but I seven tools, I would say, measure with corresponding vectors. And that is what important correspondence. Or if I have the vectors here, because they are products internal products, so that's part of algebra and geometric information. So, here we are, so two volumes of uniform. Bolas in the uniform associated two vectors of Lorentz vectors and their product Lorentz depending on the signal here, I can say intersecting us in the others, so I can decide and say this for the case. So, my product internal. Yor por esta parte negative aque. Yes, what you're going to integrate. But the final tulip is more, and that's the two. That is the voyage tomorrow, the vector, we are the vector in the vector, and we are two gregas because of information. Well, to the first one of the people, if we can formulate them, but that is political, it is exterior. Exterior points of points, also the cascade convex, the cascade convex, they are a political and I don't know what are political that are exterior, that I can bujar in the spheroidary in medium, and all the vertices that. And all the vertices that are because I am here to see many figuritas to not urge. Clara doesn't seven yet, in some several severe. But the result that I have here in this world and here, no si logo. And here, don't remember there aqueous exterior here, cast the others, and cast for the voice. Toma, tome un vertices, and a lose here, and here lumina here me vadar uncircle, so that. That's without the plan, and it's me to the part that you can see in the piece of it. Ah, that's very here, and the project, and I'm the projection, and I'm the devil. If I have a interest, all the vertices are the exterior, but the aristocracy can intersect the spheroid. Intersector. Virno. If intersecting sphera, the two bodies are not intersected at the sphera, the two bodies, the circles, if intersect. So, result that if I have what needs to be done, if the volume only takes place.  And with this voyage can be the very packet to part a political party can control a packet, and it is packetamento. We are the political party of states made a packet, There are no interesting aquariums that are political and interest with this notion of political notion. You can utilize what polar of a political definition can be part of a dimension, a definition that polar, but other political dimensions and results that are dual extremely aquí. In particular, in 2012, In the two of us political, a political dimension teres, all the dimensions are encouraged. What do you say for a dimension of dimensions? Because the child, the verse, the voice project, and when you go the projection, you have blanks. If you are the dual, the dual dual. The dual destey porn here, here, here is also their vertical in the image. And that is a great automatic, so we already have two types. Andrew, and there are a number that simply can be. This simple canon the primal representation dual is very important for the study of geometry per bolt, because the story here is that a political dimension that we can find from it.  And imagine that this vertices, the sacrament in the North Sacrament, and the projection that this projection of these processes is imagined that we're going to be able to see it and put in the North Police and project. And project what I did. This is a transformation of my view. I think what is a transformation of transformation, and this is that the same thing, but the tome of my center, the rotation so that the northeast have the prediction and this is all here on the curvature. That is a corvator and trees with the same. Corvette and trees with it. So, I can see much. It's clear. There are all the solids, platonic solids, or respondents. If you can do something in the middle of Master, you can have results. Here, but I could see a dimension, but effectively. If the verse is a political dimension in the European representatives, with all their aristocracy, people who Here we have it. So, here the groups are methods that made a group of groups of. Here is a group very facilitated, which is the symmetric group that allows inversions that change myself on invariants. That's a better group. But I also very well regret the principal here, tome in the dual in the dual, in goblas, so I can't. So, I can inversion initialize the dual. No volume of the initial view, the volume of the dual. My inversion is to make other groups, the group of Apollonia cruxes. I think others don't enter. Other secondary tales can summarize, we can group co-ops, this is growing in there, representations with matrix explicit, with 50, but not what we can do, if you learn and. I will control all the people. Two news and all this. All right. No, no, no, no. But I will say, the character of ours. Because There all pork implement actions of the group experience. Can I porn pass a action? Tomo un element or applicable action, I think. If you apply this memory, there is nothing. And there are two controls. So it's interesting here that with empezar, and a vendor decided with empezar, we have to see here. Here with groups can be semi-actions to all the other aquís with the cubic, a little different, they have the name, and the vaccine. The two and these first. The first, the primer. A little more significant. This las curb acturas initials do not enter here, but the numerical and care. The first ahí are the vertices initials of the cairo. Tomisas corporate. Tomes corruptions and here. When pieces applaud my actions, you will see for there the four intersections of cadence, we can do Apollonius. That is better than you can say, right?  The curvature meal of it. So you can see as Lorenzian. So Lorenzo is a vector X. And you definitely have kappa X esteem product Lorentz internet. So where are my vectors here? And this X here is the sum of these two questions. The result is when the vector, x that we space-like, that corresponds to a volume, and when this product here is the curvature of the volume. That is simple, that means. That is simple, that I say, in ours, that comes. Look what definitely is to contradict this. Well, we have the curvature, I can define the center of Lorenzian, simplely center, how all the vertices are in the volume, which is the vector corresponding to this evolution, and how the vectors cannot. And the other vectors simply center. And result that if I center, we can explain this form because linear all these species. And result this important parameter. Cap. Capa, the product, production of the city, the cabinet, the voyage applied to this political. With that, the result of things that have I lived in platforms, because they were. Look at the verse boom, I'm just not. The words that are not very aesthetic, but we generalize it here, the two sanctions. Here, here, to see. Here to say, when you have the projection, put it on the Lorenzian vector, and that is a vector that is the same, so very well. In what I say, we regularly, because it is regular because I know that. Because I know that all the regulars can be potential to the spirit that is in the political exterior, exterior, is a political contend, that you are continuing, that they are continuing to continue, and without. And when they are formulated for all dependency of cap, depending on the CFE dimensions, and it is simple the dimension, the dimension of the longitudinalist thing that I want to do. Or I will do everything that we can obtain, but reduce the same. Because you can say that, for example, the octave, with three discourse that are two. If it was one, capital, capatrix, and this are toddling. Because simple application of my precedent. All reduced and calculated. He is the taxed, how the first one is, I can see. And calculate, and with the interaction, everyone will. And also with the Cubo Cubo.  Today, they are usually all very good. There is no example with the cosa, the request with the cosaid, not for a integral, we are the only one that can decide that this is in the nigga, and capability in the past. This is all the world will be generated. And that generalizes in particular everything that we can say much more than that, but I think the most complicated normally. Now, the modern pocket that we will recommend, okay? If there are a little bit, don't you have a lot of types of things, but it can say, okay, okay, okay, okay. What is very natural what is it? If you have here, I will move a little bit in the packet, but however, we can decide, not decided here, but here is here the destination. I programmed. This concerns the part of New York. Are I going to be very basic? Because you have a simple dimension 3, which does not intersect. And we can component, and that is. Components of NUDA, and all these components of NUDUS, I will say when the study is very clear, one of the forms of study is decided to my objection 3 and you can see a projection in dimension two projects. Simple projection, and simple time that decides to part of the curve for review, it's a projection that's a project with a plan, a plan for a plan, and the representative. And the representation of the world is a representation that I have the same model. That is what we have done. That's what it is. Ah, very interesting. Generally, we are a laser, but you can see that. Because it is interesting. The next normal is that you can see the news. It's a problem that generates. But I can fantastic. So, all the representations possible, we have the diagrams and projections. I will say the diagram that has numerous intersections, which is more combinatory, this number is difficult to consequent. If I type in 2000 representation, it is more than a number of cruises. The treble queen trivial more sensible and the hope that the nurses are not trivial in the trivial masculine. Oh, yeah. Oh. We all represent within that. But of the nutrose. Ten que este type of nú, para 'cause none. You know what? But all of you can say, but there are, but you can understand. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can say difference. The question allows us. Here you can see the difference. The other tribal. Dominion trivial que implement a lu pasí. When two tres. Tomen lance de hop que son two nos trivialas valen stamos. Ah, we are not because this new podo sera. I don't think as a little passer, pas por there. Aregunta concatr tres lo poda sero. But we don't know if the world is 400. So, when I investigated and we are a theorem, a result that we have theorem that is 50 numbers of linear, 5 demonstration of the political queue with the work of sources of Here we go, minus, what you decide to center of volume and finale minus aqueous. Originally, what is just obviously cruise and two to see the part that passed, the part that passed. We don't know what that is. Condition, and for the same time, with four injuries possible. Finally, for four and two, two, two, three, four, expensive conjecturals that concrete sufficient sufficient, and the four queen when you alternate. Alternant queen, when we say, when I write, the first cruise can be. The first cruise for rival sixteen porno, for example. That needs four veces in the number of cruise. If not alternately, can be with us. But we are like, oh, I do respond to this positively for a family of family experience. Really, the two. The during a theorem that paramount, all the theorems that I say that are professors and professors, it is a theorem, it is a joyita, it is a joy that theorem, the two. We have two families, so if the family ends, they know that it is a tangible very definite way, and we are a circle, we are a four point distinguishable here, one of two, and one. And we have a queue in the Queen and there is another point. That will be point that tangled complicated tangent, here they are elements that are more elementary. Exulta queen can operations. The operations that are more like that is the sum of two tangles. So that is why.  This is a person who is a flight, because we are a diagonal and pass for the two points and other tango. This is a tangle, what you say is that the voyage of the voyage where a twist. And tomorrow sugar, this daughter. This twist can be the positive. Twist or positive or negative if you operations with mathematical, one can form all the families of rational tangents, with the same thing. Ten, there is a positive or negative. I formar this tangula yo un tango initial elementario espresso y applicando flip y la yudo y la grego 3 nomo de twist flip y the number of twist flip the number of twist because if you want to say the tangle two minutes two minutes three infinite  This is your flip and this part of the case. I don't know you because the internet doesn't. But we have a part of the figure, the figure, and the pegan la suma with a con twist. Here the twist is negative, here positive. No, here is positive, and here is negative. And here I have the former. It's a form of formal. It's a form of forms tangles that are formed. We are interested in it. So, a tangle that goes quite a bit, the two arrived, the two, or the two externals, and that means the tangle. That is me going in the same. That's the one in the racion. And here in the presence, I think, and the more pendant elements and also the continuous fraction. This demonstrated this fraction if I. This fraction if I lago the calculus, I will do the numerous rational numbers. If the numerous rationales that I social queue form, I can two sequences of different sections, which when their continuous actions have the same rationalism, our unique. Number 10, our nunicases and here in the heart. With when I consider the tangles, that two are topological, if only if the same has the same number. When I realized it in absolutely, because the sequence is different, when my tongue here does not sequence. When I turn the here, you don't sequence because the final measures the same basically different, it's not a joy, it's a joy. My culture is general. So, we voyadar a rational and want to see if we can represent with. If we represent with four veces, the number of cruces of volume, we have the packet within versions. And where you initialize with the other is the four, one of the other. One of the aquí y otraca. The aquí is medio y el casta fue el loom mascuno lo vemos. Voyas de las inversions have a inverción pa de todo el mundo denuest. A inverción de todo el mundo denuest. Y boy, yo triod. Muy. Tomues. That goes que voya partir com a plan. I selectionaro un bonito plan. De talcerte que cuando, yo lo corto, los circulos que. The circulos that means in the planet, that I know that the cubic cubicles don't know, but they are very volatile. Here is a plan, a little obscurity, not the plan with what I will do with the volume that are intersected, there are volas that their center that. Therebolas esus centro que dan arriba y sucro que dan abajo. Las arriba son las negras que seva qui. Estabola, y estabola, son las two negas que van aquí. Y las bajo es estabola, y la vola canda por día tras la va. When the cortex meets because the cordadographic aquí. Graphic or diagram, they are the volumes that are tangential. And we are very impatient here if you do this. But if it diagrams, and what I see is imitating, but you misunderstood in this diagram. In this diagram, there are operations, the zoom, and inversion, and the flip, and the other, and the plan. And imagine that this other plan is a segment of iteration, going to more. I want to see what. I want to see the verse that is what we are in the plan. In the plan, what we are doing is that cuadradita here me do their divide in quadratus as well. And this cuado para la discerned there is a quadratic here, it doesn't go a iteration, it is a quadratite, oh, iteration, but that can be with what we are. And more actions of group actions are not here, but the group that meets the representation. So what we can do is a rationale to a cubic in where you have this representation. Where do you have this representation? And there are because when you have my representation, it is my linear vampire. That represents linear queue, centers of circles of dimension. That is the correct mediagram, here Conway, clack, clack, clack. Diago Conway, clack, clack, clack. Una escapo conway, ye miamap, eso, medo una representation with it. This line is simple, voy, the center of this vola, and pora la volaneira, vola blanc, volaneira, aquí, ok, blank. Blanco como next. So linear here is simple and the volunteer corresponds to the voyages, and the voyage, and the voyager, the voyager, the name, and that. One here only means exactly this tangent. We are representing it. And because four veces, because a cup of ditch, what is four river, and I pass for it, because the cruise is four, we are four. Engineering can be. A ultimate thing that is a little especially that they have in the message, that is history of fontices. David, the word, a representation in the presentation, I immediately know, this and this, and a measure. That means in this ultimate two correspondents, and the point of two things is point super important. And we point it here, even my representation in the cubicle, and Conway, and here we have my. And here have my ultimate views here of the power. That is, I have a center with this volume, and a center with the road that is for here. You have two volumes, and I think the point is also. And we say, I will pass away or this point, the point for the pencil. But the point is, and because the market is not intended, if I possibly have a solution to fonts, and here the two equations and controls in the solution in terms of the numbers, that is solutions. But not like passage and with the last queen point particular potential between two in theory of the podcast or the inverse corner to point in the point of volumes, I can't say I think that. A point in the space vectorial space that represents the Lorenzian. So, that is one correlation in dimensions four. But how we are linear and with this dependent, therefore, we calculate it. And a week we have this queue magically resulted because what we will say is this point that is a point, the multiplication of the Lorenzian product and I know that this erosion, because it points to two things of linear and solution, magnifying the principle when you have. You have a little bit, a little bit because if you can. Well, and that's what I came. Thank you. Thanks for this porcelain. We have the same thing, but we have a moment for a question. We don't know if the public will be able to do it. And the news that is nervous. It's a graphic nerve. Absolutely. It's a graphical absolutely. So, all these all the sentences that are cooked here that you have to form all the solidarity. It's interesting. It's interesting. Because I'm going to say.  Maybe not the problem with this.
