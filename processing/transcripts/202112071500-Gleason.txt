Okay, well, this is hola. Antes queenada, megustariagra decera los organizadores, tanto por la invitación como la opportunidada venir aquí aprender ustedes, tanto mathemáticas, como nivel professional. Las quieridar unas advertencias de miplática de lo cabe hablar nos are mis resultados, y nos más bien miente. Resultados, and more intention of this plateau is that hub, more where in the map. It's going to be varied local variables, which are the objects of the principle. And going to say, voyage other things that are not significant that maximums, but we have seen because the news with these variables of simulating locales is and well, if you don't know with the liberator, presentarme. So we are all going to go and unfrancer. So we empregunt it. Well, no, we empear con a pregunta. Uh esabe del siglo diciete es que nos me los primos in pares de puedemer como suma de twos cuadrados are suma de cuadrados. Don't question this puesta. So we will respond to a first vaccerado, and the formal four forms. When I say, moreover, that is a number of enterprises, and here also is a little bit. And well, the voyage of a formula of how we act like this question, and the first observations that consider the Gaussian entities. Gaussianos consist in considering expressions of the forma more and more. And well, they are a subject, the complex, that are gacious, and the results are que factorized first. So, we can first perform that first universal. Formular que numbers primos unums cuadrados, puzz pamos decir a este puz lo que nistamos entender es este que numeros primos, permanent esciando númos primos en este otro vanillo. No, the factorizam puzz vuanaser los que sonsumas de candradas, los nos factorizan, no. Y bueno, ah, toda vi other reformulación pocomas sophisticada, que utiliza diamos los númos piadi nosa. And well, the recording number is a construction alphabetic concept, we consider how limited inverse of topological discretion, in estamos interests in this topology, no, and these are priorities, and also consider the number of paid names that simple. Not because simple consistency inverted, and we are a campo, no. And exist with these alphabetic versions and also a analytic version. And a little more relationship like the numerous realities. So, how constructors the numerous realities, we are the numerous numbers, is and we are going to be. Well, we can decirate. And we can take the completion of Koshípla, and we have the normal form, and well, the piano forced me, but the answer to a different method are first, what you do is define a piano, which will be a function. That will be a function to the real positives very negative. That the pediatric is multiplicative. We are the multiplication, and the seros will be one when it primo distinctamos que apelo mandamos. People are a number, the names of the pedimas queer series. And with this valuation, I'll tell you with this form, we have these terminals of the rationales, because multiplication of numerous primos, no? If we multiply, we do not define completament. And we have this valuation priority. We can define notion of distances that will be. So, the number of COPE is like very similar as great van estar very. Grand Peva, estarois canoe. That's what this addition is. No. And well, one can recover from it, and what are the private sectors? And one can recover the idea in which they are valuable to me. And if we are our first ignorance, how the volume of radio. How the volume of radio debaters is like a medio-fractal structure. How we concentrate in volitas and volitas, and really the elements of these three elements, like basically chaminos of volas cadaspecas, and obtaining this withon. And well, I know what works with the form of the geometry, as the geometry that is cost. Ok, we have this, how we can interpret the original problem. Well, what we can visit is in que pasa cuando grego a una raíz. When we have a raise unofficial numbers, the polynomial, this minimum, about the rational rationale of two opas. We have a non-Islamo, and what you can do is obtain how the product of Cupe. The coupe o que obtengamos un extension de campo de grabo dos y justa vana ser los mismos casos de que numeros primos se factorizen. No, for the four camas una van a ver esta expression and parlos others van verse est expression. No? And the formulación que quiero de la que yo quiero blar es que es a question el civilo decisietene nos la bonos preguntar de la siente forma. Como tua el grupo degaloa Lo voy describidos está forma del elemento y. No, podamos considerar este grupo degaloa y lo que 'sprelo. Group of Galois, and what we are talking about is how this group of Galois groups are actual. No? And because historia, because it results in many actual problems, we ask different questions, can formulate systematic managers in question of the group of Galois groups. So what is this historia is that. So we also ensures groups of Galva. Okay, well, how studio group is. One can study with general and relations, and that terminates very complicated, but other digamos that other form of studio is through their representations, and we carry a little bit. And the other thing that I'm talking about is a little bit. And that is going to be a representation that is going to be a linear action, a group, in a pasive. Frances Parlamente our representations, and what we will do is completely. Yes, the question is, we have the construction of the priorities like The priorities like metric completion. No, and we have this campo, we can visualize their extensions of campo, because we have not all the polynomials going to have a solution here. So this is the cigars for the point. Okay. So we're going to study these groups of galaxies representaciones. And the English idea of a patron vast impression that the view of this social correspondencia is local. The voyage average. That the representation. Stan relax with representations objects vast different. Naturales are different. Abraces on the group reductivos. Well, we know that as we have topology and differential geometry, that are like geometric territory, in the well, we have a geometry elgebras, and in these geometric terms, and topological exist in the notion of groups of LI, no? Because in digamos that the reductive groups, the lands are the versions that exist. So what is the value of ten a notion of group of Li in the geometry of Java? Because one can consider these groups of LI convales in Cupe in cualquier camp. No. So some of these groups reductive groups paid. Vana has natural group of Li, and also have natural apadic. So, the more classical, or the most classical productive group, is GLN, this invertible matrices, and the podcast can be done. But, many others, we also consider invertible matrices with determinants, one, or we can see simple forms, and the groups of groups, as The language of groups adoptives, like families, very great families of groups of Liberty, but what have priorities. And the results are that relation is between two groups, groups, representations of groups of steel groups that construct utilizing matrices, and representations on a group of galaxies, no? Well, okay. Okay. So the case was basically the concept of local language is what it is. It is going to be the same thing. In English, local classical theory, the Spanish theory of classes, the campus. Well, I guarantee. Well, if you say local class field theory, well, that local class field theory, going to have some things. We have the numeros priorities, we have the enterprise piano, and we can porpoise. We obtain a finite and one of the We have structural structures, the group of Jehupel is that the podcast is a exact sequence, or we have a group of subrojective groups, a FP, the group of this finite group, and we can consider the kernel that we have the group of inertia groups. So, we are a map of projective maps, this other group and And this is no? And also that in the trio of Galois, this group of Galois group is a very conocidoción profinitude. And the profits have grouped and methods. Probably to the numerous interos with a generador canonic. No? Yes. In the particular time. This? Yes, no, there the completación profinita de los enteros es el limite sobre toda las enes os a sista. Osistas considering things that are y praise. So we aquímos a los enteros y podemos considerar, so the group of veles elements the group of gala groups that when the group of infinite groups terminate a potential vignette. Una potentially proven. No, it's like a simplification of the group of galaxies. And very likely to decide that what classical theory is that we have a map of representation, the reciprocity of Artín, Digamos to the group of unidades of Cupe. And that when we maximum, like this ungroup, this morphism, whatever morphisms of factorizar por el maximo 60 bellian y que cuando uno hace eso obtiro un identificación. That is how mind-blowing, right? Ocean formats group. And here the pass of México, the anglands that paramilitate, but. This language is reformulated. Mefico en voyagaradon lado representaciones of couper uno dimensionales. And of the others, going to representaciones and reducing. But with this, undimensional represents and the other ladder tomorrow representacenes and reduced representation. And the anglers what we do is ah, that'll be a problem. In that case, really what is it that there is a rejection with these things? And well, because we don't say, this first queen, one representation is a dimensional representation, is actuando non-patient factorial dimension. That is what they are acting for scalars. And that is a group. So that factorizar for the maximum maximum. Por el maximo 6. Tango es acos. Y der lado este groupo llasaveliano group, y si uno consider representations and reducible representation of a group of groups have a dimensional group. So we are saying that the representations are dimensional esteems and the representations of this coincidence, but if coincidentally because they are the same group. No? About what the majority of the reformulation of languages. Maha de la reformulación de langlands. Y puener una ene que aquí uno puede decir. A cupe cruz es el grupo de matrices de una elemento de pupe y puedas el mismo truco de bora el uno y puener unene. And this is the conjectural delanglands local. This is the local language. And Harris Taylor. And well, one can see that there are things that we think of respecting this. And that there are various generalizations, there are many directions in what we can generalize. When we say we are grouped by some other group reductive group, or like another group of Liberty and well, the formula of this enunciated formula is more complicated than many technicians who are and not only many complicated. And not only the complicated decir, also complicated. And of course, a candidate of a correspondence of language general que functions for all group productive groups, but this a year. With the work of Fargo. So we know many cosas. And this a year constructs how to manage that group here. This is fixed group, we can juggle this group, and have sales and correspondence in the English. So, it's like very caso por caso. Voyago este que. Voyage to the other cosa, and the first construction, but many things that the language of what is here, and it has a construction, but not the things that we are doing, so if the retrograde is the group, and what we are in our ecological. And put it, tomorrow, a very group of languages, what have you here? Did a group productive construct other groups, the group of languages? And And we will use morphismos of groups of coup groups of languages dual. And one thing that is a milagro is that the group of languages of Gelene also. So, for example, these things, but if you are complicated, And the response is that they are very relaxed in the sixteenth, we are in a arithmetic context, also there is a part that modifies arithmetic form, but in essence if it el groups of language that could contrarias representacions. Okay. Voyage. So these are varieties of very locales. And we have the moto queer that is the simulation locales. Yeah, and then the forma geometrica the correspondence of the local colo y bueno para esto los quiero explicar más someno les quiero dar un ida de que que que quiere. So, you can see with it, like, I'll primer Equis una variety of feveric variables. And the geometry allows you to understand how. A cupe like a spacio sero dimensional space, we can consider the spacio sero-dimensional space. The spectroscope, and also one considerar of the space. And we have a map of space, or normally in an apo dead, ten is a campaign. So we are not defined on CUPE we consider the product of this morphism and optemos esteem of it. And now the majority of this chamber of vase that ok. This object of the geometry has a galaxy. So, we have to para los here the first vehicle that prepared a little polo here, we are the spectroscopic. And here the here, the voyage put a band of mobius, no, I will say my band of very bios. And a record that we are and the Fego, the truth. And we know that this is the voyage. The covert implementes with one and the constructs of changing vase and a calculation that the real net numbers but the normal realities will be with an action of the fundamental group of seven groups. So, in the coordinated. And that is precisely what this passage here, the razor por the geometry has a galaxy, is because it is a space that has a This is a space that has a complicated group. There are a reformulation of the group agloar, the group agalo already the fundamental group of some of the things that pass when action of a group and what is a representation, the master of hazards, tomorrow groups of how. So, if you have a group actuando in a space, and a comologia can terminate with a group actuando in a vectorial space, like the colology is the format standard of linearizaric action. And well, in chiometrical journey, we don't have singularity, but we have how However, what do you say? It is considering the group of changes with some coefficient algorithm and this terminal with an action of the F is that chambered platform and the same thing.  So that is coupe where my group productive groups want Gelena de Coupe. And that is going to be with the space considering the change of vase. After the consider groups of groups, and just like definitions of CUPE, and ten action of GLE CUPE, we're going to terminate with. We are going to terminate with an action that the product of groups. Okay, what is paso? Well, one have very natural entry representations that have a representation with a group group, we can enter the components. And well, when we have a product of groups, the representations irreducible, we will conjunto the product of conjuntos, the irreducible. When we par vegetars, where ve representation of one, and veto is a representation of Children's representation, construction elsewhere, product that is a representation of here, where we are in a tensor. Por denad por cordenada entonces. Pues la idea estén tengo la action de este grupo en estos groupos como logía, que estoy estudiando. Y pues lo que ma gusteri a ve componar lo unredusibles. Just like a representation, Mijede Coupe with the product. Howí? When I gustaria queued their reciprocal of the anglance where Galois is a virgin that we have these spaces geometrical spaces have the correspondence of Langlands, if just as the correspondence of Langlands local noses, no? Nos los a couple. We are representation, the component unreducible components, and we are reducing this unrecible, porter unreducible, part, and how we have pledged them. No? We have this idea of the situation and in the world to be in formulas a little more complicated. And we have a very cuidad with this. But that is passing the idea of the praise, the varieties of simulation local. Las variadas decimural locales entienden geometricamente la correspondence language. So, the correspondence of languages pascamente les pupe de la comología. Okay, y bueno. Okay, Iguste hablar laquito de la historia de cómos de paformando ta ida, howimos discoveryndo certos casos de variadadas de simura locales. Metro daría mucho en escribir, como que todo que sir, entonces what is passer unpoco comazoral. So, I consider that we first caso varied simula locales, or how the working. Loving what is reconstructed in theory of classes of local classes or the mass basic Langlands correspondence as explicit class field theory. It seems abstract form that there is a class field theory and I want to construct as the extension of Galois College. And so that introduced what the formal groups. And one in the formal groups that introduced the language very specifics of what we have as groups per group, and the pedives, we have son las versions paid varied avellian variables. Local language correspondents. Local languages correspondence, the correspondence of the England local correspondence, biennial majority that is the correspondence of global language, and many enlarged others that are society, and in the majority of these superficial modular summary or modular corner people that can interpret how to curb elliptical currents. Well, this is this. Well, this is these other things, more groups per divisible group, which are like the versions of elliptic curves or varied variables in the world. And the forma discovery is discovering that, discovering the first instances, and prevent local class filters in 2015. And the sedation of what we do is infels in the future. And in the 76 que introduce what we have the torrent elubinte yes else my planos superior of your influences. No si record in the platica de tanto de carmen como de Andrés como de Andres comparación estos spacios symmetrical spaces, like spacios hyperbolicos, well can drink the version padica de cosas. Pedicros de cosas. Drive infel seconds subversion padic and reinterpret the working tate as things of groups per divisible group. We have these constructions of drinks are the first cases of what I know we have localized. That are geometrical analogies. Analogos, a symmetric space, we have a moment. Bring the form that these spaces are very related with the correspondence. This knowledge of formula and that is the first thing that proponents these spaces that are influenced. And well, I think, and not contrary to reference for the authors for this, but we have a estimated between the 20 and 20 four. In the four, no second user, this idea. But Code as here for a formula, no sensitive as this for formulas. Codewitz proponents quality general forms that one could obtain for a reduction. And this is a complete conjecture of CodeWidth, and it is super allowed. So, when existing Antes that exist of the space, correlate. Not quite the space, but correlates as if it was complete. In the 60s, the spaces of Drinfeld in Langlands Global. Ríamos en Langlands Global is varied, and there are various types of varieties of simula and there are some very connected with the various things. But there are some varieties of similar variants that are not in connection with it. Recists that report generalized to the construction of influencers, so local queer analogs of the And in work of Jarici Taylor, in 2012, Carajol dice, okay, the paradigms of similar localities have the correspondence of the colour and the. And Jerici Taylor, as well as construct the correspondence of the English colours of the local announcement, and that is the first construction of the correspondence of English local parallels. We have the varieties of similar localities in this world of correspondence in the English local correspondence other methods. And we have the unicorn cases of the configuration of code with this via the city. And well, I want to comment that my automorph in their text, my doctor, for some cases extra of the corruption, and also academic. In 2004, ah, no. For the 2020, Los Mildosé Weinstein introduced the perfectoides and lead a interpretation to the spaces of reports in spaces of moduli de stucas, one things that they have stuck pianicas. This and that definition. In the catorce, how are the principles configuring geometric conflicts that can be spaced from various localities that are necessarily the groups for groups? However Pediciles, because the complexity has given us with symmetrical spaces, and also the spaces of modules and varied spaces. Here, the principles only group groups, and we faltered a construction as a chemistry as more general, more general space. We have to conjecture that if existence that.  Berkeley lecture notes and proponents in a construction general, usando susteria deamantes. But no esta stados 1 decisiete. Crea the foundation. Create the foundational. So, as the same thing that is, with the expodiar a construction general construction of here, and explicitly, how we try to form and, well, I'm lecturing the pace. All day. Sistan clargos. Bueno, bueno, yacabo con historia. Plexo me ver cuanto ti unfo méque a pus yaca sibra vad. Leblar conquipito de que estratomi doctorado. Día estos variades locales de simura, son. Locales of the child are not cosas que sellama in spasios rigigos y denago les estoy dieciendo mentiras, because we are spaces and what is a natural space as the simula is not the torrent modular, corporate modular, estodena familia. Well, the varieties of similar que estimate this toddling families, but based on the family of spaces rigidos, but what is spasios rigidos? This we have in the perspective complex, we have varietas complex argument, variadas archived complex, no que son es es cosas simplemente agaras varias variables and cortasas por equions, son son caso particular. A caso particular of the complex manifolds, like varieties that are like more general. Varidades, more general. There are a font of analytification. Os a puedas empasar con una varidad algebraic va, and puoras questions algebraicas, y la puedes pasar y empesar pensar como unes. And the rigid spaces is a theory of how proportional in the case of the analog of this. Because we need that, when we spaciousymmetrical space, In these spacesymmetric spaces, achieve that as the people that we have the complex planning and here is the real plan, no? This is a space that will be a complex manifold that no space, no pupils cortar with the question. No, but the. So, the principle that the number of priorities are profinites, if the local view is a conjugate totally connected, seven. And really not queas y so una forma queremos que porjemplo las varidadas el jobara yas queen conexas when pas rigidos sigan siendo conexas, porjemplo. Qe verlamente podos thinkaras que son variadas, que si son que pueda permanas, permanent pupo de gemetería y. No? So the spaces rigid spaces like more. But in theory, the space rigid space is the same. It is difficult to say that it is more, but How is that, but this termination is spaced with various forms of how various fundamental terms are spaced, but well. What is what, in my doctorado, calculate the connections of local decimal variables. So, I think of the version general, how. And construct the version general, however, the varieties connect local chimera varieties. And many questions can be the respect, and the more natural connects by their understanding are working in space rigid space, and this query connects. And well, that is my result, principal of the doctor, is calculated and. And we have a puede relation the components connect the puer con la theory of local class field theory. No, like natural formas of local class field theory in the components connects their spaces. And I think that's a good question. Excuse me. If you have a pregnant space with their analytics, or This is here for analytical, complex analytical. Okay, voyage anointes and we are talking well, we have the days of how we are doing it. And responding is this dependent and that depends on what many propuestas como studies rigid and this. This is dependent much of the tutorial that is topological concrete. It's in analogy of what studies varied versus queas. And when a study varied students, we need more interesting points. So the response dependency, well, in the geography of the history of what De quales the theory correct because those spaces will evolutionando, but the viewed idea of how we have the first solution for the connected solution. And what I will do is the view record: how the numerous three advices were like a fractal. And you cover three options, and also in a option, and here this option has three options. And that is in the option ten three options. No, and that option ten others three options. No, there is construction. What proponents are Vercovich that model in the rigid space? It is some format tomorrow esteem in what have been your camino and whatever. And what is interesting in a point, which is the point of Gauss, that is like the analog of what we have a point of generic points, no? Enter that in the generic points that are a point that all. And what is space and gauge, you can see and say with these volumes, three options, and you can put a champion for a. Y vas como tuponero un camino porcadon tús optiones. Hasenar que volveras ejer, no, y entonces tienes esto y asibas es cojindo túlas. Y cuando digas limit, tos llamos que te vashindos eseca y c cuando degas a limite. Pecinamas, tomas esta rebanada. Pues vaso tener mismo tor que tenías aquí. But one forma la inclusion estuntos generic, or these two points of galaxy. Generices or these points of graphs that I understand how to do the volume, custom es locations that have the connection. Or everything here, the vases connected with a trajectory that you can buy. No, yes, yes. Two questions, a little con the example that we're talking about. Digital calculus of the components connects to other es there some types of types of spaces.  A studiant of FARC. This and that is a computer complicated company depending on the simulation local and reducing, and the reduces like the most essential cases, and the result, well, the varieties local decimal estor. No, son, No, don't really cundo computas the connections are the conexas of the torrent. And a organizar is components with components that pass the infinite, if we are the limit of the torrent that obtains components. And what obtainers the infinite well, everything. Y what transitiva is and we will maximize this group termination a transitive action. So, we have y the So, we have y groups. So, paraje coupe, for example, is what cruise that gusto is the maximum via the map of terminants the matrix. So, the coupe will be acting here, and really all the SL in Coupe will form trivial in the connects components. Trivial en las components connects us. The other question that we can esperate of the groups that are complicated, inclusive computing groups and superiors, like one for a certain certificate, are difficult for me. The unique thing that we have. And the unique thing that we can do is configure CodeWits, which is not a group of people in particular, but consider these things that are groups of growth groups, and the alternates of the comology groups. So, however, you say, all the information of all the groups of comology groups. Groups of how it looks, but like one cada por particular area complicated for us. Charla yen, a lot and a question as philosophical militia explain.  Uh well, uh, no secrets the paso fasil que sigu, but the move of the moda of what? Well, terminated the nation from the Arizona Winter School of Perfectoides, and explicitly that has. How explicit that has been, and the cabinet concert is a year. That is the introduction of one conjecture that conjecture of the language geometric language that is parajel two inclusive parajel two nos we are como una unificación de two programas que tamos lleva naños existiendo por un la dostaba la Existence, but a ladder tab the community of numerous communities for reciprocity and arithmetic languages, and for other geometric groups, however, and French, which has a proprietary conjecture of geometric language, that is a categorical conjecture. There are things like utilities when corresponding to knowledge of a rejection, but. Objection, but the trial with our districts that objection exists for acts, but possesses us what we are. And also the work of Xinguan Ju proponents that there is a geometric conjugate in absolute analog. This is here, this, and this is here, that Fargiol proponents the conjugate of the geometric conflict to Galopia. For priorities, and representations of priorities, and what are we all local by metadata and arithmetic methods that we think in terms of representations geometric representations, no? This and in this program of local language geometric language. Langlands local geometric, also in this past. Tamina para seen there, but enpiasana tomorrow como unrol puzzles secondary because many things we have confuture of language soméric conflicts, we have the conflict of language, but we have some approximations, but we study these things here. The two perspectives will be juggling. We are a lascuatrimedia.
