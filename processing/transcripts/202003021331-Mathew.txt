So I would like to talk about some structural features of the bot-war-scholzefiltration on topological cyclicology. So it's based on work with Benantio, Matthew Morrow, and Tomas Mikolas. So I want to start by recalling some of the So I want to start by recalling some of the classical context. So let x be the smooth algebraic variety over a field, k. So then one has the following construction. So then one has the algebraic E here of x. And one has the following construction, which is due to Friedlander Susslin and Labine. Which is that there is a natural motivic filtration on the algebraic k-theory of x. So the algebraic k-theory spectrum of x, k of x, is equipped with a motility filtration. So I'll write this fill greater than or equal to star of k of x. And it has the property that the associated greater Property that the associated weighted terms, so the ith associated weighted piece of this filtration on k of x, is given by the weight i motivate complex of x. So for example, this is, oh, sorry, so shifts by 2i. So this weight i mutup complex, for example, is something that can be defined explicitly using the complex defined by block in terms of algebraic cycles. I guess it's much of a much of a complex of weight i. I don't think SP will prove that though. Sorry? I don't think, I mean Friedland and Southland certainly didn't prove that. Sorry, so they use a different definition of the motivator. No, I mean they couldn't, I mean they define a filtration, but they don't identify. They don't identify the grading pieces. I think it was okay. Okay. Um thank you. So this is the Muchave complex, for example defined by block in terms of algebraic cycles. So let me mention a few features of this construction. So the first part is let me say something about how this is defined. So I guess this is not the original definition, but this can be defined. Definition, but this can be defined via the mutevic slice filtration. So in the setting of mutevic or A1 motivic theory, algebraic K-theory is represented by a Motivek spectrum, and this carries a natural slice filtration. And it was later shown that this slice filtration recovers is a way of defining this magnetic filtration. Of defining this hismotic contraction. So, but let me in particular comment that a feature of this is, so this is in A1 homotopy theory. And so, in particular, a key feature of this construction is that it's using the fact that algebraic K-theory is A1 invariant. So, and sort of the central feature of all this is that you're working with smooth schemes. Because algebraic K-theory is not A1 invariant outside the regular case. Outside the regular case. So it's essential here that X is. So is some spectral sequence collapsing here or something? So it doesn't have to collapse. Okay, it gives a spectral sequence. Oh, I see. It is the spectral sequence. The filtration. Okay, sorry. Filtration is a spectral sequence. Right, so rationally it does collapse. So rationally, the filtration splits. Splits. Rationally, this is given by diagonalizing the atoms operations. So the atoms operations in algebraic k-theory will act by weight i, so psi k will act by multiplication by k to the i on the ith-graded piece. So rationally, that gives you a splitting. And then with mod L coefficients, so L coefficients, so continue over here. So if L is not the characteristic of k, then there's a description of these motivic complexes of x with mod i coefficients. So if we take the motivic complex of x and reduce mod mod i, then this is given as the truncation, so let's say truncation in degrees less than or equal to i of the usual area. Of the usual et al. cobalt of mu L times I, and this truncation is carried out in the Nisnevich topology. So, this is the valence of Lichtenbaum conjecture proved by Wyogotsky and Roast. And it gives a pretty complete picture of algebraic K-theory with theory with mod L coefficients for smooth schemes over a field. Okay, so a central construction in the paper by Batmoros Schultz on topological Hochschule tomology and integral kinetic Hodge theory is an is an analog of this type of motivic filtration for various objects such as THH and objects related to it. So let me, so in this talk I want to focus on the case of TC. So there's the following construction of thought, Morrow, and Schultz. So let R So let R. So the first thing I want to mention is that this, in the context of algebraic gain theory, it's very important that one works with a smooth variety, at least via these methods. But in the setup of Bottom-Rachol, one can allow R to be any, so let R be a piadically complete ring. We could, or more generally, we could allow a simplicial complete group, right? So let's say it's a pi-adically complete simplicial. So let's say it's a pietically complete simplicial commutative thing. So then they construct a filtration, a natural filtration. So then there is a natural filtration, which I'll write fill greater than or equal to star on the topological cyclic homology of R with p-adic coefficients. This means the p-complete. This means the completion of the topological cyclic homology. And the associated graded terms, so per i of Tc, of R with p-adic coefficients, is denoted as Zp of I, of R shifted by 2i. Sorry, Aki, are you kind of extending from the top part of the symptomic? Yes, I will get to that. Thank you. And so this is supposed to be an analog, this is supposed to be an analog of the Motipec filtration on algebraic peak theory, although the methods used to construct this filtration are somehow completely different. So in particular, the use of there's Particular the use of there's no assumption that R should be smooth, and there's no A1 invariance in this context. So, okay. And so these associated weighted terms, so I'm describing the filtration on Tc, but they're filtrations on all the objects related to THH, and the associated weighted terms of those filtrations give objects of interest in Piato Koch theory. So, okay, so I want to start by giving a quick Giving a quick summary of how this construction works, it has the advantage of being very direct. And so it goes as follows. So the first point is that, as Mr. Moles mentioned, so in the setup of their paper, they work with a suitable class of rings. And it's for which things work especially well. And this is the class of quasi-symptomic models. So the ring R. So ring R is called quasi-symptomic if the following holds. So R is P-complete and bounded P power torture. And it has the property that when you take the cotangent That when you take the cotangent complex of R over Zp, so that's some object in the derived category of R, and when you take the derived tensor product to R mod P, so now this is in the derived category of R mod P, then this has tour amplitude in the range from 0 to 1. So this is a class of rings for which these various filtrations are going to behave particularly well. Are going to behave particularly well. And so the basic example is that if you have any LC, if you have an Ethereum ring and it's a local complete intersection, for example, the quotient of a regular ring by a regular sequence, then it will be quasi-symptomic. So any LCI ring. But this class of rings also includes any perfectoid ring, or any quotient of a perfectoid ring by a regular sequence. By a regular sequence. And ring means ring means C P algebra. Well, it's piadically complete. I'm assuming all rings are correct. Okay. So on this class of quasi-syntomic rings, the definition of the, so that's actually the setup where they define this filtration. They define this filtration. And the idea is that the filtration is a Postnika filtration. But it's a Postnika filtration in a suitable topology called a quasi-syntomic topology. So define a Broken topology. I'm going to define a Broken Jupiter topology on the class of quasi-symptomic rings. So if we say that a map r to r prime is quasisyentopic, Is a quasi-symptomic coupler if it has the following properties. So one is that for each n, r mod p to the n to r prime mod p to the n is faithfully flat. And two is that when we form the relative cotangent complex of r prime over r, then this has Over R, then this has a similar sort of tor amplitude condition. Sorry. So when I form the derived tensor product over R prime with R prime mod P, this now lives in the derived category of R prime mod P, and the condition is that it has core amplitude in zero only. And I should say that this definition is from the paper BMS, and I think it's one of the very nice innovations. Think is one of the very nice innovations in that paper that has now also been used in several other papers. Okay, so there's a notion, so there's a notion of a cover in this topology, which is basically something that's detected in terms of the cotangent complex. And again, let me give an example. So the basic example So, the basic example, or somehow the main thing that you want to allow to be a cover and that this definition lets you do, is that you want to be able to add lots of p-power roots. So, an example is if r is a ring, well if it's quasi-symptomic, and if x, or let's say alpha and r is an element, then we can form r goes to r brackets x, modulo of x to the p minus alpha, and this is a quasi syntermic cover. So somehow this is a central idea that locally in this topology, you have lots, you have all the p-power roots that you want. And in fact, this idea, so this is, I should also say that this is a non-Netherian version of the symptomic topology, which was earlier, which is a version of this where you only work essentially with Netherian rings of finite type. And so that goes back to Maser and Quintan Massey. So now let me explain the construction. So the theorem from Bottomerwich is the following. So it states that the functor which sends r to tc of r with p-odic coefficients, as well as all the, I'm going to focus on tc, but this is true for all the other functors related. But this is true for all the other functors related to THH. That this is a sheaf, this is a sheaf of spectra for the quasi-symptomic topology. And then, with this in mind, they make the following definition. So So, their definition is that the motivic filtration. So, if I want to define fill greater than or equal to i of Tc of R with P coefficients, then this is the Posnico section, or it's the connective cover, tau greater than or equal to 2i of Tc. But this tau greater than or equal to I is to be computed as sheaves in the quasi-symptomic topology. And the quasi-symptomic topology. So this is in sheaves of spectra, and then you evaluate it on. So their filtration is exactly, well, it's a possibility of filtration up to a double speed and in this quasi-symptomic topology. So in that sense, it's a very direct construction because it's based simply on the notion of a connected Simply on the notion of a connected cover in a suitable site. And in fact, this turns out to be very explicit. This turns out to be very explicit in practice because there's a class of brains. So essentially the idea here is that let's say you want to understand the motivic filtration on Tc of Zp. The idea is that you replace Zp by some much larger ring, which has lots of p power roots, and on those rings, this filtration is just a power. This filtration is just literally the Postnicka filtration. There's no need to say she's a spectra. And then you define it in general by descent. So let me just give an example of how this works in practice. So example is if r is the ring zp, let's take r prime to be the ring zp brackets zeta p to the infinity, dipiodically complete. Infinity, and I pietically complete. So, this is a perfectoid ring, and for perfectoid rings, the motivic filtration on Tc is literally the positive filtration. No cheapification is necessary. And then, what you get from this is that fil greater than or equal to I of Tc of Zp, well, the i coefficient, sorry, repeating Zp, then this is the totalization of, well, I take the check nerve of r to r prime, and then I take the connective cover sort of levelise. sort of level wise. So it's tau greater than or equal to 2i of 2c of r prime r prime with zp coefficients, and that maps in two ways to tau greater than or equal to 2i of Qc of R prime tensor Zp of R prime with Zp coefficients and so forth. So this is an explicit formula. Well, it's explicit but maybe not so easy to calculate directly for what the motivation is Directly for what the motivic filtration is on Tc of Zp. But so an insight in BMS too is that Tc is actually much more attractable for these very big rings than it is for a smaller ring like Zp. Okay. So as I said, the idea is that this is supposed to be an analog of the motivic filtration in algebraic K-theory. But it's defined in a completely different way. But it's defined in a completely different manner. It's defined via POSNICA filtration, via suitable topology, and not using very different methods from what you would use in algebraic K-theory. So we can ask about what is the relationship between the motivic filtration on Tc and K-theory. So what is the relation that we can be? between V of S2 and the filtration on algebraic K-theory. Right, so first of all, recall that K-theory and Tc are closely related. So we have a cyclatomic trace map. For any ring R, we have a cyclatomic trace map, which goes from the algebraic K-theory of R to the 2TC of R. And I'm going to work with p-adic coefficients here. So if R is a p-adically complete ring, So if R is a p-adically complete ring, these two constructions are closely tied to each other, for example, because of the following result. So this theorem is due to Geiser and Hasselholt in many cases, and in general to Klaus and myself and Mora. So it states that if R is any P-complete ring, Then the map from the atolk theory of R with p-adic coefficients to Tc of R with p-adic coefficients is an ISO in non-negative degrees. Uh the phenomena in negative degrees come from singularities in R, which are not going to be captured by this. Going to be captured by this. So Tc is basically p-adic atal K-theory for p-adic rings. So the idea is that, well, if you have a motivic filtration on algebraic k-theory, and Tc is basically atal K-theory, p-iadic atal K-theory, then you expect that's true at the level of filtrations. So what you expect from this Is it actually a minus two truncated map? I can probably say minus one, but let me not do this. Thanks. All right. So one can expect something else. The BMS2 filtration is the atoll version of the motivic filtration. And that the Z P of I's, so these Z P of I's are defined in BMS2 directly in terms of topological cyclochomology, but these are some form of p-adic enthalmativic homology. So there's an issue in trying to formulate these statements, which is that right now the motivic filtration and motivic homology are usually defined only under, again, under sort of smoothness hypotheses, whereas these Z P of I's have the advantage, because of their construction in this fashion, that they're defined essentially completely generally. Well, I said quasi-syntomic, but it turns out you can come. Quasi-synchronic, but it turns out you can cone and define it for all p-adic ranks. But so let me indicate the example where this is. It's yeah. So let me give the following example. So this is due to Geyser Lefine and Geisser Husserl. So it states that if R is a smooth algebra where k has characteristic p, k is a field of characteristic p, then in fact what I said is literally true. So then the BMS2 filtration, well, so in this case we do have a motivic filtration because we're smooth over a field, and the BMS2 filtration Field and the BMS2 filtration is literally the etal mutivic filtration. And furthermore, so the Zp of I's that they define are p-adic atal mutivic homology, and in fact they're an object that was previously studied in arithmetic geometry, I think originally by Mill in his work on duality theorems in chiatic sites. And so these are. Settings. And so these are, I'll just find it. They're loggerhenic duramden cheese. And then you have a shot. So also in this case, so as she's the length of the filtration is zero. Sorry? So the filtration on each is. is uh as length zero. I think it does length the dimension of R, because it's it's the equation. As heaps on smooth schemes are okay. Yeah. I tell you that the filtration has link zero. So I think I don't understand what lens zero filtration means. That there is no filtration I mean. Everything is in one one there's only one graded piece that is not. P status. Well, I think you have the V D of I's for all I. Yeah, yeah, so for okay, let's talk about it. So in general, so in general, maybe the point I want to make from this is that the study of these ZPFIs, so, well, should be interesting for multiple reasons. One, because they filter topological cyclic homology, which we might want to understand. And another is that they seem to show up in arithmetic geometry in various other settings. In various other settings. And so let me mention, but in general, I think these ZPFIs are not necessarily understood. There are not so many cases in which we understand the ZPFIs. So one case is if we're an equal characteristic. And the other case, so this is done by BMS2, is a case where you're smooth over OC. So if R is, well I should say formally smooth. Formally smooth over OC. So here, let's say OCP is the ring of integers in the CP, which is the completed algebraic closure of QP. So then the theorem of BMS2 is that the cohomology of the Zp of I of R is basically a truncation of the atol cohomology of the generic fiber. So it's isomorphic to the cohomology, the atol cohomology. The atone cohomology of spec of R adjoint 1 over P with coefficients in the usual Zp of I take twist. So this is for star less than or equal to I, and it's zero for star greater than or equal to i plus two. And then there'll be some extra stuff in degree i plus one, basically at some sort of truncated p-adic nearby cycles. So this is also sort of where p-adic hutch theory is. Is also sort of where piadic hotch theory is coming in because piadic hotch theory is going to be interested in this type of object on the generic fiber, and here we're relating it to something which is living over r itself and which is maybe closer to things like the ROM cohomology. Okay, so um Yeah, so maybe you should really think of that calculation as going in the opposite direction. Sorry, which calculation? The one on the left point is the... I mean, it's a calculation of the right-hand side. Yes. Yes. That's fair. Okay, so in this lecture, I wanted to explain a few structural features of this BMS to filtration and of the AZPFI. Infiltration and of these Z P of I's. And so here's the main result. So it states the following. So let R be a quasi-syntomic ring. And then, so one has the following. So So, first of all, we have a connectivity assertion. So, for each I, the I filtration piece of Tc of R with p-adic coefficients is I minus 1 connective. So for I equals 0, this is a familiar fact that G C with padded coefficients is always minus 1 connective. And in fact, it's going to be I connective. It's going to be I-connective if R is strictly himself. So that's the first item. So equivalently, this is saying that the cohomology of the Zp of I only goes up to I plus one, which we saw over there in the case of OCP. So in particular, this is saying that the BMS2 filtration converges, sort of converges rapidly. Sort of converges rapidly. So the second assertion is that this filtration is determined, is con extended from its values on finitely generated polynomial rings. So the construction r goes to kill greater than or equal to i, tc of r with t coefficients, is left kind of. So right now I've told you how to define it on quasi-atomic rings, and the claim is. And the claim is that it's left time extended from finitely generated, well, I should say p completions of finitely generated, so let's say finitely generated polynomial rings over to zp. So what this means, this assertion means, is that you can extend it to all simplicial commutative rings, and what you get will commute with separate coefficients. So it extends to all simple commutative rings over zp. So bracing p, and commutes with sifted colloquies. So again, this is something quite a bit stronger than what algebraic K-theory has. So a result of Bot and Lurie shows that K-theory is left conextended from smooth algebras, but Tc and its filtration are actually left conextend for finitely generated polynomial rings. What did you say about K theory? About a K-theory? So left con extended from smooth algebras. So they're auditory. Okay. And so this is why, this result is why I was starting by assuming that we just have a complete rate or some pressure condition. Okay. And then finally, so this part I'm not going to state completely. I'm going to explain the statement later. So for i less than or equal to p minus 2, or P minus 2, or for all i rationally, one can describe the Zp of I via syntomic homology. And here syntomic homology refers to a more classical object, which was defined by Defined by Fontaine-Messing and Kata. In particular, it's a construction that only depends on Durand cohomology rather than prismatic cohomology. So in the rest of the lecture, I want to explain the statement more precisely what this is, and a little bit of what goes into the proof. But so any questions on the rest of the statement so far? Any questions on the rest of the statements so far? Okay. Well, I think you should call the new CPIs syntonic on, and then you can call the other ones preliminary syntomical. Sorry, when I write CP of I, I mean the BMS two. Yeah. I'm saying that we can describe them in terms of naive symptomical models. Okay, so to formulate this, the next thing I need to do is to state some facts about Durant cohology, about algebraic Duran cohomology, and that's derived version, as I'd say, too. Derived Durang cohomology. The wrong chronology. Okay, so this comes from the following definition. So the starting point here is the following definition. So let R be a K algebra, where K is some base ring, not necessarily a field. So the algebraic Durham complex, which will write us over. Which will write us omega bullet of R over K is the universal commutative differential graded algebra where odd degree classes squared is zero. So this is an extra condition if we're at the point two. We're odd degree classes squared is zero. So it's the universal So it's the universal instance of a commutative differential rated algebra with this extra condition, and let's call such commutative differential-rated algebras a bullet, together with a map from R to the ring A in degree zero. So, this is the universal property of the algebraic duration complex. So, in particular, it's a commutative differenti-weighted algebra. So, the basic example is that if all So the basic example is that if r is k brackets x, then this complex is the two-term complex k brackets x mapping to k brackets x dx. And the differential is the Durand differential. d of x. x to the i is i x to the i minus 1 dx. So this is the notion of the algebraic Durand complex. So the algebraic, I believe algebraic, the Rom cohomology was first considered by Grotmier, who proved, who considered the setting where k is the complex numbers. So if k is the complex numbers, and if r is Complex numbers, and if r is smooth over k, then the theorem is that if you take the algebraic Durham complex of r over c, then this is quasi-isomorphic to the singular chains on the underlying topological space of, well, the complex points of this algebraic variety. So the theorem of Grotenjik, so is that the algebraic Durham complex gives an explicit model for the singular co-chains on the associated complex variety. So for example, you can check this if you have the affine line or Gn pretty easily. So for example, if you have the affine line, then this is going to show you directly that the affine line is acyclic. Directly, that the affine line is acyclike, which it should be, if you take k to be the complex numbers. But note that, so what I want to consider here is where k is positive or mixed characteristic, and then algebraic drawing homology tends to behave differently. It's a lot bigger. Okay. So now let's consider the following definition. So this definition is due to H or This definition is due to Helius Erton. And this is the definition of derived Ramkov. So let's consider the functor which goes from polynomial k algebras to E infinity algebras over k. Which sends a polynomial ring p to the Durand complex of P over K. So we consider this as a commutative EGA, and hence as an infinity algebra. And now we can take its non-abelian derived functor, so in the sense of 12, and then we can extend it to all simplicial commutative K algebras. So it admits a left con extension where non-Gulium derived. We're not getting in the right functor. And this is now going to be a functor from all simplicial commutative k algebras to E infinity algebras over k. So this functor is So L omega is the derived functor in the sense of quillen of the functor which takes a k algebra to its associated Durant complex, which we consider as any infinity algebra. And so, furthermore, this is equipped with an additional piece of structure. It's equipped with a piece of structure called the Hodge filtration, L omega greater than or equal to star over K, which is the left con extension of the naive filtration. So if you look at any complex, it has a naive filtration. Filtration, you look at co-chains in degrees greater than or equal to i. And if you left-con extend that filtration, you get the Hodge filtration on derived Durant Cumology. So this is the notion of derived homology. And it turns out to be a very tractable invariant. It turns out to be a very interesting and powerful invariant when you're in a p-adic context. So that's a consequence of the philosophy. So that's a consequence in the following results, which are due to BI. So the first result is that this construction recovers the original construction for smooth algebras. So if r over k is smooth, then l omega of r over k uh after p-adic completion is the same thing as is quasiosomorphic to omega of r over k again after p-adic completion. Again, after p-adic coefficient. This is actually a pretty non-trivial, this is a very useful pattern, a very non-trivial observation, because you start out because it's defined in this sort of left-derived functor way through polynomial rings. And so although derived during homology has been around for many decades, this is a fairly recent result. And the other is an explicit example outside the smooth case. So if r equals z and k equals z brackets x, where we send equals z brackets x, where we send x to 0, then l omega of z over z brackets x, so everything is going to be after a p equation, so I'm going to start working, right, is the divided power algebra on the class x in degrees of p. In particular, it's a discrete ring, and it's just a divided power algebra. So basically for these two reasons, piadic-derived Durham homology turns out to be a very computable invariant. So L omega. So L omega, so henceforth, we're going to consider the base ring k to be z, and we're going to p-adically complete everywhere. And this associative theory, I'm just going to write it as omega. I'm going to omit the p-completion and relative to cp. relative to C P. So we'll just write it this way. And this theory, the main thing I want to emphasize is that essentially because of these two facts, it's something that you can really write down. It basically ends up being a combination of writing down neuron complexes and writing it down divided powers in appropriate ways. So at least if you have a ring which is again quasi-symptomic or say LCI, this is something pretty explicit. So now that we mentioned a flat disinfectanking complex used when it is no so far this uses the conjugate filtration of neuronal cohomology. Okay, so this is derived a little bit about derived neuron cohomology. I need to explain, before explaining symptomic cobology, I need to explain one additional piece of structure of underived during cohology, which is the forbakeness. There's the following construction. So for any ring R, L omega of R carries a forbiddenness. Carries a forbatus. Control called phi. So this is a priori a little bit surprising because R itself does not carry a verbatimus. R is not a characteristic P ring yet. But the reason for this is due to the theory of crystalline cohomology. And the theory of crystalline cohomology actually shows that what I've written as L omega of R, in fact, only depends on R model. But in fact, only depends on R mod because of the theory of crystalline cohort, which provides the following commutative diagram. So we have simplential commutative rings over Zp. We have E infinity algebras over Zp. And we have the derived Durham homology functor like this. And the statement Functor like this. And the statement is that, well, we can actually factor it through some quotial commutative rings over Fp, where this map down here is R goes to R derived tensor Z mod P. So in fact, the derived Durang complex factors through the mod P reduction, and this functor here is called derived crystalline homology, derived Durham. So in particular, because everything is being decompleted. We could do the decompletion at that. So, okay. So basically the takeaway from this, so let me just sort of write the takeaway, which is going to be relevant to what I need, is that for any r, we can associate this object l omega of r, and it has the following two pieces of structure. Following two pieces of structure. So, first of all, it carries this Hodge filtration. And the Hodge filtration, again, was sort of the naive filtration for polynomial rings, and then you can't extend it. And then it carries a Frobenius operator. And the Frobenius operator is because it factors through simplicial commutative rings over Fp. So note that these are not compatible with each other. So although the derived Durand complex depends on the reduction, depends only on the reduction, that's not true of the high. Only on the reduction, that's not true of the Hodge filtration. So these are sort of two separate pieces of structure. So now let me formulate the theorem precisely. And so let me first state the rational version, and it states the following. So if r is any simplicial commutative frame, then if I form not zp of i of r, but its rationalization, which I'll write as qp of i of r, then I can write it as follows. It's the homotopy fiber of phi minus p of p of r. A phi minus p to the i, which goes from l omega of r greater than or equal to i to l omega of r. So we have l omega of r, we have the forbadius and the pot filtration, and we sort of take the difference in this way. And sorry, this is so this is the first statement. And the second statement is that you can do this integrally in a suitable range. In a suitable range. You can do this integrally in a suitable range, but here one has to be a little bit careful. So for i less than or equal to p minus 2, one can define in a unique fashion an operator phi divided by p to the i, which goes from the i stage of the Hodge filtration back to L omega r. So there's a unique way of defining this map. Well, there's a unique way of defining this as a map of functions. So let me just say there is So let me just say there exists a unique map such that when you multiply it by feet of the i, you get the Frobenius. And then one has the formula that zp of i of r is the homotopic fiber, so for such i, of the divided by p to the i minus 1, which goes from l omega of r greater than or equal to i to l omega of r. So in particular, if you're willing to work rationally, or if you're Work rationally, or if you're willing to work in this range of degrees, you can describe these components of Tc in terms of derived Duranc homology. So I'm pretty sure what happens in a borderline case just when two Just when two starts to fade? Well, so this is always going to be true up to isogeny, up to some bounded denominators. And I think you can kind of control what denominators show up. But I don't think you get an explicit formula. So I should also clarify that in the work we must do, the ZP advisor defined it, well, you can define them explicitly via a simpler looking formula, but using prismatic homology. And so somehow the point. And so the point of this is that if you're willing to throw away some information, you can also describe it using sort of more classical tools. Although the more refined information is going to be there if you sort of prismatic algorithms. Let me just mention one corollary. So this is a corollary not only of the last fact, but also of the conductivity balance that I mentioned earlier. And it's a description of rational Tc. So for any simplicial commutative written R. Simplicial commutative invert R. It states that Tc of R with QP coefficients, so by this I mean I P completed an invert P, then it's the following direct sum. It's the direct sum of I greater than or equal to 0 of the homotopy fiber of P minus P d I from L omega of R greater than or equal to I to L omega of R to be equivalent to this. Okay, so any questions about this, about these two points? Are they the choices in their equality? Well, so this comes from splitting the mutavic filtration rationally, which there's a canonical splitting the atoms operations. And also you see the convergence. But what about in this identity function? So this identification comes from some pretty canonical paths. Actually, we'll explain that in a sec. So let me also write, so let me say again that this type of construction was considered by Fontaine, Messing, and Cato in their work. So this type of construction in particular is known to be related to atomic homology. It is a television of the chromology for student schemes over a DBR by work of Geiser. So this is sort of, well, there are various different objects defined in different sets of generalities that are sort of want to be ACP of I's in the literature, and this is giving sort of a connection. And this is giving sort of the connection between that. So these EPFIs are the ones that come up from TCM. Okay, so in the remaining time, I want to say a little bit of what goes into the proof of these results, which is sort of going to be separated than a kind of interest. So let me say something about what goes into the proofs. So so the proofs of these results are are based on a result purely in topological cyclicomology. In topological cyclic homology. These are based on a fiber system in topological cyclic homology that relates the topological cyclic homology of any ring to the topological cyclic homology of its mod theory production. And in particular, the main tool that we use is the following here. So, ultimately, the attribution afterwards, so this is the institute of Bailinson, and to the Uh and to the core husband. It states the following. So if R is any ring, then there is a pullback square. There is a natural pullback square, which is as follows. So we take Tc of R with Q key coefficients, and you could say you can sort of be careful with the denominators as well. I want you that here. Denominators as well. I want you back here. Mapping to Tc of R with QP coefficients. And this now maps to the negative cyclic homology of R with QP coefficients. Or it is Ht minus. And well finally, this is sort of the exotic map, which you have the periodic cyclochmological form of coefficients. So there's the following fiber, there's the following natural pullment. There's a following natural pulling square. And all the maps here are the natural ones, except for this sort of slightly funny map from Tc of R mod P to H P of R. And so map that's defined with some denominators. And this is the new map that's constructed. So this gives a relationship. I decided this gives a relationship that we I mean, I guess we want to say the R s and mark you. Well, I said T C, so not K theory. Sorry, what? Well, I said T C, so I don't need to assume. Oh, you said T C, you're right. Sorry. So let me just say a little bit about where this square comes from. So and where this is coming from. And so this is, so in this one, the result is due to the fortress, but it was, well, something very close to this was proved by Bill. Something very close to this was proved by Balinson. So, Bailinson proves the fiber sequence, shows that there is a fiber sequence involving Tc of R with QP coefficients, Tc of R mod P with QP coefficients, and the cyclic homology of R with QP coefficients shifted by 1. So, Billson has. Shifted by one. So Balenson has a paper from a few years ago where he shows that there is such a natural fiber sequence. In fact, Balinson proves this not using topological simpler topology, but using algebraic pain theory. So this is proved using algebraic pain theory, and Bilson actually proves it by following the strategy of proof in building these original. Strategy of proof in Goodwilly's original paper. So Balinson was sort of following the original paper by Goodwilly that studies relative K-theory and cyclotomology along a notput and ideal for two objects. And that paper was based on some Lie theory. And Beylanson's idea was to somehow adapt that Lie theory to Piadic Lie theory. And he proved as a result using algebraic K-theory and P-adic Lie theory. So there's some more motivation for building. So there's some more motivation for Billingson's work, which I don't like it in terms of. But yeah, let me just say that it's an analog of police for relative K-theory in Tc. So by the Dendoskov and McCarthy theorem, it's equivalent to a statement, this statement Equivalent to a statement, this statement is equivalent to the K-theker statement. And this fiber sequence in practice is quite non-trivial. So, in what we do, so in our work, so we prove this fiber square, which is a slight refinement of the fiber sequence, in particular applies to fiber sequence. And so we get this fiber square essentially using the description of Tc given by Nikolaus and Chola. Of Tc given by Nikolaus and Scholze. So using the description of Tc via Nikolaus and Scholze. And then after that, the main ingredient is basically bookshed theta. So the calculation on ch H of F B. So from there, one can recover this fiber squared directly. This fiber squared directly and recover this result. And so finally, I should say what this has to do with motivic filtrations. And here the idea is somehow somehow. So you prove this fiber square. This is proved using TC and using THH of FP, you prove this natural fiber square. And then now you go back to the definition of the motivic filtration on TC that On TC that I explained earlier in this talk, the definition by Bob Moran Chaltza, which is that it's a Posnikov tower in the quasi-syntomic topology. And now you observe that everything here is a sheaf of spectra in the quasi-syntomic topology. So by results of Papmore-Russia, this is actually a pullback diagram of sheaves of spectra in the quasi-syntomic topology. And well, you can look at what that does on homotopy groups, again, in the quasi-syntomic topology. And well, what that does is that it tells you that there's a relationship between the homotopy groups of this and the homotopy groups of our mod. And then finally, we use the fact that the Z P of I's are completely understood in equal characteristics. So finally, let me just say that the idea of the peak of the earlier results is basically consider this pullback square consider this pullback square which is constructed topologically as sheaves of spectra and take Posnico filtration. So it's not hard to show, but basically by some evenness that every that it's actually a pullback square of filtered spectra And then you get a relationship between T C of R of the great pieces of T C of R and of R mod P. And for R mod P, we sort of know things pretty explicitly, and then you can just work with things actually. So I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much for your question. Okay. So I have two questions. One is: do you have a version of this for frame spectra in the Hermitsmond? Well, sorry, so I guess this, if it didn't mean that this is true for any associated frame. I mean, sorry, this is a statement about cyclotomic spectra, ultimately. Going in particular. I mean, sorry, there's a version of the statement where you can put in a cyclotomic spectrum. And instead of taking R mod P, you would take a cyclotomic spectrum and you would tensor over T of change of that. Spectrum, and you would tend to that point. And then, yeah. So, this is true. So, for these motivic filtrations on TC, those seem to require that you're working with a simplicial community of brain rather than an infinity rate spectrum. So, whether it's possible, so some questions that are not, so one question is: what is the relationship between the, is there a sort of a unified way that you could get the motivic filtration on Tc, which also would give you the one on K-theory? And I think another question is. K-theory, and I think another question is: can you do it outside of some classical computative ranks? And my other question is: can you do something after K-1 localization? Well, everything here is going to be up to some, well, I think everything I explained is going to be up to some bounded denominators. So if you're in a setting where your spectra are sort of asymptotically K1 local, so they agree with their K1 localization in large enough degrees, then I think it will be good. And in general, well, in general, And in general, it would be nice to know for which p-adic rings is such Tc of R agreeing with its K1 localization and time f degrees. So that seems like, well, related to this, it would be an interesting problem. And it should be true in sort of the case of a regular ring. I'm not completely sure if that's, maybe that's not known, but maybe that is known. But it would be nice to have a GCP. Anyway, we could talk about that. Yeah, it was kind of curious about the relationship to. Here's a relationship to Selmer K there. Yeah, so I think that's not quite this is all in a for Chaotic, right? So Salmar C there is TC for definition. So the future is now. So do you like the Now, so he would like to be more chill because attendance exactly outside. Outside? I think the lobby area. But they will take the picture outside.
