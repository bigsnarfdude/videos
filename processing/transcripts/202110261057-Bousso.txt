On quantum singularities. I'm not entirely sure the title is the right title, but I'll tell you what kind of singularities, what kind of singularity theorem I'll be talking about. So just as a reminder, I think most of us don't think about singularity theorems most years. So I just want to remind everybody how singularity is defined in general relativity. It's defined as an incomplete time-like or non-geodesic. An incomplete time-like or non-geodesic in an inextendable space-time M. Inextendable just means that you didn't stupidly make your spacetime too small by removing some points. It's not a proper subset of another spacetime. And incomplete means that the geodesic reaches a place where you can't go further after a finite time. So if it's a time-like geodesic, a finite proper time, if it's an alt-geodesic, finite affine parameter. A finite affine parameter, and I've shown here some examples. So, this is a black hole formed by the collapse of the star, and then, of course, you have a singularity in the future. And this is a flat Friedman-Orbits-Walker universe, spatially flat, where you have a singularity in the past. And I'm showing a time-like and an algorithm in each case to illustrate what happens. You follow this back for a finite affine parameter, and bam, you can't go further, so that makes it incomplete. This definition is not perfect. This definition is not perfect. There are things that you'd like to call singular that this does not capture, but it is pretty good, and most importantly, it's something that you can prove. And that's, of course, what Penrose did in 1965. And he got a Nobel Prize for it last year, which I thought was wonderful. So let me just review Penrose's singularity theorem in some detail simply because it'll make it pretty easy to switch. It'll make it pretty easy to switch out a few key ingredients and then get to the new one that Arvin and I found. Okay. So bear with me while I review this theorem. And so here we go. So what we want is a outer trapped or outer anti-trapped surface, which I'm going to call T. In this example, this one here is outer trapped, and this one down here is outer anti-trapped. These are the same examples I was showing on the previous slide. A big bang. A big bang cosmology and a black hole with a bit of future singularity. Now, we're going to need the exterior of T to be non-compact. So what I mean by that is that T divides a Cauchy surface into two portions, the interior and the exterior. And I'm going to call the non-compact side the exterior. If there are two non-compact sides, I could have chosen either one to be the exterior, but I'm just going to exterior. But I'm just going to. Exterior here means non-compact. This side is non-compact. You can see it goes off to infinity. And similarly, here, so the pink part of the Cauchy surface is non-compact. And outer anti-trapped or trapped means that the null geodesic is orthogonal to T in the future, that means trapped, or going towards the past, that means anti-trapped. And outer means going towards this non-compact direction. Okay, so those null. Okay, so those null geodesics have to be contracting, more precisely, their expansion should be negative everywhere on T. We also want T to be compact. Okay, so that's the full list of things that we demand. Well, actually, it's not because we're also going to assume the null energy condition and global hyperbolicity. Sorry, so now I think I'm done with all the assumptions. And then you can prove with those assumptions that at least one. Prove with those assumptions that at least one of the orthogonal multi-designs in that congruence that makes T outer trapped or anti-trapped is incomplete. This is not quite how Pennell stated his theorem, but it's going to be a useful way to proceed. Now, how do you prove this? Okay, well, what we're going to do is we're going to consider the future of the interior of Of the interior of T. Let's just take a look at that here in this example. The future of the interior of T would be sort of this region here, right? You can see that it's bounded by the light rays that we're going to be interested in. So we're going to consider, in fact, the boundary of the future of the interior of T. Such a set is always closed. And the fact that T is compact, as we assumed, the surface T is compact. The surface T is compact, and we know that the expansion is everywhere negative on T. Well, because it's compact, it means the expansion can't approach zero arbitrarily closely. So we can rescale every single light rate. We can rescale the affine parameter so that the expansion is initially minus one. That's just for convenience. Okay. Now we're going to assume for contradiction that all null geodesics are in fact complete, that they don't run into a singularity. Don't run into a singularity. We can extend them to arbitrary affine parameter. In which case, we can define a set in the space-time, the set curly L, red curly L, which consists of all the geodesics that are going to be reached, sorry, all the points that are going to be reached by null geodesics up to f in parameter two, away from L, excuse me, away from the surface T. So that curly L, let me show you an example. If T were a sphere in Minkowski space shown here. were a sphere in Minkowski space, shown here as a circle. And this is the exterior, the brown part here is the interior. The boundary of the future of the interior is this orange surface L. So curly L would be a subset of that, right? I'm only following the geodesics up to affine parameter two. So it's shown in red here. Okay, so that would be an example of these. So that would be an example of these two sets, regular orange L and red curly L. However, it's of course different from our setting in that in this example, the expansion away from the surface T is positive. But there are clearly no problems here otherwise, with any of the assumptions that we've made. In this case, where the expansion were positive, we would not have a contradiction. Since indeed, all those analogy. Since indeed all those null geodesics are complete. So you can't extend them to lambda equals 2 and beyond. Now I want to incorporate the fact that theta is in fact negative on t, and that's going to give us a contradiction. So to do this, I'm simply going to invoke the famous classical focusing theorem of general relativity, or Henrose invoked that. I mean, I didn't do anything here. So since the expansion is initially Since the expansion is initially negative, the null energy condition means it can only become more negative as we keep going along the light rays. And you can prove that there has to be a conjugate point, meaning that the neighboring light rays have to sort of intersect each other, roughly, at or before lambda equals two. That's why I chose two. Now, fact about the boundary of the future of a surface. Of a surface is that, or of a region, interior of a surface, is that null geodesics that generate this boundary of the future leave the boundary of the future at or before any conjugate point. Could also be before because there could be non-local intersections, but certainly at a conjugate point, those light rays leave the boundary of the future and enter the future proper. This is an example of this, right? This is a light ray that goes through a conjugate point, and after that, it is actually in the future. It is actually in the future of the interior of T. Notice that I had to switch exterior and interior to a counter-intuitive labeling in order to show you this. If the exterior were truly non-compact, you wouldn't expect this kind of thing to happen where the light rays all intersect each other and close off. And that's precisely where the contradiction comes from. So mathematically, the way you show that there's a problem is that, well, we know that L is closed. L is closed. I think I never quite said this, but it's important that curly red L is compact. It's compact because it's the image of a continuous map from a compact set, namely the surface T cross a closed interval, into the spacetime. So curly L is compact. Orange L is a closed subset of a compact set, so it's compact. And so now we know that orange, yeah, so now we know orange L is compact. Yeah, so now we know R intel is compact, and then comes a slightly more elaborate argument, which I will not review in detail, which tells you that there exists a homeomorphism consisting basically generated by a family of time-like curves that you can pick that maps L to the exterior of T. And now we have a contradiction because the exterior of T, by assumption, was supposed to be non-compact, but the home. Compact, but the homeomorphism wouldn't mean that it has to be compact. Okay, so that completes the review of Penrose's theorem. I mean, the upshot is that with the assumptions that one makes in the theorem, these light rays have to, in some sense, close off. And that's like saying that a non-compact Cauchy surface can evolve into a compact blank, which is impossible. All right, so now what Arvind and I did was to generalize this theorem by switching out some key assumptions. And I will, it's maybe not immediately obvious why this is a generalization, but I'll argue that it is, in other words, that it does include Penrose's theorem as a special case. And then I'll illustrate what things it can do that Penrose's theorem could not have been applied to. Theorem could not have been applied to. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to remove this non-compact assumption. I will still call the relevant side that we're thinking about the exterior of T, even if it looks kind of like an interior, just for continuity here. So we're going to remove this assumption. And instead, we're going to assume that the entropy on one side of T, the entropy of matter on one side of T is greater than the area. side of t is greater than the area of the surface t divided by four times the Planck squared. And in addition, we're going to assume that the covariant entropy bound holds. So the covariant entropy bound states that the entropy on a light sheet coming out of a surface with area A cannot be larger than A over 4 GH bar. Okay. Now, before I show what to switch out in the proof to get this Show what to switch out in the proof to get this result. Let me just explain why the Penrose theorem is arguably a special case of this. So suppose that I have a situation where the exterior of T is non-compact. Now, there's a priori no reason why the entropy in the exterior of T should be very large in that case. Let's take a look at one of these pictures here. So, this was the classic sort of application of Penrose's theorem. The exterior of T is not. Theorem, the exterior of T is non-compact, but look, there could be no matter here at all. But since it is non-compact, I can add matter to it far, far away from T in an asymptotic region. With arbitrarily small back reaction, I can add an arbitrarily large amount of energy. I can just put like really long-wave photons somewhere very far away. And so I can always create. And so I can always create the kind of conditions that will make our theorem applicable without changing the metric, or while changing the metric by an arbitrarily small amount. But if our theorem tells us that there has to be a singularity, if there's a lot of entropy out here, that means there would have had to be one before we put all that entropy out here because the metric hasn't really changed. This is, of course, a physics proof, and I'm not claiming complete rigor here, but this is intuitively why I think the Penrose singular. Why I think the Penro singularity theorem should be regarded as a special case of the one that I'm presenting. Raphael, just to clarify questions. You first, Gary. Thank you. Non-compact doesn't mean infinite volume. Yeah, that's why it's a technical solution. But it doesn't have to have infinite volume for me to put an infinite amount of entropy there while changing the metric very little. While changing the metric very little. So, for example, if this is some sort of tube that gets very thin at large distances, I think I can still put modes that are very long wavelength on it. But I agree with your objection. Okay, I mean, you have a surface that can extend out just a little bit from the trap surface and just end, right? I mean, just it could be a space-time that goes out up to, you know. Space-time that goes out up to, you know, I don't know, a little bit larger radius and just stop there, right? You don't have to do that. I'm still assuming that the manifold is inextendable. Well, sorry. So, I mean, I was going to give my comment was related. So I was going to say specifically, let's do this in ADS. Okay, so that's a bit like what Gary said, except it's that there is a real asymptotic boundary. And Penrose's theorem doesn't quite apply, but you can fix it up so that it does. But I think what you just said is not true in ADS. I can't just put in arbitrary amounts of entropy outside. Yeah, well, it's also not close. Of entropy out there, yeah, but it's also not globally hyperbolic, so I know, but it's it's it's it's morally globally hyperbolic, it's enough globally hyperbolic that Penrose's theorem can be fixed. Well, my whole point is that this is a moral argument in the first place. No, but I mean, I mean, there is a rigorous version of Penrose's theorem in ADS, and I think that wouldn't be a consequence of what you said. Yeah, we will see in a moment that probably the right way to think about this is to simply take the union of the space-time and an arbitrary auxiliary. Of the space-time in an arbitrary auxiliary system, and to consider that auxiliary system to be part of the exterior. This is something that we've been doing a lot lately when we look for islands. And that's really the way that you can make that condition be true. But I agree with your objections, and this is, well, maybe I still oversold my argument by calling it a physics proof, but it is a heuristic argument. Let's put it that way. Argument. Let's put it that way. You could have replied a little bit by saying that you wanted your initial value surface to be complete. That would exclude some parts of the objections. Yeah, so I'm always assuming that T is Cauchy splitting. And that by Cauchy splitting, I mean that it splits a complete Cauchy surface in an inextendable space-time. Is that what you mean, Edward? Well, when you say the surface is Mean, Edward? Well, when you say the surface is complete, that would object remove the objection where it extends just a little bit. Yeah, that's I think that's well, that's what I was trying to answer to Gary. Okay, I may not have articulated it very well. But I think not remove ADS. Okay. That's right. Now, I mean, I think it's probably possible to put a lot of entropy out near the boundary of ADS without creating singularity if you stabilize it there somehow. Somehow. So again, I think the intuition is probably pretty robust that far away you can put a lot of entropy if you have a non-compact direction. But I'd like to, maybe we can all accept that this is not a completely rigorous argument, but hopefully also that it establishes some connection back to Penrose's theorem, which is really all I want to claim here. And as there are other questions, I'll move on. Oh, so I've stated the new theorem, and now I need to tell you how you prove it. And in fact, the proof is the same as the old theorem. I just have to tell you where you switch out the old for the new assumptions. So the previous proof established that the domain of dependence of L is the same as the domain of dependence of L. Is the same as the main of dependence of the exterior of t. This is this is, you know, we established this map, of course, which told us that since L is compact, the exterior of T is compact, but this map also tells us that they have the same information on them. But if they have the same information on them, they have the same entry just by. Just by unitary equivalence, these two slices. And since we've assumed that this entropy in the exterior exceeds the area of the surface T, that means that the entropy on the light sheet exceeds the area of the surface T. So we have a contradiction of the covariant entropy boundary. If, on the other hand, there was a singularity here that truncated this light sheet, then we would have no contradiction. So this is what resolves the issue. Some of the entropy in the exterior would. Some of the entropy in the exterior would just not make it, uh, would not register on the light sheet, but so go through the hole, all right. So, um what's more interesting than a new proof are some of the examples that this can be applied to. Okay, so let's again consider this collapsing star. Here's a regular Penrose diagram, and it's a sort of, I don't know, layman's book diagram of this situation. Situation. And what the Penrose diagram doesn't show, but this diagram does show, is that the area of the surface of the star becomes arbitrarily small as we approach the singularity, which we don't know yet that there's a singularity. Let's just pretend that we have data on this, on some Coursy slice that includes the star at a late time, so this slice. And we see, well, if I've chosen this time late enough, then this area is going to be smaller than the entropy of the star, which Entropy of the star, which is what I'm going to label the exterior for again, those historical reasons, of T. And of course, light waves going towards the interior and the future are contracting. And so all the assumptions of the new theorem are satisfied. But this is a compact region. So the assumptions of Penrose's theorem would, of course, not be satisfied with this region as the relevant input. They would be satisfied if we worry about this region instead. And we can also see very nicely how the singularity sort of saves the covariant bound. In fact, this is kind of an old insight. It's just that for some reason we never turned it into a rigorous singularity theorem before. So the light sheet L, if it were complete, would capture all of the entropy of the star. But since it's truncated at the singularity, it only captures some outer layer. And when you do the calculation, Captures some outer layer, and when you do the calculation, you find that the covariant mounts fine. So that's one example. Here's another example: bags of gold or monster configurations. So let's take this kind of spatial configuration with time-symmetric initial data. So the extrinsic curvature vanishes. What we have here are shrinking two spheres. I'm going to choose T to be one of those. So this is a pretty boring normal kind of sphere with. Normal kind of sphere where the light is going towards the exterior or expanding. Here it is again, and interior contracting. But then we're going to take a portion of Schwarzschild that includes part of the region behind the horizon, vacuum Schwarzschild, but part of the region behind the bifurcation surface, the bifurcation surface is here, and then include a portion of a closed universe filled with matter or radiation. And we can And we can, you can pretty easily see that you can always choose this to be an arbitrarily large region with arbitrarily large entropy. You can just put as much as you like here. And so you can satisfy the assumptions of our theorem with respect to both the past and the future directed light rays coming out of T. On the other hand, there are no trapped or outer trapped surfaces on this initial time slice. The surfaces are all normal or anti-normal. So Penrose's theorem can. Anti-normal. So Penrose's theorem can't possibly apply. Also, this is a compact region. So in this case, you predict the singularity both in the past and in the future, which, of course, when you then time evolve, you find is there. Okay, and the final example that I'd like to give is Desitter space. Well, we'll start with Desitter space. Desitter space, of course, is a vacuum solution. There's no matter at all. This would be the pen. Solution is no matter at all. This would be the Penrose diagram. Now, let's pick a very late time slice, much later than what is shown here on this picture, so that we can see it better. I do it kind of early. It's that gray slice. By the way, these wedges show you in which directions light rays orthogonal to some sphere are contracting. So up here, they're contracting towards the past. These are anti-trapped spheres. These are trapped spheres. These are traps. Here is these are normal with respect to the South Pole. These are normal with respect to the North Pole. They contract towards the North Pole. All right, so now we've picked a very late time, very large, exponentially large sphere. Recall that the sitter is, you know, the scale factor goes like the cosh. So it expands at an exponential rate up at late times. So this A is exponentially large, the radius of the sphere, the scale factor. Radius of the sphere, the scale factor. And now we're going to add a very low density of radiation to this sphere. So we can change the metric by an arbitrarily small amount at this late time. And we're going to consider T to be the hemisphere of this three-sphere. So it's an S2 that divides the three sphere into two equal halves. The exterior, well, it doesn't matter which side we choose, let's choose the left. Doesn't matter which slide we choose, let's choose the left. T is anti-trapped, so we have a light sheet going off towards the past here and towards this so-called exterior. So what we can do, right, is we can choose this slice to be as late as we like at fixed radiation density. The entropy on the hemisphere is going to go like the scale factor cubed. The area of the hemisphere is going to go like the scale factor squared. And so To squared. And so we can arrange for this to be a hyper entropic region, to be the kind of region that has more entropy than the area of its boundary. Then for the covariant entropy bound to not be violated, this light sheet here must be somehow truncated. So that in this case, the theorem tells us that there's a singularity in the past. What's interesting about it is that this could be in a very, very distant past, right? Because of the way that we can just. Because of the way that we can just add a small, very small perturbation to the metric. What happens, of course, is that as we evolve this backward, the energy density gets exponentially enhanced as we run time backwards. At some point, we have radiation domination over the cosmological constant, over the vacuum energy. And then this is just an ordinary radiation-dominated closed universe, which of course has a Big Bang. But it's interesting that this theorem can diagnose that from very far away. Away okay, so um, I started quite late, so can somebody tell me how much time I still have? Because I don't. I think we started about 10 minutes late, maybe. So let's say you can you can go till uh till uh uh 40, 1040 your time. Okay, that's including the QA, right? Yeah, that that's sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, that's sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. You're right. Yes. Sorry. So maybe, yeah. Let me keep going then. So I actually don't have a whole lot more slides, but one natural generalization of this result would use... So what I used so far is what you might call the classical covariant energy bound. It cares about the classical expansion of light rays. It uses another energy condition as an assumption. And we know. And we know how to go beyond that sort of thing. But we have situations, for example, when a black hole is evaporating, where the classical expansion is negative towards the future along the horizon of the black hole. And yet, you know, you'd still like to say that the covariant entropy bound in some sense implies the generalized second law in the sense that all the matter that went into the black hole should have less entropy than the area of such a late time cut of the horizon. Let me just draw that here for a moment. Let me just draw that here for a moment. You can see this. So let's take this cut of the horizon. The covariant entropy bound tells us, right, that, so the classical covariant entropy bound if this black hole is not evaporating applies to this light sheet. And it tells us that the entropy of the star that made the black hole is less than the area of the black hole that was made, which makes us happy. It connects with the us happy, it connects with the generalized second law. We can apply versions of the bound that tell us this for additional matter, it falls in later. But once the expansion is positive in this, sorry, once the expansion is negative in the future direction because of evaporation, then we can't do all these wonderful things anymore. And so we need something better. And the better thing is the quantum covariant entropy bound, which was Quantum covariant entropy bound, which was actually first found as a consequence of the quantum focusing conjecture. You just integrate the quantum focusing conjecture. But let me just state the bound as a sort of final conclusion. So these things here are supposed to represent Cauchy slices, two different Cauchy slices. This is a Cauchy splitting surface T. Let's call this the exterior. Let's suppose that the quantum expansion, in other words, the derivative not of the area, but of the Derivative not of the area, but of the area plus a quantum correction, the area plus the entropy, this object here, that that thing is negative. The quantum expansion was first introduced by Aaron Wall, who also first, by the way, proved a quantum singularity theorem. And I'll talk about the relation at the end if I have time. A different one from this. So the quantum expansion, suppose it's negative, then the generalized entropy by the quantum focus. Entropy by the quantum focusing conjecture, the quantum expansion can only become more negative as we go down, and so the generalized entropy has to be strictly decreasing. The generalized entropy of T prime and its exterior has to be less than that of T and its exterior. So that's the statement of the bound. And in the situation where you have sort of ordinary matter systems floating around, you can separate the generalized entropy into area plus entropy and rearrange terms. Entropy and rearrange terms, and it'll start looking like the bound that I told you about earlier. But this is more general, more powerful, because you can also consider, for example, these kind of evaporating black hole situations where even the sign of the quantum expansion isn't the same as the sine of the classical expansion. And oh, I forgot I had this slide. I didn't have to draw all this stuff. So, I already told you everything that's on this slide. So, never mind. Let's just generalize. Let's just generalize this further. It turns out that for this to be a maximally powerful statement, it's often convenient to consider the exterior of T to also include some other region, which need not even be part of the space-time, or it could be in the space-time, but far away and disconnected. And in this case, we're allowed to apply the statement when we bury, we don't have to bury both of these. To vary both of these surfaces, we can vary only one of them, and it still has to be true. So, the quantum covariant energy bound tells us in this particular setting that if the generalized entropy of the regions B and R together is greater than the generalized entropy of R, then this light sheet cannot be complete. Why? Why? Because the generalized entropy has to be decreasing along this light sheet, but in the end, this whole region just shrinks away completely and we're left with R only. But that would mean that we end up with a larger generalized entropy than the one that we started with. So that would be a contradiction. Now, to turn that into a singularity theorem, we can't. We can't use the classical focusing theorem of general relativity to show that this light sheet L has to sort of close up and be compact if the initial quantum expansion here is negative, as of course we're assuming. We have to use a more refined argument that's due to Aaron Wall and that he used to prove his singularity theorem 10 years ago, which tells you that if any light ray here continues to be lighter, If any light ray here continued infinitely far in affine distance, then the fact that its initial expansion is negative is a contradiction with a generalized second law. You basically could define a causal horizon that contains this light ray, and you can then show through some detailed argument that there will be a contradiction. What we take away from Aaron's argument is that all of these light rays again have to have Light rays again have to have finite affine distance while they stay on the boundary of the past in this example of B. Of course, we're still assuming for contradiction that they have infinite affine length, that they are not incomplete, but they have to leave the boundary of the past of L after a finite affine time. And then the rest of the proof goes through as usual. So the compactness of L is a contradiction with our other assumptions. Assumptions and so there has to be a singularity that cuts this off. So I will well, so this of course is a generalization of the previous result because in most of the examples that I showed you, all of the examples I showed you, the classical and the quantum expansion were approximately the same. But it means we can also apply to situations like if the Like if the region B happens to coincide with the interior of a black hole, it ends on the black hole horizon or somewhere near it, where the quantum and classical expansion are quite different. However, there is a puzzle, and I want to end with this puzzle. There's a puzzle in this particular situation here. This is a situation that's going to look familiar to those of you who have been fascinated by the kind of islands first discovered by Jeff Pennington and by Ahmed Al-Meri and Neda Engelhar. And Netta Engelhardt and Maxfield and Merolf. So, this is a classic island setup. We've extracted or we've allowed some of the Hawking radiation to reach null infinity. This could also be an exterior system. This could be boundary of ADS. I don't care. But we're past the page time. So, this is more. Yeah, this is a lot of Hawking radiation. We're past the page time. And we're asking about, well, Well, if we did the island, if we studied islands, we would be asking about what is the entanglement wedge of R. We'd find an island here which doesn't go quite exactly to the black hole horizon, but stops just inside, but looks more or less like this, right? Here, you can, if you want, forget this whole context, but just note that the reason why this is an island is that in the semi-classical calculation, the Hawking particles that arrive at R are entangled with particles R are entangled with particles that go through B, that are in the interior of the black hole, the Hawking partners. And so adding B to R creates an enormous amount of purification. The price you pay for that, for all that entropy to go down to zero, is this area, and that's the price worth paying after the page time, by definition of the page time. Now we have a situation, therefore, right? Situation, therefore, right, where the generalized entropy of Br is less than the entropy of the reservoir R. This is precisely a situation in which we have islands. And now we also have the situation since this black hole, since the generalized second law holds, the generalized second hole tells you that the entropy on these slices here has to be increasing, the generalized entropy. But these slices have the same generalized entropy as R and B together. Entropy is R and B together. So that means that the entropy of B R as I deform it down towards the past has to be, the generalized entropy has to be decreasing. So this quantum expansion is going to be negative. These are the assumptions of the quantum version of our theorem, but you can see manifestly there is no singularity in the past in this space-time. So we seem to. So, we seem to have a contradiction. Now, there, as usual, when there's a contradiction, there are many possibilities. Let's assume that we didn't make some stupid mistake with our mathematical logic. Then that means that one of the assumptions that goes into this theorem is wrong. The natural one to consider would be the quantum covariant entropy bound. But it turns out that you really get into trouble with things that you might care more about, like the generalized second law. Second law in this kind of setting. Another possibility that you might consider is there are some subtleties with cutoffs because these are very highly boosted surfaces. But I would point out that while it can be confusing to evaluate the generalized entropy on a slice that looks like this orange slice here, which is very highly boosted, this orange slice is unitarily equivalent to this turquoise slice. To this turquoise slice here. And the entropy of that turquoise slice has no funny boosts on it. The generalized entropy has to be, it shouldn't have any additive ambiguities, because it's a thing that we think corresponds to an actual entropy in a quantum gravity theory. Otherwise, these whole Eiland calculations, what is it that they would be calculating? So the generalized entropy on the turquoise slice is simply by global purity. It by global purity, the entropy of R. So I don't think there's any escaping the conclusion that we have a contradiction here. The final possibility that I'd like to, so we don't claim, and what I'm about to say now is not a claim of an answer that resolves this in any sort of definite and coherent fashion. But what I would like to point out is that both in the context of factorization puzzles, but more directly in the context of this semi-classical. Context of this semi-classical analysis, along with the island computation of the entropy, I think we've seen multiple hints that semi-classical gravity corresponds to some kind of ensemble. This is something that I've argued in two papers with Maria Tomasovich and with Liz Wildenheim. In this calculation, you start by computing the entropy of the Hawking radiation and finding it to. Of the Hawking radiation and finding it to be large after the page time, it just keeps on rising. Then you directly compute via essentially, well, via the RT formula or the quantum extremal surface formula due to Engelhardt and Wall. You compute the entanglement wedge. You're forced to include B because it reduces the entropy so drastically, and you find, excuse me, that the entropy is actually Following the page curve. And the way that you can try to make those two answers consistent with each other, one way to try to make them consistent with each other is to regard both of them as ensemble averages. Hawking's calculation computes the ensemble average of an outstate, which could give you a mixed state. And the quantum extremal surface prescription directly computes the entropy. The entropy follows the The entropy. The entropy follows the page curve in every unitary theory, and so it'll follow the page curve on average. If this is the right way to think about this kind of setting, and again, even in this context, we don't really understand how to get what kind of ensemble we would be talking about in settings other than a few special settings like SYK and random matrices. We don't even know what ensemble we're talking about. We don't even know what ensemble we're talking about, but let's just go with this intuition. In that kind of setting, if you evolve forward to the time that is indicated here by V and R, and then start anew and evolve backward with an ensemble, this initial state, this is like a state preparation of a mixed state because it's an ensemble of state, then it's not going to be time-reversible invariant, right? If you evolve forward with three different Hamiltonians. Forward with three different Hamiltonians, and then take this as a mixed state as input and evolve backward with three different Hamiltonians, they're going to be mixed terms. These mixed terms correspond to singularities, because if you run the data on this slice back with only the tiniest mistake, you're going to create a white hole as you go backwards. The data have to be just exactly right for you to recreate the vacuum here at the horizon. To recreate the vacuum here at the horizon. Because any mistake gets exponentially amplified as it's blue-shifted along the horizon. So, that's as far as I'll speculate, and I really want to emphasize that this is a speculation. The resolution of this puzzle may be a different one. Thanks for listening. Okay, let's thank Rafael for a good talk. We have a few minutes for questions. Um, does anyone have any questions? I'll ask a question. Okay, I'm just trying to get my intuition adjusted to the way you're formulating this result. So I think I heard you say that if there were no singularities, the entropy on the light sheet of the trap surface has to equal the entropy in the entire exterior to the trap surface. Is that what you said? Is that what you said? Yeah, so let me go back to. I had a few pictures which I think showed this fairly explicitly, like yeah here, for example. Okay, so I have so what happens if you're in, say, a cosmology, spatially flat cosmology, you know, and now you just put a black hole. Okay, so you form a trap surface, the entropy outside is infinite, or can clearly be made arbitrarily large. Now, of course, in the real world, it collapses and you get single. Real world it collapses and you get singularities and it's and it's not complete. But it's hard for me to imagine. I mean, so you know, the you have a light sheet for a while. And are you saying that, you know, if we just it could extend it a little bit further so that it didn't hit a singularity, it would have infinite entropy? Or could I add a page here? Good. Great. All right. So let me understand what example I have in mind. Understand what example you have in mind. Do you have in mind, for example, an open FRW universe? Yeah. All right. And now we're going to add a black hole to it. Yeah. Something like this. Okay. Does that look good? Yeah, that looks good. Okay. And now, all right. And now we have some trapped surface here. Let me make it red. Okay and now you're you're concerned about the fact that our are you concerned about the fact that our theorem applies to this non-compact meaning here so our theorem can't possibly be wrong right well I'm just I it's it's a it's a question of intuition here so I mean there's an exterior which clearly has a lot of entropy yes and now you look at the sort of the the Look at the sort of light cone, outgoing light rays from your trap surface. These ones here, right? Right. Okay. So there's some entropy crossing that surface. Yeah. And you were claiming, of course, that's incomplete, but you're claiming that if the singularity wasn't there and those light rays converged in some just a little bit longer affine. A little bit longer. The point is just that if they converge, they have to capture all. Converge, they have to capture all of the entropy that's on that side that we're worried about. But what about the asymptotic region? Well, I think it's easier to think about this example, right? So here, I can add, instead of applying our theorem to what is colloquially the interior, why called it exterior here, where it gives us some. Where it gives us something new, I could have tried to apply it to the exterior. Oops, what happened there? Let me try a different color. Can you see this color at all? Yeah, I think so. So let me try to apply to the exterior. This is where Penrose's theorem would have applied, right? And would have predicted the singularity along these light rays. Right now, as we discussed earlier, a priori, our theorem does not yet apply here, but it would apply here if I add a lot of entropy right there. And then it applies for the same reason that it always applies, which is that you can prove, assuming for contradiction, that all light rays are complete, you can prove that all of, you know, that this light sheet has to close off. That this light sheet has to close off. And then all the entropy on that side has to go through it. Of course, that's impossible anyway because it's non-compact, but I don't care about that. It's a contradiction. Okay. In the interest of time, I might just move to Daniel's question really quickly and then we should probably wrap up. I just wanted to comment on the last slide. I don't really think there's a contradiction here because. Really, I think there's a contradiction here because your theorem was proven in the context of Lorenzian semi-classical effective field theory, perturbatively coupled to gravity. And in that theory, the entropy of the radiation just keeps going up, up, up. So there's nothing wrong with your proof of the theorem. It's correct and it's not violated by the picture that you drew here. What you're trying to do is... No, I'm sorry, Daniel, I just completely disagree with that statement. Disagree with that statement. The very statement of the theorem allows you to consider regions BR, and in the semi-classical setting that we are operating in, it is the case that the generalized entropy of BR is less than the entropy of R. That's all that our theorem needs. Oh, I see. Oh, so you say you're, so you're, so you're not, why is T-Page relevant then? Sorry? It's not for the statement of our theorem. I was introducing it for pedagogical. I was introducing it for pedagogical reasons. Sorry. Sorry, you said that. Sorry, Daniel. First of all, I talked about the page time a lot because I wanted to connect this for those of you who have been studying islands, which is probably a lot of work. So that the setting would be immediately familiar. But it is also the case that this inequality that we need to hold for our theorem to apply happens to start holding after the page time. It's just true, right? It's just true, right? So it's true even if you don't assume that the radiation is purifying? It is true in the usual standard semi-classical analysis in which we do all of those things. Oh, so I see. It's true for the same reason that it's true when we do an island calculation, except I'm not doing one here. I'm not computing any bold phases. And Joe B or anything like that. I'm just doing the semi-classical analysis. Just literally a Hawking's calculation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I see. Okay. Oh, I see. Thanks. Yeah. All right. Let's thank Raphael again, and then we can move on to the next talk.
