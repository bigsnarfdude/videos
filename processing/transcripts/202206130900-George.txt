Pleasure to be with you all today. I do apologize for not being with you in person. I was very much looking forward to that. But as you can imagine, there's lots of things going on in getting the new center up and running. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Dylan George. I was recruited by Rochelle Walinski to come with a small band of folks to establish this new Center for Forecasting Outbreak Analytics at CDC. I was joined by Mark Lipsich, Caitlin Rivers, Rebecca Kahn, and Allison Kelly. And Alison Kelly in the initial group that came together to actually stand up the center, give it vision, and move it forward. And we were joined by an excellent team that was already on the ground at CDC, including Michael Johansson, who's, I believe, is there with you in the room, Matt Biggerstaff, Rachel Slayton, and Dan Jernigan. And so there's been a concerted effort to try to give mission, vision, and objectives for this particular center and how we actually can actually move. And how we actually can actually move the modeling to inform responses more effectively going forward. So to start off with the main objective, our byline here is better data, better analytics for a better response. And so if you don't take anything else away from this particular presentation, know that we are trying to advance analytics to bring together a much more robust and fast. More robust and fast evidence-based to guide response for a particular outbreak that's ongoing. And so the organization we're building is a response organization. We won't be doing science for science sake, which is important. Other groups are focusing on that particular effort. We are actually focusing on trying to do bigger, better, faster evidence base for using analytics and modeling to help move that forward. Modeling to help move that forward. So I just give you, there we go. So, since we've come on board, these are a handful of questions that we've gotten from the legislators in Congress, from senior leaders, either in the White House or in CDC or in other part departments and agencies within the federal government. In terms of thinking about, we're all asking the question right now: what is the summer going to look like? What is the end of the fall? Like? What is the end of the fall going to look like? How is BA4, BA5 going to impact what we're going forward? Previous discussions were on Omicron. How is that going to impact the different surges in terms of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in various geographies? And so how do we actually think about that? How do we forecast that? How do we actually then also systematically think about that in a standard sort of way? What impact does different sorts of epidemiological parameters have? Sorts of epidemiological parameters have on the spread and clinical severity of a particular surge. And then how much medical countermeasures in terms of diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics would be needed and how should we deploy them in different ways? These are all questions that, as you all know in the room, are modeling amenable. And these are going to be within the remit of what CFA is going to try to enhance going forward. And so, this is just a kind of a flavor. Forward. And so, this is just a kind of a flavor of that. This is a cartoon that we use frequently when discussing just the trajectory of an outbreak where it starts with circulation of viruses in animal populations and there's a zoonotic transmission to an index case in a human. It either goes, either dies out directly there, or it goes into human stuttering chains and dies out, or it actually is able to establish a human. Establish human chains of transmission that grow in intensity to either become a localized, a regional, or a global sort of outbreak going forward. And within this cartoon and the blue box below it, there's those green boxes. And those are just representations of different sorts of analytics that could be used to help either understand that there's something happening, characterize what that something is in terms of a What that something is in terms of a risk level. And then also thinking about what are the mitigations or interventions that would be useful in actually stopping or mitigating what's going on with that outbreak. This, the blue box is a representation that there's a bunch of analytical tools that can be used at different stages to answer questions across that range of the outbreak. CFA is going to make that box bigger so we'll have a bigger toolbox and improve the quality and efficiency. And improve the quality and efficiency by which we use each of these independent green boxes and how we can actually make them move at speed and scale to help decision makers in a response. So that's a little bit high level and cartoonish for this group, but it is kind of the, it gives a general overview or general kind of drive for what we're trying to accomplish. Now, what is the proposed value proposition of what we're trying to do here? Of what we're trying to do here. In the early stages, what we're going to be focusing on is trying to make sense of uncertainty in the early stages of an outbreak. It's like, again, is something happening? What is happening? How do we actually understand what's the available data on the various parameters associated with any particular model? And how do we bound that uncertainty so that can help us think through what's going on? Can we then take that uncertainty or those parameter sets and then put them in either into forecast scenario models? Either into forecasts, scenario models, or other types of analytics to help us get a vision of what could be happening over the next rule or probabilistic statements of where we see the trajectory of an ongoing outbreak going to enable our senior leaders to understand and have a little bit more situational awareness as to what could be doing, they could be doing or thinking about going forward. And then also, this is actually very critical or very helpful for us to understanding what are the key data gaps that we need to go after. Apps that we need to go after to understand, to put into place something that's going on, to actually get that information so that we can know with more certainty and restrict that uncertainty going forward in helping. And then translate all of that information, both from the parameter estimations, the scenarios, the forecasts, and other analytics, translate that into guidance and communications with senior leaders and the public so that they can actually know how to act upon that information. How to act upon that information. So, this is the generalized value proposition of what we're trying to accomplish within the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. Incidentally, the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, we affectionately refer to that as CFA. You know, as with anyone that's in the federal government, you have to, at least within the United States, you have to come up with acronyms. And that's the acronym that we chose to represent what we're doing here. Doing here. That's the value proposition. Now, how are we actually going to execute on that value proposition in the early stages? Well, we are organizing ourselves into three main functions or three main divisions within the center. The first one is what we refer to as predict. Second one is inform. And the last one is innovate and technology. And so I'm going to go through each one of these in terms of what. Through each one of these in terms of what they're doing, how they're going to function, and how we're going to build them up. So, Predict. Predict is the engine for getting better data and analytics to help devise a better response. And so, we will be building a world-class data science team within CDC to generate forecasts and analyses that will support response efforts. We will also be devising and working. Also, be devising and working very closely with teams that are going to be putting out efforts to collect key data to address these response priorities. And we will be working with other departments and agencies within the federal government, state, local, tribal, territorial health officials to make sure that we're aligned in the analyses that we do. Incidentally, we will also be working with international collaborators and partners on developing this effort. Developing this effort. In addition to those areas as well, we will be finding a way to work more efficiently and effectively with the academic community to make sure that we are aligned with what's going on. And that'll come in as well in the innovate function. So the main goal here is generating the insights, the analytical insights that can be useful for understanding what is either happening, the risk characterization of it, or the kind of understanding how it could be mitigated. The kind of understanding how it could be mitigated going forward. So, this is the data science team. So, there's a couple planned in the early stages, the products that we're thinking about developing right now is what we're referring to as forecasting and now casting capabilities. And these are probabilistic statements based on quantitative sorts of numerical forecasting capabilities. And you've seen these already through some of the great work that, like I said, Matt Viggerstadt. Matt Viggerstaff, Michael Johansson, and a handful of others have been spearheading going forward with the flu forecasting, dengue forecasting, and a handful of others. We will be actually moving those, bringing some of that capability in-house to actually, and then facilitating that the submissions from the academic community can continue to come into the CDC going forward. Another sort of product that we're going to be talking about is scenario analyses. And so these are going to be models that are going to help us do very Models that are going to help us do very detailed sort of thought experiments as to what's going on forward. So, you've probably already seen some of these out there in the world. I mean, IHME has been doing some of these, the scenario modeling hub has been doing some of these. And really, it's not necessarily a probabilistic statement of what will be, but it's a way for us to think about lots of uncertainty, potential policy implications on how to interact with that uncertainty and help guide thinking in a much more systematic way on how to move things forward over. On how to move things forward over months in the case of COVID, where the probabilistic statements beyond several weeks don't make as much sense. And then, you know, trying to get a better, the last bit is like trying to get a better understanding of the natural history or the parameter estimations, you know, the incubation period, the cereal interval, the generation time, things along those lines. And a lot of thinking before COVID is that you could make these estimates once and then just go on your merry way. But as we've experienced with COVID, Way, but as we've experienced with COVID, these have to be an ongoing effort. And so we need to be ready to be able to actually support that ongoing effort in different areas. And then, as we all know, with any particular outbreak, there's going to be kind of the question X or the issues that are going to be coming up on a range of topics. And these are just a couple of the bullet points here that we're going to try to think about where we get persistent questions on how do we use vaccines effectively? How do we estimate vaccine effectiveness? Same with therapeutic. Estimate vaccine effectiveness. Same with therapeutics. How much testing do we need? Where do we need to locate it? How should we close borders or should we not close borders? Should we change the way that we're doing some sort of masking guidance? These are sorts of persistent questions across many different sorts of outbreaks. So we need to figure out how to actually support the range of questions that would be coming in those areas. And so generating analytical teams around those particular questions will be something that we'll be working on as well. And then, of course, like Working on as well. And then, of course, like I said at the top, though, too, that there's going to be this question X. There's always going to be questions that you can't anticipate going forward. So we will have an ability to kind of come attack bespoke sorts of questions that senior leaders will be asking us and that will be coming during responses as well. So these are kind of the early stage planned analytical products that we're going to be supporting and building out going forward. So one of the So, not only have we been trying to build the organization, we've also been trying to help out with provide insights in ongoing outbreaks. And so, you know, back in right around Thanksgiving last year in the United States anyway, we all saw the sort of notices of what was happening with this new variant, this Omicron variant that was coming out. We quickly gathered our team internally within CDC. We brought together a handful of We brought together a handful of external academic supporters to help us think through what is happening with Omicron, what is the risk associated with it, and look at the South African data in a much more robust way. We were able to, among with a handful of other colleagues, actually bound the uncertainty associated with it in thinking about the transmissibility versus the immune evasion that was happening. That was happening and it was evident within those data, and to try to think about what that uncertainty would indicate. And we were able to put together a couple different scenarios that were helped us think through what was going to be coming later in December or into the January and February. All of those sorts of efforts made us very uneasy as it was showing that we were going to have a big surge and it was going to stress out the healthcare system in a significant way. Another similar effort in helping us. Effort in helping us do that was how severe was Omicron infections versus Delta infections. Our colleague Mark Lipsich was able to find researchers in Kaiser Permanente Southern California and working with Berkeley that fortunately we already had a working relationship with them. We already had researchers that were looking at these data and we already had a contract that CDC had established and Kaiser Pernance Southern California was already using the S-Gene dropout failure. Failure assay that could actually distinguish Delta versus Omicron. So we could actually discriminate between who was infected with what and then track them to their clinical outcome. This particular paper that was put out, it's actually not just a pre-print anymore, but it's actually been out there where Joe Linward is the main author on this. But we were able to actually use for the first time US data to discriminate between the U.S. data to discriminate between the Omicron and Delta sorts of variants to look at clinical severity. And that, with understanding the transmissibility and the clinical severity, that helps us have two significant components to understand how that's going to impact the healthcare system. So this is just an example of something that within our small but mighty team, we were able to actually provide insights to the incident commander, to Rochelle Walinski, and to the White House in the early stages of December to help them peer around the corner. To help them peer around the corner as to what was potentially going to be happening going forward. And so that was as we were trying to walk and shoot gum at the same time, provide insights, and build the organization. This was one of the things that we were particularly proud of in as we built that out. So that's Predict. Inform is another group with another division within the CFA that will essentially be communicating, understanding and communicating. Understanding and communicating the insights, the analytical insights that the predict division is developing, and translate those to decision makers in a more effective way. This is an explicit recognition that risk communications in a fast-moving environment, particularly in an outbreak setting, is very challenging. It was challenging before COVID. It was challenging before we lived in a misinformation, disinformation sort of situation that we find ourselves now. That we find ourselves now, but it is hard. So, we're dedicating about a third of our effort on improving the communications on the analytics so that decision makers can actually absorb the information and know how to move forward. So, what this we will be building a team that will be focusing explicitly on this function. And so, the people that we're looking for for this team are people that have an understanding of modeling, have an understanding of epidemiology, and have an understanding of what can be done or the possibility. Can be done or the policymaker's mindset. And so, being able to integrate across all those kinds of skill sets and being able to communicate effectively is something that we're looking for in building this team. So, we're looking to be able to share timely and actionable information, not only at the federal level, but at the state and local level as well. Many times I talk about this in terms of the 10x value proposition of CFA is that if I can go and make sure that Rochelle Walinski. And make sure that Rochelle Walinski has the information that she needs to guide the response in a particular outbreak scenario. That's the 10x value proposition. We know that we can improve things there and we know that we can help the CDC advance some of the capabilities in that space. But to be quite honest, the 100x value proposition is if we can do that same sort of function, but with state and local leaders, mayors and governors in the United States context, and help them do this. And help them do this and supercharge their responses in a significant way. And so that's why we're focusing on building out this particular inform team as well. So within the inform team, we're looking for people that have visualization expertise, have worked within the interagency, have worked with state and locals, and know something about the CDC and modeling and are good communicators across. And they are good communicators across the board. One of the things, like I mentioned, the 100x value proposition of CFA is this idea of being able to work with state and locals in a much more effective way. And so we are sharing examples of products and tools that we're already developing and that we're trying to think through and that we've been using for COVID, for the acute pediatric hepatitis situation, also for monkeypox. Also for monkeypox. And we're trying to work with and set up a handful of listening sessions with state and local jurisdictions to understand how these particular products could be used and what is the value of them and how we can make sure that they're hitting the targets going forward. So this is something that we're really excited about on trying to work with state and locals. And we're doing that within CDC as well. But that's a particularly exciting sort of effort. Sort of effort. Within Inform as well, you know, one of the things that some of the early successes in Inform was trying to do this, like I'd mentioned previously, about this early evaluation of the Omicron surge. You can see on the CDC website, we were able to put out some early scenarios that were developed in November, late November, to understand what was going to be happening across January. And we were able to put that on the CDC website, get some information out very quickly. And like I said, we have. Out very quickly, and like I said, we had a substantial amount of briefings within CDC, within the White House, to make sure that senior leaders were aware of what's going on. Quite honestly, we need to get better at being able to push that information out to the public so that it can be scrutinized and it can be used more effectively going forward. And that's something that we're working on going forward. So, that's predict, inform, and now innovation and technology. Innovation and technology. So the innovation and technology division is going to be focusing on along the whole, as Don Burke describes it, the information supply chain of collecting, aggregating, cleaning, sharing information, then analyzing it, visualizing it, communicating it, and creating decision support tools. That information supply chain, we need to improve our capabilities across the board. The first place, a sister organization within CDC is focusing more on the collection and aggregation. Is focusing more on the collection and aggregation and sharing aspects. CFA is going to be focusing more on the analytics, the decision support, and visualization and communicating of efforts going forward. We will be spending research and development dollars to improve the whole stretch of the effort going forward. We want to collaborate with academics, with private sector to create these sorts of efforts going forward. And one of the things that we're particularly focused on is creating these translational tools. On is creating these translational tools and what we're referring to as test beds, working with local, state, and local jurisdictions to actually do that. And I'll talk a little bit more about that going forward. So some of the initial work that we've been putting out, again, thanks to the significant work of Mike Matt and Rachel and Dan Jernigan. We hit the ground running because of the work they pre-adapted for us coming in. They were able Coming in, they were able to set up a handful of partnerships funded with academic partners at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Utah. And they're focusing on a handful of things, improving methodologies, thinking through how to do the informed function, and then also expanding and upskilling various public health workforce. And so, we're really excited about a handful of things that are going on in that space. We have these two really interesting sorts of engagements as well with the National Science Foundation and with the Department of Energy to. Foundation and with the Department of Energy to respectively try to push out, engage the academic community in a time of crisis, to push out grants very quickly through them, and then also to fund a couple of the initiatives that they're working on for looking at pandemic intelligence as well. And then lastly, the Department of Energy is trying to think through how to use their advanced computational power and some of the skill sets that they have developed internally to think about how do we. Internally, to think about how do we create the next generation epidemiological modeling capacity going forward. So, we're very excited about some of this initial work that we pushed out resources to support. And more of that is going to be coming in this space as well. I did want to take just one moment, though, to talk briefly about this kind of critical data collection. And I'd mentioned it kind of in the value proposition earlier on, but it is a clear recognition that we do. It is a clear recognition that we do need to have a capability to go get information about an ongoing outbreak. And we're working how much CFA will support, how much CDC more broadly will support, and how much new resources do we have to request to enable this function is still being worked out. Excuse me. But we are committed to understanding how to develop targeted studies to answer key questions on transmissibility, viral kinetics. Viral kinetics and a handful of other issues. We spent some time working or talking with our colleagues in the United Kingdom at the Health Security Agency, learning from them about their real-time assessment and community transmission study. And also the Office of National Statistics did a COVID infection survey where they were actually either sending up random samples to the UK or they were set up a random sampling of households in the respective studies to actually. In the respective studies, to actually do repeated sampling of those individuals to understand what the community transmission of COVID was happening. And there was an amazing, rich data that was coming off of that. We're trying to think through how we would actually translate those kinds of studies into the United States and how that would help us in different areas. And so we're very excited about thinking that through and that's moving forward. And we're also establishing different partner relationships with long-term care facilities, with pay providers, and a couple others to think through. A couple others to think through how we can actually acquire and do this data critical data collection in a targeted way going forward. So that's an area that people should pay attention to. There'll be opportunities in the forward going forward. But also, if people have thoughts on how to actually enable that, we would be very open and eager to chat with you about that. I did mention that we are in the innovate function, we are very interested in establishing what we refer to as test beds. Now, we probably need to come up. To as testbeds. Now, we probably need to come up with a better name for that, but that's the kind of name that we're using right now. And fundamentally, what the testbed idea is within Innovate is to try to think about how could we understand novel data sources, new methodologies, analytical methodologies, different sorts of visualizations or decision support frameworks, and embedded in a context of public health use cases. And so, have people that are coming up with different innovative ways of doing all of those. Different innovative ways of doing all of those with a public health jurisdiction and then design, build, and test those and iterate with the locality or the state jurisdiction to see what is useful, what isn't useful. And so we're trying to set up some pilot studies to actually see how well this could work or not work and then adjust accordingly. And like I said, it's like we want to think about novel data sources, novel analytical approaches. Novel data sources, novel analytical approaches, and novel visualization or communication to enhance one's jurisdiction's ability to actually come to decisions and mitigations of outbreaks much more quickly. And so we're anticipating that we're going to have a pilot study out soon, and then we're also going to have a call for people to participate in that sort of effort in the coming months ahead. So we will definitely make sure that people are aware. Will definitely make sure that people are aware of what we're supporting in that space. I did want to take just one mention, though, too, is that because pathogens don't respect borders, why would they? Because they're just constructs that we've put on a piece of paper or on a geography. But we are going to be engaging internationally with a handful of folks. These are the ones that we've been most actively engaged with. Again, we're a small but mighty team, so we have a little bit of bandwidth issue. A little bit of bandwidth issue as we pull on our team. But excuse me, we are actively engaged with in discussions with the WHO Pandemic Intelligence Hub in Berlin. We talk repeatedly with our colleagues in the UK Health Security Agency. We just recently started talking to the Public Health Agency Canada and a handful of other folks that are standing up similar sorts of CFA-like. Similar sorts of CFA-like efforts, and in particular, just recently, some of our colleagues in CDC South America have been very eager to try to stand up some sort of regional sort of discussion amongst ministries of health in South America. And so we do anticipate that we'll be working internationally as well, but those are in the early stages right now. I'll just skip that slide on DMI. One of the things I did. One of the things I did want to highlight as well is that the center will be physically located. I mean, we've been working remotely for almost the past year. And so I think that that will continue going forward as we all try to understand what is the future of work and how we actually work remotely or in person. But the physical location of the center will be established in the DC area. We will be working very closely with our colleagues at CDC Atlanta. In fact, I was just in Atlanta. I was just in Atlanta two days ago. I spent a lot of time in Atlanta, but the physical location will be in DC, and we're looking for physical space right now. This is the last slide, and then we can stop and see if there's any questions, jokes, or anything you want to throw at me in terms of this presentation. But this is a slide that Jeff Shaman gave me a long time ago and put me onto. And essentially what it is. Ago and put me on to essentially what it is: forecasting skill for numeric weather forecasting on the y-axis, on the x-axis, it's time in decades. And obviously, you see a monotonic increase in forecasting skill over the decades. And the question becomes, it's like, what enabled that increase in forecasting skill to happen? Well, it was the federal government spent a lot of money on data, on computational power, on modeling teams, on different use cases, and linking that all. And linking that all together and sustaining that funding through time. Now, the question then becomes: it's like, where are we in this space thinking about what we could potentially do for outbreak response? Well, we're practically, we're probably back in the 60s and 70s in terms of forecasting skill and analytical capabilities. Now, the reason that I left the private sector to come and help build the Center for Forecasting is: one, I believe that Rochelle Walinski is kind of a transformative leader. Is kind of a transformative leader. Two, I think that there's resources available and there's a clear mandate for moving this forward. And most importantly, I believe that we can make this for disease forecasting and outbreak analytics, we can make a similar sort of increase in capability over the next handful of years going forward if we have a good plan, a targeted effort, and the resources to actually enable it going forward. And so that's why, like I said, I left the private sector to come back to the federal government to help build this. Help build this and make sure that we were on a trajectory for success, not only for to keep Americans safe, but to keep all of us safe from outbreaks and make them less of an impact, both in terms of mortality, morbidity, but also economically, so we can go forward. I will stop there. It is an absolute pleasure to be with you all today, and I look forward to having a discussion with you as time permits. Thank you very much.
