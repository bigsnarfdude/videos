So we are very happy for our next tour to welcome Frédéric Robin from the Université de Lorraine, who is going to speak about the Hardy-Schrodinger operator on the point carriable compactness, multiplicity, and stability of the possible obstruction. Please, Frederic. Thank you, Jean, for the introduction. I realize that I gave a very Realize that I gave a very, very long and somehow misleading title. I mean, you have a hardy operator, well, that's fine. Poincaré ball, so perhaps you expect to see some geometry. Well, compactness, I will not discuss compactness finally, but stability I will do. So, what I'm going to do is to study some kind of Some kind of partial differential equation who has some origins in geometry, it is in the hyperbolic context, for which we could observe a nice phenomenon that I want to share with you today. So this is a joint work with Nassif Gusoup from UBC and from Saikat Mazumdar from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay. Okay, so let's see. Okay, so let's see. Okay, I'm going to consider first the Poincaré ball, a model for the hyperbolic space. That is, you are taking the ball, okay, no surprise, of radius one, of course, and you endure it with the metric, which is a multiplication of Euclidean metric times the coefficient. of Euclidean metric times the coefficient 2 over 1 minus x square. So as you can see here, your metric is blowing up when x approaches the boundary. Indeed, with this metric, your ball here is becoming a complete space. So you have a geodesics that blow up at infinity. So first we are interested We are interested in Hardy inequality in this context. Okay, Hardy equality. First, let us see what's happening in the classical Euclidean context, and then we are going to try to extend this to the hyperbolic context. I like to see the Hardy inequality of the Hardy inequality, the Hardy potential as The Hardy potential as a particular potential that is making some quantity, some Lebesgue norms, invariant. Okay, if you're looking, just look here at the Diracle norm. It's not difficult to see that if you make this transformation here, you multiply u by mu x, you multiply then the multiply then the resulting function by mu to the power n minus two over two well you get it's a very very easy computation I did not put the domain for some good reasons that the L2 norm of this transformation of your function u the L2 norm of the gradient that is J energy is equal to the L2 norm of the function itself okay so you have some Okay, so you have some invariance. You have a functional that is invariance under this transformation. I mean, okay, in general, people first look at what's happening in dimension n is equal to 2, which is the only case where you can get rid of this term here, when you just want u of mu x. But if you want to generalize events. If you want to generalize, then you have invariants. But when you want to generalize to any dimension, then it is necessary to add this coefficient. It's corresponding to some conformal things. Well, what you notice is that there is some L P norm that is also invariant. So you can simply compute what is the norm that is invariant. It's the L P norm when P p norm when p is equal to two star two star being two n over n minus two well uh i told you that i wanted to see the hardy potential as something related to this kind of invariance you can also observe that you if you put the hardy weight one over x squared in front of squared in front of u squared, so you compute the integral of u squared over x squared, then it is also equal to the integral of the initial function. So if you make your transformation here, you have several quantities that are invariant, the L2 norm of the gradient and also the L2 norm of the hardy rate. Well, more generally, if you want to take other inequalities, Other inequalities with a weight. L P norm with a weight. For instance, take this one. The L P norm divided by x to the power s. It's also a straightforward computation to see that it is invariant under your transformation if and only if your exponent p has the following relation with s. So it's 2 n minus s over n minus 2, but I will use again. That I will use again several times later. Okay, that's the underlying idea to have similar properties for the Poincaré setting. So this is some work now that is due to it's not written. Oh, I'm sorry, I did not write this. Is all this what I'm doing here? Well, I've got some problems with going. I've got some problems with going from one to the other. Okay. So, all this here is due to sun dip and tint type. We wanted to generalize this to the high parabolic setting when you take the ball with the metric that I gave you, that is blowing up on the boundary. You that is blowing up on the boundary. Well, there is a good, some good things and some bad things here. If you have a very strange transformation, which is this one, okay, it's not so strange after all. You take a function that is radially symmetrical, you see, you take a radial, I put it in blue, from the ball to itself, you take a map G. You take a map G from R to R, which is defined as above, I do not detail it. And you make this transformation here. So here again, you transform your radial variable into another variable. You multiply by mu, you apply g minus one, and then you get that the Dirichlet energy is also invariant under this. Is also invariant under this transformation. So, this is originate, this is, these are some roots in some conformal geometry and some conformal transformations. So, what you have here is that the L2 norm of the gradient is preserved when you change your function u and you write the transformation u mu. Okay, let's try to do this for the LP norm. The L P norm, so as it was in the Euclidean setting, then okay, it's not difficult, but it's a bit boring to compute. If you're looking for a potential Vp such that the L P norm of U with a weight V P is preserved with this transformation, U mu, then, okay, you can take, of course, Vp is equal to zero, but essentially you have. But essentially, you have just one candidate, which is this one. Whatever's the expression here, okay? The important thing here is that this exists, and you know how this behaves. So, if you take P is equal to 2, you take that your potential here, V2, V2 is essentially 1 over X R squared. This is x squared this is your uh potential your hardy potential so you have something looking like u2 over x2 if you're taking two star s which was what i was interested earlier then you get that v two star s is more or less one over r to the power s so if i'm going back to the preceding page Preceding page, you see that, okay, you don't have this with x squared, which does not really make sense in our setting, but you have a potential looking at one over x squared here, and also a potential looking at one over x squared when you take p equal to n minus s over n minus two. Okay, so you have a nice reasonable, I would say, setting. I would say setting. We can go even further with the analogy because here I did not, I just discussed some equality. I did just some, I mean, some Lie group analysis. You can write some inequalities because some deep anti-type prove that you have a Hargi inequality. So remember that my V2. My v2 here is behaving like 1 over x squared when x is going to 0 times a nice coefficient which is exactly the same that we have in the Euclidean setting and minus 2 squared over 4. It's less than the anti-norm of the gradient. Good. We also have the same thing with the subole F inequality. If you take the classical Sobole F inequality, the L2 star norm to The two star norm, two star being 2n over n minus 2, so it's with s equals 0 here. You have the control of this norm with the v2 star, which is smaller than this one. And you can interpolate, you can get some nice things. And you have this hardy subolef inequality telling you that the L2 norm of two star with the With the weight v2 star, which is essentially one of a distance to the power s, is controlled by the electron of the gradient minus gamma times u squared times the hardy potential. Okay, so you have something that is quite similar to what's happening in the Euclidean setting. I will go again to this a bit later. And if you have If I'm taking back my inequality here that I circled in purple, okay, when you divide this term here, here, this term by this term, you have a very nice functional bounded from above. Well, more generally, take the blue functional here. So, for the numerator, I take the The numerator, I take the gradient, the L2 norm of the gradient, the Giriclette energy, minus gamma times my Hardy potential times U square. I subtract some lambda U square to look at something comparable to Brussels-Nienberg. And I'm dividing by the L2 star norm times V2 star. V2 star being my kind of potential, which is one over Rs. Take the critical points of this function. Critical points of this functional, they are essentially up to a constant solution to the equation, the red equation here. So here it's looking very like some problems in Euclidean thinking, in particular by the thing that was studied by Brazis and Nirenberg. You take the Laplacian, here it is the Laplacian with With the hyperbolic metric, the Laplacian of U minus lambda u is equal to u to a critical power. Okay, you have a PDE. Let's ask some basic question. Do you have solutions to your PDE? Okay, and do you have more than one solution? I will be mostly concerned with the existence of solutions. Of solution. Okay, all this here has been written in the framework of the hyperbolic space. Well, since you have a conformal invariance, I mean the hyperbolic space is nothing but the ball here with the metric which is conformal to the Euclidean metric. You have some nice formulas in the conformal setting so that you get Setting so that you get that's your problem. The problem I wrote just on this slide here, the red one, if you make some transformations that I will not detail them here, you get something like this. The red equation, which is number three, I don't know why. You have minus Laplace V minus, so your function v times. Your function v times gamma over x squared, you have a hardy potential here, that's fine, plus a perturbation h is equal to you have something looking like one of xs times another kind of potential b of x. Okay, so I'll start with the blue one. I mean with your perturbation with our perturbation here, h h. So it's H. So it's coming from the geometric setting here. And here is what you get. So, what is funny or not is that you have very, very different situations. So, if you are taking high dimension, if you are in dimension larger than five, well, H is a continuous and even C one functions, that's good. Okay, it's con it it has a limit value at zero. It has a limit value at zero. When you're in dimension four, when you make your computations, H behaves like one of a log. And when dimension is three, H behaves like one over the distance. Okay, that will be a thing that we'll have to deal with. Sorry. And concerning B, what is nice in this kind of analysis? This kind of analysis is when B is smooth, continuous C1, C2. That is the case in dimension larger than 5. Okay, when the dimension is larger than 5, your function B is C2. It's not anymore the case when you are in dimension 3 and 4. You can get that, okay, it's C1 in dimension 4. It's C1 in dimension 4, but it's not C2, it's C11. But you know how this quantity x, scalar B of X, is behaving. Okay, that's not too bad. Similarly, in dimension 3, you are not even C1, but you know how XB of X is behaving. It will be enough for our For our analysis later. So, what you have here is a problem with nasty potential here, H, and another potential B that could be better. Okay, so let's see, let's consider now more generally, the same problem that I considered in the hyperbolic setting. Uh hyperbolic setting. Let me go back. So, if you take this problem here in red, I do my transformation and I'm transforming these questions here to get seven up. The same questions. Do we have solution to this equation if you take a potential edge here that is behaving, okay? That is behaving. Okay, it's a little abusive. Okay, I just want to tell you that it's behaving like one over x to the power theta. That's all. And also in the C1 norm. I also want to know if there is a solution and if there is more than one solution. So here you see that I just wrote a perturbation of my conformal invariant problem, just a perturbation. Conform just a perturbation lambda u, a linear perturbation. But when you have, you are going back to the Euclidean setting, you somehow lose all this geometry and you have a perturbation which is not very nice. It's potentially very single. Well, I'm not going to discuss all the issues, all the methods that you can use for this, but if you take here, But if you take here, if you take instead of the exponent two star, get rid of it and take u to the power q you take u to the power q with q less than two star of s. Then there are some reasonable assumptions. There are some reasonable assumptions to answer positively to all these questions that I ask here. Why is there this? It's because your set here, HQ, the set of solutions to this problem, it's compact and it's not empty and it has some nice properties under perturbations. I mean, you know the You know, as soon as you have compactness, you have many existence. So it's the simplest result. You take a continuous function on a compact domain. You know that there is a minimizer. So sometimes you have a critical point. Okay, you have some more sophisticated theorems, in rational methods, of course. And with this more sophisticated theorem, you can get solutions to this problem. When you are subcritical, that is, when you lose, you lose the control. You lose the conformal invariants that we used earlier. But in the general case, you don't have such compactness. At least you could not. It's because you have an intrinsic invariance of the equations. So at the beginning, I wrote some equation in the hyperbolic setting. Now, I'm going to write a transformation. I'm going to write a transformation in a more simple setting. More simple setting, but which is going to be a good model for the SQL. If I'm transforming my function u, like I did right at the beginning when I considered Rn, I multiply my variable by mu and to get invariance of Diracle energy, I have to Of Dirichlet energy, I have to multiply by to the power n minus 2 over 2. Then the nice thing, and there are some geometric reasons for that, is that your equation is also going to get invariant. So the equation I had written here in blue, if you are writing with UMU, you are getting This new equation. So, what do we get? Your domain is changing, you have something that change. This potential here, this potential here, your domain, and you have some things that do not change. Okay, let's look more precisely. precisely at this okay in blue you have the things that change so globally your equation with this red transformation your equation is invariant if you just consider the laplacian the hardy potential uh the potential here for the hard disable f setting so this were the quantity Quantities that had some geometric meaning, some invariance at the beginning, but the perturbation H here and the potential here B, they are changing. So you lose the invariance. And you also lose the invariance because of the domain. Because since you had made a dilation of your domain, your domain is becoming R minus 1 mu. It's dilated. Okay. Okay, what is becoming your function, your potential h? It's r square h of rx. So you look here that, okay, it's almost the same, but it's not because theta is less than 2. So r2 minus theta is something that is counting. So it's essentially invariant, except because of this thing, H, this thing, B. thing H, this thing B and the domain. This is why perhaps, despite you are not in a setting where things are supposed to be compact, perhaps you are going to get something nice and to recover compactness. Why do I want compactness? I want compactness to get solutions to this problem as I did in the As uh I did in the psychological case. Okay. Well, uh should be at nine. Okay. Well let's look a bit more about this. I moved away from my geometric model. Okay. At the beginning I was considering the ball. So for the ball you have zero in the interior. You have zero in the interior. Now I consider a domain that will contain the origin or not. So when you have a domain containing the origin locally, I mean you can see this on the picture. So I hope you will be able to see. I hope. If you have a domain omega here, you take an interior point here, zero. If you are looking, you are focusing here around this point. You do not see the boundary. So around this point, it's looking like Rn, the flat space. But if you are looking here, Here, on the boundary point, locally looking like a half space. And this is going to be the difference. I will mainly discuss where just perhaps at the end, I will discuss a bit about the boundary point. But for the moment, I'm going to be concerned in this point and we'll see what. To be concerned in this point, and we'll see what's happening when you are on the boundary. So, there are several, several references about that I mentioned here. They are a bit less when you are concerning the boundary domain. Okay, now what are the existence results? I don't want to detail I don't want to detail all the existence results or the methodology for this. Just be aware that if you want to get solutions to your equation, minus Laplace U minus gamma u square over x u over x square minus h u is equal to u to the critical exponent. It's a good way to find critical points for these functionals. These functionals, so via some variational methods. You have a theorem, so the origin essentially is in Oban, is in Trudinger. It's something very classical that was used in the resolution of the Yamabe problem that was studied by Resis and Neinberg. If you have infimum of this functional that is strictly less than the infimum on the model space. On the model space here, when zero in the interior, your model space is Rn, when zero is on the boundary, your model space is a half space, then you get solutions to your problem. What's the idea? You take extremals on the model space. You take extremals on the model space. You take extremers on the major space and then you're looking, you're modifying them a bit, you are truncating, you are concentrating them and you're looking at what's happening on your space here with the functional, with your function. Then, to achieve the inequality, so you make an external expansion, you have some local. You have some local and global arguments. When you are in high dimensions, it's a very known phenomenon, then the expansion here is going to involve only local terms. But when you are in low dimensions, you have some global arguments. Here is the result you can get. So it was something we proved. So it's really a So it's really a consequence of many, many earlier results. When you assume that zero is on the boundary, when you are assuming that the limit of x theta h of x is positive when x is going to zero, and that, okay, gamma is strictly less than this value here in blue. Don't look at gamma. Don't look at gamma, look at n. It is telling you that n is sufficiently large. Sorry. Then, in large dimension, you have a local condition under which you get the inequality. And so you get solutions to your problem. When you are in small dimension, you must introduce another object that is called the mass. The mass. I will discuss the mass earlier. You must be aware that the mass is defined in Lao dimensions and it is a geometric quantity that is global. I mean, if you change a bit your domain, I mean, if you're looking here again, the big difference with the mass in small dimension and large dimension. dimension if you take large dimension large dimension l which is sufficiently big then if you take your domain omega you make a perturbation of omega it does not change your It does not change your condition. You only need h of x is looking at something positive divided by x theta. You have a condition that is purely analytic, independent of the geometry. Now, if you take small dimensions, the condition you ask that the mass of omega is positive. Is positive, and it's going to change if you make a perturbation here. You change a value. Okay, it's quite continuous, you do not change it too much, but it is really an essential feature here that the condition does not depend on the geometry here. Here, it depends on the geometry. And this is going to be the first step towards the definition between small and large. Between small and large dimensions. Well, okay. Okay, I discussed the mass. I did not tell you what the mass is. There is a first remark to do. My equation, so let me go back to my equation that I forgot a bit here. Forgot to hit here. My equation is minus la plus u minus gamma over x squared. u minus h u is equal to u two star s minus one over xs in omega. Well, let us just look at this equation on RL and let's suppress this. Okay, you just look at this. Okay, you just look at this and try to find some solution to minus la plus minus gamma x squared x minus alpha is equal to zero. Well, it's a very simple computation to get that you have a solution if and only if you have this value. You have this value for alpha. It's really simple, no big deal. Well, Matthien to Voitempa? Well, you can get under some coercive activity assumption, I do not go into this, that if you take any solution to this, to this minus la plus h minus gamma of x squared h minus small h times capital h positive solution to this problem then there are not many i mean they are all uh there is unique existence and uniqueness up to multiplication by a constant and if you are in low dimension so here see look i just ask that the That the dimension is small enough, then you can prove that the function h can be written as something divided by x alpha plus. You know the first solution to your problem above here, first solution with alpha plus, plus something divided by x to the power. Divide it by x to the power alpha minus plus a remainder term. Okay? It's okay, sometimes it's possible in some larger context, but here for any H here, it's possible as soon as you have gamma like this. And then remember that you have uniqueness of H up to multiplication concern. This is how you're going to define the mass. Well, if you are you know you have heard of the mass in the case of some elliptic PDEs, namely in the case of the for instance the Robin function just look at the case advocates n equal theta gamma is equal to theta equal zero our inequality here when gamma is equal to theta equal zero amounts to n is equal to three and then what I wrote here this coefficients they amount to write something like that here Here a coefficient times one of x minus x0 plus another coefficient times one. I mean, alpha minus is equal to one and alpha plus is equal to no, alpha minus is equal to zero, alpha plus is equal to one. So if you are familiar with the Robin function, this is exactly plus or minus r of x. R of x0, the lobin function. Okay, so if you know this, just be aware that it is simply a generalization. Now, if you are more interested in relativity, you have that this via some transformation, via some conformal mappings, it's amount to consider the mass on a manifold. Well, okay, now. I have given you some existence results at the beginning. It was number 12, I guess. Number 12. I gave you situations for which there is existence. Existence of minimizing type solution under these assumptions here. Well, if you are looking at non-existence, you have a At non-existence, you have a famous obstruction result. Sorry, which is the proposed F identity. I'm not going to detail the proposal F identity, just be aware that it's related to the conformal inference I had at the beginning. When you take the Gibraltar energy, you look, you know that it's invariant with u, mu, with the transformation, you different with respect to mu, and this is what you get. And this is what we get here. If you take solutions to our initial problem, well, you have many things that cancel out. And you get this. This that I wrote in red. If you have a star-shaped domain, then the scalar product X with the outward normal vector is non-negative. So everything here. So everything here is non-negative and potentially n positive at least somewhere. And if you assume that this is negative, then you get a contradiction. So this is the result of Pod saying that you have no solution to this equation, equation I wrote here, positive solution with Diracle boundary condition, if you have this condition OP. Okay, so here is now a situation in which we know So here is now a situation in which we know that there is no solution. What I would like to get is that if I make a small perturbation of my problem, do I still get no solution? It's not clear. I mean, take the function H0, for instance. Take a constant function H0. If you make a small perturbation taking a positive constant, Taking a positive constant, this inequality is not satisfied anymore. So, because you have a large inequality here, and the main case, the most interesting case is when it is equal to zero, then you make a small perturbation. It's not a solution. You cannot verify this. Okay, let's look whether this condition you can get the non-existent. You can get the non-existent, so you can't preserve this inequality, okay? But you hope to preserve the non-existence. Well, here is... Just to let you know that we are close to the end of the time, if you want to leave some time for the questions also, but you can take a couple of minutes to conclude. Five minutes is the total time we have, including questions. Okay, we have including questions. I thought it was 45 including questions. Okay, I thought it was 45 plus 10. Ah, okay, okay. I'm very sorry. I was about to send you an email to ask you. I should have. Well, here is our result. We prove that if you satisfy the inequality that we had for the obstruction and if you have in if you And if you are in loud dimension in this sense, just remember that n is small enough, then if you make a small perturbation of your potential in some sense, okay, just make a perturbation in some sense, you still do not have solutions. So if you have in small dimensions, the non-existence is preserved under small perturbation. Perturbation. This is absolutely not the case in large dimensions because when you are in large dimensions, you have solutions as soon as your parameter lambda is positive. So this is a very central definition, very essential phenomenon. You have read the difference between large dimensions. Large dimensions where at some point you have non-existence, you make your perturbation, you have existence, and small dimensions for which you keep the non-existence stable. So what's happening in the hyperbolic problem, you have the same phenomenon. Essentially, you have this. Because you are going back, because this was my problem at the beginning. Remember that I had some potential. I had some potential that was a bit different. And you have a similar result with this problem, with the hyperbolic problem we had at the beginning. So I just have, okay, one minute to discuss how this is proved, which is the most interesting thing, by the way. You argue by contradiction. And by contradiction, if you take If you take a family of solutions to the problem, you assume that you have a family of solutions to your problem, and you make the transformation that I had done earlier at the beginning here. And here, here is the transformation that you get. The nice thing here is that you can prove that your function, your family of functions, they are going to blow up. They are going to blow up. You have a singularity that is forming, and this singularity is perfectly known. And we know it very precisely from the integral point of view, and more important from the pointwise point of view. And then we're using again the posite identity. Well, there is some terms to compare, and this is where the small dimensional occurrence. But I clearly have no time to tell this in one minute. Okay. Thank you very much, Frederic. Is there any question from the audience? I have one question, Frederick. You mentioned many, so you generalized many results from many important results to this context. Context. You mentioned the pods have identity too. Are you aware of any barycorrant type existence of redon? Maybe in the case S equals zero? For the case, in the singular case, with gamma of x squared, there are something that should be working, but no, there is an essential problem in the brain. Essential problem in the Barycoron to adapt the Barycoron thing. When you look at the transformation, what is my transformation? Here, this one that is keeping everything invariant. Okay. There is something that you have also that is for the L-to-norm of the gradient. And for this, you also have. You also have the invariance via translations. So you can make transformations with n plus one parameters, mu and x in Rn. In the Baricoron problem, where you have some topology, the key to use some topological method is that you can have another parameter here, x. Another parameter here, x0, for the translation, and you take some x0 on a ball, on the sphere, sorry, on the sphere, and you construct a retract. But this is because you have the inverse of the problem with this transition. So here, you just have one parameter, so it does not work. Okay, perhaps there is if someone is doing something like this, it's with completely different methods. Here's a basic topology, it's not going to work. It's not going to work. I see. Thank you very much. Is there any other questions? Seeing none, let me thank again very much, Frederic, for this nice talk. And I will stop the recording.
