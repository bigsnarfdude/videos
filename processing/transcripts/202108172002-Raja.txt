Our next speaker is Raja from the Indian Statistical Institute in Bangalore. And Raja will speak about group actions and power maps. Please go ahead. So thanks for the invitation. And it's a very difficult time. I know that, but it's with so many different time zones. Thanks to the organizers for organizing this. For organizing this workshop. So, I'm going to talk about power maps. When the power maps are subjective or dense using group actions, so let me just start with some abbreviations. So, locally compact group, locally compact, only the topological notions are abbreviated. LC and totally disconnected. And totally disconnected, locally compact would be abbreviated as TDLC. For a locally compact group G, an automorphism of G would always mean, we will always be assuming them to be bicontinuous, decontinuous, that means it's a continuous and its inverse is also continuous. I hope I am audible. So let me know if there is any issue in audio. Yeah. So now let's just introduce, let me just say what is group action, what we meant by group actions. So for me, the group action would mean that given two locally compact groups, action of G on X, one acts on the other, it's clearly written as G on X. It's clearly written as G on by automorphisms. So I'll always assume that action is by automorphisms. That action is a continuous map given on this direct product into X such that if you fix a G, then the map from X to X, you get a map from X to X. That map denoted as φ G is an automorphism of this group. That means it's continuous and the inverse is continuous and so homomorphism. Is continuous and so homomorphism. So for each g, you get a automorphism of x, and that gives you a map from g into automorphisms of x. That map has to be homomorphism. So there is no continuity assumption here, but continuity assumption on this joint continuity assumption on this direct product. So usefulness of this group action, we'll first explain that one. Explain that one. So let's just look at a few examples. The first one is: so we are only going to look at examples that are going to be useful for this talk. The first one is suppose we are given a continuous finite dimensional representation of a locally compact group over a local field. Local fields are fields that have some locally compact topology. There are not too many of them. There are not too many of them: R, C, Q P, and Lorentz series over finite fields. Then, using this such a representation, one can define action of the group G on this vector space via this map, the linear transformations. Each G is a linear transformation, so the action is through this linear transformations, and these type of actions are known as linear actions. The second example is: there is no extra things. You only have a locally compact group and take a closed subgroup from there. Then you get the H to act on G via the inner automorphisms. Via the inner automorphisms, this map. So, through inner automorphisms, H act on G for any closed subgroup. That is the second example. Third one is if Third one is if one has a closed normal subgroup of a G, then G acts on H, then G will act on H by inner automorphism. So here you need this addition, one needs the additional condition that it is a normal circuit. So these are the three examples that we will be using. I think only few ones will be used. I think the first one will be the important one now. These are the These are the examples. So, next, the important thing about the crucial thing about the group actions by automorphism is that using this given action on X by automorphisms of X, one can construct a new group, so-called semi-direct product. So, that idea is useful. We will see that one later on. Or you can just take Or you can just take for general constructions, one can just take C G to be a locally compact group, subgroup of automorphism of X also for the semi-direct product construction. So you have a semi-direct product of G and X. That's what we are going to define the notation as this. This is simply the Cartesian product of G and X. But the multiplication is not the coordinate-wise multiplication. On the first component, it is the same. Coordinate wise multiplication. Is the same coordinate is multiplication, but in the second coordinate, you have a small twist that the first element is the same, second element will be what is transferred by the first element of this G. So, this is a small chain here. That's a semi-direct. I think almost all of you will be familiar with these constructions. I'm just recalling because it plays a crucial role. And a few other interesting things about the semi-direct product is that it is. This semi-direct product is that it is also a locally compatible. The semi-direct product is also a locally compatible. And you can identify G and X, this two different groups, G and X, as closed subgroups of this group. That means, given two groups with this condition, you can form a new group on which these both of them will be subgroups. And particularly, X would be a non-group. Particularly, X would be a normal subduce. So, this identification is the natural identification. This is an easy way to define the identification. And the X here would be the space, the group on which the action is taken, taking place that becomes a normal subject. So, now we'll go to the more serious tasks. So, we'll first look at TDL signals, that means totally disconnected, locally compacted. That means totally disconnected, locally compact groups. I may just simply say totally disconnected groups and scale functions. So, G is a totally disconnected, locally compact group. And this course G is the set of all compact open subgroups of G. So, I'm going to recall a few results of Williams from his first paper on tidy subgroups, 1992. Most of these results are from this paper only. are from this particular only so this is the first one is about scale for each automorphism for each automorphism alpha of the group g scale of alpha denoted by s of alpha is defined through this this definition is not the original definition but for simplicity i'm taking this definition so that definition will require five four or five lines so to make it a single line statement this was proved a little later on that scale is the minimum of this Scale is the minimum of this index. This is the index. So, if u is a compact open subgroup, then alpha u is also a compact open subgroup. The intersection is also open one more time. And u mod this one will be a discrete space, but u is compact. So this is going to be finite for every compact open subgroup, this is going to be finite. And the minimum will exist. So that is the result. And that minimum is called the scale of alpha. Minimum is called the scale of alpha and the compact open subgroups that attain this minimum are known as the tidy subgroups of the automorphism alpha. So the existence of tidy subgroup is done in 94 and this one is done later on. I suppose I'm correct here. So now we look at some properties of the scale. So before that this is defined for every automorphism, but it is also defined for every automorphism. But it is also different for every element of the group. So identify each element with the corresponding inner automorphism. Then the scale of G scale of an element is the scale of the corresponding inner automorphism. So scale can be defined not just for automorphism, it is defined on the group also through the inner automorphisms. So G is actually has a map from G into autop G. So use that map to identify to define. To identify to define scale on G, then we have the following three crucial properties that are crucial for today's power. So theorem is also from Willie's 94 paper. The scale of the automorphism and the scale of its inverse are one. That happens if and only if this alpha fixes a compact open subgroup. So that you can easily see from here this definition. See from here this definition. So, this is one condition. Then, the second one is scale of the iterates of alpha is the iterate of the scales. So, the scale is a function from automorphisms to the set of natural numbers. Set of natural numbers. Set of natural numbers one realizes as a multiplicative semi-group. Then, this scale is not a semi-group homomorphism, but for iterates, it retains that. Iterates it retains that property. So, this property one, I will come back to this property. Now, the scale of S is continuous on the group G. So, when you take this definition, the scale is continuous. So, this is done by showing that you see the image, the values are taken in a discrete state. So, to show continuity, it is good enough to show that it is locally constant. So, that is what is done. It is remains constant on the cosets of the Remains constant on the cosets of the tidy subgroups for G. If U is the tidy subgroup, then on U G it is constant. So S is continuous on G. So now coming back to the second property, scale of the iterates is the iterate of the scale. This one, while proving this, Willies has observed that this may contain some information on the roots of the elements. So the hint is given here. One here. Let's see how this is useful for our purpose. So, let me just define power maps. So, that is the main discussion of this. So, we consider totally disconnected locally compact groups. For any integer k greater than or equal to 1, define the kth power map pk to be g going to g to the power k for every g. So, this is the For every G. So, this is the kth power map. Now, since G is a top locally, it's a topological group, this power map is a continuous function. Now, our aim is to find structural conditions that would be necessary or possibly sufficient for power maps to have dense image or subject. If it has subjective dense If it has subjective, then it is dense image, but sometimes dense image and subjective may not always be the same. So, are they the same? That is another thing. So, we are interested in finding some structural conditions for power maps to be dense or subject. So, in this sense, we first recall the previous observation that I told you: that iterate of the scale is scale is. Of the scale is scale of the iterate is the derivative of the scales. So, this is done as a corollary in that paper: that if G is a TDLC group and if this happens that there is some k nth powers of some elements g n converge to g, there is no a here. This is wrong. And so, this is a small mistake, so I will just ignore that. So, I also request you to ignore this. And if kn tends to infinity, so we need this kn to tend to infinity. It's not just one power. It is some kn tending to infinity. As n tending to infinity, kn tends to infinity. Then you can claim the scale is equal to one. So, that is not too difficult to see using that property that iterate. Using that property that iterate scale of the iterate is the iterate of the scales. So, with that hint, what we actually proceed is that, so what we observe in power maps is that suppose the power map is as a dense image, then for any G in G using the continuity of this PK, we can find a sequence Gn in G such that this property holds Gn to the power. g n to the power k to the power n instead of k n it is k to the power n converging to g this will be for some g sequence g n in g so this would happen so by the previous result you get the scale of g is one that means every element is a scale one that is g is uniscalar that's another thing therefore what we get is that each g in g fixes a compact open subdue so each g in g normalizes a compact open subdue it Normalizes a compact open sublue. It may not, not all elements normalize a single compact open sublue, but each element normalizes some compact open sublux. But then this is not going to be enough. This is a condition that is true for abelian groups. It is a condition that is true for nilpotent groups. Nilpotent groups are uniscalar, and there are also various other uniscalar groups. Compact groups are also like that. Are also like that. So, this is not going to be enough. For instance, the integers, integers is a discrete group, it's a totally disconnected group, but the power map is far from being dense. So, this is not going to be enough. But then, this is the idea that what we are going to do is that now we have a group actions. That now we have a group actions. So, considering group actions, we obtained a following. It's a joint work with Arunwa Mandal and myself. If G as a BO, that means the totally disconnected locally compact group, with this property that the power map has dense image acts on some totally disconnected locally compact group X. It acts on some locally compact. Then each G in G fixes a compact. Each G in G fixes a compact open subgroup of X. So the proof of this won't follow like this one straight away because we don't have any continuity for automorphisms. We don't have continuity. So we cannot directly apply. So what we do is that we consider the semi-direct product of G and X. So there also this property will work. So the proof I have given in my article in archive. Article in archive. They are slightly longer because I didn't use this. I wasn't using this result. I did not use this result. So that's why proof is longer, but in the talk, I use this result. So the proof is slightly shorter now, considerably shorter, because this property is going to hold good in the semi-direct product also. So in the semi-direct product, also, this is going to hold. This is going to hold, and on the semi-direct product, the scale is continuous. So, using that, we can claim that each gene G fixes a compact open circle. So, this is where the semi-direct product is useful. So, when the power map is has a dense image, then on any action on any subgroup, we'll fix compact open subgroups. For each G in G, each element will fix a compact open subgroup. Element will fix a compact open subgroup obviously. This is a consequence for group actions. Now we are going to look at linear actions. So here I am going to introduce the notion that an automorphism of a locally compact group is called a distal. If E is not a limit point of any orbit, any non-trivial orbit of alpha, the identity is not a limit point. So that's a very simple definition. So, that's a very simple definition here. So, this is not a limit point. Then, you call the automorphism as distal. Now, here, if we look at linear actions, we have a following nice structural condition for linear actions on distal maps due to points A and U Act in 1974. It's a very small paper. Very small paper uses a beautiful idea of Burnside density theorem. So, if you have a subgroup of GLV, V is a finite dimensional vector space over a local field. I have not said this here, but V is a finite dimensional vector space over a local field. Then the following are equivalent. Each alpha, each transformation acts on V is distal on this space B. Distal on this space B, and that is the same as saying eigenvalues of each of these transformations are of absolute value one. Now, there is a G invariant flag of subspaces. That means this is an increasing sequence of subspaces. This is called as a flag. I'm not making any assumption about the dimensions here. I only assume that the dimension is strictly increasing. So, there are no equalities here, all are strictly increasing. Strictly increasing such that all orbits of G in successive quotients are bounded. So, in other words, if you see as transformations on successive quotients, G will be contained in a compact group. G acts via a compact group. All orbits are bounded. So, this is a very crucial result that is done by Givas and Bohns in for the real case. And a similar idea was and. And a similar idea works, and it has been completely explained in addition. This is also true for any local field, also. This result also is very crucial for our case. So, now how does our situation fit in this case? So, in our situation, what we have is What we have is for a moment, I'll exceed from the full screen. I want to use my pain to do it. Now let me go to full screen. Okay, full screen modeling. So let me just put it here. So in our case, what we have is that each G fixes a compact open subgroup. K is equal to K and the K is a compact open subgroup of G. V. Now, V is a vector space over a local field, which is a non-discrete local field, local field of. So, we can find a sequence a n in the local field. If I call the local field as probably f, and I can find a sequence a n that converges to zero. Then g is a linear map. So, I will have g of. G of an K. So I'm trying to give a simple proof that this condition would imply that G is distal. This is known to people who are familiar with this topic because G is linear and A n is a scalar. I can do this. So now A n tends to 0. So as a result, this will go to Okay, so in some sense, this goes to zero. So G of A and K is also okay. So how do I say that? Okay, so what I wanted to say is that, so before going here, so let me just complete it here that this is equal to a n times k. So it not only preserves k, it preserves. preserves k it preserves a n times k also and this one goes to zero so if you have a x such that g n x converges to identity or here it would be zero because it's a vector space along a sub sequence so i'm not writing a sub sequence here original sequence itself if that is the case then this x would be in a and k for all m For all m now, but a n k converges to 0, so therefore x would be equal to 0. So any such g would be distal. Any such g would be distal. Any such g would be distal.  I'm getting the full screen mode. So now so this is So, this is so any such G that preserves a compact open subgroup of a vector space will be distal. So, that is one thing. So, this is where we are going to use that fact that G for linear actions, the transformation should be distal under our assumption that power map is dense. So, our assumptions are that B is a finite dimensional vector space over a non-Archimedean local field and G is a totally disconnected locally compact group. For which the power map is dense, and ρ is a continuous representation of G. So, using this representation, we consider the action of G on V and up time. There is a flag of subspaces with the associated unipotent group. I'll explain what this is. And a compact subgroup L of G L V such that the image of rho, rho, the G will be actually be contained in. G will be actually be contained in L times U under the flag is L invariant. So, let me just say what is a, it is contained in a compact extension of a unipotent group. G would be. Now, let me just say what is a group associated to a flag. So, flag is increasing sequence of subspaces. My assumption is that the dimension is strictly increasing. Now, given a flag like this, then we can define two subgroups. Then we can define two subgroups, H, which are the set of all linear transformations that preserve each of these subspaces. So, those are called flag-preserving linear transformations. Second one is that on successive quotients, they are identity. So, those are the unipotent transformations. So, U is called a unipotent group associated to the flag, and H is the invariant subgroup of the flag, and U is, you can show that it is a subgroup of H and each beta in H. And each beta in H fixes Vi. If you take an element from H, then they fix each Vi. So they can be treated as transformations on Vi. And if you consider the substitution quotients, these transformations are trivial. So that subgroup is normalized by beta. So E is actually a normal subgroup of H. That means that you can form a semi-direct product. Semi-direct product. So that's the idea here. One more time. Semi-direct product. The action of H on U is linear. U is a unipotent group. It's not a vector space. It's a unipotent group. Or just simply call it an impotent group. And it's a normal subgroup. So naturally, H acts on U via the conjugation, conjugating conjugations. Now, this action is is linear in the sense that you can find a central series for U such that the successive quotients, the successive quotients, each successive quotient is a vector space and H preserving each of these central series subgroups and on each of the successive quotients the corresponding H action on Ui mod Ui minus 1 is linear. u y minus 1 is linear successive quotients on u y mod u y minus 1 is linear so that is the meaning of saying that a group acts linear on a milpotent group so this condition about linearity is useful in the following one So, the previously we have seen the necessary condition for the density for linear actions. There will be a flag and the image would be contained in a compact extension of a unipotent group. So, is that clear? Okay, so now we look at the settings. We now look at conditions under which the power map is subjective. Previously, we give a necessary condition, we want to look at sufficient conditions. In our case, the following result is useful: LB are compact totally disconnected group and the NBN. Group and N be a Nilpoten group and N be a Nilpoten locally compact group. Suppose L acts on N and the action is linear over a field F. N is a general Nilpoten group. So success equations have to be vector spaces over the F and action of L on N is linear. Then in that case, if the power map is surjective on L, L is compact, so being surjective or having dense image is the same. Having dense image is the same, and this k is co-prime to the characteristic of f. Then the power web would be surjective on the semi-direct product also. So, this is a result of Doni and Mandel. So, this gives you a sufficient condition that if the group happens to be something like this, then you can obtain the surjectivity based on whether the map is surjective on L or not. Map is surjective on L or not and the action is linear. So this is a reuseful sufficient condition. So using this, we obtain the following. So you consider a non-Archimedean local field and a finite dimensional representation of G finite dimensional continuous representation of G over this non-Archimedean local. Of G over this non-Archimedean local field here. So, being the local field being non-Archimedean, it is totally disconnected. So, G is also seen to be totally disconnected. Suppose that PK is dense in G. Suppose some power map is dense in G, then we have the following. So, first one, we have already seen that it has a compact subgroup and a split unipod and algebraic group. That means that if you take the successive quotient of a The successive quotient of a central series, those are going to be vector spaces. This is not always the case for unipotent groups in local fields of positive characteristics. So we have to make a distinction in this case that they are split unipotent algebraic groups. And this group U is normalized by L. And one can further assume that L intersection U is trivial. And this image will be contained in the product L U. So previously, we only wrote that. So previously we only wrote that L times U, but here we will further assume that L intersection U is trivial. And by restricting, taking a smaller subgroup here, one can even claim that the image of Rho G is dense in L u mod U. So when you go mod U, the image would be densing L U. So that is useful because next one is we are going to say the power map is surjective on this group L itself. Power map is itself. Power map is surjective on this group L. On it being subjective on U is subject to this other condition that the K has to be co-prime to the characteristic of F. If K is co-prime to the characteristic of F, then you actually get that PK is subjective on L E. Now, once it is, that means the characteristic of F doesn't divide K. Suppose the characteristic P of F The characteristic P of F divide scale, then one gets that G actually acts as a finite group. G factors through a finite group. The action will be through a finite group. So that one can obtain that using the properties that in that case there is a local field of positive characteristic and the unipotent group will no longer be p-divisible. P divisible or any p power divisible, so that will go away. And the L contains some compact open subgroup that is a pro P group. So that will also be not K divisible. So using that, one can claim that rho G is finite. G acts through a finite row. So in case what we have divided, seen here is that your characteristic divides K, then you have a Take divides k, then you have a definite answer here that would be sufficient and necessary. And it's a very simple answer, perfect answer. Now, suppose the characteristic does not divide in K. So we will be looking at the case when the characteristic does not divide K. So in this case, it can be zero or positive characteristic also. So in this case, we will be looking at a residual characteristic. So residual characteristic Residual characteristic is the characteristic residual characteristic is the characteristic. If you have a local field K F then this F contains a lanising point. So let's uh So let's I hope people are familiar with residual characteristic and so many of them many of you would be familiar with residual characteristic. So it is the residual characteristic, it's simply that it is going to be the some prime number for positive for zero characteristic and it is same as the characteristic of f if the characteristic of f is positive. Considering the residual characteristic, we obtain the following. Following considering the residual characteristic, we obtain the following. Considering the residual characteristic, we obtain the following. If the residual characteristic divides k, then L would be finite and the rho of g is contained in a finite extension of a Contained in a finite extension of a split unipotent algebraic rule. So the L would become finite. That is the first thing. And the other one, when it divides K, when the residual characteristic divides K, there are two situations where the characteristic is zero, characteristic of F is zero, or the characteristic of F is positive. When the characteristic of F is zero, if you look at zero, if you look at the closure of rho of g, it becomes a finite extension of a unipotent algebraic rule. So, what the previous one says is it is contained in a finite extension of u. But moment you take the closure, it will be equal to l times u. It may not be the same u, u could be something bigger here. So, it will be for some other unipotent algebraic, split unipotent algebraic. So, if the characteristic half f is positive, then the unipotent algebraic group will no longer be there. No longer be there, and we will get this to be finite. So, this is further results obtained through considering residual characteristic. So, we also obtained many interesting corollaries. The first one is that any compactly generated linear group means Linear group means group which are closed subgroups of GLV over a local field of non-Archimedean local field for which the map PK power map is dense will turn out to be compact. So that mainly uses the property that in a unipotent algebraic in a unipotent groups, compact sets generate compact neighborhoods, compact subgroups, compact sets generate compact, any compactly generated subgroup of Any compactly generated subgroup of a unipotent group is compact. So, using that, you can claim this is compact. And suppose instead of looking at this local fields, we look at global fields. So, these are essentially rationals if the characteristic is positive. Otherwise, they will be some Lorentz series. So, this will be depending on whether they are character. Depending on whether their characteristic is positive or not, suppose H happens to be a linear group over E, which will be a discrete group, H will be generally a discrete group such that PK is surjective on H. If you get PK to be the power map is surjective on H, since it's a discrete group, dense is same as surjective. You will assume it is surjective on H for some K. Then if the characteristic is zero, then you can show. Characteristic is zero, then you can show that H contains an unipotent normal subgroup of finite integers. Unipotent normal subgroup here means that all transformations, all linear transformations in that subgroup are unipotent. So similar result in this direction is done by light chatter G in the periodic case, means that is the same as this case. If the characteristic is positive, then one can show that the group H is locally finite. That means any Group H is locally finite. That means any finite set generates a finite group. So, further, like that, we proceed if the characteristic of P of E divides k, then it's always the case that H is finite. It doesn't matter whether the characteristic is positive or not. When it divides K, it has to be positive. Sorry. It has to be positive. If it divides K, then H is finite. If P K is surjective. If Pk is surjective for all K, for all K, if it is surjective, then either H is a unipotent group or H is a trivial group, depending on the characteristic is 0 or positive. So this is like if you have a one parameter subgroup in a over a global field, then it would have to be either the unipotent group if the characteristic is positive, if the characteristic is zero, if the characteristic is positive. Characteristic is zero. If the characteristic is positive, then the one parameter subgroup has to be trivial. So, this is a for the periodic case, it is a well-known result. So, we get that result also, but you don't need a for all k for all primes, I think should be sufficient. So, these are the general results for linear groups. Then, we look at algebraic groups, then we look at things. Let me look. I think I have only a few minutes. We have look at algebraic groups. Assume that F is a non-Archimedean local field and G is an algebraic group defined over F. So algebraic groups are very closely like connected groups, particularly the p-adic algebraic case. So we look at that one. So now in this case, p-adic algebraic case of the result that we, p-adic algebraic case of this power maps as Of these power maps has been considered in Pralai Chatterjee's article. Now we'll state our results. The theorem is that in this case, there are two different unipotent radicals. Once you have an algebraic group defined over here over any character state, there are two kinds of unipotent radicals. One is the split unipotent radical, other is the normal unipotent radical. So we consider the split unipotent radical serves our purpose. So if the characteristic of F. So, if the characteristic of F does not divide K, then power map being dense is the same as the Power Mar map being surjective. Both are the same, and we also obtain that model of the unipotent radical, it is compact, split unipotent radical, the group is compact, and the power map is surjective on that quotient. So, these conditions are sufficient to get the power map to be surjective on a group G. So, all these three conditions are equal. Now, the other case is that. are equal. Now the other case is that suppose the characteristic divides k then the density implies that g of s is a finite extension of a splitting potential. If the characteristic is positive then g of f has to be finite. G of f is the group of f points that's a standard notation in algebraic groups. The other result is also about algebraic groups. If pK is surjective on the PK is surjective on the group of F points, then for any algebraic subgroup G defined over F, the power map is surjective. If H is a closed normal subgroup and there is a kind of stability result is also true. If you have the power map dense in a closed normal subgroup, this need not be algebraic on its quotient as well, then the power map will be subjective on the whole group. That is one thing. So the same thing like one parameter subgroup case. One parameter subgroup case, then either it is unipotent or it is trivial, depending on whether the characteristic is positive or not. And we have some more results this direction for co-compact subgroups and other kind of subgroups. So, this is the reference. This is a very restricted reference result. More detailed references can be obtained from our preprint. It's also available in archive, the version of this. In archive, a version of this is available in archive. Thanks for your attention. Thank you very much, Roger. Wuch for clap of hands. Does anybody have any questions or comments for Roger? If so, either speak up or put them into the chat. I have a couple of questions. I have a couple of questions. The theorem, I think the first main theorem you described, you talked about a group represented into GLD of a field where the group has a dense power map. Do you have any examples there of that happening? Examples there of that happening? Or the examples are really just the ones you talked about at the end? I haven't understood your question. So you had a theorem about a group represented into GLD of a local field. Or a local field. So that is either the Lie groups, the only examples that we know are. Examples that we know are Lie groups and closed subgroups of linear groups. And another one is this other compactification that for instance, Bumslak-Salita groups compactification through that listing compactification. So that has a representation into the unipotent groups. So these are the examples. I don't have any examples. Have any examples that is different from the well-known examples? Yeah. So, most of the groups you've considered are Lie groups or algebraic groups. Lie groups, algebraic groups, or any closed subgroup of GM. They need not be algebraic. Yeah. Right, okay. Thank you. I'm interested in this question. Okay, thank you. I'm interested in this question. I think this is an interesting question for other groups as well, because it's a very strong condition, actually. Supposing the power map is subjective or dense for any K, it would be interesting to have more examples or be able to show that they can't happen. Yeah, some more exploration is going on, but right now we don't have any uncreated answers. Yeah. Yeah. And Roger, can you say something about where the question of density or surjectivity comes from in the first place? Other than that it's a natural question. It is simply looking at an equation. So it is like if you assume subjectivity. It's like you are looking at an equation g equal to x to the power n. So I can write something and Something if you look at this equation g equal to xm. So when does this equation have a solution? Suppose if this equation has a solution for all g, under what condition this can happen? This kind of questions. And then there are general questions in league groups, in real league groups that when every element is the exponential image. Of course. Consider real League. So that is another direction. So, that is another direction. Yes, yes, all right. Yeah, that's a good analogy. All right, thank you. Any other questions or comments? If not, then I'm going to ask David to stop the recording for this talk.
