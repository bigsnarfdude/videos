Okay, I guess we can start. It's a pleasure to introduce Rubin Chang, who will talk about the structure of collapsing rich-flagged Kayler manifolds in dimension four. Okay, thank you for the introduction. And before my talk, I also want to thank the organizers for the invitation. Really, my great pleasure to speak. Great pleasure to speak. Today, I'm going to talk about some recent results on understanding the collapsing geometry of rich flat colour manifolds in dimension four or just collapsing hypercolor manifolds. To begin with, let's fix some basic notations. So, this notation lambda means the collection of all the Of all the isometry classes of n-dimensional Einstein manifolds, we've uniformly renormalized the Ricci curvature by lambda. Another notion, mat just means the space of all the metric spaces. Now, mat, it has a very natural metric structure, which is given by the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. That means for any two different metric spaces, we're able to define the distance between To define the distance between the two spaces given by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Basically, saying if the two spaces have very small Gromov-Hausdorff distance, that means the two species are almost asymmetric to each other in the matrixes. Okay, so given the two notions, there are a few foundational questions. So there's a quite a fundamental theorem by Gromov. This is called Gromov's This is called a Gormov's pre-compactness theorem, saying the space of n-dimensional Einstein manifolds is pre-compact in the space of metric spaces with respect to the Gromo-Hauslorf topology. Concretely, it means that given any sequence of n-dimensional Einstein manifolds with boundary-rich curvature passing to a sub-sequence, it has a Gromoff Hausdorff limit, which is a priori just a metric space. Just a metric space, right? It's quite singular a priori. Now we can ask the following questions. The first question is about the compactness problems for Einstein manifolds. It's saying under what condition the Einstein equation preserves on the Gromo-Hausdorff limits, right? So in this direction, there have been many results since three decades ago. Since three decades ago. Typically, under various non-collapsing conditions, we're able to take the limit. The Grand Hausdorff limit of sequence of Einstein, non-collapsing Einstein manifolds, still Einstein in some sense. Now, the second question is more challenging, right? We want to understand the geometry near the boundary of the moduli space of Einstein manifolds. Einstein manifolds. There are two sub-questions. The first sub-question looks like we want to understand the geometry of the limits, which feel to be Einstein. That means by Gromov's pre-compactness, Einstein limits are just a priori metric spaces, right? They could be very singular and very far from a smooth manifold. A smooth manifold, then in this case, how do I understand the Gromo-Hausdorff limit? How do I understand the singularities on those singular limit spaces? Now, another question is about the geometry before the limit. Then how the Einstein metrics become more and more singular. We want to describe the singularity formation as the sequence tending to the boundary of the moduli space. Of the multi-wise space. Now, today, in my talk, I want to answer the above questions in some special cases from the metric geometry point of view. We want to use some tools in metric geometry to address the above type of questions. Okay, to understand the Einstein limits, this is the first concept. We want to define the dimension of a reaching limit space. The dimension of a reaching limit space. This is based on a recent theorem by Coding and Nabor. So consider a converging sequence. Xj converges to X infinity, keeping Ricci curvature uniformly bounded from below. And we define this renormalized measure. Because if collapsing occurs, then the volume of unit ball just goes to zero. But that means. But that means if you take the limit, then you can see any non-travel limit measure on the limit space. But here we want to do this re-normalization divided by the volume of the unit balls. Then in this case, one can see that new j converges to some rock normal measure, nu infinity, called the renormalized limit measure on the limit space. And more importantly, And more importantly, there is a regular set R in the limit space, which is a full measure in the total space. That means a singular set has zero measure. And for every regular point, every tangent cone at every regular point is asymmetric to the k-dimensional Euclidean space. And this integer, dimension integer k depends only on the limiting geometry, right? On the limiting geometry, right? In particular, it's independent of the choice of the base points, right? Then we have a well-defined dimension notion. This common integer k is called the dimension or the essential dimension of a Ricci-Lime space. That means if we take any arbitrary n-dimensional Einstein manifolds with uniformly bounded Ricci curvature, then by Gromo's pre-conference. By Gromo's pre-compactness, we have a metric limit. And for that limit, we are able to define the dimension. It's called the essential dimension. Okay, two cases. Non-collapsing means the limit dimension is equal to the dimension of the manifolds before the limit, right? And unit walls have uniform volume lower bound. Collapsing just means the limit dimension is strictly less than n, equivalent. Than n equivalently, the volumes of the unit balls just going to zero. So, well-known conjecture in the field saying the essential dimension of the limit metric space coincides with the Hausdorff dimension of the limit. There's no partial grass in this direction. It's quite a hard question. So, a priori for So, a priori for collapsing Einstein limits, the Hausdorff dimension could be fractional, but the essential dimension is always an integer. The point is to prove that the Hausdorff dimension is still an integer. Okay, based on this notation, let's return to the degeneration of Einstein metrics. So, two cases. Tricks. So, two cases. For the non-collapsing case, there's rather complete theory, right? Because we have a very clear local structure by trigger coding, right? Locally, one has the quantitative metric construction. That means for any ball of definite radius, except for some bad radius, the ball is growing close to a metric. That means we can use a lot of tools. A lot of tools from the cone analysis. And analytically, in the non-collapsing case, we have many tools. For instance, we have the uniform stoplift, we have uniform control on the harmonic radius in various cases, and we have finite volume energy, which is a very important monotonicity property. That means in the non-collapsing case, we have In the non-collapsing case, we have we're able to use many tools and prove a lot of beautiful theorems. As a result, there is a rather complete regularity theory in the non-collapsing case. So the collapsing case is very challenging. Local topology, local geometry is highly unclear, and there is not much available analytic tool. Available analytic tool. And the regularity theory is quite incomplete. Okay, and today we focus on the collapsing case. Okay, just as I said, in the collapsing case, we don't have general regularity theory except for the two cases. In the case of dimension four, these pioneering Pioneer in regularity theory proved proved by Chiger Tian. If n equals 4, L2 curvature bound implies the fineness of singularities on the collapse limits. In the non-collapsing case, this is not hard. Nowadays, it's quite standard by just by Mauser iteration. But in the collapsing case, this is a quite deep theorem because we don't have We don't have the uniform sobblef bound, not able to use Maslow iteration directly. This is a four-dimensional case. This is a quite beautiful theorem. Now, in higher dimensions, five years ago, Neighborhood and myself, we proved another type of epsilon regularity. So, we proved that curvature uniformly bounded is equivalent to some topological condition for a collapsing manner. For a collapsing manifold, we are able to define a rough and weak new potent structure around every point. And for this neopotent structure, if the new potential rank is maximal, then we can get some uniform control of the curvature. And this is a kind of if and only if condition. They are equivalent. But except for the two theorems, I haven't seen any other regularity theorems. Regularity theorems in the collapsing case in general, in the most general case of collapsing HTML manifolds. So, we want to ask the following question because it's very hard to directly understand the collapsing of Einstein manifolds. What about the special Einstein metrics? For instance, Kala Einstein manifolds, Clabi-Yau manifolds, Haberkal manifolds, G2 Einstein manifolds, and also For and also other special einstein metrics with special holonomy condition. So, in this case, what can we say more about the collapsing geometry? And the goal of my talk is to address two well-known conjectures in the case of collapsing Hypercala four manifolds. So, what's a Hypercala manifold? Benefinition, its holonomic group is reduced to some subgroup. To some subgroup in sp1. And in the case of dimension 4 or complex dimension 2 is equivalent to the Calabi L condition, C1 equals 0. Now let's focus on the two cases, compact case and non-compact case. In the compact case for closed manifold, right? So there was a closed hypercaliform. It was a closed hypercaliform manifold by the classical surface classification theorem and the Yaus resolution of the Calabi conjecture. K3 manifold is the only non-trivial hypercalophore manifold in the closed case. And we have some topological invariants. It's simply connected. First trend class is vanishing, of course. And the OLN number is going to 24. Ole number is equal to 24, it's very large, and the OL number is contributed by the second bidding number. And the second bidding number has further decomposition. Self-deal part has dimension 3, anti-self-deal part has dimension 19, so signature minus 16. And we can apply Changau-Sponet formula. L2 energy is equal to some definite. energy is equal to some definite number 182 pi squared. This formula tells us that if we have a sequence of a collapsing collabion matrix on the K3 manifold, that means singularities must appear. Because otherwise, if we have volume collapsing and bounded curvature, that means all the number is equal to zero. Zero, right? But the Euler number is not equal to zero. It has definite energy. So the limit must exhibit some singularities. Now let's look at a complete non-compact case definition. We say completely non-compact Hypercaller manifold is a gravitational instant. If it's L2 energy, it is finite. L2 energy is finite. All right, standard definition. Now, by volume comparison, we have the following: volume behavior. It's faster than linear and bounded by a quadratic. But the volume growth rate could be fractional. And by trigger 10, L2 finite energy implies a curvature as quadratic decay. The big O. The big O and gradient or inhomogeneous collapsing may occur at infinity. This means that at infinity along different directions, we may see different collapsing rates. Now, if we put a stronger assumption, faster than quadratic decay, right? There's an extra rate onto the minus delta, then there are. Minus delta, then there are several classification results for the gravitational instance by Minerb and Chen Chen and Chen Li. But again, in some sense, they all require curvature decays faster than quadratic rate. But today, we will also address some issues. Some issues in the case of exactly decaying quadratically. Okay, now let me present our first main result. We're able to completely classify the collapsing limits of Q3 manifolds. Now we take a sequence of Habital metrics with a unit diameter. In this case, In this case, in the collapsing case, we're able to say the following: the new J is the renormalized volume measure. Codimension 1 collapsing implies we have the only orbit flow limit, flat orbifow T3 over Z2, and the renormalized limit measure is the Hausdorff measure on the limit. If D equals 2, we can prove that the Gromov Hausdorff That the Gromov-Hausdorff limit is as to its topological sphere, right? And the metric is given by a singular special Keller metric. Again, the renormalized volume measure is equal to the Hausdorff measure on the two-sphere. In the case of d equals one, it's quite simple. The limit is just a closed interval. And the nu infinity is piecewise linear. Is piecewise linear, right? It's piecewise linear function. So there are a few corners in the middle. Now, every corner of new infinity coincides with curvature blowing up locus, right? Because this is collapsing. So some singularities appear. So curvature blowing up locus is exactly given by the singularity. Exactly given by the singularity of the measure. The limit metric is regular, just a standard metric on the interval, but new infinity carries essential collapsing information in the case of codimension 3 collapsing. This is a brand new phenomenon in the collapsing theory. Okay, another result. So the previous result is about a global Previous result is about a global classification. We can also deal with some local classification. Okay, so suppose we have hypercolor collapsing and we assume there are isolated singularities. So notice that here we don't assume L2 bound. We only assume singularities are isolated on the limit space. In this case, we are able to classify singular. Are a variable to classify the singular point. Suppose p infinity is an isolated singularity, and then in the case of two-dimensional one collapsing, is a conformally flat metric. And the flat background metric lives on the cone R3 or R3 over Z2. And the conformal factor is completely classified. It's equal to k times one over r plus a smooth harmonic function. And the kappa here is a priori non-negative number. If we assume L2 energy is finite, then we can see this singular term. That means the limit metric is really an orbital metric. But if If infinite energy occurs, then maybe there's a singular metric, just a conic metric, instead of orbiform metric. If d equals 2, we can say that the layman metric is a special, singular special color metric. So this theorem is sharp in the sense that there's an example by Hattori. In his example, one has a complete hypercolor manifold. If we take the asymptotic cone, we can see that the tangent cone at infinity looks like one over R times the fly metric on R3. But in that case, the energy is infinity, right? And the volume growth rate is strictly between three and four. It's a fractional order. Okay, this is our. Okay, this is our local classification. So, what about a completely non-compact case? In a completely non-compact case, the gram of Hausdorff limits look like a fault. Could mention one collapsing, just R3 or R3 over Z2, right? Or R2 times S1, or it's Z2 quotient, or R times T2, or it's and it's Z2 quotient. Z2 quotient. So for co-dimension 2, there are two cases: a flat cone, right, with a specific range of cone angles, and also R times S1, a flat cylinder. So for the codiment one case, we have two types of limits, R and R plus, a line or a half line. They are about the Gronhausdorff limits of Hypercolor metrics. Now we are also able to give a complete classification of gravitational instants. They appear as bubbling limits of K3 collapsing and other hypercolor collapsing. Now we define the infinity dimension of instant. Suppose there is a unique Suppose there is a unique tangent cone at infinity. Then the essential dimension of this asymptotic cone is defined to be, it is defined as the infinity dimension of an instant, right? Because a priori, you can't assume this. There are maybe different, entirely different asymptotic cones with different dimensions. In this case, the infinity dimension is not well defined. But in our interested cases, But in our interested cases, for any gravitational instant, based on our previous classification results, we can prove that their asymptotic cone is in fact unique. And every tangent cone is a phylometric cone. And using this factor, we are able to give the following classification with an optimal asymmetric order. So, in the non-collapsing case, it was completely classified by Kronheim LE space. In the collapsing case, we have L F, L G, L H, and L G star, H star. And moreover, if D greater than or equal to 2, the osmotic order is polynomial. D equals 1 is exponential order. So, in the next two minutes, let's describe Let's describe the picture. So, LF, Lg, LH, they are simple. They have curvature decaying rate faster than quadratic, right? And from the manifold to it's a symmetric cone, we're able to find new potential fabric, right? And they have simpler fibers, S1, T2, and T3. But for our new friends, you know, GC. New friends, LG star, LH star, they have a very bad, very bad curvature decaying rate because their collapsing fiber is more complicated. LH star case is a three-dimensional new manifold. And in the LG star case, it's just S1 times S1. But for the two directions, we have two different rates of claps. And the model metrics are you. The model metrics are invariant under the Neopoten action given by the Neopoten structure. So, in the last minute, we can briefly introduce our new ideas of the proof and see how to classify the metrics. So, we want to use a perturbation method to produce a model metric on a given gravitational instant. But if we only assume curvature decaying faster, the curvature has quadratic decay, it's not strong enough to directly use the weight analysis, right? So our key idea is to produce a special approximate metric using the collapsing theory by taking the average around the new proton fibers. In this case, we have improved. improved asymmetric rate. Collapsing fibers decay like r to the minus epsilon instead of just going to zero. In this case, we're able to prove this improved asymptotics. Using this asymptotics, we can do the perturbation. But the above doesn't improve the decay of the curvatures, right? Right, because for the LH star, it decays exactly quadratically. So I think my talk just stops here. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions? Let me, can you give a little bit of idea about Serum 3? three is uh d equal to two case there is a special the previous result not this one uh this one right equal to two why why is only this angle up here yeah so uh in the case of a two-dimensional two collapsing uh for the regular region we have a torus bundle structure right so for an isolated singularity p right then we get a monodon Right, then we get a monogram. We're able to classify the monogeny, it lives in SL2Z. For a finite group in SL2Z, there are only a few choices. Okay, okay. So is the local result of stronger than the global result, at least for the compact case? Yes, it's stronger than the global result. So, for example, in the compact case, So, for example, in the compact case, I mean, for a collapsing limit of closed manifolds, then we can see that k doesn't appear, right? Because we always have, you know, if additionally, L2 curvature is uniformly bounded and kappa is zero, and just constant of a constant multiple of flat metric. So, this second theorem would imply this first one? Yes, it implies the first one using some this. one and using some basic ideas in classifying orbifolds. You can see that the only possible limits are those things, T3 or Z2. Thank you. Any more questions? Okay, apparently not. So we can thank Okay, apparently not. So we can thank Rodin again.
