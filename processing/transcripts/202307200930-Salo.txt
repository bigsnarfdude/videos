Geometry transforms that come up in various tomography problems and also in linear and non-linear E problems. And this is joint work with Marco Mazzukelli and Leo. Let me start by motivating this through the light ray transform. So the light rays are the null geodesics of Lorentzian metrics. And in the simplest case in the left-hand picture, if you have R one plus one with the Minkowski metric, Plus one with the Minkowski metric, then the light rays are just the straight lines which make a 45-degree angle with the x-axis. But for a more general Lorentzian metric, you can think of curves which look like in this right-hand side picture. And the inverse problem for the light-ray transform is that you have a function f supported in the brown domain, and you know the integrals of f over these curves, and you want to determine f from these integrals. So in the left-hand side picture, it's kind. So in the left hand side picture it's uh kind of a restricted X-ray transform problem because you don't know the integrals f over all lines, you only know them for the subset of lines. And so this transform comes up in wave equation problems and also general relativity. So the idea is that if you have boundary measurements from some PDEs, then if you can design some high frequency boundary data that generate geometrical optic solutions to your way Geometrical optic solutions to your wave equation. So then the geometrical optic solutions will propagate along the light race, and then from the boundary measurements, you can read off the integral of the unknown coefficient along this light trace. So that's roughly how it goes. So the Lorentzian light rays transform R encodes the integrals of F over all null geodesics for a Lorentzian metric. So this transform has been studied. The first result is due to Stefano, who showed that this transformation. Stefano could show that this transform is indeed invertible in Minkowski space, so like in constant sound speed. It's also invertible for real analytic Lorentzian metrics that define the foliation condition and also for certain stationary or static Riemannian metrics result by Holly, Jonas and Lowry. But as far as I know, invertibility of this transform is open even for small perturbations of Minkowski space. Divisions of Minkowski space. So we had yesterday that the ED problem can now be solved in this setting, in Alice talk, but the ray transfer problem is open. And also the micro-local aspects have been studied by people here like Andrush and Iran. Okay, but this idea that you can reduce a PD inverse problem into this kind of rate transform problem has very little to do with the fact that you are ideal. To deal with the fact that you are dealing with the wave equation. It actually works for a very large class of equations. So, with Rowri and Stefano and Ulman, we showed that the same thing can be done for any real principal type PVE. So, this class of PVEs, which includes transport equations, wave equations, both Lorentzian and also trichomi-type wave equations, it includes the evolution Schrodinger equation and things like the plate. Equation and things like the plate equation, if you put the right kind of waiting for the time derivative, as Sean discussed in his talk. And it also works for real principal type systems, like this fully anaesthropic elastic wave equation discussed by Jonas. So the definition of real principal type is in the footnote, so it means that the PD has a real principle symbol, so the highest order coefficients have to be a real value, and also And also there should be no trap no by characteristics. So just recall if you have a PBE an operator P, then you get this principal symbol small P and if it's real value it is going to generate the Hamilton flow in the cotangent space and and the inflow curves of of this Hamilton vector field in the zero set of the symbol are called the Nullby characteristics. So Characteristics. So, here are just some simple pictures. So, for the wave operator, the bi-characteristics are just these 45-degree lines, or lines which belong to the light comes. And a bi-characteristic has kind of a space part xt and also a momentum path Ïˆ t. So, this xi t vector is drawn here in flow. But for the Trichomi operator, you see that if x2 is x2, the x1 squared plus dx2. x2 dx1 squared plus dx2 squared. If x2 is negative, then this is a wave-type operator. But when x2 goes to zero, then it degenerates. And the nullbike derivatives look like the ones in the right-hand side picture. So they go to this set where x2 is equal to zero and they make a cusp and they turn back. So what one can do is for a real principle type T D, one can, from P D boundary measurements, one can determine. Uh P D boundary measurements one can determine inputs along along these curves. So so we call this the null by characteristic rate transform. So it's this operator R which includes the integrals of a function f over all curves X T which are spatial projections and nullby characteristics for your PDE. And examples of this transform include well the dialectic X ray transform, the light rate transform and also more general pseudo-Riemannian X-ray transforms. Money in the X-ray transforms. Okay, so in this paper with Laurie and Stefan and Ulman, we had a number of results and we also had a result where non-linearity helps. So we showed that if you have a non-linear P D where the main part is real principle type, then we could actually determine the coefficient uh from boundary measurements under some conditions. However, if the P D is linear, then we don't have this uh this benefit of non linearity. This benefit of non-linearity, and in that case, we showed that you can just determine from the V D boundary measurements, you can determine this now by Credit Ray transform. And the invertibility of this transform was left as an open question. So, the motivating question for this talk was: Can one say anything about the invertibility of this now by freight transforms? So the answer is yes. And the method we use is And the method we use is the so-called micro-local double vibration approach to integral geometries. It's kind of a fundamental approach introduced by Guillermin in the 1970s. And we showed that under what is called the Bolker condition, which somehow is related to a no-conjugate points condition, one can recover C-infinity singularities of F from RF. So this is basically what one gets from Dielemy's theory already. But as we know, recovering the singularities is not the same as recovering the whole function. So, this kind of C infinity microlocal approach is not going to give you honest invertibility of these transforms. But there are certain cases where you can do better. And one case is if the coefficients of the P B are real analytic, then actually you can use methods from analytic micro-local analysis to recover the whole function and to say that the transform is actually honest, to invert. Transform is actually honestly invertible. And so we take this approach and we make a study of double vibration transforms, which is probably more systematic than what had been done before. And one of the main results is kind of a result in analytic micro-local analysis, which show that if you have a Fourier integral operator of a certain type, which includes these integral transforms here, then we can determine the analytic signal integration of the function. Analytics in order to function from this transform, and we use this to invert this operator R. So that's somehow the main overview of what we did in this work. And we get some consequences, so we get some invertibility results for some more well-known transforms like the geodesic X-ray transform. And okay, these NARBAC-ray transforms, and these results are not. And these results are not in any way restricted to the fact that you are integrating over curves. So you can also study transforms which integrate over higher dimensional manifolds, like for instance the Radon transform and generalizations of that. And so we use analytic micro-local analysis, so we can include a non-vanishing analytic weight in all of these transforms and still get the same invertibility results. But the method uses micro-local. Microlocal form of analytic continuation, and this procedure is not stable. So, this kind of instability issue was discussed in detail in the paper with Ankana and Herbert Koch. But even though our method is not going to give stable inversion, then for some of these transforms that we study, actually you can recover all of the singularities. So, this indicates that stable inversion might still be possible, but for that, you would need. Still be possible, but for that you would need some other method. Okay, so let me give you maybe these first two consequences, and the third one I won't have time to discuss today. Okay, so the DLDC X-ray transform is defined on a compact Riemannian manifold, Mg, which has a strict atomic boundary, and we say that the manifold is non trapping if uh if each geodesic goes to the boundary in finite time. It goes to the boundary in finite time. And the geodesic X-ray transform of F is this thing IF, which encodes the integrals of F over all maximum geodesics gamma, like in this picture on the right. And this is a very fundamental transform. It appears in many places. And it would be of interest to know the invertibility of this transform some under minimal assumptions. So some of the main results. So some of the main results are that this transform is known to be invertible, it manifolds no conjugate points, so this is the case of simple manifolds within the form method, and also in three and higher dimension in the case when the manifolds are foliated by strictly manifolds, result by Wooman and Parsi. But uh so one of the conjectures in this field, which has been made at least in two dimensions, is that uh actually neither of these extra conditions would be needed, so Extra conditions would be needed. So, the question is whether you can show invertibility just for a compact truth-to-complex non-drafting manifolds. And the first result says that this is actually true in two dimensions if the manifold and the metric are real analytic. So, this theorem in some sense is not new, but it follows from what we do, and it has, as far as I know, not been stated there in the literature before. So The literature before. So it combines two things. It uses locally nipples for analytic double vibration transforms that we put up here. But actually, in the case of geodesics, this follows from an earlier paper of Stefano and Norman. And then it uses a kind of convex foliation of the manipulation, which can be done in 2D whenever the manipul is non-trapping. So result of Bette, Wolf, Galger, and Lippmann. Okay. So the So, the second somehow consequence of this is an invertibility result for this null bi-characteristic rate transform. So, we start with the function p living in the tangent space t star m. We assume it to be a real-valued function which is homogeneous in the exile variable. For instance, it could be the principal symbol of some PDE. And we let R be the null by the refuse-ray transform, which includes the integrals. This ray transform, which includes the integrals of f over all curves xt, which are special projections of these Nullby characteristics for this Hamilton function small p. And we have an invertibility result. So if this function p is real analytic, and then there are some conditions on Abloxide P and the Hessian of P, which I'm going to discuss on the next slide, and also with foliation condition, we assume that the Foliation condition: We assume that the support of it can be foliated by strictly pseudo-convex kind of time-like hypersurface gamma t. And then we show that under these geometric conditions, the transform is invertible. So, let me try to explain a little bit these conditions and also the geometrics. I'll draw a picture. So, so this is kind of a a similar result for the light ray transfer proved by Plame Stefano. So, this is a generalization of that result. Of that result. So, what are the conditions? So, you have some manifold, and your function f is living in this manifold, and we want it this function from the knowledge of these integrals over this set of curves. The spatial projections are now by characteristics. And we have a foliation, so we can somehow foliate the manifold by some hypersurfaces like this. This are the gamma T. It's not the gamma t's. And so, what are the conditions? So, the first one is that the psi gradient of p should not be zero, and the psi gradient just from the Hamilton equation is the tangent vector of the curve. So, this first condition just means that the curves will have no cusps for other singular points. So, what is time-like? So, so this means that if you look at one of these gamma t's, If you look at one of these gamma t's, so so this uh proof is uh based on kind of a layer stripping argument. We first uh uh w we start from here and we d determine if the function is small neighborhood here and then we move it inside and we iterate this kind of result. So, so this time means that that this gamma t is that there are many curves in your curve family which are tangential to these gamma ts. So, the way how this works is you basically want to Way how this works is you basically want to look at the normal or the co-normal to this gamma t, and you need the condition that there is some curve in the curve that will link, which is tangential to this normal vector. So, in the case of wave equations, this is exactly the same as time lighting in the usual Lorentzian setting. And we saw examples of foliations which work in Alice's talk. But in other cases, like for the geodesic or two Guri Mannian, other Tugari Mannian X-ray transform, this condition actually always holds for any hypersurface. So this is kind of a void condition for those transforms. Okay, so then we have strictly pseudo-convex. So this means that if we start moving this curve down a little bit and we look at the parts of this curve which are inside the domain, there will be many somehow curves which Curves which are somehow short, or whose parts which are belonging to this domain are very short. So, we are only using these short curves to determine the function in this neighborhood of this point. And the final thing is that I mentioned this Bolker condition, which is somehow related to no conjugate points. And for things like geodesics, it's automatic, that short geodesics never. Is automatic that short geodesics never have conjugate points. But in this more general setting, you need a condition on the Hessian, like the ÏˆHession of D has to be non-degenerate in order for short curves not to have conjugate points. So this last condition is just this Bolker condition. So that's some of the geometric setting of this result. And as a corollary, combining this with what we did with Lowry and Stefano and Worma, we showed that if and Stefano and Worma we show that if P is a real principal type operator whose principal coefficients are real analytic and if these geometric conditions hold then we can actually determine a potential V from the boundary measurements for the P D P plus V we can get the kind of P D inverse result from this rate transform result okay so these were two examples of what we can get from from this Also, what we can get from this theory. So, let me, in the remaining time, try to explain a little bit about the methods. Okay, so we use the double vibration approach of Guillemin, which is quite classical, and it seems so classical that maybe not many people are very familiar with it anymore. So, let me try to explain in a few slides what these double vibrations are about. So, I start with a simple set. Part. So I start with a simple setting. So I start with M, which is just the plane R2, and this grid G is the family of curves over which we integrate, which is just the straight lines in R2. So this setting gives rise to the classical Radon transform R, which is defined so that Rf at the line L is the integral of F X when X is belongs to this line L. But there's kind of a duality here. But there's kind of a duality here. So the Radon transform has an adjoint R star which is ob obtained by integrating over all lines which contain the point X. And if you compare these two formulas they are kind of completely symmetric. And somehow to further encode the symmetry one can define this Z, which is the incidence relation or the line point relation. So it's just to set, let's see, if you figure Let's see, if you fix a line L, then you look at all pairs L X so that X belongs to the line L. So this would be somehow corresponding to the left-hand side. Or you can also think of it as the pairs LX where L contains the point X. So it's a sub-manifold of the product G cross M. And then you can draw this diagram where you have the projections from Z down to G and M. To G and M, and it's easy to check that in this case the projections are both submerged, the derivatives are changed. So, what is a double vibration? It's an abstraction of this notion. It's a definition due to Gerfan, Crime, and Shapiro in the late 60s. And it's completely abstract. So, it's saying if D and M are any manifolds, then a sub-manifold Z of the product G cross M is called a double vibration. T cross M is called a double vibration if the two projections are submergents. So it's a beautiful definition which tends out to include a very large amount of integral geometry transforms. So whenever you have double vibration, you have a transform and it's obtained as follows. So you take any Z in this set G and you think of this point Z as parametrizing the curves or manifold. The curves or manifolds over which you integrate. So then, because Ï€g is a submersion, then the fiber Ï†g inverse of z is a smooth manifold in the product. And then when you project down to M, you get a smooth manifold in M. So with this point Z, you parameterize a set of manifold GZ, and then the double vibration transform is the thing which encodes the individuals of the function f over all of this manifold GZ. Manifold GZ. So there's some density which I'm not going to discuss in more detail. So for any double vibration, you have a transform. And okay, so this is somehow completely abstract. And then you could ask if you are given a kind of some more concrete transform, is it of this double vibration type or can you make this more concrete? So we actually did something like this in the case. Did something like this in the case of rate transforms when you're integrating work curves. So we show that if you have any double vibration rate transform, then it arises in a more concrete way as follows. So there exists some fiber bundle N over M, and there exists some vector field Y in this fiber bundle on top of N. So that R just the input the integrals over projections of integral curves of Y. Projections of integral curves of y, and there's also a converse under suitable conditions. So, basic examples would be: you take the fiber bundle N to be the unit sphere bundle S M, you take the vector field Y to be the geodesic vector field, this gives you the geodesic vector transform. Another example is you take the fiber bundle to be the zero set of the symbol, and you take the vector field to be the Hamilton vector field, and then you get the Norbach reference ray transform. Get the null by the reference rate transform. So, this you can think of as some kind of rate transform of a general curve families. So, there has been some previous work here, including work by Han Ming using this Bohrman-Basi approach. But these are all somehow contained in this double vibration business. Okay, so what about the invertibility of these transforms? So, Guillemin's idea was to use micro-occural analysis. Was to use micro-local analysis, and he showed that whenever you have double-fibration transform, it's a good integral operator. And he introduced this condition that he called the Bulker condition. So, this is related to kind of a micro-logal version of the diagram that I showed before. So, now I have the polynomial bundle of Z up here, and I have the cotangent spaces of G and M down here, and I have the left projection and the right projection, and the bulker condition is just that the And the bulker condition is just that the left projection is injective and it's an immersion, so the derivative is also injective. And he showed that if this condition holds, then you can make sense of the normal operator R star R by using the clean intersection calculus of integral operators. And this turns out to be an elliptic pseudo-differential operator, which immediately gives you recovery of C-infinity similarities. But it doesn't give you the actual. But it doesn't give you the actual invertibility of the transform, it only gives you these uh similarities. So then Booman and Quinto observed that if things are real analytic, one can do better. So if things are real analytic, they say that okay, maybe you might use the same idea to recover analytic singularities of your function. And now, when you recover analytic singularities, there's a kind of very nice micro-local analysis. And micro-local analytic continuation results and Sato Kawa Pashibara that then allows you to use analytic continuation to recover the whole function. The issue with this thing is that the calculus for these operators was missing in the real analytic case. And because of this reason, people developed an alternative method which People developed an alternative method which does not use the calculus at all, instead, they use the FPI transform. So, this was first done by Stefan and Ulmo for the geodesic rate transform, and there have been other works for specific transforms. And so, what we do is we prove the recovery of analytic singularities for a general double vibration transform. We don't use a calculus because it doesn't exist yet, but we do it directly using this FBI transform. Using this FBI transform. Okay, so then some of the main result that we prove for integral operators is the following. So if R is a double vibration transform and if all the underlying quantities are real analytic, for instance for a male bike that is great transfer, you want the symbol key to be real analytic in x and psi. And if the bulk air condition holds, so the bulk condition Halts. So the Volcker condition was that this left version pi and is an injective immersion. We actually only need the Volcker condition at a single point. So if we have a point C zeta xi, which is in the canonical relation C of this operator R, and the canonical relation is just the twisted version of the core normal bundle of Z. And there's two parts in the bulk equation. The global part is telling you that. The global part is telling you that somehow this pi L is injective in the sense that the inverse image of this psi is just a single term, and also that the derivative of the literal region should be injective at that point. So, if this condition holds, then we can recover an analytic singularity at x eta of f from the knowledge of R F. So, this is kind of an analytic regularity result for L. Result for LIPTFIOs in this class. And we also give some geometric characterization for the Bolker condition. The global part of the Bulker condition somehow corresponds to a no-conjugate points condition, but it's a bit subtle. It's not always somehow an obvious no-conjugate points condition, but in some ways related. The local part is somehow related to the fact that uh if you look at this manifold G Z over which you integrate, Over which you integrate, and you look at all such manifolds which go through a fixed point x. Then, when you vary these dz, you need to generate enough tangents for normals in order to cover a large set, so that that will ensure the local part of the bulk condition. Okay, so so let me maybe so I have the definition of analytic waveforms, but let's maybe skip it in the interest of time. So, just one slide about the ideas of proof. So, just one slide about the ideas of proof. So, the first step is to localize in space. So, here we use the global part of the ballkeep condition, which is basically telling you that if you are interested in a similarity at some point x data, then there is only okay, so if you are interested in singularity at zeta, then there is only one singularity x data which is going to contribute to that singularity in the rate transform. So, away from So, away from this point x, you don't get any contributions. So, we can localize near this point x in space. And once we have localized in space, we can choose good local coordinates which allow us to represent the double variation in the form x prime equals phi z prime for some function phi, and then we reduce things to a model for a ripple operator, which is this operator t, which is written out here. It has a certain phase function. Here it has a certain phase function and some non-vanishing amplitude. And then, what we do is we microlocalize in the parameter space G by using an FPI transform. So, the idea is that our assumption is that some point Z at zeta hat is not in the analytic wavefront of T F and the definition of anal analytic waveforms is that when you take the F P I transform of T F at that point you have exponential decay. You have eight connection decay. So we have localized in space and we have micro-localized in parameter space. And it turns out that from some abstract properties of panel correlations, this also micro-localizes in space. So now we have micro-localized in both sides. So then we have a new operator which has some k lambda, which is given by many integrals. One can remove some of these integrals by some. One can remove some of these intervals by stationary phase. This is the third step, we simplify it a little bit. And then we get another transform which is written out here. And then we want to this transform is some kind of generalized FDA transform that actually takes the analogy away from the set. So this is work of Scherstein in the 1970s and 80s. So in order to show that this operator is some kind of FPI transform, it's the most table. FPI transform is the most technical part of the argument. It uses now the local part of the polka condition. Okay, so let me maybe end with some perspectives. All of these results require things to be real analytic. Of course, it would be very nice to drop this condition. And there are two approaches that want to try energy estimates, or the Ulmoisier approach. So, for which of these transforms do these approaches work? Also, what happens when the Borke condition? Also, what happens when the Boltke condition is violated? This has been studied in specific cases, for instance, by Franz Joa with Stefano van Urman. Of course, you will consider systems of cancers, like in my book with Schulkal van van Mohrmann, and maybe could one use these ideas to actually do a composition calculus for analytical bios. Okay, so let me end here. Thanks very much.
