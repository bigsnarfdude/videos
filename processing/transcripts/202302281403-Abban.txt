And thank you, Dan, for forcing me to do the hike. It's good. He's really good. So there were lots of questions about the state of the art for hypersurfaces. I spent a lot of time talking about that. And then I specified the quartet, and probably that justifies why quartilies. So uh bit of notation. Why did I say myself? Much yourself a self. It would be d in p and plus one. I'm going to write it usually in that. And I should explain itself. So we like funnels. So this thing being funnel is the same as asking Good. Now, there's a change on here. What is the expectation for age stability of these guys? So, the expectation is that all Let's see in Pn plus one more than that two ways and three are choosed why not one and two because uh if D is one and two then X is J fully stable. Probably stable strictly, I mean, obvious, and it's all good from these pass. And that's the expectation. Good. So here we go. So it's very brief. The answer is not much. So to talk about how much we don't know really. D is n plus 1. And the answer is yes. This is the work of HPR. T is N. J is yes. Um just write it differently, but Differently, but n is at least RQ. The answer is yes. Same two guys, but different paper. And R here is the index. So it's for n plus 2 minus b index. And also x3UP5. Nothing nothing more like okay, there's some obvious things. So know that there exists one X D stable so while openness but it's Oh, it's default. So, how about the module? So I write it differently. So, what we know So if you take cubic in P3 or 4 or 5, then the modulate is the same as GAT and this came up yesterday. This came up yesterday in Iostak. So this is Odaka Spati Song. This is uh so he said it yesterday. I'm just repeating what he said. So the idea is to Show that K semi-stable, poly-stable limits of stable surfaces, QB surfaces, or QB surfaces. So the way you do it, you basically take XT, which is X. X. We take minus k and we trace it and it goes to some n. We want to show that n is of 1. Basically, assume n is not partially at the point x and And with a few big machines, some big ones, so it's that one, xkx. And this is less than the local value normalized of x at x. In defining it, you don't have to know what it is because you don't even use it. And the other thing is if you have a If you have a secret cover of so this is secret along cover. Yeah, so volume xt dot xt dot hat is the same as degree of this map, so and And volume x x hat. But not every colour is good about this. So this is use PHP plus. And the third one you do is the interesting one is this is less than 2n minus 12 mm makes this a smooth, but here is not smooth. Smooth, but here it's not smooth. It's pretty obvious what you do. So at this stage, you work out this thing. So eliminate these from inequalities. From one side, you have that. The other side, you get a combination of these divided by your index that came up to. Our index that came up today, this morning. And you want to show that I think is one. So this is part here. Life is good. What you need, the ingredients are in front of you. What you need is that this is big, so you want this to be large and you want this to be thirteen, which is small. Thirteen. So you divide this by that, you get a bound for the degree. You get a bound for the degree, and in good situations, you get the small numbers like 1, 2, 3, and then you rule out 3 and 3, and then you prove that it's 1. So there's some work to do after that. Now the problem is that this thing is only conjecture. Conjecture, but it's true if n is at most 3. So this is. So, this is exactly what is done in this paper. Prove this for all to tree, and they use the classification of singularities. Then you get a really good bound, and you can do things. So, this number is really big for cubics, and it's bound for qualities. Like that, then. And the magic here is that he doesn't prove it for four faults, but he proves it for Four fault, but he proves it for n-dimension for locally complete intersection things, and then he does some clever tricks to do similar arguments to get it done. The point being, prove this, you can remove this and put n, and that's automatic. You don't need to do it. That's the limitation here we have. So, what's the expectation? Is that for all cubics in Pn, just give it the right hand, K mod cubic is the same as GT Beyond qubits we have. Beyond cubics, we have no expectations, which is nothing. No idea what we expect. So this talk is about experiments to create some expectation. We still have no experience. Good, so what's next? What is it? I want hypersurface of degree D in P n plus 1, one of which is not cubic, the next one left is four in P4. So, we already know that GIT is not enough to read k modular. Why is that? Because you have hyperledgics. So these are complete integration of quatrix and quartics in P11111, five of them, and a two. It's a white chocolate. It's not one of these, the chocolate, the Korean size chocolate. Good, so you have these guys. So what do they look like? I'm going to write it as a y squared. So these are my coordinates, x, naught, 2, h4 and y. So a y squared is the same as is equal to h f four of x variables and Variables and BY is a project in X so we can tell you this. If B is not zero, then we eliminate Y and we get a quad. Pretty obvious, which is pretty fast. So if P is zero, then that's small so that x is small. So these are the hyper elliptic guys and What's happening is I can write x now as y squared is f y squared is f q of x and q squared is 0. I did that I have a map to something I call y which is the vanishing of this quadrat in p4 this is in p152 forget the last one and I just keep it and this is 221 And this is two to one branched along S d D, which is given by Q is L C dot inside S degree eight. And we know this from the Erband improved. Improved versions of so X to Y side 2 branch D which is a minus lambda j of y lambda is at least one. Lambda is at least one, then y is semi-stable in place x as we said earlier, the K is semi-stable, the K-poly stable, in fact. Polystable, in fact. So it follows that X are per elliptic in this case. And I had said earlier that these files are K-stable, so they should all be in the K-module. To write the You could write the K modulo as x k P S and 3 and 4. That's the dimension and S D three. So this is going to contain smooth particles plus smooth particles. Is the GIP math known to contain things that are clearly not case on stable for easy reasons? That's the whole problem. I want to invent a notation just for the sake of this part. If I write x4, x, 2, 4, I don't put anything here. How is that happening? I think this is the parameter space of quartics, parameter space of Sections, but I'm asking that they're smooth. If I take so clearly, if I take the closure of this inside that, it contains elements which are not of this object. So you can add, you can just deform this to the whole. Add, you can just deform this into the whole thing contain only I mean, putting that way this obviously wrong. The greatest obvious problem containing only guys next to four. So Good. So meaning what the meaning maybe you look at the closure. Bug a cover and other people. Where are you thinking in the closure? Sorry? What closure are you? So it's just asking if you can further degenerate beyond just hyperliptics. Step one. I will briefly talk about it. I will call it a commercial break. Because I think, I hope, to talk more about it. Not eat, but things I don't eat. That's it. Brainwashed by neurosymmetry is an expectation. It's going to be full of walls. I don't understand it. Space of rigid maximally mutual. Mutable around polynomials C D one take these And on the other side, you take to generalization to final end folds. It is true that your hands get tired very quickly. What are the What are these guys by notation? If you know what they are, you know what they are. If you don't know what they are, there's no point seeing it here. Some combinatorial game. We mode things out by few Gornish sign deformation. What is this harbour-looking model? It's basically. So the final is Tori is TG if it appears as the general fiber of a cube orange line degeneration with reduced fibers and special fiber toric, toric degeneration of these steps. And why is expectation true? Because people believe it and also because it's true for Tauric case by net science. Just under the scripture. As you see, what we do for K moduli, we're looking at Q Burringstein deformation of set and we don't sense space. So what you do is qualitative mutation. So here is Rigit. Oh, so here is rigid maximally mutable polynomials. What things? Exactly. I don't want to say. Good. But what you do is basically you start with, I mean, u means some of L shows up. You start with x1, x2, x3. x1 x2 x3 x4 equals x14 so this is a toric quadrant you start with this and then you take some You can take a Laurent polynomial that represents this, and you shoot out, take the polytechnic of this and mutate take this with the condition that strictly. Strict to those for which the take the holiday of anti-canonical divisor, zero is the variety of this. So this is equivalent to your toric variety being equally stable. So basically, you go on a hunt for toric varieties, come from here, but they would be capableistic. KOE statement. And once you find them, find the final guide that corresponds to this. And I asked you before, I think computation went through more than 100,000 cases. Lots of mutations. And you find three. Imagine I'll never write the equations, but take it here. So there are complete intersection of two quadratics and quartic in this space. And they cannot be embedded in the current space. Good, now you have new toys to play with. This does. And you take all of them. Step two. Take all these x224 in p 0.52 would you write x and y. If I write all of If I write all of these guys, it's going to be something like y0y1 is equal to f4x. And then a y0 plus b by 1 is g and So for this matrix A, which is A B C D if rank of A is 2, I get my aquartic. So I can eliminate both y0 and y 1 back to aquatic. If Rank of A is 1, I get a hyper ellictage. And if A is 0, If X0 one of these only X224s are a very simple company, Yeah, so I'm going to write x just denotes these things, right? So I have y0, y1 is f x. I have g2 is g is 0, h is 0, so two things about these people. Two things about these people. I'm going to assume that's the story. I'm going to denote by S G is h is 0 inside P4. So I just take the complete intersection of these two and I denote by delta. F is That is so now I'm going to assume of S and delta or speed. So first thing is that you can show easily X is clear T. In fact, it has only two singular points, P0 and P1. P0 is 0, 1, 0. So life is not so bad and have a group which is C star cross semi-gear product mu2 acting on X. This one does it by count the Y count. White out by scrolling this to see changes nothing. Is that with these conditions, what is stable? This is a this is magic. I rely on your memories, people. So, So suppose we have some setup, so g x on some final x, and this is reductive. And if Ax E minus SXE is bigger than one, that's like zero, too much delta. For every G invariant, G variant variant divisor E over X X is K for the step. The keyword here is is something. Just by looking at this, you can prove that PN is capably stable because you have PGL acting on it and there is no divisor that is prime and 46 statement is true. So anyway so. So of the theorem, I'm not going to prove it. Basically what you do is suppose x at x is not equal to state. Therefore, there exists f prime g invariant such that this tau. That this star of E and these were defined yesterday. If you don't remember them, that's not true. Let C be the entropy. So F might be a divisor on X itself, so in that case it's just or it leaves above X, so you take the image, so that basically means the image is in variant. You take this thing and it follows that theta x Tend top ace of x is less than one for every x. What you do is you ask who could see me stop. So I have X and I have a map to my surface S and the connect bundle are defined at my two singular points. So you resolve them in which It's an RGA proof. Anyway, life is good. So basically, based on this, you say Z is Take these two surfaces, you cut it out, so you get a curve the invariant point on Z for an irreducible front layer. Of this map, this is not easy, it's not difficult to see stuff, which is analyzed your equations. Or it could be something variant divisor intersecting set. Now you know you have something in hand now, you can work with these guys. You analyze them after X to be in one of these positive planes. So for example, if you do it for any point here, you apply it for all these two end planes. So what you do is for that point, you want to show Delta F s the way you're doing things that um you do it without FTP. So it's some nonsense, so you basically fix the divisor P Divisor B that same in doesn't have to be easier to write the formula if it is. And if you did that, then delta x is going to be a minimum of one over s infimum of delta x on b with respect to X on B with respect to not minus job. So this is something that we did with Teacher a few years ago. If you have heard it, it's nice it works. If you have never heard it, I can explain it in 20 minutes, not now. What it does is you fix a device there, so not in a you can do it anywhere you like. It gives you these numbers and they give you a lower bound. So better than that is if you fix a that is if you picture flag then delta xx is bounded by the minimum of one of that s and then some delta some holiday stuff and some stuff that are more holiday. I'm not going to explain anything about these. Point is they're computer Is your computer by hand once you fix a flag? So, all you do here is fix your point, you play with flags and take this and work out these numbers. And hopefully, your flag was chosen correctly. The number you compute is bigger than what you think. But life here is disgusting, so I'm cheating. You really don't do it that way here. So or you dream this place like this. Between this place like this. Take a flag in here, the right numbers and you put them in your mouth. Excuse me. Said a magic word, the Mori dream space. How does it kick in? How does it help? The thing we do, it works in any scenario. Anto Fujita and many other people came up with a formula to compute this, and their formula was. Compute this, and their formula works really nice if it's a modern space because you have all the decomposition, you have the Z decomposition for free in front of you. How does Z interact with the iridicible fibers? In any case, does Z intercept the iridicible fibers? Third one, fourth one. Oh, yeah. You can cut them here. Not the problem. You need to do nothing. And it's not reading up a few pages of documentation. And I'm going to write something that's more friendly to a few people in this room. We started it, right? I'm going to rewrite. I'm going to rewrite x. I just change I make a small change on my voice plus f x. Right. All I did was I changed my coordinates and why not too light about this. Well What? So this transaction four is choosing and the path is so if I forget. Forget by one in those equations. I get the two to one map to pier and half d. The d is just quarantine square is half and striked to one. And y is Good, good, good. So, this is like a coin basically with a writer. Y and D is going to have an isotrivial degeneration to Y and D naught. It's basically we scale that. Okay. If these were denoted by this change outside or inside, sorry. Set S infinity to be half of the naught. Now, my surface S is a My surface S is a deposit of the G4. It's a intensation of two cooperatives. This is smooth. So it's case stable as it was proven by Lucy. So there's this cone construction. Cone construction, let's say. Basically, tells you you have cones like this over something when this is the cone overface. So it tells you when their case data. So this is why that tells you that why in the notation, why In the notation, y and 1 minus r over 3 is infinity is k for you state. I'm not going to like that. They have a long formula that tells you plugging these things we have, this pops up. The unit OSF2 is basically minus j r. R in other words, R is just a half. It's a pupil. Good, what did I say? I started. And so yeah, so that implies that y and five over six is infinity. As infinity, K equal is stable by the cone construction. You have a cone over this thing that's k is stable. The formula tells you this is k by stable. S infinity is half of d0. So in other words, y and 5 over 12 d naught is capable. The note is came from standard. Okay, the note came from this isotrivial degeneration. So openness gives you that is j. Good. So now this thing is y and k over four t is uh k of t and it's also the below x k. And below basically y. Y is this. So this is two and two. So minus k of y is of seven minus four and d is of degree four. And also T is in the smooth locus of Y. So by interpolation between R as these guys, Y and C D is case stable for any C between the two numbers I've just shown you. If C is half stick there, I get that min is stable and then by the double covering argument that we have earlier, x is We have are x is going to be a depending on what kind of human you are. You prefer this proof or the previous one. So, anyway, so we have all of these figures. Now, proposition. I'm not going to prove it, but with a bit more pain, very similar to what we did, in fact, copy-pasting for MEC on this region. If S and C delta, so S will by the puzzle degree four, delta is the variable. If this thing is K stay back, I'm just staybrite or stable, then Y and Sanskrit. And five plus sixteen C over twelve D is that comes from this with these numbers. You have to set C to be one over sixteen, you know, you get one. Uh where uh the guys we wanted, there you go and on the other side you get S and C stream delta. What it means, so basically if this is K poly stable, this is K poly stable. So in other words there is a finite morphism. Morphism file from the multi-line of this guide to MKPS34 the image of five is going to be two four parameters to opt. And if you remember in the beginning I said how they did the qubit thing, so you just use the same formula here, life is much easier, dimensions too, those numbers are easy to work with, so you use those inequalities. Like we did earlier, this is not complicated at all. So you see that all the phone So all before singularities on limits in M1 over 16 can have order at most four. You also know that the singularities have to be T singular, but we saw the type right here. If you combine these two together, If you combine these two together, you have the least that edge in these limits. The symbol can be A1, A2, A3, or 1 over 4, whatever. And that's time to play with this thing. So you basically argue that these two are impossible because they give one DPU to write their models. Their models and others. So you only have this. In other words, basically that implies that your limits here are of this form. What do you call this? And it's two two four and three elements of five minutes. Before you ask any question, for those who like these things, you also point crossing for these guys. Any questions perhaps? So, are there generations? I mean, if you go in the for instance, hyperlink in the code. It's hyper-elective process. Are there the generations that come from the generations of G4? Mark at the end of the paper, if you use that concept, that is not there would be things. So I mean in the K-mount there would be things that are not uh weighted complete exactions in weight. So hence we still have no expectation. But that just shows you how complicated life will be. This is the first non-Q thing that life is discussed. Sorry, I my voice is down. I woke up at three AM to at night. Body is disconnected from the bed. Yes, yes. Other questions for Abby?
