So, we should be okay now, is it? Yes, perfectly. Yeah, so whenever you say I can start. Yes, please, please stand. Okay, so good evening, everyone, from Europe. This talk is going to be a little bit. This talk is going to be a little bit different from the rest of the talks, I think, but I was asked to talk about this subject. So let's see. This is the outline of my talk. The main idea is that I want to explore the possibility of defining or giving some kind of measure of the strength of the gravitational field, especially in. Especially in vacuum, by using elementary quantities, so just the basic geometric quantities. And so, the basic idea is that I want to know what gravity does. So, we know that gravity is curvature, space-time, but how do this, how does curvature affect the area, the length, the volume, etc. Well, then you can go back to the class. To the classic books, and there is this famous book by Pauli, published in 1921, on the theory of relativity. And then he asks, what is the volume of a sphere? And then he writes this, that this is going to be a complicated function of the radius, which I call L here. But one can expand, and then one gets this kind of expression. And one gets this kind of expression. And here, this calligraphic R is the scalar curvature. This is in a three-dimensional Riemannian molecule. So, this is the scalar curvature of the Riemannian manifold at the center of the bolt. And of course, from here, we need to come get the area also expanding in powers of L. Well, this is Riemannian, but there is some nicer idea. Idea which was written by Feynman in his books. And the thing is that, according to Feynman, the rule that Einstein gave us for the curvature is as follows. If you consider a sphere which is small enough, and then in such a way that the density inside the sphere can be considered to be constant, then the radius excess, and then I will tell you what he meant by that, for the sphere is proportional. For the sphere is proportional to the mass inside the sphere. So, the definition that he used for the excess radius is this one. So, you take the radius minus this expression, which of course gives you the radius in Liberian geometry. Now, this is the notation I am going to use. So, this means the variation of the quantity L keeping A fixed, as we do in in L. Fixed as we do in thermodynamics. And then, of course, we can't rewrite this in this form, given that the row and the density, the mass density is constant. So I just want you to ask you to keep this formula, or rather this one in mind. We will recover this. Now, here n is the mass inside of the sphere. And I haven't told you what, I mean, Pauli doesn't say what is the definition of a sphere. Doesn't say what is the definition of a sphere for him in an arbitrary manifold. And we also don't know why Feynman chose this excess or just the excess in grays to measure the mass. It could have chosen the volume or the area or other things. So these are the first things I want to somehow explain. So I want to recover these sentences by Feynman. By Feynman, and then we will be. I mean, things will be clearer, and then we can be able to go to the case of empty space. Now, what I'm going to do is to use Riemannian normal coordinates. So, near given any point in your manifold, you know that the deviation from flatness can be measured by using this function in Riemann normal code. This function is Riemann normal coordinates. So, here the coordinates are Riemann normal. And then the notation, of course, you have to be careful. These are the components of the Riemann tensor at the base point. So, these are just numbers. I mean, they are the components of the Riemann tensor, but at that point. And the same for this Fourier derivative, etc. And we're going to need this expansion of to order 8 to the 4. Here, eta is the Minkowski metal. Here eta is the Minkowski metric, and this is the notation for my indices. We also need indices for color emissions too. Now, what is the final sphere is very simple in positive space-time. You take a point and then you choose a time-like vector. I mean, at that point, so it's a vector at the tangent space. And I am going to choose it to be normalized. And then you just throw all possible. Just throw all possible geodesics which are at that point with an initial tangent vector of the one up to u. And then, if you follow this now fine parameter L, this will give you a coordinate sphere. But of course, this construction can be done in every space time. So this is what I'm going to do in principle for other spacetimes. So I take a point P and I adapt my coordinates so that this is the origin of the coordinates and I choose a tangent vector. Vector at that point, which is time like an unit at that point. And I also choose the time coordinate to be just aligned with this u. And then, of course, I can take all the vectors which are at p orthogonal to u, and I can throw the space like geodesics. And this will generate also a ball. And of course, given that we are. And of course, given that we are a normal coordinate, the geodesics are just like this, where R is the affine parameter and n is the initial tangent vector at the point P. And then it immediately implies, given that the initial radio orthogonal, that this geodesics live in the hypersetters X naught or T as the constant. So these ends all we have the Have the one, two, three components. And of course, the initial tangent vector I chose to be normalized also at the point t. So this is what I'm saying. These special geodesics define a ball which lives in the hypersurface t equals zero in this particular coordinate. Now the metric on the ball can be immediately written because this x mod equals to zero, so it looks like this. To zero, so it looks like this. I'm just careful with the notation. These are the IKJL components of the space-time Riemann sensor at the point P. Okay. These are not functions. And of course, this will have a boundary which has the local topology of sphere. And you can choose local coordinates there. And the boundary is described by giving radius. So R, which is the assigned parameter. So, r, which is the assigned parameter, you can give the radius as a function of the initial direction, you know, the initial tangent vector n i of theta alpha. Now, of course, this initial unit tangent vectors can be given like this, or if you want, these are the three spin one spherical harmonics. Now, the induced metric on the memory is as usual, and then with this, we can compute things like area and other things. Now, for Now, to compute the volume and to compute the area of the boundary, I have to define first what is the boundary. And then I'm going to do some perturbation. So the first thing I do is I choose, I mean, the R is given that, given 6L plus evaluation. So this means order 1. Of course, given that this is going to be a function on the sphere, it can be expressed. Can on this here, it can be expanded in spherical harmonics. So, what I do is expand this in spherical harmonics. This is just doing this, where these guys here are completely symmetric and traceless. And I am going to take out the pin zero part or the photosymmetric part, or the one the algorithm variation out, because this is the only one which is going to contribute at first level. Review that first order. Now, using the calculation of linear order in the curvature, this is what you get. So, this you can find in the books or other places. So, my notation here is this is V flat. So, this is the volume of a sphere in the flat space-time. You have it here. The same for the area. And then, the difference between the area and the flat version, which I call the first variation of volume and area, is just like this. And here, this and here r is the the scalar curvature of um the the space like t equals zero hypothesis at the point p. That is the spatial scalar parameter. Now, the first thing I want to remark is that as you can see at first order only this part, the spherical symmetric order average. Symmetrical order, average variation enters into the expression. So, all this expansion doesn't matter at this order. The second thing is that we can recover Pauli's remark by just setting this equal to zero. So, if you put this equals to zero, you get the volume and the area exactly as Pauli said. What about Feynman's remarks? Well, for that, we need Einstein's equation. So, this is the nice thing here. So, we can recover the So we can recover the remark by Feynman if we keep the area fixed. You see, if you keep the area fixed, then this gives you an expression for delta L sub one in terms of that. Okay. But then I know that if I use the Gauss equation, that this scalar curvature at the hypersurface can be put into relation with extrinsic curvature and the Einstein tensor of the spacetime. Eigen tensor of the space-time. Now, given my construction, the hypersurface t equals zero is at the point t maximum. So these terms here, the guys of the second fundamental form, do not arise at this point. And then we know that the scalar curvature is just twice the time-like component of the Eisen tensor. And of course, we know that the Eisen tensor is related to the energy momentum tensor via Eisenhold equations and then. Isn't this equation, and then what we get is the variation of the radius. If we keep this area fixed, is actually this thing here. And we can use Einstein's equation, and then we get a final remark, because this is just the mass density. Okay, so this is a way of making sense of those ideas, but of course, we could also But of course, we could also compute this variation of the area by keeping the volume fixed instead of the area. And we will get something which is also proportional to the mass. So what is to be compared here? I mean, we can keep the radius or the area or the volume fixed and see what is the effect on the others. And at this order, all of them are proportional to the energy density of the mass, if you want. So the thing is, what is the good proportion? The thing is, what is the good proportionality factor? And I was just puzzled why Feynman calls the radius excess, but he seems to be right, as I am going to explain later. Now, my main question was, okay, this is very nice. We get the mass. This is a very nice idea that the radius excess or the area deficit has to do with the mass. But what happens if I have? With the mass, but what happens if I am now in a pure gravity situation? So, what happens if I am in a vacuum, but with a gravitational field? Well, then, of course, all these things that I have computed are zero. There is no variation of the area, no variation of the volume. But we also know that the gravitational field has some energy. I mean, it's a field, it's a force of itself, and it also affects. And it also affects the geometrical quantities. So, if we cast any of these relations between the radius of the area, the volume, and mass or energy, then in this situation, maybe we can find some kind of pure gravitational energy density. Or I would rather say something which measures the strength of the gravitational field. Alternatively, this could provide an origin of a positive local energy for the gravitational field. For the gravity synopsis. Now we have to go to the next order in the Riemann normal correlated function, and then the volume and the area of the ball are going to receive corrections with aqualatic on the current. Now, for that, I am going to use the electric magnetic composition of the white sensor, but we already heard that from the previous talk. That was very handy. So now I am at vacuum, which is. And vacuum reaches zero, so the Riemann is the byte sensor. And then, given your time-like vector that you have chosen at the point P, you can define the electrical magnetic part as usual, or do you prefer this as just the zero i zero j component and other components for the magnetic. The completely partial components are in this case of all dimensions just a combination of the electric part. I want to remind you that E and B are traceless and symmetric. So now I have to go to second order, and then the ball is going to be the four because I have a new gravitational field. So what I do is I define the ball as before. So this is the first order. I remind you that this didn't affect in the previous calculation, but it will affect me now. And then I will have a second order. And again, I am going to split this. Am going to split this second-order perturbation into the average one or the very consymmetric one and the one that actually depends on theta at phi. And well, similarly to what happened in the previous case, now this part is not going to affect the volumes, areas of this angle. Artistics. I'm going to prove that. So now, if you do the calculation, this is a boring calculation, but you can do it. This is the area of the balls boundary at this order, so quadratic order. So this is the difference between the flat area and the area. This is the remaining thing coming from order one, which we are going to put equals to zero because we want to keep the area fixed or we don't want any excess there. These are the parts coming from. These are the parts coming from the electric and magnetic parts. So this is my notation. B square and E square are just the squares of the electric and magnetic parts. And then there are these combinations that are coming from the non-spherical isymmetic first-border perturbation. Again, I am using this square as just this square. And the interesting thing is this term, which is in red here. In red here. Now, all these numbers are unknown, and in particular, we are only going to be true, which is 8 over 15. Why I say that this is the interesting term, because this is the cutting between the gravitational field and the deformation. Now, if I don't have any electromagnetic, sorry, any gravitational field, you know, all these terms will also arise. So, these are terms which are actually there. terms which are actually there also in fatter space-time is if I consider a deform ball. But this one is not there, you see. This is actually the coupling between the electric part of the violin and the deformation. And so we see that only the spin to deformation is important at this point. It's a kind of a follow-up thing. So only the spin to deformation gives a different contribution. Gives a different contribution in this case with respect to the things in space-time. Or, in simple words, the only relevant non-spherical deformation of this order is given by the spin tool spherical deformation aligned with the violence, with the electric part of the mind sensor. Or in other words, the electric part of the vibe sensor are telling you how do you have to deform your your ball. Now, if you keep this in mind, then we are going to remove all other first-order perturbations for spin difference from two. We are also going to put the first order thing equals to zero. And then this is just now my definition of the radius of the ball. And as I said, this is not going to be important, but I want just to remember, I mean, to stress that there is this number. First, that there is this number here, gamma, which is a purely pure number, which is the amount of the deformation. So we know that the deformation has to be, I mean, is ruled by the electric part of the right tensor, but we don't know how much. And then this gamma has to be fixed. Now, using the explicit value for B2 for this B2 thing and this deformation with the The formation with the aligned with the electric field, then this is what you get for the difference between the area of the flat area. Now, again, as I said before, I want to remark that only the average second-order deformation of the spherical symmetric second-order deformation is entering here. And when I have different colors, these magenta terms are somehow the second-order variation if you keep the radius. Second-order variation, if you keep the radius constant. If you want to keep the radius constant, this is what you would get. And the red terms are due to the spin to deformation aligned with the electric part of the values. You know, by themselves, only the magnetic attempts, so if you want to keep your radius equals to L constant, this will give you something which is negative definite, so that you will have a deficit which you could maybe call the energy. Called the energy. So then this brings me to a question. So, what is what we expect? What do we want to be a kind of energy now? Of course, we want this thing to have some properties, but the question is whether this combination, for example, has those software. And I will discuss this in a minute, but before that, I just want to show you a couple of things. If I keep the area. A couple of things. If I keep the area constant, then I can get some variation of the radius of second order. This is the average variation of the radius, which looks like this. You can rearrange things in that manner. And also, if you keep the average radius fixed. Sorry, the other thing I want to say is that you can also compute the variation of the area if you keep the average radius fixed, which is. You keep the average radius fixed, which is the only thing you have to keep fixed here because the other part is not contiguous, and you get something which is similar expressive thing. So now the thing is, does any of this formula contain a possible gravitational energy? And I remind you that I still have this dumbbell, which is arbitrary so far. And what should we expect as the correct answer of this quadratic order in vacuum? Okay, so these are the requirements. These are the required properties according to my ideas. So, there are several desired expected properties if you want this to be something which is like quasi-local energy or something like that. Now, it should be positive definite and it should vanish if and only if the curvature tensor vanishes or the vibe tensor. It should be quadratic in the curvature, in this case in the white tensor. It should also be the timeline component with respect to your With respect to your unit time-like spectral you chose of a tensor field. Now, this tensor field should have some properties that ensure that this title component, the thing that you want it to be an energy, propagates in a calculator in the sense that it vanishes. I mean, if it vanishes in the initial slice, it could vanish in the entire domain of dependence. Now, for this to happen, Now, for this to happen, you need two main ingredients. The first thing is you need some control on the divergence, on the tensor field divergence. Now, if you have any field, this is usually true by the field equations, for example, for Maswell and other things. This also happens for gravity. And you also need the dominant property. So, this is the equivalent to the thing called the dominant energy condition. But I mean, for the electromagnetic field, this is not a condition, this is a property, right? The energy momentum tensor of the electromatic field has this property. So, for this tensor that we could have here, we also need this kind of dominant property. This will ensure that the propagation is causal, and also that if you define the momentum with this tensor by removing one of your time-like vectors. Removing one of your time-like vectors from the energy definition, this will point in the direction of the propagation of this energy. Now, if you assume this requirement, then there is a unique tensor with all these properties, which is, of course, the Bell-Robinson tensor. Now, for those of you who don't remember the Bell-Robinson tensor, I can just give you the basic pictures. So, this is the definition in four dimensions. You can also write like this. four dimensions you can also write like this with the dual so this is very similar to f f plus f star star into magnetism it's completely symmetric it's traceless so similar properties again and it has this property which if you apply this to any four future pointing vectors this is always non-negative and this is extremely positive if all of them are time line so this is what we call the dominant property it tells you that the time lack component It tells you that the timeline component dominates over any other component of the sensor. And of course, it also has this property that this covariant becomes heard in vacuum, even with the cosmological function. Okay, now the terminal component of the Berlin-Robinson tensor is E squared plus B square. So the previous formulas that I showed you can be rewritten in this manner. And you see, you get actually a time lag component of the word. Actually, the time-like component of the word of some tensor is d to gamma equals one over 12. G2 gamma equals 1 over 12. Both the excess radius and the area disticit just have this proportionality with the Bell-Robinson super energy or whatever you want to call it. This is nice, but I mean, this is like, if you allow me to say it, like cheating. I mean, I am just saying, okay, let's do Just saying, okay, let's do this deformation and then let's choose this gamma, and then I'm going to get what I want to get. So there should be some kind of other independent ways of arriving here. And the thing is that what I need is to define or to say what is the sphere that I'm going to use. But I have to say that, you know, in advance, not posteriorly. So, and this is very nice because I can provide an independent argument. Because I can provide an independent argument which defines the ball completely independently of the space-time you are using. So the thing is that I'm going to ask that the mean curve vector is constant. I mean, the mean curve vector on your boundary, so on the sphere, on the collimation. I'm going to ask that this is constant on the entire sphere. Of course, if you are in flat space-time or if you're in a space. Flat space-time, or if you are in a clinical space, this immediately excluses the spheres. Okay, if you demand that the mean curve vector is constant on the boundary, this depends the sphere. Now, if you do the computation, and now I'm doing the computation completely in general, so I have put back all my expansion at first order with the spherical harmonics. Then, this is what you get. Then, this is what you get. And here, n is the normal, which is the t equals zero slice. And this is the, of course, the mean curvature at over zero. And then you get all these things here. You see, and now if you want this to be constant, amazingly, this is telling you that you have to put equals to zero all these spherical harmonics with s different from two, and also that you have to choose. That you have to choose y align with the electric part of the y can store and with the proportionality factor, which is exactly 1 over 12. So I don't have to cheat anymore. I have just only to tell you or to provide this intrinsic definition. I am going to call a ball at this order, independently of the space-time, as a thing that I have constructed by this. I have constructed like this, and that has a mean curvature vector constant on the boundary. And then, if I do this, everything is completely fixed. And what I get is this Berl-Robinson quantity with the factors of the radius excess or the area deficit. Okay, so this is just, I mean, collecting the results. So, if you do the calculation. If you do the calculation at first order, so we are not in vacuum, this is what you get. And if you do the calculation in vacuum, at second order, this is what you get, where P000 is now the Belgrade energy. And now you may see that the factors between this and that, and between this and that, agree. In a way, they are giving you the same thing. Now, Now, therefore, one can define the quasi-local energy, or we want equivalent mass at first non-trivial order by just using the average exchange radius. So this would be the formula. The energy is, you have to put this factor to the form of G, and then the variation or the excess radius in average, keeping the area fixed. Area fixed, the area of the boundary. An alternative definition is this one. We keep the average radius fixed and then we compute the deficit, but then we have to put this one over there. Okay, now if you use these definitions, then if you are in any point with matter, this is what you are going to get at first order. But if you are, but and then there is no L to the four, but you L to the four, but you if you are in vacuum, this is what you get where E squared and B squared as the electrical magnetic part to the square. And I want to express that this fixes this number because you may know that there are many, many definitions of quasi-local energy in the market. And in principle, most of them, most of them will give you in vacuum something proportional to the Bell-Robinson paper energy. Some people energy, but this factor is different. I mean, this can be negative for some of them, it can be positive, it can have many, many different numbers. So, if you pass this kind of calculation and this kind of prescription, then this number is fixed. Now, so this will be my prescription to define the energy inside an empty wall, and also not empty, just to. And also, not empty, just a small ball around any event in any space-time. You choose your event and you choose a time-like vector unit there, then you build a tiny special two-sphere around this point. And the boundary of this ball is determined by the constancy of the mid-travecture vector on the boundary. Once you have done that, you compute the area and then you set. And then you set a dot square equals to that and compute the average excess with respect to that. When you have that quantity, you multiply by this number, and then this is what you would call the quotient local energy relative to this observer within your ball around P. Now, this is the basic idea. You can also do this with the deficit area. This is an alternative definition, but it's just the same idea. But it's just the same idea. Okay, now by construction, this prescription gives zero energy to any ball in the flat space-time, which is something some of the problems that quasi-local energies have. And of course, this is also by construction will always give you a non-negative definite energy, which is zero only in flat space-time. But you may be curious about the values of this thing. The values of this thing. So I chose the Kerr metric. Now, for the Kerr metric, if you use, for example, Bougeon linked coordinates, so this R bar and theta bar are just the coordinates of curves metric. I mean, Borgian linked. Then what I do is I'm going to choose any observer which lies in the plane of the two planes. In the train of the two principal malirections of the right tensor, just for example, and to make things easy. And then, if I do the computation, this is what you get. Here, little m is the mass parameter, so this combination here. Capital M is the mass of the kerometric, and of course, A is the angle of momentum parameter. Now, if you are the equatorial plane, or if you are in the virtual, of course, this reduces to this. Course, this reduces to this very simple formula, which I have chosen to write also in this manner because this looks like the gravitational Newtonian Newtonian energy for two masses, one the mass, another this mass with this factor. So here L is the values of the ball and R, of course, is the coordinate. And this, if you want to pass this formula, then of course. Fastest formula, then of course this is only valid if L is much less than R. Now you may be curious about this number. So I did this very simple computation. So if you take a ball with the Earth's variance and you put this ball at one astronomical unit away from the Sun, then the total pure gravitational energy due to the Sun's gravitational field inside this ball Inside this ball is about 120 grams times C square, which is like a small apple. This is nice, the apple, you know, the gravitational apple. And you may compare this with the Earth's mass. Okay, so this is nice, but I was wondering if we could use this in a useful way. So I have been asking around about whether people know how much. Whether people know how much energy was transferred from the gravitational waves measured at LIGO and Virgo to the interferometer. And I didn't find any answer about that. So I was just doing some basic and maybe crazy calculations, but using this definition. And what I do is I am going to assume that they weigh, so for example, we can. So, for example, we can take the first wave, the one from the 14th of September 2015, is a plane wave, which is a good approximation when this arrives the interferometer. I'm going to assume for simplicity that it's linearly polarized, but this is not important. I mean, a user calculation will give you an idea. And here I am using U as a retarded time, but this retarded time is units of length. Units of length, so it's like Ct minus Z or whatever. So, as we know, the signal has an amplitude and a frequency that are increasing in the final stages. They increase somehow in a correlated manner before the ring down. And the signal for this particular one was like 0.2 seconds. So, this is just the construction here. This is the construction here. Now, so given these properties, a very basic way of describing the strain here, this H plus, is just to take an amplitude which depends on time and also the cosine of another thing which gives you somehow the frequency, but also depends on time. And this A and B are increasing in a correlative manner. Relative manner. Now, you see, to compute the above energy that I gave you, I only need to know the right tensor at a given event because everything that I did, all the tensors were at a point P. So I have to choose a point in my space-time. I'm going to choose, of course, the point that they interpolometer somewhere, but the time is going to be at the maximum of the amplitude and the. Of the amplitude and the frequency. So, somewhere here. And I'm going to put u equals to zero at that maximum because this is going to simplify the calculation very, very, very. Now, from the data, we know that the maximal amplitude, so the value of A at zero, because zero is by definition the maximum, was 10 to the minus 21. And then, of course, b of 0 is 0 there. Well, this is quite good. Is zero there, well, this is what we get. Now, it is easily seen if you use my formula that in this case, this is the expression for the, if you want to call it the energy for this quantity. So this depends on the square of the second derivative of this, of the H plus. Now, with this formula, I mean, with this expression for H plus, you can take the first derivative. H plus, you can take the first derivative, and of course, the first derivative is zero at the maximum. And for the second derivative, you do the same, but I insist I only need this at zero. And therefore, all these points, I mean, the sign of B is zero and the B point is zero, so only this thing in blue is going to be relevant. So I only need the second derivative of the amplitude at the maximum. And I have estimated this second derivative. Estimated this second derivative at the maximum like this. So it's like the amplitude times omega over z squared, where omega is the frequency of the gravitational wave. I guess this is a good estimation, but I am not sure. And then you do plug this here, then this is what you get for the amount of energy in the small ball. And of course, one thing I wish to remind. One thing I wish to remark that if you do the calculation with using the pseudo tensors or the things that you find in the books, you know, average of h dot square, well, you are going to get this something different. Now, if I introduce the LIGO-VIGO values, so the frequency at the maximum was 250 hertz, the strength was one times 10 to the minus 21, and then I am using as length. And then I am using as length, well, the arm of the interferometer, which is four kilometers. So, this is my estimation of the energy there, like 10 to minus 4 joules. And I don't know if this has anything to do with the energy transferred to the internal parameter, but I did some other crazy calculations, the naive estimation. So, what I did is I considered a scale of radius. Of radius 1.4 plus minus this 10 to the 9 light years, because this is the estimated luminosity distance to the source, to the pair of black holes that collided. And this shell has this radius and a thickness of 0.2 light seconds, because this is the time that the wave spent in passing through the interferometer. And I assume that this contains three That this contains three plus or minus 0.5 solar masses in energy because this is the total amount of energy related according to the data that they gave us. Then I used prediam geometry to estimate the volume within this scale and then to estimate the energy density, which I assumed is conserved. And I didn't take into account the red shift for anything like that, which is maybe 1.1 faxel. 1.1 factor. So, this is what I get as the energy density inside the cell that crosses the interferometer. And, of course, I can multiply this by a sphere with this radius. And then what I get is this value, which by the way, I didn't know, but apparently, this is something that in the British and other words is called a put ponda. I never heard of that before. But anyway. That before, but anyway, you have to compare this with that. It's not too bad, in my opinion, the disagreement, and also you have to take into account, of course, many factors which I have not taken account. And well, this is basically it. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Jose. So we have time for questions. Anybody who wants to ask something, John. wants to ask something Jose on your ask okay there are no questions for for for Jose I have a question uh this is Alfonso from Spain uh can you hear me Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, you explain what you get when you do the second-order expansion of the area and the volume. My question is, what do you expect to get if you perform a higher order expansion? And also, I would like to ask whether these expansions have been performed. It has not been performed because it's really, really boring. I mean, the calculation is really boring. What I expect to get, I mean, in my opinion, this is only interesting in the case that your white tensor vanishes at one point, but not in the neighborhood of that point. Because if it vanishes in the neighborhood of that point, then I think the calculation. I think the calculation at second order is already fast. But if you want to start with this possibility that the rich tensor is zero and the right tensor is zero at the point, but not around the point for the white tensor, then in my opinion, what you will get is something which is like the super energy tensor of the first derivative of the white tensor, which is a complicated tensor. I mean, it's just the thing that you will construct. Thing that you will construct which has all the good properties of an energy tensor with the first derivative of vile. And in principle, this is a tensor with six indices and it will scale like L to the seven. So this is my guess. So eventually it will depend on the derivatives of the violence of the derivative. Of the derivatives of the electric and magnetic part of the visa at that point, which I am assuming not to vanish, even though the electric and magnetic part do vanish. This is Joseph. So I would like to bounce on your question. What is the energy? Can you hear me? Sorry, I cannot hear you. Can you be closer to the microphone, please? Can you hear me better now? Yes, a little better, yeah. Yeah, so I would like to bounce on this question that you posed me and you posed today, on what is the amount of energy that a gravitational wave would would be leaving on a detector, right? And you want to compare with your with your correct me if this is not exactly the expression, the question you you had. The question you had. But I just wanted to take advantage of the fact that this meeting is precisely putting together relativists from the mathematical relativity scheme of the spectrum to astrophysical relativists to raise the question here. So if someone can enlighten on this point, that's it. Yes, please formulate the question as you think is well posed. Is there anyone that comment on this? Well, I just want to know this. I mean, if there is any estimation of the energy transferred from the gravitational wave to the interferometer, which must be a very, very tiny quantity of the entire wave because the wave has been has still propagating around the universe, so it just left a little. Just left a little, little amount of energy in the interferometer. And I want, I would like to know if there is a kind of estimation of that. Yeah. So I don't know if there is an estimation of that, but perhaps think of the wire tensor as the thing that exerts a force on the end masses and causes the displacement. That could perhaps be used to sort of get an estimate for the energy that the ideal detector. Energy that the ideal detector would have. This is somehow what they have done. I mean, what they have computed is the square of the white tensor. So assuming that this is the plane wave with some property. But it could not be the square. So the white tensor itself would be the thing that causes the force, right, on the masses. Okay. Yeah. Maybe. I think it would be interesting to compare, but I'm not. Would be interesting to compare, but I'm not so I don't think anyone has a comment, yeah. So, yeah, so I am asking a question to the audience and to the world. But Jose, just a quick question. I mean, the thing is that you looked at this energy and four kilometers, total energy contained in four kilometers. That would not be the energy that the detector has received. Be the energy that the detector has received, right? Because it's really the test masses which receive it. So, to me, there's a, I mean, so if you there's some orders of magnitude difference between the detector size or location of detector versus four kilometers. So, therefore, you know, you had this agreement between the two estimates of energy, one, you know, coming from when it was emitted, and then what was. emitted and and then what what is in the detector uh that i don't think is has much to do with the what the what the test masses actually uh receive right i mean i mean it's related to what badri was saying but yeah i mean yeah i mean i am aware i mean in a way the numbers that i have written are like it will be like um maximum Maximum, I mean, like, I mean, the thing should be less than that because I am somehow estimated this is here, and I, of course, the parameter is not sphere, it's just something plain. But I just wanted to see the, I mean, an estimation, which I guess it can give you a maximum value of the but I mean, if we could somehow have an actual number. Number, maybe then we will be not, we will not be blind of how to look for this number in a orientation or something like that. But I mean, I agree, yeah. But I guess this measurement is not a calorometric measurement, you know, like some particle physics, particle astrophysics measurements in which energy transfer is directly measured. It is really the displacement. So, as Badri was saying, is really. So, as Badri was saying, is really the tidal force. So, that's the linear in the y times the etc. So, yeah, but I mean, yeah, the measurement is just different here in this case. What I have done is to define a kind of energy of the tidal force. I mean, it's not the energy if you want of the gravitational field, but if we believe that the tidal thing is what is measurable, then this is like the energy of that. Okay, we still have some time for questions and discussion. If anybody has any other question, please ask. If not, then let's thank José again. Thank you very much for this very much. You very much for this very good talk. And now we will pass now to Daniel. Daniel, are you there? I'm here, yes. I don't know if you can hear me. We can hear you, but so you are going to present online or you are in presential?
