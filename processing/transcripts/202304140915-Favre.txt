Alright, so let's come on for a second talk today. And the next speaker is Charles Ba and he will speak on polarization of pseudo-automatic. Thank you very much. Thank you first for the webinar, for all of us here to this beautiful country and national park. So then, so I have an apology because my talk is going to be very much algebraic in nature. And there will barely be anything except title. Okay, so this is a joint project with Alexander Markus and Solav, who's working at the Steklova Institute in Moscow right now. And the problem is to try to And uh the problem is to try to understand the difference between barational maps and automorphisms. So let me uh explain you a little bit uh what the setup will be. So let me recall what the birational map is. So you fix uh x, a smooth projective variety, let's have dimension d and we're going to assume it's defined over c, for example still. So what is a birational map? Well this is so I'm going to consider birational self-map of x and this Of x. And this is given by a graph. So gamma is a subvariety of dimension d, which is irreducible on the products x cross x, such that when you look at the first projection and the second one, i1 and pi2, they are all barrettomorphism, which means that they are isomorphism over an open-ariskend subset. Okay, so once you have a barrettal map, there are two important sets, subsets that play a very specific role. So the indeterminacy locus. So, the indeterminacy locus, which is a set of points for which the image has a positive dimension. So, here it's a set of points in X such that the image over pi 1 is as dimension as this point. And then the exceptional locus, which is a set of hyper surfaces that are contracted to lower dimensional subverts. So, when F has no point of intrinsic in this reverse also, then F is an automorphism. When F has no exceptional local F has no exceptional locus, and it's a result also, it's called a pseudo-atomorphism. In that case, we can find F is going to induce an isomorphism from U to V, where U and V are upper and direct dump set whose complement has co-dimension at least two. Oops. Yeah, here. Okay, so the set of Barcelona set map forms a group, and then you have these two sub-groups. So the set of group of pseudo-automorphism and automorphism. Pseudo-automorphism and automorphism. So, what I'm going to be interested in is to try to understand what is the difference between these two groups somehow. So, let me make a definition. So, pick a barrage map on your favorite projective verity x. So, you're going to say it's regularizable if you can conjugate it by some baraschal map to an automorphism. Okay, so in other words, if there exists a barachal map. So in other words, if there exists a parational map from y to x, so y again is smooth and predictive, such that the lift of f to y, so this wonderful map phi minus 1 copy is regular. So you can define similar way the notion of being a pseudo-regularizable with when well f index y, so this map is not a pseudo-automatic. Okay, so yeah, so true observations is that Yeah, so true observations is that thanks to Hironica and his followers, so you can always assume here that if f is regularizable, then you can always assume that y is. And also there is a small observation that f is a clinical property, if you want. F is regularizable if and only if one of its iterations. Okay, so the questions I'd like to address two questions. So given a birational map, Even a virational map, is it possible to decide whether or not it's regularizable or pseudo-regular? So, in fact, what I'm going to do next is to take a pseudo-automorphism, so it's already very close to be an automorphism and try to decide whether it's an outregularizable or not, which is something which is a bit more subtle. Okay, so let me give some constraints. Okay, so you pick, so you Okay, so you pick your favorite variational map on your favorite priority, and then you try to see whether it's a regular export or not. So as we're going to see, there are two sets of, let's say, this joint constraint. One, the first set of constraints comes from the geometry of X. Sometimes there is no variational map. All variational maps are actual automorphism. And then of course, when you're working, when X is a projective plane, a borrowed space in general, then you have plenty of. Space in general, then you have plenty of partitional maps, so then the constraints are more dynamical in nature. So, okay, so let me discuss these geometric constraints. So, the first observation is that if f is birational, it has a point of intimate c, so lies in this I of F, then its image is in fact covered by rational curves. So, if it appears that your variety has no rational curves, well, then it has to be, f has to be an automorphism. So, of course, I'm receiving equation. So of course P to the D and Halplatier version occurs. But if you take X to be an abelian variety or a compact complex torie, so C to the T, nonetheless, some more compact like this here, then the bar, I mean any barational map is automatically. So later on we're going to look at families of abelian vertices. And so most, I mean, on the cell where part of the manifold, which is called by Ebelinver. The manifold which is covered by Eibel inverted, you won't have rational curves, and so the indetermincy locus is going to be very simple. Okay, so second simple observation: if the kinetical class is zero or portion, then you don't have any, you cannot have any, you're not a smooth variety, so you cannot not have any critical set, and so you cannot have any uh contracted uh hypersurface, and so the any variable map is a pseudo automorphism. Barrestle map is a pseudo-automorphism. Okay, so then you have two, you have more, I mean, a deeper reason for regularizability. For instance, so there is a theorem by Kubayashi and Chi that say that if X is, let's say, of general type, so it means that the canical class is ample, then the group of Barretto transformation is in fact finite. So it's connected to the fact that more or less x is. To the fact that more or less X is a hypotenuse. So if it's finite, then you can show that any finite group of Parison transformation is in fact regularizable. And even deeper reason, geometric constraints, so I'm just mentioning this one. So sometimes you have final varieties, so they're very close to be rational, but still the group of birats of transformation is equal to the group of automorphism. Okay, so this the most famous example, the case. The most famous example, the case of the smooth album surfaces of degree n and pn for n agreed up quantum. Okay, so let me turn now to dynamical constraints. So again, the problem is the following. So you have parational map on X verte verti, and you want to try to understand when or whether or not it is conjugated by a baracial map to some automorphism. So the main So the main constraint that arises in this setting comes from looking at the set of dynamical of degrees of iterates or dynamical degrees. I think it has been introduced a couple of times already in this conference, so let me do it again. So here to define first the degree, so you fix any ample line bundle on X. So if you want to embed X into P N and then L is a restriction of a hyperpowered hyperpoint. A hyperplane class and F is your birational map. And so you look at the degree of F is computed by, so when L is an upper line bundle, you can look at its first-gen class, its class in, let's say, H2 or H11 or in the numerous space, depending whether you're more on the topological side or an algebraic one. And then you can pull it back by F and take its intersection with the. And take its intersection with the C1 of L to the right power. So appear it's not completely clear how to define the pullback line bundle by a rational map. So what you do is, okay, well, quick. So you use the diagram I drew before. Well, you pull back. So remember that pi 1 and pi 2 are the two projections from the graph to x and y. Two projections to. Two projections to the two functions of x. Sorry, f is from x to x. And so you replace the full back by f of 1 of l by pi 2 star, and then the other one by pi 1 star. So you compute everything in gamma. If you don't like gamma because it's singular, which might happen sometimes, well take a resolution of it and compute everything on the resolution of singular edges of gamma. Okay, so there's this theorem by Dean and Simoni, which gives you some basic information. Which gives you some basic information of the behavior of the degree of iterates of F. So it says basically that if you change, if you conjugate A by some birational map and then you change your line bundle by any other ample line bundle, then the degree growth are always comparable. Okay, so well it's written here. So Y is your new model, V is your marginal map from Y to X. Comparison map from y to x. Ly is the online bundle. So, what you do is that you have your clinical system on x and f, and then fy acts on y. Then you compute the degrees of the fn on one side, on the other side of fny. So it's found from above and from below by some positive constants. The second remark is that, so what does it mean in particular, if phi is the identity and then you change the ampaline bundle, this means that this degree growth is essentially the same. Is essentially the same to bounded constant. And the second observation is that this sequence of degrees of iterates is some multiplicative of two bounded constant, and so you can define the following limit using a Feketti's lemma, which is called the dynamical degree, or here the first dynamical degree. So there are higher dynamical degrees, where instead of pulling back just the first-gen class, we drag the first change class to the power. Apply the first class to the power k and so on. So I'm just going to consider the first dynamical. Okay, so I could have discussed the dynamic constraint for f to be regularizable also in the case where lambda one is equal to one. But I'm going to to uh state our main theorem in in that setting, so when the dynamical uh degree is greater than one. So I'm going to discuss all that in that particular. To discuss all this in that part here. Okay, so suppose that F is so what I'm going to say is that if F is an automorphism, then lambda one of F is very special. So suppose that F is an automorphism on some projective variety, okay? Then you can look at its action on H2, let's say with real coefficients, and it's not difficult to show that the first dynamical degree is in fact the spectral reduce of this linear operator. Linear operator. Okay, on this fine-dimensional other curse. In other words, this is a maximum of the Modelite of Lambda, where lambda ranges over all eigenvalues of XF. But now on this high-dimensional real vector space, you have a lattice, which is the image of H2X inside. And this lattice is fixed by your automorphism. It's actually. It introduces an isomorphism on this lattice. And so this implies that lambda 1 of f is algebraic integer of degree at most the rank of this H2 expression. So in fact, since F star is the isomorphism of the lattice, it is actually a unit in this ring of integer. So two consequences. So suppose that f is regularizable, then it means that it's going to be an atomorphism in some model, and so lambda one of f has to be like this, unique in the ring of integer of some number of field. So if you do uh the contract of this, so if you suppose that lambda one is greater than one and it's either an integer or trusted and top, then definitely f cannot be regularizable. F cannot be regularizable. Okay? The Henel map is not regularizable. I mentioned the Henel map once in the last one. Why is it so? Well, the degree of the dynamical degree of the Henel map is an integer which is greater than one, so it cannot be realized. So I'm not sure who meant who realized this for the first time. Maybe Habar? I don't know. Okay. Maybe you. Maybe you okay someone yeah but the fact of not not being able to find a model in which F becomes an antomorphism I guess it's implicit in Herbert's work okay so two remarks this uh so there is a a paper by Canta Deserti and Chie that say the following so if you pick any barrel map of You pick any Barrational map of degree T, and if you post-composite by a generic automorphism of Pn, then lambda 1 of A composite F is equal to T. What it means, that if you take any parational map of Pn of a fixed degree, at least 2, for generic A, then it's not regularizable. And then there's also this result by Bailey, Dilak, Johnson. Bell Dino-Johnson and Higger that say that well there exists some verasual map of P3 with a transcendental atomical degree, and so for this these maps then also it cannot be regular map. Okay, I have to check the time thirty five okay. Okay, so now you can look at more of finer constraints on these dynamical degrees. So you have to understand that essentially in dimension two, the question of deciding whether a map is a parasite map is regularizable or not is very well understood. So, okay, so let me state only two theorems, two results. So if f is regularizable, then we Variable, then we prove with Jeff that lambda one is dynamical degree either a quadratic integer or it's a salon number. So Salem number means that it's an algebraic integer. So let me draw here the unit circle. So if you look at the, so you have a saline number is a real number such that is Such that is Galois conjugate or one over lambda one and all the other ones on the units are okay and then you have this partial converse by Blanc and Pontal that says that if number one appears to be a solid number then in fact it's a regular estimate. Then there are some partial results in higher dimension but not that much, but many. Much many, and some more interesting or more definite ones are dimension three that were made by Delico Loblank. Okay, so as I said at the beginning, I'm interested in, so I'd like to focus on pseudo-atomorphism. So my question is: pick a pseudo-atomorphism and try to understand whether it can be regularizable or not. So people have looked at this problem. But for the moment, we know only of two sets of examples where we can prove that some pseudo-atomorphisms are actually not regularizable. So, what is the problem? The problem is that you cannot really use this because for a solo automorphism, again, it's going to define an action, linear action on H2, and again it's going to be an isomorphism on the lattice. On the lattice. So you cannot just use this simple remote. So still, so there is a paper by Petfor, Conta and Keen. They were looking at a set, so I didn't write the formulas, but they were looking at a countable set of examples of pseudo-automorphism. And they were able to show that for any element in this set, in fact, there exists a surface which is invariant by the dynamics and over which the dynamics. The dynamics and over which the dynamical degree of the restriction is not good. It's not a sign number, it's not productive number, in fact, it's a piece of number. And so, by using the constraint that we had in dimension two, we concluded that this pseudo-atomorphism cannot be regularizable. And then there is also a recent result by Alexander Kuznet-Sovan. So, she looked at a family of pseudo-atomorphism and duals and Of pseudo-atomorphism on dwarves of P3 that were introduced by Chere Meblanc. And she proved that, so she was not able to prove that for all these examples they are not regularizable, but for a generic, so it's, I don't remember, I mean, how many parameters you have, but quite a few, and she was able to prove that for generic parameters, then this pseudo-atomorphism were not regularizable. And the techniques there is slightly Slightly more complicated. So the point is that she was able to show that there exists an invariant class, which is this class theta. So that satisfies the following equation. So f star of theta is equal to lambda theta. So theta is the neuron series space of X. And what turns out is that this class is not an F. If F would be an automorphism, that it has. Would be an automorphism that it had to be net. So she was able to find a curve, a rational curve on X that intersects negatively theta. So it's not a contradiction, it does not tell you that it's not recognizable because maybe what you can do is to flip this curve. So what it means is that you plug that curve and contract another direction, and then for some wonderful reason, then this sign has changed. Okay, so this is something that appeared quite classically in a dimension, a hierarchical. Between a dimension of higher equal to three. But here, what she proved is that in fact, this curve is somehow not invariant. So, even more, so she could find a point in that curve with infinite backward orbit. So, the key is, so finding this curve is easy, and then finding this point is very, very difficult. So, it is not very easy. Orbit, center, infinite orbit is not inside of C. Yeah, yeah, outside yeah, outside of C. Sorry. Okay, so let me come now to the main setup or main object of interest for me. So I try to discuss this problem of regularizability in the case of families of abelian varieties. So what I said before is that if you have an abelian variety which is a productive manifold, which is a Which is a compact, complex tori, then any barational map is actually regular. Okay, so then you don't have anything to do. But we are going to consider families of such things, and then the problem becomes much more interesting. So the setup is as follows. So X is the smooth complex manifold direction D plus 1 by fibers over the open unit disk T and you are going to assume. And we're going to assume that this map pi is proper, is a submersion over the punctured disk. And we're going to fix some relatively ample line bundles. So what does it mean? It means that if you look... So if you look at the fiber XT or 0.0, and it comes with a mechanical embedding if you want in TN. So you have to think of this as a one-parameter. Think of this as a one-parameter family of hypers or hyper subference, sorry, of algebraic sub-varieties in some p-n. So, again, so xt is a compact, complex torus. So, abbeyn here means that it is also projective. So, I'm going to assume, so when you have a torus, you have a group load, and I'm going to assume that you have a zero section. This is not really important here, but it's just to make itself definite. And let me consider Meromorphic map from X to X that fibers over pi over this. So in other words, you're considering a one-parameter meromorphic family of automorphism of abelian variants, okay, that might degenerate to central fibrin. And so the And so the question is here whether or not it's possible for F to be or to decide when F is regularizable or not. Okay, so to state our main theorem, let me make a couple of more comments. So XT is a compact complex torus. So it's a quotient of some linear space, let's say C to the D, but low some co-compact lattice, lambda of G. And then T and then F T, since it's a at least it fixed the zero section, it's a morphism, so it can lift to C to the D at the linear line. So the situation is like this. You have C to the D, which is your fixed vector space, and then inside this, you have your concompact lattice that moves homomorphically with the parameter T. And at the same time, you have a linear map, UFT, that is that sends, that is. Is that sense that is an isomorphism on this lattice and that move also holomorphically. Okay? So everybody is moving homomorphically. And so in particular, these linear maps, UFT, they have essentially the same conjugacy class. At least they have the same eigenvalues. Okay, so let me denote them by row one, row two, row D. So they don't do not depend on the on the parameter t. Okay, so they're all conjugate one together. They're all conjugate one to the other. And you can easily check that well in that in this condition, you can compute all the animical degrees of ft on xt. So in particular, the first dynamical degree of ft is equal to the norm of rho 1 to the square. So okay, so essentially, so what is u f t is the action on h1, right? And so here, if you lambda one is kind of So here if you, lambda one is connected to the action on H2 and so you have to h1 way to h1 bar and so this is why you get round to this work. Just ask you to give you an example where I get interested in the smartphone. Well you're going to see some afterwards. So in fact what you have to understand we know basically all examples and they come from arithmetic constructions. You'll see. So, yeah, well, I didn't say anything, so for now I'm fine. I'm going to state the theorem and the claim is that the theorem is non-empty, applies to a non-trivial function. Okay, so what is the main result? Okay, let me put it here. So, I'm going to talk about models of maybe tools. Okay, so let me take The main system is like this. So you take a meromorphic family of atomorphism on probized epidemiology. So it's just as before. So you have a one-parameter family of a compact complex tori, but all projective, together with a one-parameter family of automorphism. But then the term is that both the map and the appendicular T could degenerate when t goes to zero. So you can acquire some singularities, a lot of things. Lot of things. Okay, so now the basic assumption is that we're going to assume that lambda 1 is greater than the dynamical degree of the restriction to generic fiber is greater than 1. Even more, we're going to assume that none of this eigenvalue here is the root of unity. If there is one, well, in fact, you can split up to isogeny, you can split your value into products so you can It into products so you can get back to the cheating a little bit here. So the following are equivalent. So, first, F is regularizable. And second is that, in fact, if you're, I mean, is that the family does not generate. That is, the abelian variety, when t goes to zero, in fact, x0 remains in the abelian variety. So, okay, it's not, it stays bounded in the moduli space of aberrant. In the moduli space of abelian vertices, if you need. Okay, so let me discuss a little bit more what I mean by maybe regularizable and the statement here. So to make sense out of this, we consider models of family of epilum vertices. So what is it? So this is again, so this is this thing y over d. So it's a smooth manifold dimension d plus 1 blah blah blah. Manifold dimension d plus one, blah blah blah, together with a rational birational map or bimeromorphic map from y to x, such that this diagram is commutative. And also, I'm going to assume that phi is an automorphism over the punching disk. Okay, and so here I'm insisting on this because it will appear later as being crucial: is that the central fiber for y is not necessarily proper. Okay, so when I say that f When I say that f is regularizable, it means that you can find a proper model such that f extends as an automorphism of one. So we're going to see in a moment that there is always a non-proper model over which this map extends to automorphism. So here it's very important for y to be proper. And so here what I explained is that you might have also, so if f is a regular. Havel. So if f is regularizable, it's not necessarily the case that even after blowing up, blowing down, and so on, you can have y0, x0 to be abelian, because maybe you have done some finite group questions. And so you have to do a base change to do this. So regularizable, it's if and only if, in fact, the family abelian vertex does not generate. not generate this is the upshot examples okay so there are basically two uh i mean easy easily described family of examples so one is like this so uh you take e of t your favorite family of elliptic curves uh d is uh is some integer numbers and you take a matrix in sl d of z okay and so now the family okay I didn't write it The family, okay, I didn't write it down, but so the family Xt is going to be Et to the power T. So the T power of ultra elliptic curve. And so what is this? Well, okay, so E of T is the C model, some compact lattice. And probably I should have written U of F T in my previous notation. Okay, so you have X1, XD, 2. You have X1, XD to image by the action of these things, and A is preserving this big lattice, which is a product lattice in C to the T. Okay, so the third tells you this. If you want this family of automorphism to be regularizable, well, this happens if and only if the elliptic curve does not degenerate. So, what does it mean? It means that the J function extends homomorphically through the origin. Origin. Okay, so then there are plenty. In fact, you have plenty of construction using so well and Shimura's results. So in fact, for abelian variety, we know basically all of its endomorphism. Okay, there is a classification. I'm very quick here. There is a classification given abelian variety. Adeline variety, okay, you can describe what are the possibilities for all endomorphism of this addal variety, up to isogeneous and up to some, at least in the case where, yeah, in general, at least in the case where the varieties are simple. So here I'm just taking that the simplest case, which is not a product. Okay, I'll explain this. So it's a bit of arithmetic nature. So you take K, a number field, so a finite extension of Q. Extension of Q. So if you want K is generated by one element, alpha, and you're going to assume that let me call alpha 1 alpha D, it's of degree D over Q. Let me call alpha 1 alpha D the Kawa conjugate of alpha. I'm going to assume that they're all real. Okay, so this is what is called totally real 3D extension of Q. And I'm going to fix. And I'm going to fix a unit μ inside the ring of integers. So ring of integers, so it means that μ, the minimum polynomial of μ is over Z is modic, and its constant coefficient is there plus or minus 1. And so one knows by direct play that there are plenty of such examples, at least when K is not equal to Q. So when D is a greater equal to T to Q. Okay, so now. Okay, so of course you can think, okay, let me embed OK directly inside RD. So we know that it is lattice. Unfortunately, it is not a complex lattice. Okay, so we're going to look at two copies of Rd. So the construction is as follows. So you pick D element inside the upper half plane. So H is the upper half plane in the complex plane. So Z1 to Zd have the imagery part positive. Then you look at lambda. Then you look at lambda z. So lambda d is a lattice which is in C to the D, which is thing like this. So alpha and beta are two elements in the ring of integers. Okay, so alpha one, alpha two, alpha d, beta one, beta two beta are the gamma conjugate of these numbers. And then you look at all these images like this, so alpha one plus beta one, z1, and so on and so forth. So you can check that this is co-compact like this in CD, even more. Like this in Cd, even more than the quotient, which is compact, complex torus, is abelian. So it means that it is projective. And then what is the automorphism here? Well, it comes from the unit. So you're multiplying in each variable by the conjugates of your original unit. You can check that this is an isomorphism lambda z, and so it defines an automorphism on xz. And what is the dynamical degree of that guy? Degree of that guy. Well, this is the maximum of mu i to the square. Okay, so now you have a family parametrized by h to the d. h to the d is not really projective, but what you can do is that in fact you can remark that if you quotient by PCL2 of O of K, so you take a matrix, two pi two matrix in O of K, and you have K embeddings, so it acts like an Like an element of the membrane by members remote inside any factor here of H. And this quotient now is a quasi-trojective variety, which is called a Hilbert elemental vertical, so let me call this HK. It's quasi-projective. And in fact, so it's a theorem that it can be compactified as a projective variety by adding only finitely many points. I only find too many points. So this has, okay, I don't remember what is the dimension of this guy, but when D is equal to 2, I know that this is a surface, so let me conjecture many dimensions. This is equal to D. So I find how many points, which are like cusps. Okay, and so the previous term tells you what is a family of automorphism, etc. This is just a Etc. This is just a map from the punctured disk to that Hilbert modular variety, right? And if you want F to this family to be regularizable, it means that the map, the image of zero is not one of this discussed. So just one remark here is that even D for D equal to two, you have a surface and the single point. And the single point, so that the point that you're having here only in fact number. So you can find like a compact family of such things. So what I'm saying here is that you can actually find compact family of atomorphism for which the fiber is moving inside the moduli space. That is not isotrival. So it's something that you couldn't see in dimensional. Something that you couldn't see in dimensional. Okay, so maybe I'm already eight minutes. Eight minutes. Eight slides. What? 16. 16 slides. Okay, so let me give an idea of the proof. So in fact, it's a combination of understanding the theory of degeneration of ecclesiastes and knowing what is the dynamical degree. What is the dynamical degree in top tuning the dynamical degree? Okay, so I'm not going to review what is the theory of abundant model because I'm completely unable to do this. But what you have to understand is that, so in the situation of a family of polarized abilent variety, then there is one favorite model, which is called the Nero model. So it was built by this guy in Nero and a French mathematician from Yeah, a French mathematician from so the theorem is from the 50s, right? It's not a Roman Empire. Okay, and so it was then extended to Renault and Monfort. So the problem with this model, it's a very nice model that has a universal property that I'm not going to describe. And in particular, this implies that when you look at the more family of automorphism, it's going to extend as automorphism. It's going to extend as automorphism to this model, but this model is non-property. Okay, so it's not because you have this that it solves my problem, because I would like to, in fact, so what I would like to understand is that there exists a compactification of the neural model for which Fn remains an automorphism, does not acquire some point to S. So, this universal property gives you a second thing. So, what you do is this. So, what you do is this, right? So, you suppose, okay, so you want to prove you probably want to prove that one implies two. So, I didn't say, but if two is valid, then f is realizable automatically. So the only non-trivial implication is one implies two. So, you suppose that f is actually an automorphism of x. Okay, you want to say that, okay, maybe after blowing up, blowing down the. Maybe after blowing up, blowing down the central fiber and doing base change, X0 is the abelian variant. So, this is what you want to do. So, the first thing is that if you look, so you look at on X, F is an automorphism. So, let me remove the, so you look at the central fiber in X, X0, it might have a lot of irreducible components. Okay, it might have some singularities also. And XSM may. And XSM means that I remove all the singularities. And the universal properties say that you have a regular map feed from XSM to the neural model. Okay, and the second, so I'm cheating here, have to already do base change. Second thing is that in the neural model, we know very well what's going to happen for the central fiber. So it's not necessarily abelian, but which is what we say semi-abelian. So it's an extension of an abelian. Extension of an abigolent variety by, okay, I should not have written Gmk, it's going to scare you, but Gm is C star. Okay, so it's an extension of C to the D by some compact, complex, co-compact sorry lattice by C star to some k. And the fact that this extends to a smooth family, it's just saying that N0, in fact, is abelian. So it means that you don't have this factor. So now what I'm going to do is to analyze all this situation to fix the idea only in dimension 2. So in higher dimension you have to play with not only the first dimensional degree, but all dynamical degrees, but the argument is the set. Okay, again, so neither fiber or two dimensional. So you tell me like 4, 3, 2, 1. Stop, okay. Don't let you be out of time. So the fibers are of two-dimensional. The fibers are of two-dimensional, so f is an automorphism, and lambda one is greater than one. Okay, so first, the first thing is that since you have a family of automorphism, so up to replace f by some iterates, you can assume that only residual components of the central fiber are fixed. Okay, so the first observation is that you can at this point one, so which is fixed, and for which the dynamical degree of the restriction is equal to dynamical degree. Of the restriction is equal to dynamical degree of nearby fibers. Okay, so this is so it doesn't mean that for all of them this is true, but at least you can find one. And now you're going to see what's going to happen to this component in the neural model. So you're going to look at its image in the neural model. So let me call it Z. So since E is a component of your denomination of surfaces, it has dimension 2. So you have three possibilities. Z is a point. Z is a point, a curve, or is a component of the neural model of Z. So let's look at the point where the dimension of Z is 0 or 1, so either a point or curve. So what's going to happen is that, so suppose that D is a point. So E is mapped by some barrel map to a point. So in fact, you can say that E has been obtained by blowing up this point. But now this point. This point, but now this point is inside the neural model where F is an automorphism. So, okay, so what's happening is that E is some P2 and in fact the action of F on E is linear. So the dynamical degree has to be equal to 1. Now when Z is a curve, this is the same because when D is a curve, it's fixed by the dynamics. So the diametrical degree on the curve is 1, and the fibers are not. Is one and the fibers are now P1 and again the relative dynamical degree of one. So there is a formula by Dean and Corthurst telling you again that dynamical degree is equal to one. So okay, so it's not possible. So it means that in fact that component for which the dynamical degree is equal to dynamical, it's greater than one, has to be one component of the neural model. Good. So now, okay, you look at you again my contradiction. Again, by a contradiction. So, suppose that the central fiber of your neural model is not compact, it's not abelian. Okay, it's semi-abelian. So, I have two cases. Let me look at one of the extreme cases where Z is a torus of C star to the square. But then what you do is that, so you have a degeneration of abiland verity with these linear maps in the background, and for which you understand the eigenvalues, and degenerate to some more physical. To some morphism on C to the square, so you again have some linear maps that's lurking in the background, and in fact, the eigenvalue are the same. But now, the dynamical degree on the generic fiber is modulus of the largest eigenvalue to the square, whereas the dynamical degree on the torus on the star to the square is just the modulus of the eigenvalue. So, since it's greater than one, it cannot be equal. Okay, and I think I'm done, so that's a control. Okay, and I think I'm done, so that's a contradiction.
