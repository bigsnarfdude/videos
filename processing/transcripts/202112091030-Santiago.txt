Y puedemberlas depositidosín. Yes, well much Felipe and some disclaimers to see this platica. This platica is a little distinct as. It is a little distinct as medical investigation work in the industry of 5 years of produced. It is an invitation to the financial industry as an alternative doctrine or in the extraneous work. And the idea of this platform is exponent three problems. Three problems, rapidly three problems with many attacks, but other problems that attack cooperative bank and one of the cooperative banks, and two of us in the bank of inversion to what medical channels. And first disclaimer: the second is obviously this platform, and not represent in. Vista and representan Pedro that Citigroup, one of my anteriors, and only explain the problems and a general colour to resolve obviously how problems durante work. So, with two claracions, can This plateau will give a very introduction to this alternative to mathematics in the extraneous industry and the financial banks. And one of the modulations of the paradox segment of correlation also models of correlation and the And the terror the model of the futures of petrol futures, all problems to a description, and possible alternatives of solution also explain some of the rights that practices our practices in relation to resolving problems between a context. And we will turn with final comments to the labor of context that is what I say as an alternative to work for mathematics. So, Well, also, first of all, financial affairs is amplified, and we have many different sectors, we have three great sectors on the banks, the embers institutions as hedge funds, and pensions, and private equity, and the stock exchange. Then, through the banks, also subsections that are the commercial banks, the individuals, as Individuals, like I said, corporate banks, that refer more corporations and empress very peculiar media and present media, and the bank in person. And the problems that I commented on the idea is when the first here, the second here in my experience, also works in the commercial bank, but the corporate bank. My passion to the cooperative and finally controlled and passed with the first problem. The first problem is of the problem to describe the circumstances of a vision, and in this case, we can speak in a corporation, but. But this problem is puedar in the context of the commercial bank, a individual or inclusive puedemar in a hypoteca, or a para comprar somewhere. So, that in general, the vida du unrestamo, which is and can pass things in when clientele in question and. In question, and the corporation or individual corporation and offer is performing, which is the clientele or individual, and this vibration. So, if you are performing not all this perfect, but if we are at default, then we are in a process of administration and depending on this process, we are. This process will have a cura sixteen unaccurra, well, regret performing, all if you don't log a cura, other processes that are a process of corporation where this legal component and also financier, and this process finally is ours, if the hugo. Perdida, if the entonces aquípoemos think that the vida of this entonces are various candidates that to the analysis interest, the first is here the probability of default. So the probability data cuel quietamo de que vallamos astre cuadro de default despued una bes que yá estamos aquí este la segunda cantidad. The second candidate is exposure to default that is exactly when we are exposed to the moment of default. That obviously can be the millions. So default, so the exposition evidently are 80%. So the exposure can be called. And finally the loss that defaults one is that this is the process of recooperation when respect to what includes gas administration, gas legal, etc. So the default can be exposed to 200, you can see. So quarantine. These three are like analysis quantitative analyses, and in particular, we concentrate in this candidate that as explained all the data of the default. The part of the default. This is the model more sensible of how the part of experts that simply multiplicand these candidates that are and one more decision. One three estimations and multiplication and that is my experience. And we will color. Toleramos or van color for Cada por estamos que tiene. So, how do you concentrate in the candidate that also put one recoberción? So, the men who recover. And how this recoveration is first obviously in the industry, we have data this una distribution. This is a typical distribution of cooperation, data from the Italian banks, are 25 commercial banks, and that are prestamos, cadaver, we are individual. So that's when this is a typical recuperation, clearly we are modal that. And we have intermediate culture. So, this type of distribution, and how we idea a form of typical region. And the typical regression. And for this, we think in what our work we want, but what the factors of factors consider to model recuperation, and we have factors continuously and also discretion that depend on the type of people, and the podemosar, we are talking about corporations, we can spend in data that has. Data queen to cerca of financials of these empress if we expensive in individuals the status of status, what is their value, we speak in if you have collateral in case of a protein, we have an evaluation of evaluation of the casa or the terror so the usem to model this variable and the forma pose models of typo regression so immediately can be in models of regression of typo logic logic or typo probit. O typo provides how we enlarge our data, including the sero yellow and continuum, so obviously require a little more queue the typical model logic and probit, an option to inflate vitamins that vase the distribution vita and that is. And that is here. So the idea of this is usar also the extremes, error. So we are the masses of probability in 0 and in the mass ponytail in the continuum. So it's a little more complex. And the estimation that can serve for a maximum likelihood estimation is a alternative and it is a queue. We can resolve it, and we can estimate this quantity. Algunas from the practices that we have to resolve is the selection. Resolve is the selection of the model, the selection of variables, and the frequency of the estimation, and some of the designs are that many data incompletes, we have a number of default numbers in the case of soberment of default sober. So, the data that we have very similar and. And the estimation are more complicated in that case. And also we have some limitations in the sense of the system and the software that we can utilize. In this sense, I want to fatigue that the selection of the most selection of variables are problemas very interesting. And also the solution will depend on a focus practical. De une fo que practico attendiendo la naci, as the banco. A veces este, la muestra que tenemos que tomar puestienos que se una muestra que se representativa noso de portafolio de clintefoli, sino también del momento del mercado. So, that are many frequency of the estimation because they are queen of the. Supposing that we have this inflicted vita, and we have our parameters, and that today, with the most of today, and then using model, but the question is when we can use, can usually. When we are going to be all representative, or when you can see the conditions in my portfolio of the mercado encamped, that the Chambered that the estimations of my model of utility is preguntas, and cadaver chambiamos estimadores, because we can also preguntar noune y la selection of variable others of cuada, and if the selection of the most traces of cuad problem. That the first problem, the second problem is about the matrices of correlation. So, well, this problem with a portafolio, this problem is the situation in the context of modes of implication, and we can spend a portfolio, but in the very beginning of equity, and where we have three actions, and their points that we have. Apple, and Google, and we have sex. So, this is a portfolio with three actions. Two, they are correlation, so clearly that the same thing, and they express because they are in the same industrialism, Apple, and Google. My interest Coleman Sachs is a bank, for example, a distinct industry. So in this case, we have a portable inclusion when we can see that well these two have a correlation between them and it is intuitive with embargo the bank portafolios. Portafolios, the milles, the productos, and not only a class in this case, the three are equity, they are actions in actions, but the bankrupt classes, no different classes, and products and the problems much more complicated. So, we have a portafolio compared to stocks that are these. So the elements can be very distinct natural and para cada element of time que es como esta, una seri de timeo para quadad una. And usually, and this para proposes regulation, we have three years of data that are already 50 years, because Marcas or 50 tenemos 3 elements are to serve. And the problem in us problems that we estimate the matrix colour.  Correlation. But when it major queues like the case of when three actions and cues not have a problem in the empirical biennial, but in the case when I say the portfolios with 1 or 1 elements, and Elements and 15 data. We are problemas because of the estimated empirical, not definite. So, no, it is a matrix if complete with the proprietors, which we don't have to do. You can calculate the empirical embeddings, but we observe that those values are overspread, that values more than estimates, and the most estimated. So, the estimation of the matrix that we are estimating good proprietors. So, because So, because of this problem, because we are trending, we have to have data. So, with simplementes, factors together in my portfolio, and three years of data, I try to estimate this candidate that are more of two parameters. So, I started maximum. That is an idea intuitive because the estimation is problematic and inclusive to data to the estimation with the empirical estimation correct of the correct and that is that we need the mission. 50% excerpt of longitude 5 in vexes 5. And this data equivalent to the 20 years. And we know because otherwise practical estimation in the world has this moment of market. So many data needs to reflect. Not necessarily reflecting what we are doing in this moment. The case are more evident, we encrypted maintenance of data from series. So, we don't have to do this, and other problems that the time can be different longitudinally to different. Different elements. So, an alternative to resolve this in vending empiricalization and the objective of a matrix that is a circuit, like possibly in and here, we are going to define the normal fruit for. To minimize this candidate, so we have a estimate that minimize this and the idea is restricted to a class of estimates that are a linear combination between the empirical estimates that we have difficulties. And other matrix where this other matrix can be very identified multiplicated by this constant identity, which we see that this constant depends on the value of value. Also, we can do different classes of matrices here, but the idea is simple to a combination of linear combinations between the empirical and other matrix that usually is a matrices of block. That usually is a matrix of blocks and shrinkage target. And so all this well, the script, as a optimization of this form, which minimizes this distancia, suggested this condition that this estimated linear type. So one queues have description in mathematics evolving. Mathematica segues a simple optimization and conditions of stake, which was published in 2000, that when the variables have the time has finite, so existing. So this exists one solution optimal solution and this expression is that we learn the variables if in normal distribution, multivariate, so also in that case, we have a optimal solution and we have the expression. So clearly these Because these optimos dependencies exactly the matrix and I want to estimate and theory that results in a optimo para la practica, well, the major que podemode. What we can use here that we don't know, we can choose a estimate, which can be the empirical or one another. So this results in alternatives for aim with. And we are resulting, we can estimate that they are optimal, and how we can calculate exactly because depending on the correlation that we can approximate. But we will approximate practical points that have justified the results that normality or existence of momentum. In the tendos that justify because it is rational to these puestos and described a justification where we are. We are very on this substance, and to see the data that have this moment consistent with these. So, we have to quantify the rod of approximation and rumor as the time cost computational cost. Adams, well, this is a solution, but in the industry, also. In the industry, also explore alternative methods in this case, we decided what we have this solution, but there are other options, a correction of the spectroscope, which the idea of this info is not in the estimation of the energy we are estimating the matrix of correspondency, but info in the spectroscopic In the spectroscopy, in the valores, without two forms of one form, and two using neuronal rules. So what is estimated the values, or info estimation of the values, using these two alternatives and reconstruction of correlation. Other alternatives usar methods of truncation. The methods of truncation that can be soft or hard thresholding, which the idea of these methods is using the matrix of the estimated empirical, but in a project of this problem, it can be a solution or various solutions. And one more time that we're going to be estimated, appropriate. And we preguntaros also 3 methods el día delay y después los comparo en 1, puede cerque no se al 6mo metodo el que este el que tenga unjor comportamente. So, se tendra que er un chambio de model in that moment. One of the things that also passes. One of the things that is also with the pandemic of COVID in the year passed many of the models that we have aspirated because the change was very repentant. So it is an estimation empirical or destiny where us in the data historical. Tiempo historical, but avido una chambio repentance, like the change of COVID, so you estimate a capturing capturing change. And we have new models or models, or we have how we can incorporate the information of a phenomenon as. De phenomenon, like COVID, and that passed and this year of news, including also with the change repenting of gas and petroleum. So all these are practices that are not necessarily the result of historic results that appoint that guarantees. Polly, we guarantee a optimum solution in use, but we justify quantitative manner the decisions that are problema is the future of petrol, the precious future. So Okay. Well, aquípo demos ver momento lo que les quieros señar son gustamente los precios del petrolio y aquí los tenemos. Okay. So, if you can see the presentation of Petrolo, that are precious typicals, and we can see these are precious of what the contrast of it is. The contract of it is what price because the contract and what we are seeing here is WTI, the WTI, and we can compare. And we compare and WTI son the two contracts, the two more representatives of petrol and guillar much of the market. So, we will see the presence of the contract of the spot price to a message. So, this is a part of. This is a part of the spot price commodity mastercan, and this queue is contract to entrepreneur in it. But more of the contract, but we also contract in the case of commodities, in particular petroleum, have different contracts that we can see here. So we have contrast futures that the contracts pod queues to entrepreneurs, but also we have contracts for example to break between February 2022, March 2020, Abram 2022, and if you can see that they are contrados you structure structure of time, contradictions for favourite. For fabric, and if the signal can enter a contract where entrepreneurs, no 5 media in the future, that are exactly the futures. So, yes, different aquí. So, here the idea is just model of this structure of time, not only of the contrast. The only contracts pod que es eliminated the contracts at time future. And well, we can differentiate in this type of contracts here. This is customer cada lineage structure of contrast in general the curb usually. Usually, we have this type that a contract of petrol to entrepreneurs, more variety, that is a contradiction to a year, for example. And we are because we are inflation, and also gastos of the mass enamento, and other types of gastos for example. For example, having to petrol. So, in general, we think that the presidents of contrast have this type of curve, which is more conformable. But there are moments in the market, this evolution of evolution in which the form of the curve is. Forma de la curba is different. So, this is more contango, and when the forma de la curba changia y como esta caso de la linea verde podemos que era era more varato en este cas pornemo estara quiera más varato complar Petrolo para entrega en diembre de 2cho, que para entrega en di siempre 20. So, yes, pas 2. And this pasando says, this type of curb is a intuitive because it is more varied with entering the future, but it can be special when we have changed the spot. So if the presence of the chimo is a change of curb, this type of curb. Of the curb, this type of curb is because the models that need to capture these forms, tienque certain passes of capturing chambers, and tien que circa pasarme las two formas contangoformo y este type when we reverse phenomena, we have backwards. So, the model that So, the model that proposed that capturing these two phenomena and especially the models. So, the models were going to be two options that are classical models, one Gibson and Schwartz, which is a system of questions of this type, and here, and Washington. UW and UW are correlation processes, their model of relatively sensitive relations. This question is the precious spot of the mascara, and the second question the rendime of convenience that is when I refer how. The cost of the inflation, etc. So, the cost of ten petrol in my case. So, if you have a contract in the case, have a queue of petrol in a petrol porn, but using costs, and this equation is to model this model and with these two equations. And with these two equations, relatively, we have these brown movements, and this is a process of reversion. So, if we have when calculating the presence of the future with these two components, a differential part that That consolidation que note that approximation also, and well, also from the retrospective evidence estimates and alpha and sigma one. So, the retro is what we have the model that we can use, we are very complicated, but the estimation, frequency of estimation, one that we have the estimation and that. We have the estimation, and that the solution of the PD is not so, and we have to be approximation, and we are interested in their experiences, we have Monte Carlo to approximate those experiences, and they have to many calculus. So, the composition of the results. The computational computer and many. So, that are typical of problems, and the second model is the billion proposed, also very classical, and it is also differential, but here what represents the first spot, a more and more. Unaving and segunda is the prescience of petroleum. So, two systems equations of two different economies or the interpretation that have different interpretations. This other model classic, which is a good thing, and a more formal and estimation of these coefficients. These coefficients and one can calculate the presence of the futures, of cadaver futures that we future. And well, we have the selection of the model one can use the two or the two percentual uses more appropriate and context. And the time. And va depending on the time in the queue. And okay. Proustamos are time. So we start commentaries final. Gracias. So we passed how digital. How do you say this is an alternative to mathematics, also extra opportunities in this way that need evidence mathematical evidence, in particular probability, statistics, and programmation in my experience in this moment? What is this? What is using principles of Python and C, so the program is important because all these models comment in the three types of problems have implemented the continuity continuity one that is in the mathematical part and one that focuses much. And many more in the part of implementation production. If mathematics obviously the first option is the talents immediately, it is more attractive, yo, my experience is necessary, but if you serve programmation because they have to make the implementation of prototype implementation, and also collaborate with analysts that. Analysts that are in focus in the program for the production so it is very important and obviously based on a work very collaborative. The idea of the work is formula problema, where there is quiet also. Although I want to understand also that explorer literature, there is an internal literature and all the investigation that also explores the external literature, plan that will begin to recreate and recuses that we have the projects that type investigation of three messes. Van 3 messes vanar new messes. So it's restricted in the sense that all the processes that pass in a period solo explorer tasumciones, but consider these limitations. Proponents a model recognize these data or analysis data, also data from other companies, and not just to recollect, and one explorer in the alternatives and sexual comparison of results, presenting these results from preliminaries, establish results. Results preliminaries, final results, with the public interest, also exponent to methodology, and the abort of convention to because methods that are proponent has appropriated, and because it is mejor que los alternatives. Los Alternatives. Evidently, in many presentations, the audience is not techniciency, not all people are mathematical. So, adapt the context, and many veces a interpretation of what this presentation generated. For a public general and a queen, you can create the solution, create documentation, reports, and presentations when technical as the principle, all these problems are real problems that with what they work on in my experience. Evidently, I can tell the solutions because they are reports that all these. Because they are reports that the companies, but in the board of analysts, also included these reports and interest in this queue. No, this is legal investigation. And yo croquet with utamino. Gracias. Gracias. Muchísimas gracias este tenemos algunas preguntas del público yo yo tengo una pregunta. It is more aspenso, well, your doctorado in mathematics and statistics, no. And my question is more that the idea is. What the idea is one person who is terminated doctor is a post-doc, and that astonishes geometry, but changing the gusto touch, and even not how it is possible, and how the recommendation is coming, for example. No, if definitely.  Tipo de work and this mathematics, the entrepreneurs are, but if you have very diverse possible and how I create the first one, it is abierto. This abiero yesara septal es un para.  Comun is explicament your doctoral in a forma note, a forma queuentender queer person. So, it is not very like what you have, but also can explicitly not technica. So, that question much. That question is much and I think very much that first point. Definitely the abilities taking technical abilities that have their mathematical doses in corrections and technicians and send the students that are communication and collaboration, that we know that these. Demonstrating this to work in a work, all the projects are interdisciplinary, and a great deal or other people. So, in the first problem, there comes three, so one. So, one here, working in this model, one here with this, one here, and another one work in recollection and put it. So, this one and other people, or people, or three people, working on this. So, the collaboration is very important. And when you buy the things that repair or a little familiar with these, we are here just probabilities and this type of mathematics postal, which for very. Points that we have complex, metro optimization, and numerical analysis. But as we can see, the profound of the notion that a year or not has much inclusive. Okay, muchas gracias. Tenemos alguna otra pregunta. Okay, well, para seque no no escer así, tenemos unaver. Abi, justarla. Tieno pointamens que que con la pandemia tra los models. Los models don't put the pandemic. But the models unincorporated as the variants, how is the pandemic, if you put the market completed or whatever? If in principle, we can crisis, this also for example when This also perimeter when recording with the petroleum environment, the future of the petroleum was narrative. So, in principle, that crisis is a model of capture. So, that crisis the traders are located, and the model is not captured. It has to be algo evidently. Evidently seria, and many vases the experience of the traders, and many vexes of decided technica, but immediately has to be a plan of how can modify to capture these types of situations. So, with the pandemic, also. También paso varios in our models not prepared for that, and what is good first of the immediate models that are backup, that is really more empirical, that technicals that are using situations like these of COVID. And in the solution, In the solution, and what is rapid queue can be working on a plan more to solution in the model or the models that fall and in the case of COVID, and we are recapanding new data. Recapando nu a datos, datos of pandemia, pero era very in certain longitude of the pandemic. So, no podium plances or a year in vascular pandemic, and during the good of many, but to finish. For final, the year passed the market adaptation. So, if their planes, and modifications, the new models and important. If it is important, the problem, but if not, it is one iterative of when. Okay, so I gustaria dart las gracias otra es por tú charla estami intersante gracias. Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias is the bueno.
