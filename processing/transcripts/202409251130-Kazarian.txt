Okay, let me go on. So, still the definition of the generalized topological recursion is still missing, but still, I would like, before giving the actual definition, let me give describe some more properties. Properties. Actually, what happens is that it behaves as nice as possible. So all possible expectations for the generalized topological recursion happen to be correct. So, first of all, it behaves very well with respect to degenerations of the spectral curve data. If several Curve data. If several special points glue together, so if those points which are glued together are k special points and the k special points never meet with non-k special points, then the recursion is compatible with the limits. So let's check. Well, let's check first, let's check how it works for these examples, what we have. Examples, what we have. So consider, for instance, this spectral curve data. Y has a single critical point at the origin, and X has K critical points and also a pole at the origin. So if K is equal to 1, 2, or 3, then the origin is a special point across. Is a special point according to our classification. We have zero of order two and pole of order smaller than two, then these are special points. And what we have in this situation that the corresponding critical points of X glue with the origin, which is also special, but is not included to the recursion. So the origin. So this here in this case, the So this here in this case the origin is a k special, k dual special. But if the order of Paul is greater than two, then according to our classification, the order of Paul is high enough, so that the origin is not is not Is not special anymore. So the only special points are those which participate in the check of inarrow runtime recursion. They glue together according to this theorem. The limit does exist. And the same here. We have some degeneration at the origin, but this is the pole of the function y, and because of this pole, the origin is not a special point. The origin is not a special point, so the only special point in the case A is a critical point of X. They glue together, and we have that the limit does exist. Here, when we split the pole of Y function along with the simple poles, there are some newborn critical points of Y. And these critical points of Y are K dual space. K dual special points. These are those points that we would like to avoid. And therefore, this theorem is not applicable in this case. The critical points of Y glue together with the critical points of X, and this is not allowed by this theorem. In this case, this theorem is neither applied, so this limit is not compatible. This limit is not compatible with a generalized topological recursion. But by some reason, the Boucher in our recursion survives for this limit. And by that reason, the Boucher in our recursion is not compatible with the generalized topological recursion for the limiting spectral curve. So we claim that the limit does exist if. does exist if if the K special and K dual special points never glue together, but I we do not claim that the limit does not exist if they glue. Sometimes even if they glue together, the limit still exists. So consider let's consider another example. Which pool normally would last? So, what do we have here? What are special points? The origin is a critical point of X. So the origin is a special point. Special point, and we consider it as a k special point. And y has a simple pole, and independently, whether s is equal to zero or s not equal to zero, a simple pole is not a special point. So this point does not contribute to the special point. So for all parameter values, the origin is a unique special point. So this limit does exist. Does exist. So for S non-zero, we have the standard situation of Kantewish-Witten with deformed y function, which leads to some shift, some rescaling of times. And for s equal to zero, we obtain a regular topological recursion which corresponds to the Boucher and R. And so this is the spectral curve is exactly which corresponds to the Exactly, which corresponds to the problem that Paul discussed in his talk yesterday. And let me make a funny observation that we may consider instead of this function y, when we apply the topological recursion, the involution, the involution. The involution of deck transformation is just z goes to minus z. And if you consider just the check of in error and recursion, then we only need only the odd part of this y function. And since the involution is global, then we can modify y in this way. So we consider just the The odd part of y, and then this topology, this spectral curve would produce just the same differentials of topological recursion, right? But this is equal to, if I am correct, z times z squared minus epsilon squared. Minus s squared, right? So this spectral curve produces just the same Techer-Fernard-Horantian recursion as this one, and therefore for S non-equal to zero, the generalized topological recursion is also produces the same. But if you can. But if you consider this particular form of the spectral curve, it has some additional critical points of y, which are not which are k-dual special. So this limit, the theorem is not applicable to this spectral curve. So the limit does exist, and the limit is described by the limit is described by the generalized topological recursion. It is given by the limit we have Bouchard inert spectral curve, but BGW spectral curve, but we cannot apply theorem in this form. In this situation, the limit does exist, but it's not covered by this theorem. Then, if you remember, Paul introduced Paul introduced two potentials. One is called two partition functions. One is called Z with index K pet and another one is Z with index BGW. And they are two versions of. Of the corresponding deformation of the spectral curve data. And actually, both of them correspond to just the same spectral curve. But in order to extract a numerative data, you need to choose an expansion point and a local coordinate. So as far as I understand, in both cases, the expansion point is infinity. is infinity but for one of this tau function we use z inverse as a local coordinated infinity and another version we use this y tilde as a local coordinated infinity so they the both both differentials corresponds to topological recursion with the same spectral curve but and with the same expansion point infinity but with respect to different local parameters. Respect to different local parameters. And this operator that was an exponent of some Virasor operator, it was just an operator which realized the change of the local coordinate near this special point. Bresen Grosswitten. Bresan, Bresen Grosswitten, yeah. It's a another matrix model, yeah. Matrix model, yeah. Some variation of Kance Schwitzen 80s, early 80s, the same. And the theorem looks fundamental, but actually the proof is obvious in spite of it looks deep, but actually it's obvious. Let's consider Let's consider a formula which I have not presented yet for omega tilde. What's the most important that my expression for omega tilde is algebraic, it's globally defined. And you can analyze what are possible poles of this omega tilde with respect to zero and these poles are special points and also on the diagonals. So this projection operator. So, this projection operator is summation of some residues at the k-special points. But since we can represent these residues as contour integrals, then we can replace small contours around the case special points by a single contour which surrounds all k-special points. And thus, this integral is defined by the behavior of x and y. By the behavior of x and y functions near the boundary. So now, when we start the deformation, whatever happens inside the domain U, whatever behavior of X and Y, how they glue, the corresponding zeros and poles glue or split, what happens with this special point inside doesn't matter. Points inside doesn't matter as long as along the boundary everything is holomorphic. If x and y are regular along the boundary, then the whole recursion is well defined, and this integral depends holomorphically in parameters, and then we have holomorphic depends on parameters. So, it's amazingly. So, the crucial point that in opposite to the formula in the Checho Fernar or Rentan recursion, our expression for omega tilde extends globally as a global Meromorphic form, and this is how it works. Another important property is the XY slope duality. So consider the initial data for the topological recursions, for generalized topological recursion of. For generalized topological recursion or usual Schechwer Naranten recursion. And we can associate the dual spectral curve data, which consists of just swap of x and y. And we also replace case special points by its complement. So this includes some set of special points, and this is the complementary set of special points. Then it happens. Then it happens that we start both topological recursions. This one produces differentials which has singularities, which has poles at the k special points. This one produces also some differentials which has singularities at k dual special points. But it happens that this these two systems of differentials are related by explicit algebraic relations. Algebraic relations. It means that there is a universal formula which expresses one of these two systems of differentials in terms of another one. And these expressions are algebraic in the sense that they involve the original differentials and the partial derivatives and also combinatorics, but does not involve the study of the behavior at the poles. So you do not. Pause. So, you do not, if you know the answer, if you once computed differentials on one side of topological recursion, then there is no more need to start topological recursion itself on the other side. You just apply these formulas. There is a definition that I still also missed, which is still missing, which provides. Which provides a closed expression of one system differentials in terms of another one. And the theorem says that this generalized topological recursion is compatible with this swap. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will show. Yes, I will show some consequences. So, for instance, just as a small remark that Just as a small remark that the definition of XY duality is missing, and the definition of generalized topological recursion is still missing. But actually, we use this theorem as a motivation for the definition. Yes, I also Yeah. Consider consider again these spectral curves. Then we analyze the set of special points and we see that all special points are k special points. K special points. All the special points, we include them to the original topological recursion. So, what do we have on the dual side? On the dual side, we have empty set of poles. So, the dual side is trivial. So, assume that just for any initial data, for any x and y, we assume the situation where all Where all special points are included to the original topological recursion, the dual one is empty. Then on the dual side, we have that all differentials are trivial. We have no non-trivial relations. All sum over residues over empty set gives zero. The topological recursion relation gives The topological recursion relation gives zero on each step, so it means that we just apply this duality expression for the situation where on the dual side all these differentials are trivial. And this is a specialization of this x-y duality formula for this special case. So this term is somehow a contribution of zero, two differentials. Of 0, 2 differentials, and this term is a contribution of 0, 1 differentials. So only differentials which are non-trivial on the dual size as the 0, 1 and 0, 2. And they are combined in this closed expression. So for this situation, for instance, if you try to start through topological recursion, you have first of all you should solve algebraic equation to find the position of critical points. Find the position of critical points, then you should find the expansion of the involution sigma. Then you start this procedure by counting the contribution of all critical points. This is quite complicated. But if you just apply this formula, it's much, much, much, much simpler. So now this formula is valid. This formula is valid, is applicable for any function x and y. The input of this formula is just arbitrary to functions x and y. And this is the meaning of this formula for arbitrary x and y. That means that we apply generalized topological recursions, recursion with all special points considered as case special points. So let me mention one more. So, let me mention one more theorem. Sasha Alexandrov will speak in more details on this situation. It happens that the topological recursion, the generalized topological recursion, possess KP integrability property in all generality if the spectral curve is irrational. I will not explain. Explain what is the meaning of this, Sasha will say in more details, but let me just consider one example, one illuminating example. Consider this spectral curve. So people in topological recursion know very well the opposite situation when x is the x square and y is z. So you consider the dual situation. The dual situation. So, if you apply the standard CUO recursion, that the original recursion is trivial because X has no critical points. And on the dual side, we have the standard Tay curve, which produces the standard differentials of which leads to the Kansewitten potential responsible for intercession numbers of psi classes. So, this is what we have. So, this is what we have in this situation. So, from the point of view of generalized topological recursion, we have a single special point, the origin. And this naive application of Chekhov and error-runted recursion corresponds to the situation when we consider this point as a k-dual special point. So, the standard cancel is obtained on the dual side, which and on the original side we have zero. Zero. But now let's turn things around and consider the origin as a case special point. Then, again, everything is well defined. Our recursion works very well and it produces a system, non-trivial system of differentials. On the dual side, we have trivial recursion because now the k dual special points in empty. But on the original side, we have instead. On the original side, we have instead some non-trivial topological recursion. And this is the answer, the expansion of the answer. I formulated it in terms of the corresponding potential corresponding to expansion at infinity in the local coordinate one over zero. And this is again, this is the solution of KP Harar here, which for which we have no enumerative meaning. Meaning. It looks as fundamental as the original consequence within potential, but we have no explanation. What does it count? No, no, no, it has genus zero terms. The exponent of h bar is h bar to the power of 2g minus 2 plus m. Count this way. M count this way. Yeah, the geno zero components are non-trivial here. And n is a homogeneous degree in p variables. Uh but wait a minute minus three so for instance here n equal to five n equal to five and g is equal to zero minus two yeah so this is n equal to five g is equal to Equal to five, g is equal to zero, for instance. Yeah, it's so you see that this potential involves all variables. There is no reduction. So Kw potential depends on odd variables only. But here we have observed no reduction. And by the way, this differential could be, this topological recursion could be realized as a limit of CEO. limit of CEO recursion. Let's add to initial data to initial x function at the monomial with a pole at the origin. Then if the order of pole is greater than two, that the origin is not a special point anymore. So this family for the all special points of this family are critical points of X and the origin. Points of x and the origin is not special anymore. So the limit of standard CO differentials for this spectral curve with three critical points produces exactly this potential. Let me switch to the very first slide. Yeah, no. Oh, this is this is fine. So we take some point of expansions here. W is one over zero expansion at infinity. Those differentials that we have. Those differentials that we have, they are regular at infinity. They have no pulse at infinity. So we take, expand this into a series at infinity and combine them in no yeah. So we just expand them, combine the coefficients in the potential. So this So, this potential depends on the choice of the expansion point. So, the corresponding endpoint functions or endpoint differentials are defined globally. But if you choose any expansion point and expand it into a series, you can associate the corresponding potential. The potential does depend on the choice of expansion point and the expansion coordinate. Okay. Okay, so now I think that it's time to give finally the definition of what we are discussing. The definition of topological generalized topological recursion and also the definition of other things. Actually, they told the The definition of generalized topological recursion is motivated by the XY duality. So let me first, however, let me first explain what is the XY duality transformation, XY swap duality transformation, and then I will show how to derive the definition of generalized topology cursion from this XY duality formula. So, xy duality is a global transformation, which for a given collection of differentials on one side produces explicitly the collection of differentials on the other side of duality. It's defined by a closed expression, but if I will. But if I will show you this expression, it will look very strange and unmotivated. Therefore, before giving the actual definition, let me give a kind of motivation for this definition. So let's consider a quite specific situation. Assume that our spectral curve data contains Contains a point which I call nice, where both x and y have logarithmic singularities. So of course, originally I do not expect that our spectral curve data have such a point, but let's consider a special situation we have when we have such a point with such a logarithmic singularity. Then I will explain why. I will explain what does this duality transformation in the space of power expansion at the nice point. So for the first step, I will explain how this transformation works in the space of power series and X and Y. And then I will switch and show that this transformation actually extends to global. Actually, it extends to global rational functions. So we consider such a point with logarithmic local behavior of x and y. So dx and dy have poles of with residue one, first order poles with residue one, and we consider exponent of x and exponent of y as local coordinates. As local coordinates. And then just as we discussed to the expansion point and the choice of local coordinate, we can associate the potential, then the corresponding partition function. And the same on the dual side, up to this important sign. We start with differentials. We choose this local coordinate y. Local coordinate y, we associate a potential and the corresponding partitional function. So our definition of xy duality acts not on the original differentials, but on the corresponding partitional functions. And on the language of the corresponding partitional functions, it acts by an explicit operator, which is the exponent of this partial differential. Partial differential operator in p-variables. So the actual transformation of xy duality is given as a composition of all these transformations. Once again, we start with our original differentials. We pick a nice point, associate a local coordinate x to this nice point, and then we And then we reformulate the data contained in the differentials into potential. Then we take the exponent path to the corresponding partition function. Then apply this exponent of this operator and interpret the result as a dual partition function. Then take the logarithm and again expand. And again, expand this logarithm and associate the coefficients of this expansion. We associate the differentials also expanded in y-coordinates. Okay, when we consider the correspondence between functions, differentials and the functions, we do not forget the contribution of the singular point zero two. 02 correction of singular points. And also, by our choice of nice points, it happens that 0, 1 and 0, 0, 1 differentials are also not regular. And so we have take this correction to make the 0, 1 differential also regular in order to be able to expand it into. To be able to expand it into a series. And then the theorem says that if you take this composition, then the result is expressed in a closed form of a closed transformation, and this is what we call by x y duality. And it's important. It's important that this form of operator corresponds to only to a nice point. If you compare with what is written in our original paper on this x-y duality, we used a similar computation, but we used different points of expansion, and the variety was different. Actually, the operators, the potentials depend on a choice of expansion point and the Point and the way how XY duality transformation looks on the level of the corresponding partition functions in terms of partition functions, it does depend on the choice of the expansion point. So, this formula works only for a nice point. So, now let me show the final answer. So Answer. So the previous slide could be considered just a motivation, and now this is a definition. So the formula is quite complicated. So we have again two steps. On the first step, we consider we compute these differentials W th which involves additional parameters u1 un and then we And then we turn the monomials and u variables to the derivatives with respect to y. And the expression for this WFET involves summation over hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a graph which has some set of Set of vertices which are marked. These are vertices and also some set of hyper edges. A hyper edge is an edge which connects some of the vertices. This is a hyper edge. A hyper edge connects several vertices with Vertices with a leg, with some set of legs. In the usual graph, every edge has two half-edges, so it corresponds to legs. So this is another example of hyper-edge, which is just usual edge with two legs. And there could be also some edges which just have a single edge. And also the legs could be. Legs could be multiple, and there could be multiple edges. There could be multiple hyper edges, and this is what this is an example of a hypergraph. So, as you see from the picture, the hypergraph is the same as the bipartite graph. The white vertices are considered as the true vertices, and yellow vertices are considered as hyper edges. Hyper edges the white vertices are labeled, and hyper edges are not labeled. And for each hypergraph, we have its own contribution, which is product of some contributions corresponding to the hyper edges. And the contribution of hyper edge is almost the same as just W n omega n differential, which is. Differential, which is slightly modified by applying these differential operators to each of the arguments. So the formula looks quite complicated, but this is how it works. It proved out that if you just pick contribution to each particular genus component, that the sum happens to be finite. So this dependence of this one and U. Dependence of this one and U variables is polynomial if you restrict it to the coefficient of each particular power of H bar. And also another observation that we have here hyperages which has could have multiple legs like that. Then we should restrict this contribution of this W capital to A capital to the diagonals. This restriction to diagonals is not well defined if you have a singularity on diagonals which corresponds to hyperages, which correspond to zero two terms. And especially for zero two terms, we have an exception and instead of usual differentials omega two, we consider the dissingularization. Dysingularization. So this disingularization is applied to only to zero two terms with two legs attached at the one vertex. And in this situation, the corresponding zero two term is not regularized. And this is how it works. The formula looks complicated, but actually it's quite explicit. And I implemented this on the computer and played a lot. And it proves out that this transformation is well defined. The dual differentials are symmetric, globally defined, meromorphic. And moreover, they are not the they They are regular on the diagonal, and the inverse transformation could be applied. And it's given by the same formula with x and y swapped. And it's strange, but the last two properties are probably one of the most important properties of this X, Y, swap transformation. But strangely, up to this point, But strangely, up to this point, we have no commendatorial proof. If you just apply the original differential with summation over a Have a graph and try to apply this transformation twice, the fact that you get the original differentials is complicated combinatorial identity, and we have no combinatorial proof of that. And besides this W fat. W FET have poles on the diagonals. So individual summons and this sum have poles on the diagonal, but they strangely cancel on the dual side. This is the special case of this complicated formula. In this case, it's quite simple. And you see that it's really symmetric with respect. See that it's really symmetric with respect to x and y. So these are Bergman kernels which have poles on the diagonals. Each of these three summons have poles on the diagonals. But if you sum up, the result is holomorphic on the diagonals. And besides, it's symmetric. If you just replace omega by omega check and x by y, then the formula is just the same. Is just the same. But for higher GNN, this becomes non-obvious and actually quite complicated combinatorial task. And we have no proof. Therefore, the original definition from the local expansion and the nice point in it not only the motivation, but also the way to prove these properties. At the moment we have no other way to prove it. We have no other way to prove it. Okay. Now the now the m my next step was to to show how how this formula could be derived from the definition. Be derived from the definition. And this is usually the part where people trying to read our papers usually give up because the formula is quite explicit. Again, just you start with this definition and you should follow this sequence of transformations and the result is just. And the result is just this combinatorial expression. So the computation is quite lengthy, and usually, people, my experience, are not able to follow all our steps of computation, but the formula itself is quite explicit, which is just like that. But still, let me try to give at least to explain what kind of terms are used in this formula. This formula. So the first ingredient is the following. So we have, so we just consider just the first step of this ticking soft transformation is the correspondence between the potential and the differentials. There are some details which I skipped probably as a contribution zero, one term should be added here, but the moral is like that. The morally, it's like that. So, what's written here? We just differentiate the potential, obtain the corresponding partial derivatives, the Taylor coefficients, and collect them into generating series. This is the same as just insertion of this operator, which is called loop insertion operator, and then taking the Value at the origin. We said p variables is equal to zero. And this is the first important step to introduct this notation. And it's and to how to say, to give weight to my considerations, such an operation is taking the value of the power series as the origin, taking the field term. I call it. Taking the term, I call it vacuum expectation value. So, this notation is appeared several times in this conference, and actually it's just the same with a certain identification, it's just the same as it was used in this conference. So, but for this situation, I consider the space of power series and p variables and. Series in p variables, and this expectation value is just taking the origin. So, this is what we get with this notation. But I would like to express the same, but instead of f, I would like to put this the corresponding partition function, the exponent of f. And then this vacuum expectation values is replaced by what is called connected vacuum. Replaced by what is called connected work expectation value, which is related to the original one by the inclusion-exclusion procedure. This inclusion-exclusion procedure just replaces the taking of the exponent. And this part probably is well known. And this is what it's not a big deal. Anyway, so on the right-hand side of this equality, the omega differentials are expected. The omega differentials are expressed as some combinations, some chemical combinations of the vacuum expectation values applied to partition function, which is the composition of inclusion-exclusion procedure. And here we introduce this loop insertion operator. So, this is not strange, this is well known, but there is another step which. Step which for which it took for us a couple of months to understand that it could be applied. So let us introduce J operators, which is just partial derivative if k is positive for multiplication by p if k is negative, and extend this loop insertion operator by adding the negative terms and consider a similar expression. Consider a similar expression like here, but now we put here this extended loop insertion operators. Then it proves out that after inclusion and exclusion, this negative part, this negative part of the loop insertion operator cancels out and produces nothing except this singular contribution. So, this singular contribution is automated. This single contribution is automatically accounted by the adding negative part to this loop insertion operator. It's really strange. Let me comment more on this amazing quality. So on the right-hand side, we have a power series, which involves both positive and negative exponents of x variables. And on the left-hand side, we have a power series corresponding. We have a power series corresponding to omega, and with this singular correction. And actually, what we use here is the power expansion of this singular correction in one of the possible directions. So it happens that this operators do not commute anymore. So these loop insertion operators commute, but if you add positive negative terms, Add positive negative terms that they do not commute anymore because of the Heisenberg commutation relation. So, this expression does depend on the order we put these J operators, but the difference is just corresponds to different sectors of the expansion of this singular term. So, on the left-hand side, we have a symmetric expression but containing a singular term. Containing a single term. But on the right-hand side, it's not symmetric, but it becomes symmetric if you convolve these negative exponents of x to a generating series. It's really amazing. So this equality corresponds to just the first two steps of this correspondence. And the same we have on these two steps. The same we have on the right-hand side. So the So, the next step is just to see what happens with this contribution of this differential operator. So, if you just plug in, we obtain the insertion of this on the dual side, we have insertion of this operator realizing x, y, swap duality, and after conjugating on the left, we have this one. So, the next step is just to compute. step is just to compute this operator and what do we have here j is just combination of j plus j minus these are certain differential operator acting on power series these are also these operators so we have certain operators acting on this power series and p variables so these computations should be done in the space of differential on of differential operators Of differential operators in infinitely many variables. This is possible, but it's very complicated because it's very hard to keep all these indices in mind. But it happens that there is much smaller group acting on this power series in pure variables. There is a very small group. There is a very small group, which is called G L infinity. And all our operators belong to this group or its Lie algebra. The group itself, the Lie algebra itself, comes, it's well known in physics. It comes from boson-fermionic correspondence. This space is called bosonic-Fox space. And well, you can introduce it just at Hawk by this generating. This generating series. So we consider the space of infinite matrices with columns and rows are labeled by integers. And this is matrix units. And this is every matrix unit acts in the bosonic form spaces, the space of polynomial power series and p variables. And the commutation relation between this. Relation between these operators is the same as the collimutation relation between infinite-dimensional matrices up to some constant extension, which is denoted by hat here. But anyway, we have much, much smaller, much, much smaller Lie algebra, and all computations could be done in this Lie algebra. So, actually, I need So, actually, I need to consider certain specializations of this formula, which is given here. And actually, I would like to just restrict ourselves to this formula. So, this is so just consider this and this expression as what I call a universal bosonic operator. It's a It's a family of operators parametrized by x and u, and all operators that we are considering are specializations of these operators. So for instance, these j operators are just become shift matrix which filled with one one and one diagonal on the distance m from the principal one. And q is just diagonal operator with this eigenvalues. Operator with these eigenvalues. So now the computation is much faster, much simpler. We just multiply three matrices. Two of them is diagonal. It's much easier. If you just multiply three matrices, two of them are diagonal, it's much easier. So if you do the same computations in the space of differentials, operators, and p-variables, it becomes impossible. Impossible. But if you just believe that this bosonic operator produces a representation of G L infinity, then these computations become quite simple. Okay, I will skip certain steps. So the result is as follows. So we have So we have original differentials which corresponds in the power expansion at the nice point corresponds to these vacuum expectation values with J operators inserted. And the same on the dual side. And in the middle, as an intermediate step, we consider similar Consider similar expressions involving this universal bosonic operator, which is drawn here. Then, passing from this creditor to this one is governed by the combinatorics of summation over graphs. You see this exponents when you expand these exponents, they, in a sense, correspond to contribution different summons. And this step passing from these creditors to these creditors corresponds to this strange operation which turn monomials in U variables to partial derivatives in Y variables. So this is how the computations work. But the result is what's really amazing that the result is just expression. The result is just expressed in a closed form. Just I recall this formula. So now in the final formula, there is no reference to the expansion point, there is no reference to a choice of local coordinate. The formula itself is valid in the space of global Meromorphic differentials. They said we are okay summation over graphs and then turn humanomials to derivatives in y variables okay I I gave I give gave a small Gave a small idea of what does this formula of X-Form duality and how we what was our motivation for this formula. But now let's consider more detailed structure of this formula. You see, it contains derivatives over x, it contains derivative over y, and it contains Insertion of singular terms on the diagonal. So it follows that if you apply this formula, if the original differentials have some set of points, that on the dual side, the new appearing singularities, only those which are special. So if the original, if you have no singularities other than those Singularities other than those at special points on the one side, then we have no new singularities on the other side. It may happen that after you apply this combinatorial expression, some of singularities cancel, but new singularities could appear only among the among special points. And we can use this property as a definition of x y of general. Of X, Y, of generalized topological recursion. We just define the generalized topological recursion, but the requirement that the dual differentials are regular at the k special points. So we consider the original differentials, we assume that they have the structure that they have singularities at the k special points at no other singularities. K special points and no other singularities. We apply XWOP transformation on the other hands side. We necessarily obtain singularities on all special points and including K-dual special points. But we choose the contribution of K-special points in such a way that they cancel on the dual side. So if you We take this requirement that dual differentials are holomorphic at the case special point. We turn this into a definition of the generalized topological recursion. Then this theorem becomes just a reformulation of the definition. So this is the idea of the definition of generalized topological recursion. We will we will formulate it in more details. formulated in more details but this is but this is how it works. I think I have to stop here. The next step will be the actual definition of generalized topological recursion, but let me postpone it for tomorrow.
