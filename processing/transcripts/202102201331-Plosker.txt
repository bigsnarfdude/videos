So, our next speaker is Sarah Glossker. She is an associate professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Brampton University, and she's going to talk about indigenous lead work in mathematics classroom. Great, thank you so much. So, thank you all for coming to the talk, and thanks for the invitation. And if you have questions, You have questions, you know. Feel free to interrupt because I don't know that I can really see the chat, the full screen mode, with sharing screen. So yeah, go ahead and interrupt. So let's get into it. Hopefully, there we go. So just first of land acknowledgement, my university, Brandon University, has campuses on both Treaty 1 and Treaty 2 territories. Our main campus is located in Brandon. Our main campus is located in Brandon, Manitoba, on Treaty 2 territory. This is traditional shared land between the Dakota and Ojibwe. The Turtle Mountains and Bryn area was also home to the Métis people. Settlement along the Assiniboine River and into northeastern areas of Saskatchewan created a chain of Métis communities. And my collaborator, Kathy Matas, is Métis. And she, so this is the official land acknowledgement, but she Acknowledgement, but she says actually that you know, this was this past tense, should actually be present tense as well. So is it's also, it is home to Métis people. So Brandon University itself was founded in 1899 as a Baptist college. There's just over 3,000 students and over 300 faculty members, five faculties: arts, education, graduate studies, health studies, and science, and a school of music. And a school of music. And our mission: we promote excellence in teaching, research, creation, and scholarship. You know, the usual sort of stuff in here, but I do want to highlight that it does, our mission does include this. We embrace cultural diversity and we're particularly committed to the education of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people. And 13% of BU students identify as Aboriginal. This is through self-identification. Self-identification on paperwork, on say entrance paperwork. But talking to various deans and people at the Indigenous Peoples Center on campus, this 13% is believed to be an underestimate because there are people who don't want to identify. So I've been told even something like 25%, but one in four. 25%, so one in four students are Indigenous at our university. So there's an Indigenous People Center on campus that offers academic support as well as transition support. So assistance locating housing, dentist, whatever, and cultural and spiritual support, which is very important. So cultural events, beating club. I don't know why, but beating seems to be mostly women. So they were calling themselves the beating. So they were calling themselves the beating babes. And then finally, they had one guy join, but they still called themselves the beating babes. And personal and social support, so movie nights, soup lunch, of course, many of these things have been suspended to COVID-19, which is really too bad because it was basically creating a home away from home. And Kathy, my collaborator, she is an associate professor of art history. She is Southwest. History. She is Southwest Manitoba Métis and has been beating since she was 20 years old when she learned from her auntie. And she has been teaching at BU since 2002. And I'm from Regina and I started at BU in 2013 and I am in the math department and I'm a CRC in Canada in quantum information theory. So you might wonder how the heck did we get together? Neither of us are in. Neither of us are in math education. So, well, that's the one great thing about a small, one of the great things about a small university is that you get to know people who aren't in your department and not even in your faculty. Because it's small, you really get some, you get to know a lot of people, which is really nice. And so we met actually at a sharing circle. We met actually at a sharing circle about a year prior to actually doing this project. So there was a series of events on campus that I won't really get into, but it prompted a sharing circle. And what a sharing circle is, is you get together in a circle. It's usually led by an elder and you pass around an object, like maybe a stick. An object, like maybe a stick. And only that person with that object is allowed to talk. Everyone else is supposed to listen. And it's sort of you talk things through. You air your grievances. There's a lot of emotion, crying, hugging, that sort of thing. It can be cathartic. And at that event, Kathy and I were both there and we met there. Kathy and I were both there, and we met there. And I'm more of an action-oriented person, so I don't want to just sort of talk about frustrations. I want to actually sort of do something. And so one thing was to, yeah, actually do something involving this Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada calls to action. So implement some culturally appropriate topics into my course curriculum. And so that was one motivation. And so that was one motivation for the project. Another one, I'll tell a quick story. I have to keep an eye on time, but I met a math professor at a conference years ago, and I can't remember who it was. I've been trying to figure it out, but she was teaching two sections of, I believe, a combinatorics course. And one was bright and early in the morning, and she grabbed her bag and ran to the class. And she ran to the class running late. And she got there, she opened her bag, and it wasn't her math notes, it was her knitting. And so she just figured, okay, I'll go with it. And she sort of started a demonstration with the needles and yarn and talking about permutations and how it sort of related to how the knitting related to what they would be learning in the class. And then the second section of the course. The second section of the course, she grabbed the correct bag and just did a regular class. And then after the class, after the semester was over, she got her teaching evaluations. And actually, the one section of the class, a bunch of the students mentioned how useful that demonstration was on the first day and how it really made things, these abstract concepts much more concrete. And so I thought, well, why don't we do that? I thought, well, why don't we do that? That was kind of a happy accident for her, for this professor. But I thought, well, why don't we do that on purpose? So there's a potential for increased learning through this tactile learning. So I'll talk a little bit first about relationship building. It's very important. Like I said, the sharing circle was nearly a full year before the course. And I had several meetings with Kathy. We got to know each other, built trust. We got to know each other, built trust, and there was sort of a reciprocal relationship there. So, I do want to sort of emphasize that, you know, if you do want to indigenize your course content in any way, maybe don't just go up to a professor's door and sort of knock and say, Hey, I want to do this, can you help? Because there is sort of this history of maybe one-sidedness or. One-sidedness or sort of distrust because of historical things. So yeah, definitely relationship building is incredibly important. Presenting yourself as an ally. And so the course itself was a linear algebra 2 course, but I think it a lot of what we did makes sense for geometry as well, or really. Geometry as well, or really it could be done in quite a few different math classrooms. It's a continuation of Linear Algebra 1, but at a more abstract level. So we do vector spaces, bases, dimensions, linear mappings, diagonalization, inner products, that sort of thing. So it's linear algebra, but with some proofs and problem solving in there as well. And so what did we actually do? Well, What did we actually do? Well, there was an assignment where it was sort of a three-parter. Firstly, Kathy and her RA came to class and gave a demonstration of how to do bead work. And then the students were asked to follow up at the Indigenous People Center, go there once during the semester, and And so the beating babes meet Tuesday normally before COVID Tuesday at lunch. And then there's that's more for students. And then there's also an evening session that's the whole community. So different people in Brandon come. That one's a bit more rowdy, I would say, the evening session. And so some students could only attend the evening, some students could only attend at lunch. Students could only attend at lunch. They were only asked to attend once as a follow-up, but many of them actually attended multiple times because they enjoyed it. And one of them was trying to finish these earrings that we were making to give to their significant other. And so then there's the classroom visit by Kathy, there was the follow-up that the students had to go to at the Indigenous People Center, and then there's a third. And then there's a third part, which was a written reflection, just a page long, talking about how BWork fits with the topics covered in the class. And this was worth 3% of their total grade. And so I'm not in math ed, so this was totally new to me. This ethics committee approval. Yeah, wow, start early. I thought it would be rubber stamped. There's definitely a lot to go through. Definitely a lot to go through because of the position of power because we wanted to use the written work to sort of share with a wider audience and disseminate these results to a wider audience. So there were consent forms. They were treated like student evaluations. I didn't get to see them until after the marks were in. Of course, their mark, we didn't want. Their mark, we didn't want it to be perceived that their mark could be tied to whether they consented for me to use their written work in any way. So I do have some photos, but I can't share, I didn't take photos of the students because it was, it's needed to be anonymous. But there's Kathy on the right and her RA Justine on the left. And they brought in a bunch of examples of beadwork, some moccasins, earrings. Everyone got a little Everyone got a little paper plate with a piece of felt, which was just easy to so that the beads didn't sort of roll away. This was mine. We chose three colors. And as you can see, I don't really know anything about color theory. So these are probably terrible choices. These two are too close together in color. Yeah. And so this was what we were going to be creating. These earrings that were kind of this. Earrings that were kind of this triangle with diamond shapes inside, and then these sort of dangly parts to it. And you actually start in this little corner, you put four beads on the thread, and then you put the needle back into the last two beads, and you pull it tight. And I can't describe it very well, but when you pull it tight, it creates this little block. Tight, it creates this little block. So, in my mind, instantly, I thought, okay, we have a four-dimensional vector. So, it was just this column of four beads. And then you did this linear transformation, and you got a two-by-two matrix. So that's how my brain works. And then you keep adding two and another two and another two. And so you can kind of make as many mistakes as you want in terms of reflection, rotation. In terms of reflection, rotation, whatever, they're all just the same colored beads. I guess you have to be careful what kind of mistakes you make, but it's forgiving. The process is forgiving up until you get to here. And then once you have the different color, then of course certain mistakes will make it so that the pattern doesn't work anymore. So you have to be careful once you get past there, past that middle bead. And this is some. And this is some purple and black earrings that are kind of hard to see the contrast on this photo. These are another couple of sets, and there is some pattern to the different colors going down these dangly bits. And this is a part of a sash belt that Kathy was making for. Making for herself, this, I think, I believe it was part of her PhD work. And each flower represents a woman that she's blood related to in her family. And I don't know that I can zoom in while screen sharing, but if you look very close, she does what's called the painterly style, where you don't really necessarily pre-plan every little bead. Plan every little bead, and so that leads to certain spots where there's kind of enough space for a half a bead to go. And so there's a little bit of a gap. Whereas traditionally, as I understand it, everything's pretty pre-planned. Every last bead was pre-planned so that there's no little gaps. Okay, so getting into the outcomes of the exercise. Of the exercise. So, first of all, math students have a really hard time with no right answer. That was quite a stumbling block for some students. I had some students come see me even multiple times trying to figure out what I wanted as sort of an answer in the written part. And I told them it really depends on how your brain works and what connections you see. What connections do you see? The written work definitely reflected the students' personalities, and I'll get into some quotes from the written work in a minute. Some were kind of surface-level, some were very deep reflections. The surface level ones, well, there's always going to be some students that, you know, maybe don't attend. You know, maybe don't attend class and then aren't really motivated to do the work. Like, it really had nothing to do with the fact that this was an Indigenous speed work assignment. They just weren't really going to put in much effort into any assignment that I'd give them. And some of the surface level was more just Then saying something like, Oh, I really enjoyed the follow-up at the Indigenous People Center. I found it more useful, for example, than the class, the classroom visit. But then they didn't explain why. And so Kathy and I were talking about, well, it maybe would be good in the future iterations of this to have the students submit twice, which I guess is common in art studios. Which I guess is common in art studio classes where they get feedback on the first one and then they can resubmit. Because I think that some of the students could have written a bit more. And then some of them were very deep, which I'll get into. One student had done some computer science classes. And so that student was saying, well, we could run a computer, we could code. Run a computer, we could code some computer program to, you know, this is the size of the beads. I want to make a flower with four petals, two inches in diameter. And then it would print off little circles where all the beads should go. And then you could sort of follow that as a template. And so then there wouldn't be these little tiny gaps. One student mentioned the dimensions involved in feed work. Mention the dimensions involved in feed work because for some reason their two-dimensional flat triangle kept sort of starting to turn into a three-dimensional pyramid shape. So that student was talking about linear transformations between two dimensions and three dimensions. We talked a little bit about one-to-one functions, onto functions, invertible functions in theory. In theory, any mistake that you made in the bead work, you could undo by just going the opposite way through the needle, through the beads with the needle. So we talked about sort of the needle itself being kind of a linear transformation. So some quotes from the written work. So one of the students said, at the end of the day, a mathematician orders numbers. Day, a mathematician orders numbers into lines to solve for unknowns in an equation, while an artist places beads onto a string to create something beautiful. Both are simply looking to display rows of information in useful and meaningful ways. And Kathy and I both thought that quote was very deep, and definitely it gets gives you insight into a mathematician's or a math student's mind in terms of displaying information as Information as beautiful, as beauty. And one student was, well, there was some frustration with the lack of rigidity of instructions of how to bead. So when Kathy and her RA were doing the demonstration, they were very kind of laid back, and students would say, Oh, it would show them their beadwork. Oh, is this how it, is this the correct way of doing it? Is this right? Way of doing it, is this right? They say, Oh, yeah, that looks fine. Well, is it fine, or you know, are you just saying that it looks fine? And some students were up at the board kind of drawing it out. And this student for their written work created an algorithm. So, this is definitely, I've taught this, well, you get to know the students quite well in a small, small classroom, and definitely this is how their brain works. And so, Works. And so their write-up was: this is a quote from their write-up: put needle through beads five plus twon and six plus twon through the same side as it exists previous substeps. So they had steps and substeps, and n is the number of desired rows in this triangle part of the earring. So I thought that was interesting. I thought that was interesting. The way they sort of translated the beadwork into an algorithm. And one student attended the, at least one student attended the evening session, the sort of rowdy session at the Indigenous People Center. And so there was talking about, their write-up was talking about mental abuse towards humans, math, which we had to laugh at. Laugh at. And here's another quote: In dealing with a complex and intricate art form, whether it be beating or linear algebra, it's very easy to get overwhelmed in just how many different ways there are to mess up. And this student actually talked quite a bit about high school math, their experiences in high school math, and getting very frustrated with it. But then in the end, taking math at university because. Because after they figured, you know, it's a challenge that they enjoyed. And all it takes, however, is a few deep breaths and a positive self-affirmation or two to gently nudge yourself back on the right path. So very introspective. And so there's no right answer, right? This I thought was a fantastic, this is part of a fantastic write-up. And the algorithm I thought was fantastic. Algorithm, I thought, was fantastic. So those students did, I thought, great work, even though they were completely different write-ups. And just, I should wrap things up. So definitely build a relationship if you're looking to find someone at your university, maybe who has local expertise. And we were very open with the students. open with the students. And I would say, because of that, the students were very receptive. And I definitely would say this project pushed students out of their comfort zone. And I think that's a good thing because that's where learning happens. And so, yeah, I did mention we're thinking next time have the students submit twice. And then the last thing I'll mention is international students. International students. So there was, I guess, there was some concern that international students wouldn't really find this relevant. But Kathy and I were talking and a lot of our international, we do have quite a few international students at Brandon University, and many of them are actually indigenous in their own country. So we have some from Brazil, from Honduras who are indigenous from Central or South America. And there's an opportunity for cultural exchange. And I was just at the previous talk, but in the other parallel session, where there was the speaker, Mera, was talking about sort of this blend of culture and math and learning and art. And then Kathy and I also thought that this was helping for the hesitantly Indigenous students. Hesitantly Indigenous students. And I said at the start of my talk that not all the Indigenous students self-identify because there is some stigma there. And so there are what Kathy was calling hesitantly Indigenous students. And she thought that by Indigenizing some of the course content, this was sort of helping build confidence and letting them explore their own culture. So that is. So that is, so yeah, so we were both very happy with the results and we're hoping to share them in a publication soon. So that's all I wanted to say. So thank you. Had any of the students had any experience with beating before or were they all new to it? They were all new to it. So yeah, it was brand new to everyone. Brand new to everyone. And Kathy often has her students who are new start by just sorting the beads. Because even if you get beads that are all the same color, there's some that are kind of like not misshapen or not really the right color. Or she mixes them all up and then you have to sort. And you have to sort with the needle on the piece of felt on that paper plate. And so And so we skipped a lot of steps. So, when she does it with her art students, she does a lot of, you know, a few weeks or something before actually getting to beading earrings. So, we definitely skipped a lot of steps. We had to. We didn't have the time. So, yeah. I don't know if that answers your question. Are there other questions for Sarah? Sarah, we have a question with Sarah. Have you noticed that students with this experience continue just using these bits for learning other mathematics courses that they have, or just start to record? Start to connect some of these methods that they're using for dealing with the new mathematics concepts that they learn? I don't know because I haven't taught those students since doing that. So I don't know if they've continued. Yeah, one thing that was interesting was that many of the students went to the Indigenous People Center many times. Indigenous People Center many times, but then that semester, but then they didn't continue the next semester. So I'm not sure why, because they only needed to go once. So they were definitely going above and beyond. I think it was just maybe they wanted to finish the earrings, some of them. But yeah, and then the write-ups didn't just include connections to linear algebra. Like I was saying, the one student who had taken some computer science. The one student who had taken some computer science courses. So they were making connections definitely with previous courses that they had taken. But that is an interesting question, whether, you know, future, if they're, if this sort of expanded their mind and they're sort of thinking in new ways, I don't know how I would test that. I didn't quite get the way that you the You know, there was a connection for them between some of these transformations and the beating. Could you just say a little bit about that? So different type of rotations for each one of these beads, you rotate them and you allot with all those white beads on the shape that you should, but with the middle one, with the color one, they are not. So I didn't get that. Well, okay. Well, okay, so we were making a lot of mistakes. I was doing the earrings too, and the students, and we were all new to it. So the thing is that if you have, you know, a two by two matrix, A, B, C, D, but they're all white beads. So it's actually just A, A, A, A. So if you flag or you rotate, it doesn't matter. And so really, you could make a lot of mistakes up until you started adding a second color and then a third. Until you started adding a second color and then a third color, and then you really could not make any mistakes anymore. So, I had a math teacher years ago that said, if I make an even number of mistakes, they'll cancel each other out. That's interesting. Great. Are there questions, any comments? I have a question. Yeah, so I've done a lot of mathematical bead reading, and I never thought. And I never thought about the relationship between linear algebra and bead work. And I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you see as some of the major connections there. Yeah, I think the major connections would be these linear transformations. At least for me, that's what I saw with taking, yeah, say a column vector in a four-dimensional column vector and then transforming it into a two-by-two matrix through the Into a two by two matrix through this very first action of the four beads and then stringing the needle back in and getting the two by two block. And then we did talk a little bit about invertible linear transformation, so being able to undo the action and what else? I guess to some extent, one-to-one and onto linear transformation. To linear transformations. Well, I suppose we kept adding EDS, and then the next row would have too fewer and too fewer and too fewer to get this triangle. So I guess we could, yeah, we could talk a little bit about domain being the beads that you're about to string on, and range being the sort of after effect. Sort of after effect of stringing it through the needle. So that was where I saw the most connections. And then it was interesting to see students make connections to other math courses. So I think it just so happened that I was teaching this linear algebra course. But if I'd been teaching, say, a combinatorics or graph theory course or geometry course, there was. There would definitely be connections there as well. Thank you so much, Sarah. Let's just say thank you to Sarah and before we start the short and make us ready for Henry Adam's uni course. Thank you so much.
