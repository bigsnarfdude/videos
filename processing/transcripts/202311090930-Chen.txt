We're going to talk about refined atoms conjecture via LIR. Actually, if there is not so much things to do with OIR, I should apologize and delay it this term. So at the beginning, So I begin from explain the title. What is the Adams conjecture? The Adams conjecture is just a conjecture described the CETA correspondence in terms of A parameters. And so let me first briefly recall what is the CETA correspondence. If you have listened to the talk on Monday, I think you should notice the Situ correspondence. You should notice the setup correspondence. In this talk, let me just focus on the unitary group case. So let's have a local field of characteristic zero and E to be a quadratic extension of it. If one is given the following data, the first is Hermitian form, Hermitian space V over E and a skew Hermitian space W over E and the second some auxiliary data Which consists of an additive character ψ f of f and additive and character chi v and chi w of e cross satisfy certain conditions, then you can associate a way representation of the unitary group UV cross uw and And if you have a representation pi, say irreducible representation of the unitary group U W, you can consider the maximum pi isotopic quotient of the wave representation omega, which should be of the form pi tensor submultiplicity space. I denote it by big zeta pi. And it's easy to show that you have an action of UV on this space, it's called the big zeta lift. And if and we have the how duality, if we know that if zeta pi is non-zero, then it's in the meets and unique. Irreducible quotients, which is usually denoted by small theta pi. And the map from irreducible representation of uw delates those representation pi, such that zeta pi is zero to the inward. To the irreducible representation of UV by sending each representation right here, by sending each representation pi to set up pi is an injective. Sorry? Oh yeah, yeah, not equal to zero. Sorry. Not equal to zero. Sorry. It's a I write it wrong. So why we care about the CETA correspondence? I think different people have different answers, but for me, my answer is my answer is because Answer is because people expect that situation correspondence realize certain functorality and the Adams conjecture. Conjecture describe this functority So to be more precise, what is the Adam's conjecture? Let me write down first. So it's It says it says roughly speaking, it says that the setup correspondence realize this functionality you since I work with unitary groups, so the due group is GL, is GL and semi-direct product Z MO2Z, but usually we should we Usually, we will compose an A parameter of the unitary group with the standard representation to get a conjugate self-dual representation of the way the group cross-SL2. So, I use this form. It realizes this. Oh, I forgot. I forgot. Suppose letter. I forgot. Suppose that the dimension of W is N, which is less or equals than the dimension of V, which I denote by M. So you can write down this functionality. It sends the elements GX, G in GR and CX in SL2, SL2C to this block diagonal. In this block, you have G. In this block, you have A M minus N X. Well, A M minus N X is the unique M minus N dimensional representation of the SL2. Okay, but but since but since we are working with Untergroup there is there is also some issues of the splitting character so so more this is just roughly speaking to be more precise I erase here to be more precise. It says that it says that if you have a parameter psi of the unitary group UW and you have pi inside this A packet. Packet then if theta pi is non-zero, then theta pi belongs to an a packets associated to an associated to an a parameter set of UV, where theta psi can be explicitly write down as. So basically right down as here, you just I explain this. You just simply twist the parameter psi by these two characters, and then you adding adding an extra block. An extra block chi w box tensor S M minus N So concern the least Adam's conjecture what has been done For synthetic orthogonal to pair over a non-archimedian over a non-archimedian local field F there are two results. There are two results. The first is by Mogleng. She proved that if M minus N is greater than the biggest one, biggest B minus A plus one, where for those block S A box tensor S B inside psi, then Then the Adams conjecture holds. She also provides many counterexamples saying that the atoms conjecture is not always true. And based on McGreen's results, package and handler shows that given an A parameter psi of UV of UW, sorry Uh there exists an in and pi belongs to this a packet. There exists an integer, positive integer d pi psi, such that as long as m is greater or equal to d pi psi then then set up pi. Then sit up pi lies in the apex predicted by the conjecture as long as setup high is non-zero. And moreover, they show that least d pi psi can be Can be computed using an algorithm of being shuffled by the market. Okay, let me let me then briefly recall how how they achieve list how they proof list Basically, they prove used two ingredients. The first is explicit construction of a packets. The second is the standard tool in the seat of correspondence, namely the cutlerless filtration. And let me first explain how Moglin show is. She first considered the so-called stable range case. What is the benefit of this stable range case? In this Of this stable range case in this stable range case for any pi lysine, for any pi unitary group of any pi irreducible representation of other type of this unitary group UW. Let me just write it as this. We know that setup high is non-zero. theta pi is non-zero and moreover pi does not roughly speaking live on the on the boundary of the cooler filtration I have at least two benefits. She can prove the stable range case. And then she used an argument called descent along the week tower. And so this argument allows she to allow she to generalize her result on the stable range case to a lower range. And basically, Moglin's range for the adult conjecture is roughly speaking the lowest range. such that the adding block I w box tensor S M minus N is the largest guy in some admissible order and They use Moglene's result as an initial input and they continue the arguments of Mogleng's this argument descend along the we tower and you and apply some and apply some new results of of being shu. Of being shu, the flu of change, admissible order, and some algorithm to detect if certain data gives a non-vanishing representation in the A packets. Okay, uh let's let's uh strategically prove uh the results. The result. And there are still many questions one can ask about this Adam's conjecture. For example, the first one can ask a given psi, which is an A parameter of UW, can we say something? Can we say something about can say something about the minimum of this d pi psi where pi where pi lies in this a packet because because uh in many in applications you don't want uh if you're starting from an a parameter uh if you're starting from An a parameter, if you're starting for a packets associated to list sign and do the CTA correspondence, you don't want your representation does not go to the expected A packets or goes to here and there in many different packets. So it's meaningful to ask if we can say something about this minimum dπ psi. And the second is that That ASEAR and MOC, when they do the endoscopy classification, they also define the map for each A packet from this A packet to the character of component groups associated to this psi. And in many applications, you also want to know how this map J behave under the CETA correspondence. For example, when you use the CISO argument to deal with Fourier-Jacobi model of the non-tempered GGP or the twisted GGP conjecture, you would like to know the behavior of this. Behavior of this map on the set of correspondence explicitly in certain epsilon factors. And the third, of course, of course, you Of course, you can ask what about the other dupa and what about the Archimedean face? A psi hat. A psi means the component group associated to this A parameter psi, and the hat means the Punctual Due of this guy. So if you have a representation, it associates you a character of the definition of leaves is quite hard, I think. So it's not very easy to So, in this talk, I will focus on the question two for stable range unitary due pair. Okay, as I explained, the proof of Moggling and the bucket handser uses the stable range as an initial input. So for Unitary Jupyter, I would first like to investigate this stable range case. Let me, but I will not use the explicit construction of a package, rather I will use another feature of the of the okay, okay, of the ASA packets, namely the namely the ASAS multiplicity formula. Formula. I will first explain what in what assumptions I will work with, my working assumption. Well, simply denote it by AMF. And by this AMF, I mean five assumptions. The first three assumptions are local, and the last two assumptions are global. The first is that for an A parameter psi this A packets high psi of U W is defined. Of course, you want to list to be defined. Otherwise, what you to play with and equipped with a map J from list A packets to the character of common groups. And the second, And the second is that this A packet pi psi UW is multiplicity free. And the third assumption, local assumption, is that if psi can be written as something like psi Psi tau plus plus site zero plus side tau conjugates check conjugate do then then the packet can be construct then this packet can be constructed as a parabolic induction. How to write pi belongs to and pi zero lies in this a package associated to site zero and the others and if uh oh I need to assume this is good is of good parity and and uh let me let me Let me write it as this. If psi is something like this, then this a packet can be constructed using the parabolic induction. And if further, if further size of good parity Then the normalize the intertwining operator defined by Arthur acting on each pipe belongs to this belongs to this induction. I write here. I write here by scalars okay J pi A tau here here epsilon is the here epsilon is the sine of this of this Hermitian of this scale Hermitian space W and Base W and K is the dimension of this site tau. And A tau is the basis element in the component group corresponding to this site tau. Okay, this is my local assumption. And my global assumption is the following. The first is that if we are working with If we are working with number field E over F and W is a scale commission space over E, then this L2 discrete of UW can be decomposed into near equivalence classes, and each near equivalence classes Represents by an elliptic A parameter of this UW. The second global assumption is that you can define the for each elliptic A parameter psi, you can define the canonical sign character epsilon psi, which is a character of the global component. Which is a character of the global component group. And similar to ASAR, you can define the global A packets psi of uw eta psi, which is basically the restricted tensor product of all local a packets satisfying certain A packet satisfying certain conditions given by this canonical sign character epsilon, and I have this near-equivalent class L2 psi of UW decomposed according to this global A packet. Yes. Good parity means all size, side, side. Psi is of good parity. Yes. Okay, let me let me first give a few remarks. Let's explain what is LII in the title means. The first is that it's about the local condition three. Condition three, a tollware proves that ASL or Marx local intertwining relation, which is originally formulated as the equality of two distributions, implies our assumption, local assumption L3. Local assumption L3, he proves this for temper sign. And if we assume the second condition, namely the multiplicity freeness. There are Tobias proof also works for non-tempered sign. That's why I assumed the multiplicity freeness because in ASA and Mox works, they didn't desert. Works they didn't observe the multiplicity freeness and the second for quasi-splits unitary groups This L1, L3, G1, G2 has been proved by mock. And of course, following us, following. And of course, following the work of Arthur, and for L2, I guess it's already proved by Moglan and in the non-Archimedean case and by Moglen-Renard for non-Archimedean places. So basically, for quasi-speed intergroups, all the assumptions are established. Established and for non-quasi split intergroups Careta, Mingus, Shing, and White has proved my assumption for temporary A packets. And for non-temporal A packets, there is two ongoing work. These two ongoing work by Kaleta Mingus Shing and Atobe Gen Ichino Kaleta Mingus Shin. Okay, so all these, all my assumptions are expected. I assume these five conditions for Five conditions for both quasi-split and non-quasi-split. Okay, so let me let me write down my results capable of finding one. I would like to. I would like to keep this board because I will use it after a while. So, uh, I forgot to I forgot to say this is a joint work with Zhang Yangzhou. Okay, uh so suppose suppose that the width index of V Index of V, here I work with this local. Width index of V is greater or equals to the dimension of W and size A parameter for the intergroup UW. Then the first is that the Adams conjecture for pi in this A parameter pi size, theta. parameter pi phi theta I use v to denote this is this is the theta lift of pi to the group uv then uv lies in this a parameter pi theta psi where theta psi is so is the one predicted by the atoms conjecture The second is that if pi if pi corresponding to the to the character eta of a psi, then theta pi, theta v pi corresponding to the a parameters theta eta. theta eta lies in this a theta psi, which can be determined as the following if m and n are different parity which is just the same as one of this is even and one of this is all then the sita eta eta restricted to the component group A psi you can see here that this theta psi if if you ignore the twisting by character then this theta psi is nothing but by adding one one extra block to this psi to this a parameter psi so you can regard this a psi as a subgroup of a theta psi then if if you restrict the theta eta If you restrict θ eta to this a side, then it's just eta itself. On the other hand, if m and n are of the same parity, I write here, then for each basis elements a in this a psi in this In this component group A Psi, suppose it's corresponding to some to some subrepresentation psi i of psi, then theta eta evaluates at Ai quotient eta Ai equals to the epsilon factor. Here, psi E d is certain additive character of E of E modified from psi F. So this is not very important, so let's see. Let's just say ignore it. Let's just say ignore it. If you are familiar with the almost equal rank eta correspondence, you can see that the behavior of this eta is very similar as the almost equal rank case, actually. And the third is that the CTA correspondence gives a bi-ejection. From pi psi of UW to pi zeta psi of uv. Here, the w runs over all n-dimensional scale Hermitian spaces over this over this quadratic field. Over this quadratic field, quadratic field extension E over of F. Okay, any questions so far? Yes. I think for one is already proved by Moglin. is is already proved by Moglin for two uh for two is not it's not really because Moglin use hers uh hers uh uses her parametrization rather than others parametrization of the a packets the two the two parametrizations are different so you need to detect what is the difference Yeah, yeah, I assume all. But for quasi-split groups, they are fully established, and for non-quasi-split group, there are some works trying to establish. Okay, what is the key ingredient? It's the notion of it's a notion of so-called low-rank punitive representation. Low-rank junitory representation, which is, I guess, first introduced by Roger Hao and extended by Jian Shu Li. By the way, Jian Shu Li is the director of our IASM at Zhejiang University. At Zhejiang University. So let me briefly recall what is the feature of these low-rank representations. So at first, locally, when still under the same assumption that the wheat index Rv is greater or equal to N. Is greater or equal to n. Then locally, I have a bijection between irreducible unitary unitary representations of UW. I union all this together while W runs over the n-dimensional commission. The n-dimensional commission spaces cross E1 hat. Well, E1 is the norm one elements in this E and the hat means the function I can do again. This is bijective with the irreducible unitary representations of Of UW UV of rank N. Here, if you start with the representation pi and the character chi, chi of e cross, you just send it to theta v pi twisted by chi composed with determinant. Composed with determinants. Okay, this is one-to-one bijection. This is the local local results and globally globally if sigma is a Now, this is an irreducible unitary representation of UV a dynamic point which occurs as subrepresentations of AUV. Here, AUV means automorphic functions on Automorphic functions on this group on this group UV then we have three three equivalent statements the first is that sigma is of rank n and the second is that And the second is let sigma v at some place v is of rank n for some v. And the third is let sigma v is of rank n for all v, all places v. And once, and once these three conditions, three conditions, these three equivalent conditions are satisfied, then you can find the then you can find the find the commission space W over over E and then automorphic character chi of E one such that sigma is the Is the SETA lift? Sorry, sorry. You can find an Hermitian scale Hermitian space W of dimension N and the automorphic character chi and automorphic representation pi of this list W, list UW. Such that this sigma is the component-wise theta lift. I use theta abs to denote the component-wise theta lift of pi cancel with this automorphic character chi. Of course, composed with the determinant. By component-wise, theta lift, I mean let's because pi decomposes a restricted tensor product pi v, you do the theta lift for all pi v and tensor n together. This is theta absv pi. Okay. And another thing I need to use is an equality of Jian Shu Li, an inequality of Jian Shu Li. It says the following: if pi is an irreducible unitary representation. Of UWA and you can define m pi to be the multiplicity of pi occurs in the occurs in the this A U W and and you can define And you can define this M2π, which is a dimension of this pi occurs in A2UW, where A2UW is the intersection of AUW with the L2 discrete UW. W okay likewise you can define likewise you can define M sita V A B S pi and M two Seta V A B S pi and the theorem of Jinxu Li 97 says that M two pi that's all equals to M two Seta V pi that's all equals to M Seta V and that's equals to M pi okay this is all the ingredients I need Next, to explain the proof. The proof uses the global method. Proof of the first assertion. It's easy. Yes. Yes. Not not actually, I think. Not actually, I think. If assuming the multiplicity one, you know these two guys are either zero or one, right? But for these two, it's not necessary, right? Okay, okay, okay. Proof of one. There are two steps. The first step is given a parameter. A parameter, a parameter psi of this uw. I assume this is of good parity because for non-good parity case, you can easily deduce from the good parity case. We globalize it to an A parameter psi, elliptic a parameter. Capital Psi of some global parameter of some global unitary group UW and and at two places V and omega at V you have we have At V you have we have list psi localize equals to psi v and and that's an at least auxiliary place w we have good control of component group have good control on the component group This is step one. And step two is that you having this global data, you can global for any for any pi in this local a parameter pi psi of u w, you can globalize it's using the other multiplicity formula to a representation pi. Pi and then and then you apply the theta lift to the to a stable range group gets gets theta absv of pi and by the generally by generally inequality you know let's list theta v abs pi V A B S Pi occurs in the discrete spectrum of U V. Okay, the step three the step The step three is to compute the near equivalence class of this theta vabs pi. But since now you are working with global guys, you can compute at our ramified place to determine the near equivalence class. So it's relatively easily, you can deduce that this lies in the this has the a parameter theta size. parameter theta psi where you well theta psi is a similar guy as the local Adams conjecture is some similar guy and then you use the answer multiplicity formula in the reverse direction you localize it you get you get theta pi equals to theta theta pi equals to zeta absvi localized at some place v which belongs to this pi set aside okay this finish the proof of first statements and proof of two proof of the second statement We use an idea of October. Namely, instead of looking at this representation pi and representation sita v pi, we look at the parabolic induction with all space representation tau of Representation tau of some GL. And imitating the argument of Gang Ichino, we can establish explicit some explicity diagram from omega total tense tensor with chi w tau semi-direct product with situ. Product with Cita V uh Cita V Pi check. We have a following without the Following diagram where the vertical arrows are given by normalizing into 20 operators. And the horizontal map is some explicitly constructed map, which is essentially some Goldman-Jacques K integral, which is essentially some Goldman Jack. And this diagram commutes after up to a computer. Up to a computable constant. So, this allows us to compute the information of this intertwining operator using this intertwined using this intertwining operator, and by our assumption L3. And by our assumption L3, this allows you to determine the theta eta of associated to this theta pi. Okay, this is this gives the proof of two and Oh, sorry, I should say this is just for non-Archimedean. Non-Archimedean phases, we use this method. For Archimedean phases, we use global method again. Since we can use this method to show the observation two for all non-Archimedean places, and for Archimedean places, we can use global method and AMF to deduce the same conclusion. And proof of three. Proof of three for an for a representation, sigma lies in this ape kit predicted by the Adams conjecture. We need to find the representation pi of u w of for some w such that. For some w such that the zeta lift of pi is sigma. And again, we use the global method. Globalize this sigma to some discrete automorphic representation of some global UV and of the neo equivalence class. near equivalence class of the near equivalence class this guy and and then apply gen shuli's results uh you know that this global guy is coming from coming from a coming from some Coming from some uh automorphic representation of of some UW but to show the but to show the local component of this pi liking certain a packet, we would like to use the AMF again, but but genuinely results only tells you that this. result only tells you that this pi is automorphic but not but not telling you that it lies in the discrete spectrum of the automorphic uh it's not uh it's not necessarily lies in the automorphic spectrum uh discrete automorphic spectrum so uh so the the idea to to resolve this issue is that when globalizing this sigma you uh you pick up an oxidary place and And you carefully globalize this. You carefully pick up the local component at that place such that is strictly negative, and that will guarantee this pi to lies in the discrete spectrum. Okay, this finishes the Okay, this finishes the proof of three assertions. And now I would like to turn the tables. That's why I keep this board. Just now I say that I assume this AMF for both quasi-splits and the split groups. And assuming this, we have seen. Assuming this, we have seen that the stable range atoms conjecture can be relatively easily deduced from these assumptions, AMF. So the nature of question is that can we, if we only assume this AMF for quasi-speak groups, can we use the CETA leaf to say something about this AMF for non-quasi-speak group? So now we only assume this for quasi-split group. For quasi-sprite groups. And we would like to deduce, we would like to deduce something for the AMF for non-quasi split groups. And here is the daydream of Jiaoliang and I. It's not a actually, it's not a dream, just a daydream. Saying, says the following, if pi is in a near equivalence class represented by represented by represented by an elliptic here here pi is a pi is a global is a global representation of some of some Dalic group say it is in the near equivalence class represented by an elliptic a parameter Then Jen Shu Li's inequality is actually an equality. Inequality is an equality. And we have the following results. Maybe I write two. The first is by Gang Chino. This lets this is true if psi tempered And Jariang and I also prove that when the when the weight index of list W when the weight index of least W is less than or equal to one, then the daydream The daydream comes true. I should remark here that the proof of this theorem one and two does not rely on The AMF for non-quasi speeds actually does not rely on AMF, I think. Okay, so once so, in these situations, you can you can define. You can define locally, you can define if your Google is non-quasi-split, you can define the A packets, which is pi in the irreducible representation of UW, such as theta pi lies in zeta psi. Sit aside for some stable bigger group UV. And globally, and globally, you can define the canonical sign character same as other and tensor them together. Tensor this local a packet together. To define the global A packets and you have a and you and you have a AMF in this for this group. So you can dedu actually you can deduce as a multiplicity formula for this non-classic group. This non-class display group. And actually, with some further argument, we can show that this formula satisfy our assumption L1, L2, L3, and G1, G2. Yes, of course. Uh you mean this the one this no no no only when only in these two cases so so either side is tempered or or the global group is has rank less or equal to one ah yes Sorry. Actually, this is an embarrassing question. We are trying to prove our daydream. If this can be shown, then all the cases can. And all the cases of the AMF can be established. But it's quite hard. But I think if the A parameter, if this global elliptic A parameter is regular, which means the cospital representation occurs in this side are all different, then I think we have some hope to show this. We have some hope to show this daydream. Yeah, any? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry. There are still many applications, especially for the metapellatic group MP. Just so two last minutes. Let me speak two last minutes. Actually, what I wrote is just now it's not that new because Moglin has already defined these a parameters, a packet for mp2n to be to be. To be this And we can we can ask some questions is our daydream Is our daydream true for MP SO do pairs? Shall I have verified the case of MP6? It's true. And the second is that since now we already have a very good explicit construction of A packets for SO2R plus one. And so 2R plus 1. Can we use the stable rand theta lift to obtain an explicit construction of a packets for MP2N and generalize the work of Atobe and Hazelting, Leo and Low. Okay, let's go. Thank you.
