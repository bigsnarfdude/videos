So, for the last talk of the day, we have Federico Trinka from the University of Oxford who will be telling us about calibrated geometry in G2 manifolds with Como JD2. Thank you very much, Penzalo, for the introduction. And thank you very much to all the organizers for setting up such an amazing conference. I'm having a lovely time and I learned so much. Learned so much. So, I'm going to change that now. You're not going to learn anything in my talk, but hopefully, you will have a good time. So, as Gonzalo said, I will be talking about calibrated jump in G2 manifolds with homogeneity to symmetry. So, this is based on joint work with Ben Aslan, which should be ready soon. This is what I said in September of twenty twenty two. In September of 2022, and the public is not out yet. So I'm going to improve my estimates now and say that it's going to be ready very soon. And this is what I'm saying now. Okay. So the overview of my talk is going to be, well, this one. So I will start by telling you some preliminaries. So some stuff that you probably have never heard before, like the two manifolds and the substitution for substitutes to manifolds. Sensitives and cositives to manifolds. And then I will start the actual part of the talk where I will discuss a bit about G2 manifolds with T2 times SG2 symmetry, T2 invariant associatives, T3 invariant co-associatives, and I will apply my discussion to the manifolds constructed by false-colour half-ins and all-true. So please feel free to interrupt me at any point. I don't know how long I will go. Okay. So you can start. Okay. Good. Any other comments? Good. So preliminaries. So the things that I will be talking about are about G2 geometry. So the local model, as you might know, is R7, which we see as R3 plus R4, and the free form, Phi0, which is the volume form plus the Xi quadrimigai. The Xi are the The Xi are the coordinates of R3, and the omega are the empty self-dual two forms on R4. That's the right idea. It's a nice definition, isn't it? It's your definition. I like it. It's my favorite one. Am I the first one using this definition? No, no, no. Are you still using it? I am. I also started by doing this, but I don't know interactions. Okay. Well, I should have said, I mean, maybe not too many interruptions. I changed my mind. So we have these R7 with a free form. So we want to pass from a local model to a global one. So we have a seven manifold with a free So we have a seven manifold with a free form and we just want to identify the tangent space with a in the free form and the tangent space with R seven and V naught. If such a free form is closed and co-closed, then we are in the Trussian free condition, so the aluminum is V2 and blah blah blah. What I will be using is that given a G2 structure, you are inducing also a cross product on your manifold, which is defined by, well, taking the musical isomorphism of. Musical isomorphism of T of XY. Okay, so now if we have a G2 manifold, so Trosian free condition, we automatically have two calibrations, P and star phi, and so we have associative manifolds with that ones that are calibrated by phi, and cosositives to manifolds that are ones calibrated by star phi. So these are some propositions, some conditions on the associative and cositive planes that can be translated to That can be translated to a global setting. So, a plane is associative if and only if it's orthogonal, it is co-associative. So, it is equivalent to saying that the cross-product is preserved, phi now, and it is not preserved in the orthogonal. And we also have these two conditions on phi and sli. Okay, a proposition that I think no one mentioned so far. No one mentioned so far is the local existence and uniqueness of associates and cositives to manifolds. So, this was done by Irving Lawson in 82 in their, well, best paper ever. If we have a two-dimensional sub-manifold and two, then we can extend locally our sub-manifold to an associative, which is three-dimensional, and this can always be done under some analytic condition. We have an analytic condition, which I will always assume. And the same holds for cross-susative submanifolds, but we need to assume that vanishes on such a three-dimensional sub-manifold, and it is an obviously condition that you really have to track because it's in the characterization that I mentioned before. It needs to vanish on end. Okay. Okay, so what I will be talking about is: well, I mentioned homogeneity 2, T2 times SV2, but at the end of the day, I will be doing homogeneity 1 superfold theory. So I guess there is a lie in my title. So what is homogeneity 1? I have an action with the orbit which is of dimension n minus 1 with respect to the object that I want to study. And these give me a principal orbit. Give me a principal orbit which is of the dimension I want, so two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and I automatically have a calibrated manifold through it. So we always have local existence under these assumptions. So bear with me. Now I will say something that is, I mean, we all know, but no one has said it out loud. It was just our secret so far. So we have a manifold with a Lee group. Have a manifold with a Lie group acting effectively on it, so we have an injective ovomorphism from gene to the diffimorphism group. And well, okay, at this point we can induce a stabilizer Gx, which is the points of G that fix G under its action, and the orbit space, which is just the points that you can reach by your action. So, the two theorems that I want to recall from VTF. To recall from the differentiable transformation groups theory is that this life theorem is essentially such that the normal bundle is isomorphic to this associated bundle here. So near an orbit, we can really reconduct our differential geometry to representation theory. And it's the normal at one point. And yeah, the second theorem that I am going to use and I'm going to state is the Obi-Type certification theorem. So, if you are in the setup I just mentioned, you automatically can split your manifold into some strata, not defining what the strata is, but let's say it's moving by this manifold, which is characterized by the stabilizer at that point up to conjugation and the stratification. And this gratification also passes to the quotient M or it shift. Moreover, so I'm actually talking about three theorems, not just two, because there is also the principal obituary theorem here, which says that I can find a subgroup of G, which is the principal stabilizer, such that up to conjugation, I'm always inside some other stabilizer. Stabilizer and the manifold that I get from HP is open and dense. So now the preliminaries are out of the way. So if there are any questions now, even silly ones are fine. Careful, changeful. Yeah, okay. So I guess you haven't really paid attention to my title because I promise homogeneity too in general, and I'm only only talking about. In general, and I'm only only talking about T2 times SC2. There is no typo. I just lied, plainly. I'm only going to talk about T2 times SC2 today and forever. So the setup I have is, I have a G2 manifold, G, M, sorry, with a T2 times ST2 option, but I will call G from now on. And my G is an injective homomorphism into the automorphism. Homomorphism into the automorphism group of MP. So I'm preserving the G2 structure as well. Given such an injective homomorphism, I have the generators of the action that I call V1, V2 if I'm in the T2 component or V1, V2, V3 if I'm in the C2 components. So I guess I'm assuming my action to be injective, so I'm not really in the homogeneity 2 setup. Setup, but this time I'm not flying anymore. It's just I don't want to pass through portions and stuff. Okay, so first thing I want to say is that I'm not talking about the empty set here. I'm talking about a bunch of manifolds. There are a lot of examples of G2 manifolds with T2 times SC2 symmetry. For instance, well, the easy trivial C3 times S1, but also the Barn and Salmon manifolds of And Thalman manifolds of topologies three times R4. And finally, the manifold that I mentioned before, the Fossolo-Harski-Nostrum manifolds, which are the G2 manifolds recently constructed by them in 2018, I think is when the preprint came out. And these generalize the Brian and Solomon manifolds and the BGGG manifolds that were mentioned by Isaiah, I think. Okay. Okay, so now we have an effective G-action, but also we are inducing three more actions, which are the T2 given by T2 times identity, and S2 given by identity times S2, and T3 given by T2 times S1. So, as I said, I'm going to only talk about homogeneity one in reality, and that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to study calibrated. Study calibrated invariance of manifolds in with respect to these three actions here. Okay, so this was a table first, but after I've seen that mixed feelings about tables, so I changed it into a TRM and hopefully you want to make me go back. So So in the setup of before, I have M, which splits into five strata, the principal part, and so I have M, which is a G2 manifold with G2 times SG2 symmetry. Then there will be type certification to make me split my manifold into strata. And I claim that in our setup, we have only five strata, which are the principal parts, where the stabilizer is identity. So we don't have any exceptional orbits. Any exceptional orbits, and the dimension of empty is absolutely seven because of the principle orbit type theorem. Then the second stratum that we're looking at is S1 and these characterized by having one-dimensional stabilizer, and the only possibility is a U1. And the dimension of this stratum is 5, but you know, the 3, S2, and the dimension. 3, S2, and the dimension is 3. And S3, 3-dimensional, the stabilizer, and the dimension of S3 is 3, as a sub-manifold. And finally, S4, the stabilizer is U2, and the dimension of S4 is 1. So this is just representation theory. Indeed, we deduced using the, this using the slice theorem, but we also know how all the gx mentioned before. All the G acts mentioned before act on the norm of an ode. Moreover, what we show is that with respect to the T2 action, the singular set of this T2 action is only contained in S2 and S4, what is actually S2 and S4. So I'm talking about many actions now, and I know it can be confusing, but I have 82 times ST2 action. A T2 times a T2 action inducing a stratification, and then T2 action, which also induces a stratification, and the singular set of this new T2 action is contained in S2 and S4. Finally, the tangent space of this data are given by the, well, the tangent space of the row betas is usually plus U1 times U2. So the cross-browder of the generator is of the T. Of the generators of the T2 component. Great. Any question on this table, Kundlava? Yes, what is U1 times U2? Sorry? So U1, U2 are the generators of the T2 option, and U1 times T2 is the cross-border. So when you say here T2, you always mean the T2 on the left. So you never need to. No. No, this T2 can see anything. Well, not anything, but yes, almost anything. Yes, almost anything. I mean, I don't know. I haven't checked if any T2 in T2 cancel C2 could be the stabilizer of some stuff. But this T2 actually, this is just the T2 on the left. Yes, this one is just the T2 on the left. Yes, yes. But this T two this T two is not. But it's the but all the the S the guys in the points in S4. In the points in S4, they are stabilized by one of the S1s in the left. Yeah. And the other S1 is the one contained. So they are only stabilized by one of the S1s in the left. These ones? Yes. And so you are in the similar set of T2 because you just need one to be in the similar set. I mean, is there an easy reason why these are all connected groups of distances? Oh, yeah, they use a lie in my table, yes. Yes, I mean, of some of them, I can say that is actually true. For instance, in this case, you know, we know that SC2 is really the SC2 on the right, and it's the component, you know, it's not just the identity component, but in general, yes. No, no, no, it's acting by No, no, no, it's acting by automorphism. So I'm pre-segment that you do structure. But for the principal part, it really has to be stabilizer strain of beauty determined. Yes, yes, yes. In that case, yes. I don't have any exceptional obvious, yes. Any other question? This is a tough table. You know which ones can be the most zero of the other one by just checking the inclusions of the groups. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can, I mean, we actually I could draw you a little diagram of what can be next to each other. Yes. Okay. So now given a group action, which is structure preserving on a closed geometry, so GT geometry in our case, we have these objects called multi-moment maps, which were defined by maximized one. Max length one. For instance, in our case, we have theta one and theta two, which are defined by the infrared differential. So the definition of theta one, theta two. This is the definition of mu, which is the one essentially is the dual of a cross product. Just so you know, that when we take a gradient of mu, we're really talking about u1 times u2. Then we also have mu, which is essentially the Essentially the multimomen map related, well, the multimomine map of the T3 action, U1, U2, PI, and eta, which is the one related to the RC2 component. So there are some properties of these multi-moment maps that one can deduce from, well, just looking at them essentially. And what we deduce is that nu and deta are T2 times H2 invariant. So if you put SC2 invariant. So if you quotient your manifold by T2 times SC2, these nu and theta are still going to make sense back. Then theta L and mu, they are T2 invariant, but they cannot be SC2 invariant, they are only SC2 equivariant. Because if you take the derivative of, you just look at the lead derivative here, you see that it's going to give you an SC2 action. But if we take the absolute value, these are T2 times FC2. These are T2 times SV2 invariant, and so they pass to the quotient. And this is going to be the crucial idea, just forgetting about everything and passing to the quotient. Because I'll give you a piece of tough math here: 7 minus 5 is to surface. So everything is much nicer there. Okay. So like sorry? So not talking about what we've got. Okay, so just yeah. Yeah, I mean the ab well, the absolute value is we know. Okay, so now we'll be talking about T2 invariant associatives. So we need a few crucial observations. So the first one is that if we are outside of the T2 action, of the similar set of the T2 action, which is S2, S4, S2, S4, even by the table, I mean not the table, but not table before. We have an L is T2 invariant associative if and only if its quotient is an integral curve of gradman, which is U1 times U2. This is something, I mean, these are observations indeed. The interesting thing is that the flow of U1 times U2 is preserved by the stabilizer, and so looking for T2 environmental. So, looking for the two environment associates splits with the certification. And so, instead of looking at integral curves in a generic thing, we can restrict ourselves to the various parts. And so, this is the first proposition, and the only proof that you'll see from me is that mu is preserved by the flow of u1 times c2. And so we have three first integral of the system of bodies that we're looking at. Of the system of bodies that we're looking at. So once again, easy math, 7 minus 3 is 4, minus 2 given by the T2 action. So we are looking at integral curves in a surface again. So the proof is not very complicated. We just plug in U1 times C2 in the new con, and what we see is that U1, U2, U1 times C2 is. U1, U2, U1 times C2 is an associative plane, and so these values. Okay, so my main result about T2 times ST2 invariant, well, T2 invariant associatives is that given my manifold splitting in the way above, then we can find all the T2 invariant associatives in the principal part, and this corresponds to the level sets of mu in the quotient. Of mu in the quotient. So now in the quotient, we really know what RT2 invariant effect is. And this is up to an horizontal lift, which I'm not going to comment on. So we settled this case here. Now we look at S1. What happens at S1? We have, so let me call you so that we don't have to go back, but S1 is five-dimensional. So what we've shown was that we can find an explicit. What we've shown was that we can find an explicit submersion into the sphere, and the fibers are all T2 invariant associatives. Then we look at S2. This is also T2 invariant associatives, and this follows from the certification theorem that I mentioned before. S1 was one-dimensional. Five-dimensional. So yeah. Five minus two is still free. Okay. And finally, as free linear as four. And finally, S3D and S4 is T2 environment associative. And so we have essentially up to settling what's going on in MP over T2 times SC2, we have constructed an associative vibration in the sense of perigeanis and motae. I mean the ones in NP, they'll be these level sets of new, so you can like draw them on the quotient, but now you need to check how they affect. I need to check the sections. Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is the next point. It's here. I mean, this is another point. But yeah. Yes. So you have your... So you know that if your parabola exists and you need to, so you need to refer to that. Yeah, you raise that. So essentially, you have like MP here, and let's say a And let's say S1, and here you have an S2. And you're looking at integral curves of U1 times C2. So if you're in S1, you say in S1 in work root. And if you start here a priori, you could meet your S2. That is something that a priori could do. It could happen. But this doesn't happen. And this is exactly the reason why we did use this. Reason why we deduce this movement for multi-two environment associates, because these are the level sets of mu. And μ is 0. And these are outside of 0. So we need to be for sure epsilon separated by the single acceptor, the T2 option. So, can you say why are things from your first bullet point? It's three-dimensional. This one? This one? So you go to the T2 times SC2 quote, you have a curve, and then you want to lift the curve to the SU2 bundle over MP over AT2 times SU2. Is it that for? T2 bundle. Oh, to the T2 bundle. No, no, no, no. I mean the S2 bundle. If you lift a curve to the RC2 bundle, you have still a curve. Oh, yeah, yeah. T2. And then you multiply by T2. And then you multiply by D2 and you get a free. Sorry. We need that. All good? Each curve downstairs actually corresponds to a whole S3. Yeah, sure. And I don't know how to compute this. Horizontal lift maps. I have no idea. But it doesn't matter because I know where they are up to. Okay. Any other comments? Any other comment, question? Oh, yes. So these ones, so these ones, as I said, they will never meet the singular set, so they exist for all time, if you wish. So these are always T2 times R, or T2 times an open integral. These ones are usually. Are usually S3 or some quotient of S3, and these ones are as well S3 or quotient of S3. These ones are going to have different topology, and I will come back to it if I can when I go to the first glass. Okay. Oh, any other question? Okay. So now I'll briefly comment on the T3 invariant and the RC2 invariant case. So for cost-susity. Invariant case, so for cositive. First case, T2 times S1 invariant to susative, once again, outside of the singular set of a D3 action, which at this point we cannot compare with Si because we don't know how to do that. And it's not sure that you can actually compare them probably. So sigma is cross-servative if and only if it's the integral curve of this gradient of mu1 and by a proposition of Martin and one, and which is. Martin and one, and which is essentially our same proposition, is that we have three constants of our ODE system, and now seven minus three is four. So we can actually characterize all of them as the lateral sets of this function here. And what we get is that when we pass to the T2 times ST2 quotient, you have a local parameterization of your quotient with associatives and co-associatives, in the sense that. Cross-societes in the sense that μ and ν are a parameterization of your surface, and the fibers are either associatives or cross-societes, which I think is quite nice. So I won't comment too much on this, but we also managed to show that all the T-free invariant associatives can only develop singularities modeled on the Abelosen cone times r. And these happens only in the points where the cellular. happens only in the points where the stabilizer is two-dimensional. This is differently, the reason of this picture is that differently from the previous case where we could do it just by geometry, we really had to use geometric measure theory in this case, which is, I guess, something. Okay. Same thing for SC2 environment custodians. We would like to see them. Would like to see them. So, in that case, were there examples of development symbolic? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if you look at C3 trans one, it is already clearly one. Yeah. Okay, so we would like to say the same things as before, but in this case, the condition that phi vanishes on v1 v to be phi is not necessarily true, and in general is not true. So we restrict ourselves to v. So we restrict ourselves to this case and we push forward, and what we get is essentially the same things that we got for T2 invariant associative. But what I would like to comment on is that in this case, splitting with a certification is not really a big condition because, well, we said that S4, S3, and S1 have half-dimension 3, 1, or 3, 1, or 5, and they're 5 very bio associates to manifolds, so we cannot have a co-sociative in it as well. So essentially, we're saying that all the interesting things is going on in the principal part. Now, in this case, we can't really find functions because if you plug it in, so the natural things that are preserved by these By these system of ODEs, it's not closed. So we cannot recover functions, but we recover one forms, omega i's. And so sigma is astitzo invariant and cross-sociative if and only if these three forms here, these three one forms here are identically branching. What I would like to say is that, well, all the SC2 environments. Well, all the SC2 environment associated with smooth. And if you try to plug in these one forms in the Kai Janis and Lotte setup, you know, the one on caustosity vibrations, you really get the same ideas. So I guess it's nice. And then iron can just suck the meter. Yeah. Yeah. GM topology is just SU2 times S just. No, no, because in this case you can really meet the integral, you know, the singular set of the SC2 action. And I mean, essentially, you're K. I mean, these I'm actually not talking about T2 times SC2 environment for substitutes, I'm only talking about SC2 where C2K is. So, this works for SC2 environment processes. Not with bit here. This bit usually uses the T2 symmetry, but the RAS works for any SC2 invariant associated. Okay. So, how much time? Because in the other case, we had one to divide something. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, essentially, what I'm claiming is that if I have the non-symmetry, If I have the non-symmetry, I can classify the tangent cone at each point. And so I know whether or not it can develop singularities. Because if I know what is the tangent cone, if it is a plane with multiplicity one, then I know by a large up to some argument that you can pass to the limit and so on and so forth. So you're really using some slightly heavy geometry. Yeah, yeah, I'm using a large. Yeah, yeah, I'm using a light. That's I mean, if it's it's not that tough, allied. I mean, yeah, allied is tough, but using allied is not tough. Okay. Oh, any other questions? Sorry. How much time do you have left? 20 minutes? Yes, a bit more. Then you can really stop me more times. Stop me more time. Can you actually draw a picture of an example that draw the coordinates in the police and the level sets? Yeah, I'll do it best for the Brian and Salomon case. So yeah, now I'm okay. Well, I can go on, finish the presentation, and have more time for questions. And then I'll ask you for the pictures of this one thus. Of this one? That's the same. It's the same, exactly. Okay, so the first of all asking Nordshrum manifolds, so they're constructed using a homogeneity one construction. So they picked SC2 times SC2 and K0 as a stabilizer of a principal orbit, and K is the only singular orbit of a acid. Of a acetated acid reaction. So, as these are done much better than I will, I have essentially some copies of my ST2 times ST2, which I will do as sqls that are enlarging essentially and collapsing to S2. To S2 of this S2 over K0, and here we have SC2 times SC2 over K. So this is the group diagram that I have, but what are the possibilities of K0 and K? So I have K0, which can be very trivial, or that subgroup, that discrete subgroup of SU two times SU two. Of SC2 times SC2, but I'm not defining. And for the singular orbit, I have SC2 times SC2 over K, where K is either the identity times SC2 or diagonal SC2 or K of Kmm, which I want comment. It's a finite. Finite. No, Kmm now is U1. It's U1. It's not. K0 is finite. K0, so if. K0 is fine. K0, so if you intersect Kmn with K2 minus 2, if Mn are co-prime, then it's discrete. But if you have Kmn, then this one is not discrete. So you'll be one-dimensional SQL. So essentially embedding your SQL with some weights. So the theorem that Lorenzo will actually say hello to all of you. Mark and Gioanes proved was that on this manifold Fc2 times Fe2 over K0 times 0 infinity, there are families of torsion-free G2 structure which extends smoothly to a singular orbit and they are complete at infinity. Moreover, these are all the possible SC2 times SC2 times C1 invariant G2 manifolds. So this is a quite G2 manifolds. So, this is a quite nice result. And I guess I could say that this was the real motivation behind our approach. So, what we've done was picked a T2 in this subgroup and we tried to compute the ODE explicitly as Kaijanis and Lotte did and I did in the Brian and Solomon case. And I couldn't be bothered to go on computing stuff. To go on computing stuff. So I was trying to look for first integrals, and we managed to see that μ was the first integral. And we tried to push in another direction. So these are, so let's say families, these are how many parameters is this one? I think it's one parameter family for each choice that you can do, I think. So I mentioned that these are SC2 times SC2 times C1. Has SC2 times SC2 times C1 symmetry, but in particular, you also have T2 times SC2 symmetry. And this is the action that I have. So I pick lambda 1, lambda 2 as elements of T2 and ST2 as ST1. And I'm acting on the so PQT is an element of ST2 times ST2 up to a quotient and the time. And what I'm doing is essentially I'm mimicking the quotient. Is essentially mimicking the brilliant Salamon action. Any question? So here you would turn it into some usual example that you can do. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. I'm essentially working here with SP1. And okay, what we can do is to stratify our space in the following way. So if we look at At this part here, so I'm excluding the singular set. In this part here, I have MP and two copies of S1. So let's say S1 plus S1 minus. And in the singular part of the F two times F two action, so in this point here, I Point here, I have either an SP2 or S2 times S3. That is not great. Red is not good. Well, I mean, I've written MP So plus. Square plus minus here I have S to two S2 minus plus and in this case S2 is either S2 or S3 in S4 and in this case here I have an S one and S two. So this is why I can't say anything about the topology of infess1. Of in this one case, because I will have compact stuff. Indeed, what we got is that of the fossil-Hafsky notion manifolds, the principal part is fibered by completely two invariant associities that are topologically equitant side, as I mentioned before. We have in the principle, so here I'm working in this lab here. Slap here, I have a submersion into two copies of S2, so I'm distinguishing the connected components, and these extend to completely to invariant associative of topologies one times zero two. So in the picture that I've drawn before, I have S1 here collapsing to, let's say, S2. So you have a single here, which is collapsing to just one point. Collapse into just one point, and so that's why I get S1 times R2. So remind me, what's the state? I've got a bit lost in this one. So S1 is five inch, S2 is three inch. What's this? It's the statewide, and the S1 case is T2. So you have in a five-dimensional manifold, which if you take the closure of it, you will meet S2. So you have a curve of two. Right? So you have a curve of T two invariant associ of of T twos, right, which will converge to S two and in this convergence you have one sequel which shrinks to a point and so you get S1 times R times S1. But the stabilizer is in S1. Stabilizer is in S1. Yeah. And the level sets of the other ones, the D2 times R, are like paraboloids like that. Parable lights like that? Yes, yes, precisely. You are one light ahead. Yes, they will look like peaks. So for instance, in the Brian and Solomon picture, you have S2 which is a sphere, and you have these two copies of S1 that are going to be fibered by this T2 S1 times R2, T2 invariant associatives, and you have T2 in parent associatives, and you have all this one parameter. So these are, I've already mentioned that SC2 times SC2 in there. If K is isomorphic, well, diffomorphic to SC2, I get a topological S3. And if I'm in the tough case, so when K is equal to Kmn, I get less spaces, which I guess is quite sobriety. I don't know. So it's the restriction maybe close. I don't know. So it's the limitation co-line. Sorry? This is the lens space. This is the lens space of three parameters n, n, and minus n. And this is the picture. You have a semicolon there. You have a colon. Yes, so it's usually given by two parameters, the namespace on SQL. But it was easier for us to consider it as an IP. Easier for us to consider it as an I-dimensional space where you're given a first parameter n, which is the one you're dividing for. And we can do the same for cross-susatius to manifolds. So we have an explicit formula for theta one, theta two and no. So we can find the singular set and everything about about this post positive. About this cost-sositive, and we deduce that. There is a four-dimensional family of cost-susitives to manifolds, which are topologically T3 times psi. We have a three one-parameter family of cositivity. Yeah, it's three, I'm not sure. Yeah, exactly. Yes, yes. No, but yes. They could intersect each other. Intersect each other. Yeah, but they don't. No, no, they don't. Because they're staying in the principal part. Yes, exactly. And I have one parameter family of costositives that have topology T2 than sine two, and they're the ones that intersect the one-dimensional stabilizer of the T3 action and a zero-dimensional family of singular possessive that can happen. And for the SI2 invariant costitive case, when they exist, and this is important. Case when they exist, and this is important because the a priori they usually don't exist, they have this form here. So they are essentially the one given by a fiber of a point, you can buy an exaltment case. So what you're saying is I think that you just multiply so yeah, I'm just multiplying by one of these SC2. I take one SU one point here fixed, so these are. Point here fixed, so this is the base space if you wish, and then multiplying by the other one, so I get a family of S3s that match into a point. So it's like the fibers over one point you require an excellent. And well, note that they won't exist when they have K and M. They won't exist in the channel. Yeah, right. They're smooth. And this is the picture that Unzana was waiting for. Unzala was waiting for Amizi, thank you for your attention.
