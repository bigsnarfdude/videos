Joint work is required. There will be some work both with other people and of other people mentioned occasionally. It's not very new, it's maybe about five years old. When I was asked to give a talk, I gave the organisers a choice of something that was new and inaccessible versus something that was old and relatively accessible, and probably sensibly equivalent to the old thing. But there have been some updates, and there's quite a few open problems. I didn't add them to the open problem list, but I might maybe will. Into the open problem list, and I might maybe will act at all if people are interested. So I was motivated, I'm going to give an ahistorical motivation, I was motivated a bit by some of the things we saw in Sven's talk about uniqueness of Cartanison algebras in von Neumann algebras. And that's what this will be about. It will be about uniqueness of Cartanison algebras. Now, there's a couple of problems with generalizing those von Neumann techniques to the C-star algebra world. To the C-star out of the world. The first one is that we don't know how to do it. They don't obviously generalize. And the second problem is that even if we could generalize it, the generalization is known to be false, which is a more serious problem, perhaps. And we know that, thanks to work of Jordano Puckman-Scow from the 90s on Canton minimal systems, we know that Cartans aren't unique, and then there's work of Jin Li and John Renaud much more incidentally. So that's problematic. And for that reason, I'll start with a very naive. With a very naive motivation coming from matrices, which goes back to what David said almost in the very first sentence of the conference: that Cantanza algebra is coming from matrices. So, this wasn't example zero from Sven's talk, which should have been. It's so classical that it's too trivial for modern modern algebraists. So, it says this: for any set x, if you take L infinity of x, so that's the bounded. L infinity of x, so that's for bounded functions on x, and it's acting via multiplication on some fixed with respect to some fixed or v canonical fixed orthonormal basis of L2 of x. So we think of operators on L2 of x as infinite by infinite matrices, and then L infinity of x consists of things that look like that. So it's diagonal matrices with respect to the So, it's diagonal matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis. Then, that is the unique Cartens of algebra in the sense of von Leuman algebra theory in the bounded operators on auto of x subterinal automorphism. I have no idea who to attribute this to, probably Hilbert. I mean, it's that old and classical. I mean, the only tricky thing in proving this is you have to show that if you have a maximal abelian subalgebra in B of L two, and it's the image of a faithful conditional expectation. A faithful conditional expectation, then it is L infinity with respect to some orphanormal basis. Okay, and then at that point, any two orphanormal bases are the same up to unitary isomorphism, what gives you the results. So this is very, very, very classical stuff. So we can't generalize the nice things in the type 2.1 setting from Sense Talk, but maybe we can generalize this type 1-ish thing, which again is all. The moral The moral, which again has come up a few times during the meeting, is that matrices have a unique Cartens of algebra. Again, in the sense that on Leuman algebra theory, in particular, this contains the set, the case, sorry, that X is a finite set, in which case this is just saying that the diagonal matrices are the Cartan subalgebra in the matrix algebras. And so, okay, problem. Let's say you have a C star subalgebra of the pounds of operators of X on set X. Operators L to X on set X. It contains the diagonal matrix with diagonal matrices with respect to the autonomous bases as a Cartans of algebra. Is it the unique C star diagonal up to maybe up to automorphism, maybe up to winner automorphisms? Again, that's a distinction that we have to make in this setting, as we saw in Sven's talk. So this thing, by the way, it's not a light. This thing, by the way, is not a C-star algebra, Cartanzaba, Rhymbia, L2, LX. Cartans of algebra in the atlanti of x, it's a von Neumann. Cartans of algebra, the normalizers generated as a von Neumann algebra, not as a C-star algebra. So initial observations, normalizers are matrices with at most one non-zero entry in each row and column with respect to the standard matrix representations, just algebra. Caddison Singer in 1959 proved that, in fact, if you take the diagonal matrices and there are a Cartan algebra and a C-star algebra. There are a Carthanson algebra and a Cister algebra, so of course they knew all that language, then it's actually automatically a diagonal. So that's not the Cadison-Singer conjecture, that is a theorem of Cadison-Singer from the paper where they introduce the conjecture. It's much, much easier. And it is automatically diagonal. That means the turpular states send uniquely. You might notice I phrased this in a weird way. If you contain L infinity as a cartan, is it the unique diagonal? So A, it is a diagonal. So A, it is a diagonal, so it makes sense to ask this question. And B, it's not the unique Cartan-sub algebra, even if you take kind of the most trivial, non-trivial example. You just take the diagonal things plus the compact operators. So you're basically just taking diagonal matrices plus things that are finitely supported, even in that very simple C-star algebra. It's not the unique Cartanson algebra in there, it is a unique diagonal. Okay. Now, although that motivation is very historical, it's also ahistorical because it's not what motivated Stuart and I to do this. Actually, it kind of is. It kind of is what motivated Stuart to think about this a little bit, but not me. I was motivated by the following thing. Any questions about the matrices? Anyone happy with matrices? Okay, so here's my actual motivations the other way of thinking about. Motivation, it's the other way of thinking about these things. And this will tie it to course geometry and also to group theory to some extent. So take a uniformly locally finite metric space, also called bounded geometry metric space in some context. So that means that it's discrete. And for any R there is a uniform bound on the cardinality of all R balls. The most important example for connections to other parts of mathematics, at least from my point of view, is if you take a finitely generated group of word mathematics. A finitely generated group with a word metric, that will definitely be one of these ULF metric spaces. And then we will take the star algebra of all complex x by x matrices, so infinite by infinite matrices, uniformly bounded entries, and the propagation, that's the largest distance, so that you get a non-zero matrix entry is finite. So in this picture, I've drawn this, in every other talk I've ever given. In every other talk I've ever given, that means that you are morally, not literally, but morally supportive in some strip like that around the eye. So that's a star algebra of matrices. Because of the ULF condition, any such matrix acts as a bounded operator on L2 of X, and the uniform row algebra is, by definition, the C star algebra completion of that star algebra finite propagation for its natural representation. Propagation for its natural representation on L2 of x by matrix multiplication. And again, in the key example where x is a finitely generated group of word metric, you can do this more generally, but in particular in that example, then uniform row algebra is the cross product of L infinity of gamma by the canonical translation action of gamma. So in that case, it's something that's again named us. And then second problem, which is secretly the same as the first. Which is secretly the same as the first problem, is this thing? So this sits inside as diagonal matrices as operators with propagation zero. Is it the unique diagonal C star subalgebra of a uniform row algebra? Up to maybe up to automorphism, maybe up to inner automorphism. Those may even be the same question, I don't know, but we can prove them under different hypotheses. Okay, so that's problem number two, that's motivation number two. Number two. And that's saying. So, first proposition is that, say, you have an abstract C-star sub-algebra of the lambda operator L2 of X. It contains the diagonal operators as a Cartan subalgebra. For non-degeneracy reasons and to avoid annoying technicalities, I will assume that it contains the compact operators. And I will also assume a kind of separability relative to the diagonal. So that diagonal is. Relative to the diagonal. So that diagonal is not separable, but for simplicity, I'm going to assume we're kind of separable relative to that diagonal. So say we're generated by a countable set of normalizers and the diagonal. Then there is one of these uniformly locally finite metric spaces, or more precisely, there is a uniformly locally finite metric on X. It's unique up to course equivalence. I'll explain that in a moment. And indeed, your C star algebra then is the uniform row algebra or such a space. Course equivalence means if there are two Course equivalence means if there are two metrics, then if you've got sequences in the space and the distances tend to zero, tend to infinity in one of the metrics, then the distance also tends to infinity in the other metric, those sequences. So being a long way apart is the same, whichever metric you look at. Okay. The assumptions are not really necessary, but then I would have to talk about large-scale geometry and the non-metrizable setting. Geometry in the non-matrizable setting, and I don't want to, and you don't want me to either, I think, in most cases. So we'll ignore that. Plus, we can't put any theorems, not many theorems in that setting. That's really open. Nonetheless, the original problem in the matrix setting, which does make sense in that level of generality, that is open in that level of generality. And it has to be false, but if someone sees an easy counterexample, I would love to see it. I don't know why I say it has to be false. I don't know why I say it has to be false. It's not based on anything other than prejudice. Sorry, I seems too general. Okay, so from now on, without further ado, I won't repeat this assumption over and over again, that X is going to be your latent metric space. So the original problem about matrices, we've now changed it into a problem about these more concrete uniform real algebras that are rather large. One question about the unique sequence, like, I mean, it's a proposition if you require unique algebra sequence, giving. Oh no, no, no. If you have the Cartan inclusion. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's unique. I mean, it's a unique metric on X, where I have identified X with the normal positive linear function. Sorry, normal linear functional infinity of X. I mean, yeah, I really taking that into account very much. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, anything else remotes? All right. Okay, so I'm just going to quickly say what the group wid is. This is not strictly necessary for the talk, but it maybe motivates some of the results later. So we've got a Cartan inclusion, actually it's a diagonal inclusion. What is it? So let beta x be the Stone-Check compatification of X, or in other words, be space and multiplicative linear functionals. Space of multiplicative linear functionals on L infinity of X of Galf and Joule. Then the metric on our ULF metric space extends by continuity by the universal property of the Stone-Check compactification to a zero-infinity valued metric. Now you'll notice that that one is half open and that one isn't. We need a compact image to extend things to the SponeCheck compactification. So this is infinite valued and it's mainly infinite valued. Infinite valued, and it's mainly infinite-valued on the nastiness at infinity in Stonechack. And what your coarse groupoid is, is it's all the things in beta x cross beta x which are at finite distance from each other. So that's an equivalence relation by the triangle inequality. It tells you it's transitive. And you look at all those things which are at finite distance from each other, because it's Because it's an equivalence relation, the pair groupoid operation on beta x cross beta x restricts to that thing, and that gives you the so-called coarse groupoid. Slight subtlety, you do not give it the subspace topology, that's a garbage topology, give it the inductive limit topology, which is why I've written it as a union like this, and not just a set of things which are finite distance from each other. And okay, if x is gamma, then this thing is the transformation. Gamma, then this thing is the transformation group for the canonical translation action of the group on its stone-check compactification. So, proposition by Skandalis, Tu and Yu, they're the ones who introduced this thing. It is a always lowly compact Hausdorff-Tau principle, sigma-compact and ample, and there is a canonical isomorphism between this groupoid and the inclusion of its base space, and uniform raw algebra, and the inclusion of its canonical. And the inclusion that it's canonical cut in. So it's the only nice property it doesn't have is it's not second countable, which it can't because the diagonal is too big, but okay. That's all right. I mean, we know from a few results that have been mentioned, like I think Ali Rad's result, that the Cartan reconstruction theorem works in the non-second countable case. We shouldn't be, if we're dealing with a tau group always, we shouldn't be scared of non-second countability. That's okay. If we're dealing with more general groups, we should be terrified, and all second cards are realizing we should think about that. But yeah, but for any attacks, it's insane. Okay, so back to the question. Is it the unique diagonal up to an automobile zones? So there are some necessary conditions which may be automatic if you increase the number of assumptions. For two obvious necessary conditions, you take an arbitrary Cartens. You take an arbitrary Cartan subalgebra. First of all, it's got to be isomorphic to L infinity of the natural numbers as an abstract C-star algebra. There's no way it can be isomorphic to L infinity of X if that's not true. And the second thing is that you've got to have this separability relative to diagonal condition. So uniform algebra has got to be generated by the Cartan and countably many normalizers. Countably many normalizers, because that's true for the canonical one, it can't fail otherwise. So these conditions might be automatic as far as we know. Well, okay, condition one can't be automatic, it's false in general. You can make exotic cartons, as I said, even in the most trivial example where the Cister algebra is diagonals plus compacts, you do not get a unique Cartana. It does not have to be isomorphic to one. Does not have to be isomorphic to L infinity of the natural numbers. It has to be pretty close, but so it can't be the whole thing. Examples where it's not the whole thing. If you assume that your Cartan is a von Neumann algebra, which is a reasonable thing to do in this context, and it is automatic, it can't be anything other than L infinity of n, and I would conjecture that if it's diagonal, then this condition is automatic. There are no diagonals on that other than ones which look like Other than ones which look like L-infinity of the natural numbers. And moreover, if you are isomorphic to that, you're a real copy of L-infinity with respect to some of the normal basis. The second condition is automatic if one holds, and also if you assume that the uniform row algebra is nuclear. Again, I would conjecture that that happens in general without the nuclearity assumption. But we don't know that at the moment. That's quite a hard theorem of Quite a hard theorem of Raga, Farah, and Vignati, that it's automatic in that situation. Okay, so we'll call the Cartan subalgebra good if it satisfies those conditions, those are the obvious necessary conditions. So first thing, this is an observation. If going back to Elizabeth's question in the last talk, if I don't attribute something, it's due to Stuart and me, but also it means I don't think it's worth attributing, it's just not so. Think it's worth attributing, it's just an observation, it's fine. This is not very hard, so I mean, if you thought it out these things enough, it's not that hard. Um, so the following equivalents, there is a unique good Cartan in here up to automorphism. Second thing, whenever you have an abstract isomorphism of two of these uniform row algebras, y and x, both ULF metric spaces, then there is a bijective coarse equivalence. So one of these maps preserves. Equivalence, so one of these maps preserving the large-scale geometry between y and x, but it's also bijective. Course equivalence is going to have to be bijective. In general, they can screw things up up to find that error. So that's a fairly easy observation. And for the sake of completing Becky's bingo card from yesterday, many hands completed the proof of this theorem. So the second condition is known to hold now in quite a wide variety of situations. Firstly, if the uniform rgebra is nuclear, if known if the group point is amenable, then that's equivalent to the space having U's property A, whatever that is, some large-scale geometric thing. That is a theorem of fewer white and myself. X is non-amenable. Okay, so for that, you need firstly that isomorphism of these things implies coarse equivalence, not necessarily bijective. Not necessarily bijective. That's due to Bragger, Farrar, Cook Row, Bodier, Exarch, Vignate, and myself. And then you use a theorem of Kevin White from geometric group theory coarse geometry. But if you have a coarse equivalence between non-immutable spaces, then it's automatically close to a bijective coarse equivalence. You automatically get a bijective one for free. So that combines both. So that combines those things. Effects as a group, you've got a dichotomy. You're either in the first case or the second case, so you're fine. You just apply those previous two cases. The last one is a weird one I just mentioned. Expanded graphs are the worst possible spaces generally considered because of the matrices that came up in Diego's talk, which I won't say anything more about, but he was right. And that's predictable. So they're generally considered the worst possible counterexamples in these cases. In these cases, but Raga Farrar, Bodie, I can get the order wrong, Bodie, Raga-Farrar, Emiarte, and myself prove that even for expandographs, things behave themselves, so okay, at that point, one has to conjecture that it's just true in general. We can't prove it yet, but hopefully, someone will prove that eventually. I hope. Let me just briefly say what this says for groups. So, theorem, I didn't attribute this, but I will say who this is due to. I didn't attribute this, but I will say who this is due to. I don't really know. Yeah, anyway. So let's, you've got two finitely generated groups, smaller equivalents. Firstly, they're bijectively quasi-isometric. Secondly, the transformation groupoids that map to your stem-check and pantifications are isomorphic, these groupoids, topological groupoids. Thirdly, you have diagonal preserving isomorphisms of the corresponding cross-products. The equivalents of those bits, a bit of folklore. Bits of it of folklore, it appears explicitly in a paper of Jinli, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, this is due to various people in different ways at different times, in different communities as well. The new bit is that diagonal-preserving isomorphism is the same as abstract isomorphism. So, related to Sven's question from earlier. In this case, you do not need to remember whether diagonal is the same. It's automatic. It's the same. It's automatic. You recover it automatically. Okay. So, last slide, one stay out of time. Is uniqueness up to inner automorphism, so that's a stronger condition. So this one. If you are in the nuclear case, so groupwood is amenable for space as property A, then there's a unique good Cartan sub-algebra. Again, the goodness assumption might be, you might be able to junk that if you replace Cartan with that. Junk that if you replace Cartan with diagonal, I would conjecture you can, up to inner automorphism. This is much more substantial than the previous proposition, and it requires a lot of ingredients due to other people, which I'll go through very fast. So ideas in the proof, just because I want to credit various people. Firstly, Hiroki Sako, this is quite a difficult theorem proof, that nuclearity of this thing is equivalent to the so-called operator norm localization property, whatever that means. You can estimate operator norms locally. Locally, and that was introduced by these people. Then you need to know that if you have an isomorphism of uniform raw algebras, you get a coarse equivalence. If it's nuclear, that's a fairly old theorem of Jan Scheckler and myself. And then I mentioned already this group, Bodhio, Bragger, Farrar, Cookro, Vignotte, and Vinotti and myself. And then there's a more general and, I think, in some ways better proof of Diego and Federica. Of Diego and Federico Bigelow more recently, which is an isomorphism of these things, gives rise to, of course, equivalence of the underlying spaces. Then you use ONL in a fairly messy way in Hall's marriage theorem, which I felt quite happy about because I got to do some combinatorics, which is usually way beyond my meager intelligence levels. So that's that I felt like a real mathematician. To replace this with a bijective course equivalence. So you estimate the norms of some projections, that lets you compare the ranks, and then you get a bijective course equivalence using force marriage problem. And then finally, you use ONL again. You show that the canonical, you're not really implementing the bijective course equivalence, there is one, is something called quasi-local. I don't want to define that. Even if I wasn't out of time, I wouldn't want to define it. Out of time, I wouldn't want to define it. Finally, you refer to very much factual Zhang and then subsequently simplified by Takarozawa. But if you're in the nuclear case, then any quasi-local operator is in here, so that unitary is in there, you get the automorphism, and you win. There's a lot that goes into that, and quite a few different groups of people. Okay, and the last thing I want to mention is that it doesn't work in the non-nuclear. Doesn't work in the non-nuclear case. First, the ONL bit doesn't work, and second, the quasi-locality bit doesn't work. Those not only do the proofs not work, they are both known to be obstructed outside the case. Oh well. But nonetheless, the question, the theorem is open, and it could well be that it's still true, but you would really need new ideas to do it. At the moment, that's where we are stuck, I guess. Okay, thanks.
