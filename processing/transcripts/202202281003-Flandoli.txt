Participate form with a noise of a very specific type, which, in my opinion, is natural. But this is, if you want, it's part of the story. But the talk is short, so I don't want to speak too much about the origin of this noise into the equation. And the mathematical question is whether this noise in a suitable scaling limit or in some Scaling limit, or in some approximation, give rise to an additional elliptic operator of this form, where Q is the noise covariance. There are formal works in the literature on this topic, but the rigorous analysis for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes with its specific difficulties in proving a priorist estimates, etc., looks to me very. Looks to me very difficult. Very difficult topic. Let me mention that it's not the same, it's in a slightly different direction of instabilities, linearized equation, etc. But there are several works that point in a similar direction. But I think that the analysis, if you take If you take a sort of average equation, deterministic average equation, one can understand something. The problem, as I will show, is the link between the stochastic and the average equation, which is very difficult. Anyway, this is a topic that attracted attention, maybe on slightly different models, that I certainly acknowledge and a very interesting direction of research. So let me repeat again: this is Me repeat again. This is the starting equation I want to treat: a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with a noise, which mimics the two terms, the transport term and the stretching term, and the noise appears in both, the same noise which appears in both. The motivation for this equation is another story I address maybe to this paper with my student Umberto, Papaleta. My student Umberto Papaletta. He is working with Arnold de Busch to extend the results. And also, there are motivations for this equation from other people, other groups like Derry Holm and collaborators. So complete motivation is not very clear yet, but it seems that it's a model that captures something of the link between small scales and large scales. So the imagination that I have imagined. The imagination that I have in mind is that the noise, time derivative of W, are small scales, and what is denoted by U and omega are large scales. But of course, to be precise on this is a topic in itself. So the problem is establish a link between these two mathematical models. I want to treat this technical question between these two. Between these two mathematical models, in which the part of the Navier-Stokes part remains the same and the noise moves into an elliptic operator. Maybe let me jump, this was related to the difficulty in experiments to have properties like this. Which is the point, as Gregory mentioned just a minute ago, the first step of the story is to move from Stratonovich to Ito. Stratonovich to Ito. Undoubtedly, the noise at the beginning was Stratonovich. There is no question about that. When we move from Stratonovich to Ito, there is a corrector which erases. Sorry, when I put in bold the curl L became another L, but this L is the same as the corrector. And the question is, what is this corrector? Okay. A very simple, I mean, it's a two-page. Very simple, I mean, it's two pages of computation, but it's a simple result: is that this corrector is an elliptic operator in divergence form under relatively natural assumptions, which are space homogeneity and mirror symmetry. Not isotropy. I mean, isotropy is more than homogeneous, but it's not needed. So, we don't need isotropy for this result. For this result, and this is very important for the other parts of my talk. Under isotropy, you have more, you have this covariance matrix is an identity. But otherwise, it's interesting also, it's very more important, I think, to investigate non-isotropic situations. Be above the statement of the theorem I wrote, one possible way to handle this noise, which is to decompose. Which is to decompose in Fourier, so to speak, with independent scalabranian motions and the covatians is what all of us know. So under this assumption of homogeneity and mirror symmetry that I always do, the stochastic equation contains already the elliptic operator I want to find at the end. So the question is not the formal question of Not the formal question of taking an average and cancel into eto integrals. The question is when these eto integrals are small, and this mathematical question is extremely difficult. So when is true that these eto integrals are negligible? And so we can say that the original stochastic equation is close to the equation mean field type, so to speak, with only the elliptic part. With only the elliptic part. So before I never put a scaling parameter, sometimes it will appear, something else I will drop for notational simplicity. If we have a scaling parameter in the noise, so we wn is the noise now with the covariance qn, we need to find a sequence of noise processes with two properties. One property is Two properties. One property is that the covariance is not negligible in the limit, so the elliptic operator remains, but the eto parts is negligible. And they are apparently in contrast. It's not trivial to do this. This is extremely difficult. I have only very few fragments of ideas how to handle this topic. For me, this is essentially open. Which is the difficulty? The difficulty. Which is the difficulty? The difficulty is to have a priori estimates on the vorticities omega n depending on the parameter n, because they are subject to the deterministic part of the dynamic, which contains, for instance, the term omega, the stretching term, the deterministic stretching term, which already deteriorates the estimates, as we know very well from the deterministic theory of Navier-Stokes. Deterministic theory of Mavier Stokes. But this deterioration is unif somehow uniform in the parameter n. So I would satisfy, for instance, to be able to handle a model in which I modify a little bit that nonlinearity to see what happens. So the problem, the problem, that is an enormous problem in the theory of 3D Navy stokes, but let's keep independent of our specific interest because the specific interest. Because the specific inter is to send n to infinity. There is also a stretching term which contains the noise. And when we want a noise which produces a dissipation, this noise must act at high scale, high wave numbers, small scales, high wave numbers, and the stretching due to this noise is enormous, is enormous, especially if it is isotropic. Especially if it is isotropic, isotropic, very dangerous. In principle, it produces an exponential explosion of every estimate. So the estimates on the solution omega n are spoiled in an exponential way by this isotropic noise. And when we lose the rigorous estimates on omega n, the rigorous analysis of the etoterm is eto term. Of the eto terms is completely spoiled. We have to show that the eto term goes to zero. The eto term contains the noise, but also the solution omega n. The noise is made suitable to go to zero in a weak sense. The omega n diverge exponentially, and the etoterm are not infinitesimal. So, this is a very complicated factor that is related to dynamo theory. There are different aspects in dynamo theory. There is the Aspects in dynamo theory. There is the alpha effect, namely effects related to mean field, but there are also effects related to fluctuations, which are equally important and very difficult to control. So we are here that the stretching term is due to the noise is very dangerous, and I want to find conditions under which it can be controlled. A very simple condition. A very simple condition is the orthogonality between omega n, the vorticity, and the noise. Let us discuss this orthogonality. Of course, I'm looking for an approximate orthogonality, but let us discuss this orthogonality. The point is that I'm not talking about the orthogonality between the large scale vorticity omega. Vorticity omega and the large scale velocity u. This is false. This is false. There are clearly beltramizations or approximate beltramizations when you see more fluid, turtle and fluids. So this is false. What I don't know if it is also false or there is a hope is some kind of orthogonality between the larger scales of vorticity. Scales of vorticity and the small scales of velocity, of velocity. And this is the key of the fragment I'm going to show. Whether this two-dimensionalization of the small turbulent scales is true or not, I cannot state. I can only mention two directions where there could be results, numerical results. Results, numerical results or theoretical results in the theory. One, unfortunately, is not really directly on the three-dimensional magistokes, but on magneto-hydrodynamics. So the effect of a strong magnetic field on the turbulent velocity field in the background. And there is here, I mentioned one theoretical paper which proves. Paper which proves two-dimensionalization of the velocity field, and one numerical paper where we see that the filaments of vorticity of the turbulent fluids tend to have a direct preference direction. They are so-called like directed polymers, and the velocity field of these filaments. Of these filaments is clearly roughly speaking in the orthogonal plane. These are two examples. I'm sorry, on my screen, I don't see the first line of my slide, but I hope you can see them. In the first line of my slide that I don't see anymore, there was mention a paper of Baben Mahalov and collaborators. Makhalov and collaborators on the two-dimensionalization in three-dimensional fluids. Now it's not magneto-hydrodynamic, it's really three-dimensional fluid, when there is a very strong vorticity at time zero. So if the initial condition is an enormous rotating vortex, then the fluid at least for a while performs a very strong forms a very strong two-dimensionalization. So and the numerical paper of which I took just one slide measures in turbulence with numerical simulation quite precise on something like 10,000 to the cube degrees of freedom that there is again some kind of two-dimensionalization namely that Analyzation, namely the eigen direction of the intermediate eigenvalue is almost parallel to the vortex tube and the two direction of compression and expansion of the fluid are almost orthogonal in certain simulations. In the case when the vorticity becomes extremely large, so when the vorticity has Large. So, when the vorticity has exceeded resolution, like 10 times the average vorticity, there is some degree of two-dimensionalization of the turbo and the ground around. So, I treat here an oversimplified model, just to have a first instance of what could happen. So, I take the model that I described above, but the noise horizontal. Horizontal, strictly two-dimensional horizontal. And having in mind a vorticity which is almost vertical, I decide to oversimplify and eliminate the random stretching term, the term that the effect of which is extremely hard. Of course, the second step that I'm not able to perform today is to understand what happens when this term exists but is only almost orthogonal. Almost orthogonal. And the third very strong simplification is that I put this geometric constraint globally on the fluid, while of course they would be, if they are true to some approximation, they are true very locally around the vortex filaments, the largest scale vortex filaments. And so here there is a remark which showed that even with this simplification, Even with this simplification, the rigorous analysis requires care. Because if I write here the Stokes equation just with the Ito term of transport type without the Hito term of stretching type, this equation apparently is much easier, but is meaningless. It's meaningless because all terms are divergence-free except Except the transport term. And so there are no solutions. If u is a solution, we find the contradiction on zero equals one, so to speak. And so this equation does not have solutions. So I cannot neglect the stretching term just for simplicity, so to speak. So I have to do something more complicated. What I can do today is the following: namely, to The following: namely, to correct with a projection. So, I need to eliminate the stretching term because it's too difficult, and the motivation to eliminate is this two-dimensionalization, which requires certainly much more work to be understood. Mathematically, I need a projection in front of the transport term in order to maintain compatibility of the equation. With this projection, the equation. With this projection, the equation has solutions. The problem now is the following one. Now that I have understood the structure, which is projecting the transport, projecting the transport, I have to go back to the stratonovich with the projection and repeat the procedure from stratonovich to it. In doing that, To it. In doing that, of course, the ito is the ito with the projection. The problem is that the corrector, the corrector, is no more a second-order elliptic operator. The corrector now contains the projection, so is a non-local operator. The degree of the symbol of this operator is is like a second order differential operator. Second-order differential operator, but it is non-local due to the projection, which appears in two positions, as you see in this equation. This slide summarizes the expected result of this work, which, however, is in progress. Why I describe the work in progress, because there were three workshops at a distance of two weeks one from the other. Of one from the other. So I had to speak in a workshop on mixing, and then after three weeks in the workshop at Newton Institute, and now I cannot have independent results for that time, so I decided to present something which is in progress and could be wrong because the topics are extremely difficult and I could have done some mistake. But I hope that there is something correct. So the expected result is the following one: that there is That there is, I take the three-dimensional IV stokes with the projected transport term. I assume that W is strictly horizontal. You will see in the next slide that W is an isotropic noise, but isotropic in two dimensions. So it is homogeneous from the viewpoint of three dimensions and mirrors. And what I believe that I can complete the proof is that the solution of that equation is close to the solution of a Navier-Stokes equation with an augmented viscosity, but horizontal viscosity. So there is a turbulent coefficient, a turbulent, ah, thank you, 20 minutes, the turbulent adequate The turbulent viscosity coefficient, and the Laplacian is an horizontal Laplacian like it is natural from the because the small scales, small turbulent scales which act on the fluid act horizontally with respect to the mean starch. And the top comparing with other papers that we and my collaborator brought recently, I expect that the convergence I expect that the convergence of the result is a convergence in this topology, continuous in time, and slightly negative Sobolev topology in space for the vorticity, for the vorticity. Positive Soble space for the velocity, but slightly negative for the vorticity. All these mixing and dissipation enhancement results are good if we deteriorate a little bit the sovereign topology. So maybe one can do slightly better because. One can do slightly better because there is already viscosity in the problem which regularizes, but this is what I expect at the rigorous level. With this model, the facts that can be proved are the following. The estimates on the L2 norm of the vorticity now work because, okay, work. There is always the deterministic part. There is always the deterministic part with the deterministic stretching, which spoils to some extent this estimate. But this is one story. At the stochastic level, so what matters the dependence on n, on the scaling parameter n, there is only the transporter which is orthogonal and does not contribute to the anstrophy budget, so to speak. And this, with this, with this a priori estimate, A priori estimate on the astrophy, I can control the Ito integrals and I can find the noise such that the Ito integrals go to zero. The second order, I mean the second order, the corrector, which is an operator, is a linear operator, converges even if there are non-local parts. I can prove that converges to a local operator, to a viscosity time. To viscosity, time and horizontal Laplacian. And since I have one minute, let me just scroll that. The noise is a classical isotropic noise made by Fourier components, but two-dimensional and repeated. And with this noise, if there are no projections in the correctors, we know from many. We know from many previous works that we approximate a Laplacian. In this case, it is an horizontal Laplacian because the noise is horizontal. The noise in order to have that the Ito integrals goes away, go away and remains the Laplacian with the non-zero constant in front. I need the noise which works on high wave numbers with a certain intensity. With a certain intensity, and this is a computation that was performed in previous two-dimensional works recently. All the story is to understand this corrector, what happens to this corrector, and this I drop the description of this, which is too long. Sorry, that I scroll some technical slide on this. I just mentioned that I work on. I just mentioned that I work on this topic with some collaborators, and we have understood similar results in the two-dimensional case relatively well, with rigorous, complete results. Also for passive scalars, but here the difficulty is that the Navier-Stokes equation itself. And in three dimensions, we have a result. Result: this paper on PTRF with a different noise. The noise is isotropic, acting only on the transport, but the physics of that paper is not correct. That is a mathematical paper to understand that there exists a noise which could improve, delay the blow-up of Navier-Stokes, but is physically not correct. I think that the noise that I showed today is in the correct direction. Is in the correct direction, even if it's just very abstract and just a fragment, and maybe even unsure because I have to complete the write in the paper. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for a very thought-provoking talk. Any questions?
