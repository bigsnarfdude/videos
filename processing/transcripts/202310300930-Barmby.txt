The person you've been getting all those annoying emails from. Those are pretty much done at this point. Welcome and thank you for being here. I'm from Western University, which despite the name is located in eastern Canada on the traditional territories of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, the Onapewak, and Chanung Tong nations, and on lands connected with the London and Somber Treaties of 1796. I'm really glad to. 1796. I'm really glad to be here on Tree 7 territory. So, when we were coming up with this schedule for this conference, we said, well, somebody should talk about astronomy data to the statisticians so that they know what data sets are out there. And somehow I got elected to give that talk. So, I'm really glad to be kind of giving you a preview of some of the big data sets, particularly that are coming up in Australia. Particularly that are coming up in astronomy. So, astronomers, you're going to know some of what I tell you here. You may wish to have a brief nap. Statisticians, some of you will know this stuff as well, but particularly the earlier career folks might not know about some of this stuff. So what I want to do is kind of talk in very general terms about, well, what are we actually measuring in astronomy? And then what data What data sets are out there that measure certain aspects of the universe around us? Because remember, that's what we're after in the end. We're trying to understand the properties of the universe through the properties of the statistical distributions of objects in the universe. Stars, galaxies, planets, molecular clouds, whatever. And so, what are we actually measuring when we go out and look at the sky? Well, At the sky. Well, I'm going to totally skip gravitational waves here because other people are much better qualified to talk about that than me. I'm going to talk about electromagnetism. And more or less, what we're measuring is brightness as a function of location on the sky, wavelength or frequency of light, and time. I'm also going to skip polarization. Greg has given me the I over there. But add a few more variables in that function if you really want. function if you really if you really want to but measuring this function over all of these parameters is too complicated we can't do that at least not all at once so what we do is kind of split it up and we or we integrate this function over different different variables so one example might be a data cube where we look at a piece of sky over some restricted range of weather Over some restricted range of wavelengths, or for some period of time. We integrate over time, and what we get is a three-dimensional data set that shows us brightness as a function of position on the sky and as a function of wavelength. So in astronomy, we would call this a data cube. You see these in lots of different wavelengths, but most particularly in optical wavelengths. And optical wavelengths, radio, and x-ray, I would say, are the places where you see this kind of thing most common. We also see images, and an image you can think of as a data cube that's just collapsed along a wavelength dimension of the cube. That's not always how they're made, but that's one way to think about it. And so, an image is typically made over a particular range and wavelength. That's what these curves are trying to show you here, the idea of. Of trying to show you here, the idea being that we have specified wavelength bands which have funny names that don't necessarily mean much, like what is the Z band. U at least means ultraviolet. That would kind of make sense. G, green. What is Z? We ran out of letters. What is Y? We need something before Z and things like that. So imaging, of course, is a very common form of astronomical data. Form of astronomical data, and within an image, there might be multiple options. A spectrum would be another case where you've gotten rid of the spatial information, but you're interested in the wavelength or frequency information. So you could have one-dimensional spectra. This would be an example of a one-dimensional spectrum, with usually a bunch of messy stuff and then some dark peaks. Sometimes there's a continuum. Sometimes there's a continuum, a smooth continuum underneath. There's also two-dimensional spectra where you get one of the spatial dimensions but not the other one. And so that's what that picture there is as well. And another example of astronomical data, which astrostatisticians have been very involved with, is time series photometry, where what you're measuring is the brightness of a single object or group of objects. A single object or group of objects, and you measure, make those measurements repeatedly at multiple periods of time. And what that results in is things like these light curves for Cepheid variable stars or a light curve for a supernova, where of course the Cepheid repeats, the supernova does not. One of the major challenges that we have in astronomy compared to lots of fields is that our That our time series measurements are not always made at regular intervals. We have this annoying fact that we're on this planet that rotates, and so we can't look at every object all the time. The planet goes around a star, the star gets in the way, you can't look at your favorite objects when they're right behind the sun. And so it means that many of the classic statistical methods for measuring variability time scales or extracting information from Or extracting information from time series have to deal with this kind of censored and gappy data. So that's my very brief overview of the kinds of data that we collect. We've got brightness as a function of spatial position on the sky, wavelength or frequency, and time. And what we do in our measurements is typically integrate over one or more of those variables. Integrate over one or more of those variables. How do we actually measure stuff? Well, we have these enormous things called telescopes, and they are super complicated and involve machines that to us are really cool and to other people are totally inscrutable. But these are big organizations that collect, that maintain and build the instruments that we use to collect data. So hundreds of people. Data. So hundreds of people work at observatories and at space missions to build an instrument that might be bolted on the back of a telescope, or an instrument that might be so big that it can't be bolted on the back of the telescope. So it's got to sit in a building all by itself next to the telescope. There's a little person figure there next to that spectrograph. So the point is that it is a big operation. And astronomical data, in particular, Astronomical data, in particular in the visible wavelengths, has, of course, benefited enormously from electronics technology. The CCDs and other electronic sensors that we use to collect data in the optical wavelengths are now at sort of nearly 100% quantum efficiency. So when you stick one on the end of your telescope, you're collecting almost all of the photons that you can get from these things. And what does that do? What do these electrons do? What does that do? What does this electronic technology do? But it gives us data which we can then measure stuff from. So the kinds of things that we are measuring from that F lambda integrated over some variable include things like where is the location of my source on the sky? Exactly where it is. Where is it moving? How precisely can we measure its location? How precisely can we measure its location? If it's a source that can be resolved, so it's bigger than the minimum size of object that your telescope can see, then we can say something about the structure of the source. Is it extended? How is it extended? If it's elliptical, what is the angle of position angle or the ratio of the axes? Often we just want the brightness. Often, we just want the brightness. We don't care where it is, we just want to know how bright it is overall. And we might want to know the brightness as a function of time. If we have a spectrum, the basic kinds of things that we're trying to measure, again, can be brightness. We're often trying to measure the depth of an absorption line that's due to some particular molecule or ionized atom in whatever we're looking at. Or we're trying to make. Looking at, or we're trying to measure something about an emission line, the same kind of thing, again, in the object that we're looking at. And that stuff, through Doppler motions, gives us information about motions within the object, both the gross motion of the object and also motion within it. It tells us about composition because we're looking for emission lines or absorption lines from particular atoms or molecules. And it tells us about physical conditions. And it tells us about physical conditions, temperature, density, pressure, that kind of thing. The astrophysics, in many cases, is in the spectrum as opposed to the image, which is a little more complex to derive physical information from. And many of these things that we're trying to measure can be either relative or absolute, where the absolute part is hard because that requires another step of calibration. For example, relatively For example, relative luminosity is pretty easy to measure, but absolute luminosity means we need a distance, for example. So we take our measurements and we compile them into catalogs. And as was already pointed out in the first talk, astronomers were kind of the first statisticians because they were the first people who were systematically compiling observations and measurements into lists of information. And so this list. And so, this list is just a list of the Messier objects, one of the early astronomical catalogs of fuzzy things in the sky that were not comets. We try to make our selection criteria a little bit more physical these days than fuzzy things in the sky that are not comets. But the Messier catalog, I think, is a really nice example of an early astronomical catalog. So, what are some ways in which astronomy data is different or are different from other kinds of big data that statisticians might work on? Often our astronomy data is pretty noisy and that's not always something that we can do anything about because we're trying to measure very faint signals from things very far away and we are typically doing it right at the bleeding. Typically doing it right at the bleeding edge of the technology, and convincing the time allocation committee on the telescope to give you twice as much time so your measurement could be half as noisy is not always easy. Often our data are incomplete or truncated in weird ways. So there might be some reason why our telescope can't look straight up, or we have this annoying galaxy that we live in that gets. Annoying galaxy that we live in that gets in the way of seeing the galaxies behind it. And so our maps of where the galaxies are in the sky are not complete because we don't have a complete view through our own galaxy. And our data may or may not fit well into a database model depending on exactly what we're trying to measure. So those can be complications in analyzing astronomical data. On the other hand, there are some big pluses of astronomical data. Big pluses of astronomical data, and that includes the fact that it's often public. That lots of most NASA-sponsored missions, for example, have a mandatory rule that data become public after a year or a year and a half, something like that. Many ground-based observatories also have that requirement. And of course, astronomical data don't have the same kind of research ethics. The same kind of research ethics and privacy and commercial concerns that other kinds of databases might have. And so that makes them great for exploring in a way that you might not be able to do with other kinds of databases. There's work ongoing to federate much of the public astronomical data, to put it together so that you can put your source of radio observations. Source of radio observations together with your source of X-ray observations, but that's not a process that's still ongoing. And I would say our database practices are still evolving. And what I mean by that, I stole this horrendous looking diagram here from our friends at the Canadian Astronomy Data Center, who maintain something called the Common Astronomical Observation Models, C-A-O-N. Observation Models, AOM. And what they do is operate an archive of telescope data where you can look for various kinds of observations from different telescopes. And the point is that it's quite complex to capture all of the features of astronomical observations in a way that you can then easily search for them. We do have something called the astronomical data query language, which is related to Related to SQL that you probably know about, but it deals with some of the peculiarities of astronomy data that people in other fields might not care about. For example, we really often want to select objects in a particular region of the sky, which doesn't come up in, you know, if you're looking for credit card data. So, not only do we have databases that give you information from a specific telescope or group of telescopes, but there are also Telescopes, but there are also things that I would kind of call metadatabases, which try to combine information from both telescope archives, but also from the literature. And in astronomy, the ones that are best known are SIMBAD, which has a French acronym that I know has an English acronym, but I can't quite remember, and NED, the NASA Extragalactic Database. And those two objects are. Objects are not homogeneous because they're collecting information from lots of different sources, but they're enormous resources for doing astronomical research. So one of the things, what I'm going to do now is sort of switch over to some of the newest missions and projects that are going on, just because I want people to be aware of them and also to be thinking about future projects. And one of my favorites at the moment is the Gaia project. It's a European-led mission that involves measuring the distances to something like a billion stars in our own galaxy. Except it turns out some of those are not actually stars in our own galaxy. They're things in other galaxies, which is what I'm interested in. But there's an enormous amount of data here, which is super well described and calibrated, and lots of And lots of interesting things that can be done with that data set. Just to give you some of the numbers about Gaia, it's got distances measured to 0.001% for the nearest stars, which when you think about it, is really kind of ridiculously impressive. Even for stars quite a long way away across the Milky Way, you're looking at distances of sort of 20%, which is still pretty awesome. 20%, which is still pretty awesome. So, I would really suggest that people look into the Gaia data set. There's lots of interesting statistics that can be done there. Thinking about other sources of data, here in Canada we have the CHIME and eventually the CORD projects. And so, CHIME is an interesting kind of radio telescope that's sometimes described as a software telescope. So, these cylindrical sort of half-pipes. Sort of half-pipe things are located in Penticton, BC, which is what direction are we facing here? I don't know, not that far away, that away. It's actually a pretty interesting place to visit if you ever get a chance. What CHIME and CORD and QIIME in particular is about is measuring the 21-centimeter hydrogen emission from distant places in the universe. Although it's also turned out to be a fantastic resource for things like Fantastic resource for things like measuring fast radio bursts, and we're going to hear more about that later. But again, this is a digital telescope because most of the work is done not with the physical hardware, but with the software that is connected to the back end. And this thing generates an enormous data volume, 13 terabytes per second, which means you've got to do a lot of processing. Now, moving on to sort of not quite present but future emissions, one of the most But future missions, one of the most important that's going to come out in extragalactic astronomy is the Euclid mission. So it was launched just a few months ago, expecting the first data release in about 2025. Euclid is designed for surveys, so for surveying large areas of the sky, in particular for cosmology. So Gaia was kind of stars, Euclid is kind of galaxies, but there's going to be a lot of interesting data coming out of Euclid that involves very precise measurements of galaxy shapes. Very precise measurements of galaxy shapes and positions in the sky. We also already heard a little bit about the LSST. If you're not an astronomer and you can't figure out why LSST has stood for several different things, we're confused about it too, don't worry. The important thing is that there is a telescope in Chile called the Vera Rubin Observatory, and it will carry out something called the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Survey of space and time. It's going to, again, operations begin quite soon. It is going to survey the whole sky every week-ish, and it's going to do that every week for about 10 years. And so that's going to provide a fantastic data set, not only in terms of depth when you add up 10 years' worth of data, but also for, for example, time variable objects, moving objects, and so on, going to produce an incredible data set to work. Produce an incredible data set to work on. Also, coming up pretty soon is the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope from NASA. And so that's a Hubble-size telescope, but with a much larger field of view. And what this picture of my favorite galaxy is supposed to show you is that little tiny red square there, that's the field of view of one of the cameras on Hubble, whereas this giant bunch of Whereas this giant bunch of white squares here is the field of view of the Roman camera. And so you'll be able to see a much bigger piece of sky all at once with Roman. You will not be looking at the moon at the same time as F31. That's just there for scale. You probably can't look at the moon with Roman at all. But again, Roman is going to be great for visible and near-infrared imaging surveys. It will also have a coronagraph to Have a coronagraph to do work on exoplanets. It's kind of a weird mixture of two missions. Exactly when it's going to be launched. Most of what I've seen says 2020s, but maybe somebody knows what this last digit is supposed to be other than I do. Five-ish. Five-ish. Okay. Yeah. So not that long, right? It's 2023. Let's say 26. I'm not a representative, so. Okay, okay, very good. A little further in the future, but. A little further in the future, but not too far, is the SKA Observatory, which is a radio telescope made up of a bunch of individual dishes that will be located both in South Africa and also in Australia and New Zealand. Canada is a partner in the SKA, so this is a big deal for those of us in this country. And I found this bizarre old intro graphic, which told us that the data, daily raw data generated by the SKA, would be equivalent to. By the SKA, it would be equivalent to 15,064 gigabyte iPods. Can you even get a 64-gigabyte iPod? I don't know. It shows you, but it shows you the sort of length of time it takes to get these projects going, right? By the time you actually built it, your original infographics are totally obsolete. But 300 petabytes per year, that's a lot of data. That's a lot of stuff that's got to be crushed. Also, possibly of interest to Canadians is that. Interest to Canadians is the Castor mission. So, this is a proposed one-meter diameter visible and ultraviolet telescope, again with a large field of view that will do lots of survey work and probably also some time variability work. The idea is that this would be a Canadian-led mission with partners elsewhere. That partner list is probably incomplete. It is not yet funded, so we do not yet have a launch date. But if you're Canadian, you can call your MP and say, And you can call your MP and say, give us money. That would be great. And also, an ad for another project that I'm involved in, along with Greg and some other folks, is a project called Candy Apple, which asked me after my second coffee, and I can probably remember what that stands for. But what Candy Apple is, is about a $14 million Canadian project that will provide. That will provide the hardware and software that we need to put together the data from all of those missions that I just talked about. So, processing that 300 petabytes of SKA data per year is not within this project, but processing the smaller amounts of data from the SKA's precursors, for example, or the LSST survey is what Candy Apple is all about. And it's going to be particularly important for things like trans. Important for things like transients, where you see something changing in the sky, supernovae, kilonovae, gravitational wave sources, all that kind of good stuff. So I want to just finish off by mentioning a couple of bits of interesting science that you can do with these big astronomy data sets. So this paper by Bouvert and Everall a couple of years back was talking about what are the odds that a star is missing from a particular Gaia data set. Gaia data set. And they develop quite a detailed and original kind of statistical approach to this, which I think is worth looking at. Their paper also has some fantastic plots that I really love. These are all-sky plots that look really weird because of the way Gaia takes its data, but I think there's some really interesting both science and statistics in that paper. You can use Gaia to do very cool things like see. To do very cool things like see nearby galaxies rotate. So the data sets are big enough that you can look for motion of stars in other galaxies. And this is Andromeda again. But so one of the early results from the second Gaia data release was a detection of rotation in the Andromeda galaxy. My particular interest in Gaia is with nearby galaxy contents, and so one of the things that I've been working on is seeing Been working on is seeing how some of these various databases, Gaia and Ned, and Simbad, overlap. And I can talk about that until you're all bored, but I will stop and not. So let me just wrap up with saying where can you go to learn more about some of this stuff. I have a couple of general papers that I've written kind of trying to explain astronomical data to non-astronomers. Most of you in the room don't need this, but if you have a statistician at your home, Have a statistician at your home institution who might need a bit of an introduction, that those might be helpful for you. If you want to know more about the future projects that Canadian astronomy is involved in, you can read that in this marvelous document here and also the US equivalent. Yeah, that is your very brief introduction to big astronomy data sets. So, thank you.
