First of all, I would like to thank the kind invitation of the conference especially Professor Ya Chuang Yi for invitation. Today I will talk about the continued gravitational collapse for gas star. So this is a joint work with my former student, Yao Ye. Of mass and the second one is the uh conservation of momentum. And here we have uh two two force. So this is the uh let me let me see. So this is the it's a pressure, okay. this is the pressure okay this is usually uh produced by the uh because this model uh uh this model describes the motion of the gas star so here the the pressure so the pressure somehow is produced by the nuclear fusion so this is somehow the pressure is explained okay but how so there is a another force this from the graviti uh gravitational force Gravitational force. So the gravity, this is the capital phi. This is the potential. Here, the rho is the density and the u is the velocity. And the pressure is somehow, the state of equation, somehow is the, this is the state is somehow described by the observation, okay, the astronomical. at the astrophysical observation. Usually for simple certainty, so usually we consider the gamma rule and here gamma is greater than one. It's very important. So when gamma is greater than one or less less than four over three, so this is several critical mass and when gamma Mass and when gamma equals to four over three. So this is critical mass. And when gamma is large, largest thing is four over three. This is subcritical mass. Kick chair, okay, okay. That's a dinosaur from Baibu, Chinese Google. Cannot be used in China, okay. Okay. So we know that the SQL physics, so we have many special solutions for the gas star. I think the most important is the lay eminent solution. So lay email solution is for the state case that is the velocity. So it's zero. So that means the size doesn't move. And also that's the steady state. This is zero, and also this is zero. So we only have the balance of this full force. So if we divide this balance, So if we divide this by rule, and then we take a divergence here, and then Labor Phi is this one. So we can get some called the semi-linear individual equation. And if we consider the radiosymmetrical solution, then the equation becomes somehow ODE efficient. So then we can solve this ODE efficiency. If we got map between two penance to this interval, and the empty solution has somehow the competitive support. And so the subcritical mass and exactly the ring has already proved that this is stable. Okay. Here we say that the condition is stable because ring is the work is. The work is business, the solution has already existed. So at that time, the existence of the solution is not known. And for Gaba, is in the critical mass. So Taipin Niu and this is Feng Yan and also Teng Any has already shown that this this lay every solution is uh is not stable. Is not stable. And then, even for the supercritical mass, and Jia has already showed that I also showed that this is not stable. So, for the lay emblem Segushi, of course, this is for the stability of the lane-empted Serushi expanding solution. We know that the university is somehow expanding and for. The OER system without the gravitational force and the cell is constructed. Cellar is constructed by a fine stability. The affine stability means the stability somehow is linearly linear. Linear you can spend with respect to time t. Postal system. So this is also by the Heisega and Ja. They're working exactly based on the salaries construction for the OER system. So that means they use the OR system as a background system and consider the small gravitational force. So they also can struggle there. So they also construct the a fine solution for all our personal system. And furthermore, they also prove that the fine solution is stable for the critical mass the result for the expanding solution. And more importantly, this is very interesting for the LF solution. And this is somehow this, of course, by the gravitational force. For the subcritical mass, there is a low collapse. So, this was done by the same work by the Deng and the New and Puny and also Yao. So, gamma equal to 4 over 3. The colour is weighbor. They observed there is a formula glass collapse. So that means at some time, so the war particles collapse to the original point. But Kello also gave a explanatory formula of this kind of special solution. Yeng Guo and Hezekiah were very important phenomena. the quantity of continued eclipse for the super critical for uh super critical mass the observation is that the uh close to the origin so the it's a particle uh forced uh collapse and they say then the collapse the uh along the radius very important progress and this and the collapse solution And the capacitance they will choose. Dominated by the operation of the opposite system. Okay, so this is the observation. So this is a construct special kind of solutions and uses a special kind of solution of the pressure or post-mo system as a background solution. So the further construct is there, construct a special solution for the Consider a special solution for the original Eula cosmo system. We did bad work, so we consider a general case because they only consider a special collapse solution. And here, so we first we We first classified what spherically symmetric solution of progression is Eula Poson system. And we classified it by two cases. And one is for the escapical and the also connect case. Critical velocity V sub substar. This of course depends on the radius. and the radius and we show that if the initial velocity is greater than or equal to the critical velocity, then we can say that the dust escapes away from the gravitational force forever. We prove that the PISMA this one and the special solution. So then we consider the original OLAP person and then we can prove that for the original OLAP system we consider also a special segue which formulated a continued gravitational collapse in fire time. So this is a sum of for the general case. It's a problem of course we consider the gas star surrounded by vacuum. Star surrounded by vacuum. So, this is the physical vacuum condition. Okay, this is as usual. We formulate, reformulated the system by this one. So, by somehow scanning. And this is exactly so first formulated by Wuan, Hezigan, and Chia. And the advantage of the scanner is that. It's an advantage of the scanning that is the we still get the same, it's almost the same Euler photosystem. The only difference is here is the pressure. So this kind of scanning, that means we want to weaken the we ask the epsilon is very small. So that means so we if epsilon is So we, if epsilon is zero, so this is the freshness of EUR possible system. So here we just use the Euler Process system as somehow the perturbation of the freshness Euler possession system. Coordinator and then why is somehow this is the lagarangic coordinator? Of course, we consider the radial solution. So, here chappa is the ratio of the Euler system over the Lagrangian coordinate. And we get the solution for the ratio for the ratio equation. So, the advantage of the in the Lagrangian coordinate, we reduce the We reduce the system, the system of file. We know that the file, this efficiency, will have a fair efficiency. This system contains the fair efficiency. But here, we only get just one efficient. So if chopper equal to zero, so that means this is somehow the collapse.  Freshness equation, okay. Here. So G of R, there's G is some point like the average density. Okay, average density. So if GR is this is even this is a constant, somehow like this is the Kepler equation, okay. And then we we consider this somehow this is the OTE equation. Use the conceiv, and then we get this equation of this equation. This sum of the ODE equation. For the preciousness solutions, we have two. We have two cases. So, this is for the escape escape case. So, if the initial velocity is greater than the critical speed, okay, and then we can say that the dust, okay, the tends to infinity, as the time of tends to infinity. So we can say that this is somehow this is a linear expansion. And then this is different. So the expand by the power is two over three. So there's a difference. And for the collapse case, if for the initial velocity messing, the critical speed, then we say that you make this is a collaboration time. Okay. That is the solution collapse around the point 2 over 3, okay, as S prints through this one off. The remark tool is so they only can study the special case just this one. Okay. They immediately find that they have expensive solution. So, this is a very special case. So, in the case, that is because the initial velocity is less than zero. So that means the case, that means the gases var has already collapsed, so initially collapsed. All cases that we can consider this initial velocity can be positive initially. So that means the gas star may be initially expanded, but finally stop and then collapse by the gravitational force. This solution is, we have the two kinds of solutions. We have two kinds of solutions. This is for fixed R. So that means we get the solution, the trajectory solutions. So if we combine all trajectories, so we have exactly we have collapse. So that means the what trajectories will collapse.  So we got a sample progress and this look as the case. Euler personal system. So we finally considered the original Euler personal system and we executively proved that for any gamma, so for the super critical mass, and then we can say that the solution as a somehow the near the collaboration time. The near the collaboration time and the behavior of the solution almost the same as the pressureless oil of post-man system. So, this is our main theorem. Organize the proof. Okay. The first assumer is a very, I think we just solved the ODE system so that exactly we can get the We can get the formula of the freshness of all our possible system solutions. So, there's, and here we only consider the original possible system. First, we take some of the coordinate transformation, tau equal to one minus s over the p sub r. The advantage of this coordinate is that we Cording the we we unify we unify the collapse time as the tau equal to zero. Otherwise, so you know this is the continued collapse, so maybe the collapse time is different, depends on the r but here we unify so clock zero is the calibration time and then we get a the new equation like this one, okay? We get the new equation like this one, and also. And also, here we only consider the whole collapse pace. Okay. So if epsilon equals zero, so then we have this one. So this is the preciousness of our post-system. And the collapse, we have this special solution. We can say that as top principle zero, so phi zero is also zero, but the point is. zero but the point is four over three okay the pressure as a solution as a background solution and then we consider this equation okay this is this equation and if phi is a phi zero and then we find that this this term is not good okay and here so we can say this one So we can say that there is this one. This error term is not good because you can see the gamma in this interval. So that means so this term is but not is not inequalable with respect with respect to respect to the tort, so especially when torture close to zero. So to use the energy inequality, so energy method, so we need to we need to improve we need to improve the error time. This is our idea. So we use the somehow absolute GF, phi GF, plus the set I use somehow is the remainder term. This is the phi zero. And then, and this is somehow we we use the We use this one. Okay. This is the S P A P. So somehow we approximated the solutions. So V1 or V2 or VM is exactly the somehow the linear equation of this one. Okay, this is the linear equation. We consider the linear equation here and the error time. For example, F1 only depends on. F1 only depends on phi zero and for f2 maybe depends on phi zero and one anyway so depends on the formal expansion or theorem okay so this is the estimate of for zero and we can say that the the important thing is the derivative of the derivative of with Derivative with respect to top. So we can say that it's a original is the index 4 over 3 minus m because we have the m derivative. So that means when we derive to the phi 0 with respect to tau, so this is not good, it's minus m. If we derive with respect to r, there's no problem. respect to R, there's no problem. Okay. So so here, so we improve this one. So and then we can see how about the phi G and then we find that for the VG, so we can say that the derivative with respect for top. So this is the top always always three minus J theta minus M. So only difference is here, J theta. Is here g data, but here data is not positive. So that means even zero term is not good, so we can we can explain the enough time. So until because the G theta, okay, until this is regular, near the tau equal to zero. So this is the this is the main idea. This is the main idea. You can spend enough time. And finally, we consider this one. Okay. So time over R. So we consider the remainder time equation. This is for remainder term equation. And then we can solve this one. Okay. So then we can by the edit method, we can solve this equation. This is our main result. So the phase equal to this one. Okay, we consider this one. This is the phi zero. And this is the sum of the expansion and this is the humanitarian. Okay. And the important thing is that when tau equal to tends to zero, when tau tends to zero, so I think this is the main time. Okay. This is the main time because this is tau. The main time because this is tall, the index is 12 over 3. So, and you can see that this one, for example, 31. So, you can say that 31 is somehow this one. V1 is almost 103, the plus data, okay, V1. If VG is plus G data. So, if when This is equal to zero, and also this is also equal to zero. So that's why we can have this one. So when all equal to zero, so phi over phi zero, the limit is one. So that means the near the collaboration time. So the solution was described by the brush in the Euler Possum system. So I stop here. Thank you very much.
