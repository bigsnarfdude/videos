Well, actually, I think I should let her explain what she's going to say. All right, take it away, Arilina. Okay, thank you for inviting me to speak at this conference. So today I'll talk about counting points and function fields and I'll present two different contexts in which I've done this. Um, okay, so for this talk, FQ will be a finite field. And since there exists a correspondence between Q and FQP, the function field field in one variable over FQ where Z corresponds to polynomials in FQ, one variable with coefficients in FQ. We can adapt many of the conjectures and results regarding counting points over Q to counting FQT points and this will also give us some nice geometric interpretation. So let me start with the first The first application. So here, little k is just the finite field of q, and the characteristic of k will be greater than or equal to actually greater than 3. And f F will be a non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree three. And at least ten variables and X Is a smooth cubic hypersurface defined by F So, inspired by work of Browning and Vichy, who considered the space of rational curves. Space of rational curves of degree D on X. I consider the space of degree D rational curves passing through two points on X and the motivation for this is geometric. So let me talk a bit about the motivation. So in 1972, Manin introduced the following notion to study parametrizations of rational points. And he defined two points A and B in X K to be our direction. To be directly our equivalent if there is a morphism f from P one to X defined over K With f of 0, 1 equal to A and F of 1, 0 equal to B. And this generates an equivalence relation on the set of the colours. Of k rational points on X called our equivalence. In particular, we remarked that informally speaking, two points are equivalent if they can be connected by a chain of rational curves over k. Thus, our equivalence on On the set of rational points on X is not so interesting unless there are many rational curves on X, or at least over the closure of K. So such X are rationally connected. So roughly speaking X is rationally connected if for any two general points on X there is a rational curve on X Passing through them. And in particular, we remark that rationally connected varieties are those for which our equivalence is trivial. And we may need to extend the ground field. To an arbitrary algebraically closed field. Moreover, since we consider cubic hypersurfaces, we have the following results. So the first one is by Swin Dyer. Swing Erd Dyer, and this is from 1971. And he proved that our equivalence is trivial for cubic surfaces over finite fields. And then more recently, Mador proved in. Mador proved in 2008 that our equivalence is trivial for cubic hypersurfaces x and pn minus 1 if n is greater than or equal to 6. And in the same year, Kollar gave a similar result for cubic hyperservices. Similar result for cubic hypersurfaces and he managed to improve on n. He needs n greater than or equal to 4, but there is a condition on Q, so Q greater than or equal to 11. Okay, so back to our problem if we have to. If we have two points, I'll denote these by A and B in FQN not zero, such that they satisfy the equation of the cubic hypersurface. And then there is another condition that I need to I need to have for this result is that one of them does not lay on the Hessian hypersurface associated to X. So in particular, the determinant of this is not zero, where h of x is just a Hayesian matrix associated to X. Matrix associated to x. So it's just the matrix of the second derivatives. And then I will consider the space of degree D rational curves passing through the points A and B on X. Points A and B on X and the 2008. And these A and B are the corresponding points in A. Um, in XK. All right, so as it's been mentioned in other talks, there is a correspondence between FQD points and FQ rational curves. And this is what we are going to use. And on top of this, we need to add the conditions that the rational curve passes through two points. So, in particular, if f is the rational curve. F is the rational curve, and it's given by F equal to F1 UV up to F n U V up to V Then we write these. We write these Fi's, which are polynomials with coefficients in K. So we write this as alpha D I u to the D plus alpha D minus 1 I u to the D minus 1 V plus dot dot dot plus alpha zero I V to the D. Z to the D so these alphas belong to K so then the condition that the curve F passes through Through the points A and B is equivalent to a condition on these coefficients. So alpha 01 up to alpha 0n is going to be A. And the coefficient of u to the d, so alpha. Of u to the d, so alpha d1 up to alpha dn is going to be equal to b. And now since we can regard this curve as a point in the projective space, then we can, by counting FQT points, we can deduce stuff about the geometry. Good stuff about the geometry of the space of rational curves. So let me write this down. So such morphisms of degree D are parametrized by this space Mar D A B P one K X Kx, which is an open sub-variety of this projective space P to the n times d minus 1 minus 1. And it's cut out by a system of 3d minus 1 equations. Equations So then it's expected to naive dimension. Is mu equal to d times n minus 3 minus n. And what I want to show is that it indeed has this expected dimension. So by using the hardy little wood circle method over the function fields, I can count FQT points and deduce this result. So So denote by NABD the number of polynomials F1 up to Fn and FQT of degree at most D Most D whose leading coefficient is given by B and whose constant coefficient is given by A Such that f of F one up to Fn is zero. So then I can obtain a precise asymptotic formula for this quantity. So if we fix a finite field, Fix a finite field of characteristic greater than three, and we fix a smooth cubic hypersurface x in Pn minus one over k and then our more variables. And we pick any points A and B in X over F Q, not both on the associated Hessian hypersurface. So then we have the following asymptotic formula so NABD is Q to the D plus one to the N minus To the n minus 3 minus 2n plus 4. So if you are familiar with results over q, then this q to the d plus 1 is equivalent to the capital B when you count points up to height B. And we have an uglier term that I'll just write. I'll just write. But it doesn't matter for this purpose, so I'll leave it out. However, the important part is that the implied constant doesn't depend on Q and This depends only on the degree D and on X. So now we have this asymptotic formula, we can obtain the following corollary. So under the same setting as a Same setting as above we can so same setting as above we can deduce that there exists a constant Cx greater than zero such that Than zero, such that for any points A, B, and X, not both on the Hessian and any D greater than or equal to 19N minus 19. 19n minus 11 over n minus 9. If q is greater than or equal to cx, then there exists an FQ rational curve of degree D that passes through A and B. So this result can also be seen as a corollary of a result of Pirutka and an argument of Collar, which states that any two points A and B on in X K can be joined by two lines on X defined over K. Also, keeping the dependence on Q in the asymptotic formula upstated allows us to deduce further results in the same spirit as those of Browning and Vichet. So, if again the same setting and if you pick any Pick any points A and B in X K, not both on the Hessian. Then for t greater than or equal to 19 n minus 11 over n minus 9, we have that the limit as q goes to infinity. Q goes to infinity of Q to the minus mu, where this was the expected dimension, times the number of points, FQ points on this space, of rational curves passing through two points, this limit is less than or equal to one. And now since And now, since by result of choler, all irreducible components of more DAB P1KX have dimension at least mu And then using the Lang Reil estimate, then we can deduce that this space is irreducible and has the expected dimension. Moreover, um this is a result of a refQ, but what is interesting is that we can talk about the same argument. follow the same spreading out argument as in the paper of Browning and Vichy and deduced the same result over C. So in particular if now X is a smooth cubic hypersurface over C and again we take two points such that one of them is not on the Hessian then Then the space of the degree D rational force passing through two points up to isomorphism, I mean, has the expected dimension as well and is also irreducible. And it's also irreducible. All right. Um I won't go into into the proof, um but um as I mentioned it But as I mentioned, it uses the circle method. And all these conditions that the characteristic needs to be greater than three and that one of the points must not lie on the Hessian come from the analysis of that comes in the circle method. So now I'll move on to the second application that I would like to talk about. Application that I would like to talk about. And this concerns the battery-manual conjecture and function fields. So for this part, capital K will be a global field, so a number field or a finite extension of FQT. Of Fqt and X will be a smooth projective variety over K and X K will denote the set of K rational points on X. So as you've seen in other talks, if X is funnel, so the damped canonical divisor is ample, then we can define the associated height function. On the set of rational points, and this measures the size of a k-p point, and then we can define An xb to be the number of rational points of bounded height. Then the original version of this conjecture, which now has a Which now has many other improvements. When K was this was originally conjectured for K a number field, and it said that there exists an open subset that is not empty. Such that when we look at the number of points in this open subset U of bounded height, then this is asymptotically equal to a constant. equal to a constant which depends on the height times b log b to the rank of the Picard group minus one as b goes to infinity and moreover they are gave an interpretation of this constant and generalized the results over function fields Over function fields. Maybe the conjecture, I should say. And in particular, for function fields, we would be looking at the quantity and xm. And Xm where we look at rational points. But this time we need to take them to have a precise height equal to Q to the M. And we consider this as M goes to infinity. And then the expected result is to get To get the equivalent constant for function fields times q to the m times m to the rank of the Picard group of x minus 1 times log q. And then for this original version of the conjecture, there were some counterexamples. And these are over queue. And the first one was produced by Batrev and Chinkle. And we looked at the sum from i equal 1 to 4 xi times y cubed is 0 in P3. In P3 cross P3. And then more recently, Browning and Heave Brown produced another example where they looked at the sum from i equal 1 to 4, xi times yi squared. Also, in Also, in B3 cross B3. But as I've mentioned, there are some refinements of this conjecture. And the idea is that one can remove a fin set and then the conjecture will hold. And this is the case with the example. With the example produced by Browning and Hiff Brown. So a fin set is just a finite union of sets of the following types. So either A is a subset of XK that is not so viscously dense or is a subset of pi WK where W is Is sorry a irreducible variety of the same dimension as X and pi is a map from W to X, which is a maximum. Which is a generically surjective morphism of degree at least two. So inspired by work of Lerodourier, who produced also a counterexample for the original conjecture over Q, which gets explained by removing this fin set. I have obtained a similar result over function fields. But the difference is that this result is valid not only for FQT, which is the correspondent to Q, but to any extension of FQT. So if K is a degree extension of FQT, Extension of FqT such that the characteristic of K is greater than 2, then there exists a thin set T, which is explicit, and I'll explain in a moment what this is, such that the number of points In the Hilbert scheme of two points on P2, take away this fin set such that the height of these points is equal to Q to the M. Then this agrees with the refined version of the conjecture. So we obtain exactly the pair constant times q to the m times m plus an error term big o of square root of m q to the m as m goes to infinity. So in particular I'll explain now what this Hilbert's What this Hilbert scheme of two points is, and what the thin set that we need to consider is. So, if we're given X any smooth projective variety, then we can define the m symmetric product of H. Symmetric product of x to be the projective quotient variety from x to the m where we quotient by the symmetric group which acts on xn by permuting the factors and then inside the here we have Inside here, we have the diagonal delta. And to define this, we first take a point x and xk bar such that the degree of the extension kx of k is equal to m and this should be larger than 1. And this should be larger than one, otherwise, the whole thing is trivial. Then the orbit of this point X contains, under this Galois option, contains M distinct Galois conjugates and I'll deny the notes then. X1 up to Xm So then the diagonal delta in Xm is the union of the following sets of points. So X1 up to Xm in Xn such that such that xi is equal to xj and then I forgot to denote this projection projection from xm to simen x by pi so when we also look at the projection of delta I'll denote this by d and And this symmetric product, simon X, is singular along D. And then this Hilbert scheme of points on X is precisely the decimalization of schema X when X when the dimension of X is equal to 2 Moreover, if the characteristic If the characteristic of k is zero or larger than m, then this map epsilon this preserves the canonical divisor. So then counting points on Hilbam X becomes much simpler because it is easy to define a height by connecting the height to the height on the surface. To the height on the symmetric product, and this one is just the product of the heights. So the height of x1 and then up to the height of xm, where these were the Galois conjugates. So then there are, let me see. Oh, yeah, I'm almost out of here. So if we just take X to be P2, then we have two types of points on CMX and we'll have irreducible points. Which are these ones coming from the double conjugates. So we'll have pi fxx bar where x is a degree two point and the rest are reducible. And in particular, and the result of the fin set T is just the pre-image of these reducible points. So we need to remove all the reducible points. And then in order to count this, it is necessary. In order to count this, it is necessary to count quadratic points in Pn over function fields, but this is a result of Kettelstring and Pander, so the counting comes really easily. All right, yes, so this is all I wanted to present today. Thank you very much. That's the bottom of the Thank you. Are there any questions for our speaker? I have a question. All right. This is about the formula for cubic hypersurfaces, this NAB. So it's a really nice formula. I was wondering about the leading. I was wondering about the leading constant. Is there any like geometric or arithmetic reason why the I'm sorry, the leading coefficient, why the coefficient of this sort of leading term has the shape it does. You know, we're not in the setting of Mannon's conjecture, so it's not Paris constant, but I was wondering if there's some sort of analog. Yes, it's a product of local densities that comes from the analysis in the circle method from the singular integral. integral and that's that's where this minus 2n plus 4 comes comes from i was going to ask um this is maybe a slightly self-interested question but in this uh heights on stock stuff that i posted with david and matt um we talk about other heights on the symmetric Other heights on the symmetric product of a variety. So, this relates to the very last thing you talked about, which would be some, which would be sort of some linear combination of the height that you're talking about, plus some contribution coming from the discriminant of that field, like some multiple of that. And that would be, I'll just comment that I'd be really interested to know whether what the counts would look like with respect to that modified height. I would guess that the stuff that you do is capable of. Capable of doing those counts? I haven't tried it out, but I guess I could try it and see how it changes. But yeah, thank you. I'll just point out for clarity that the David that Jordan mentioned there is not me. I am density zero in the space of Davids. Are there other questions for our speaker? Our speaker. I have a question. So I remember there's a, there's, Kohlar proved more for these rational curves on cubic hypersurfaces over finite fields. Like for any map from P1 of FQ to the FQ points of the hypersurface, you can extend it. If Q is like sufficiently large, you can extend it to a map from P1 to the hypersurface that interpolates those points. Interpolates those points. Is there any hope that you could do more than two points and try to actually count such things and try to understand what sort of degree is necessary? I think it would be possible to take more than two points, but then the analysis becomes a bit more difficult because taking just two points made the conditions for this quantity NAD really easy to express. Easy to express. It's just fixing the first and last coefficient. But as soon as you take a third point, it's a bit more, it's a bit trickier, but I think it's doable. So I think with the same method, it could work. All right. Are there any other questions or comments for our speaker? All right, well, seeing none, let's thank her again. And that concludes the activities for the day.
