But in generality, K can be any set. You take the only restriction is that it has bounded diameter, so diameter is equal to B. And you consider a problem where you're trying to cover the set K with sets that have smaller diameter. And you're looking for this number B of K to be the smaller s number of sets of smaller diameter needed to colour K. Diameter needed to cover K. So, for example, if I have a triangle, a collateral triangle, then I can cover it with three sets of smaller diameters of sets K in circles. And B of M would be a supremum overall bodies, or over all sets K in Rn of this B of K. So this is somehow the worst case scenario for the column. For the cover. So, yeah, you can cover triangles with balls. You would need three balls, and then you can cover it with smaller homozygic colors. And somehow those two classes of sets are the natural choices, because balls among the fixed diameter would have the largest volume, so you would be fighting the largest chunks with balls. And then smaller homothetic copies of your set or of your body, they resemble the structure of your body. Rely the structure of your body. So, with small shifts of smaller homothetic copies, you hope that they will also cover entirely like a lot of your initial certificate. So, you can do that, you can do other things with a triangle for Borsov's problem, you can mix and match, but this is a sad. So, Porsov introduced this problem in 1933. He showed that in one dimension, Porsov numbers In one dimension, Borse number is two, so you can always split any set on a line two pieces. And then, maybe a bit more interesting is that on a plane, you can do three pieces always. So, for triangle, triangle is kind of the illustration of the worst case scenario. And then he showed that for any sphere in RN, so it's a minus one-dimensional sphere living in RN, the Polski number is a plus one. Porsche number is a plus one, and it's possible on during one side, another side is an example where you take like Boronoi regions defined by the points of regular simplex on a sphere. So he made the question uh whether the sports of number is always n plus one. So in any dimension n can be always to n plus one. In any dimension, n can be also to n plus 1. There was a lot of progress towards proving this over the years. I'll list one, because next slide I will say that the question has negative answers. So Furkell proved that in dimension 3, it's true. And then Khan and Kalai disproved the conjecture in high dimensions. They constructed a counterexample. So they constructed a set that needs That needs exponential in a lot of n parts were constructed a set such that if you want to cover the set with set of smaller diameter, you need exponential number of parts. And there was an improvement in the base of the constant, or in the base of the exponent, but not in the root of n. So since the question was disproved, everyone were happy. So we go home, we deal with our lives. We go home, we deal with our lives, and we don't touch this, but there are a lot of questions related to evaluating this value of B of. So in general, in dimensions four and higher, we don't know the value of B of, and we want to understand the behavior of this function. So one example would be what would be the smallest dimension where the Borestop question fails. And if you have smallest dimension, of course, there is a race, and there is a A risk and there is a chain of results. Yeah, it's a commensural example, so they take a subset of hyper Q, of vertices of hyper Q. And yeah, I mean, I can. So they take a dimension which is n choose two, in that dimension they would In that dimension, they would take vertices of hypercubes, so let's say is the set A, which is a subset of 0, 1 to the entrance 2. But they take only those subsets that are indexed by badges of certain graphs. So the graphs that they consider, they would consider by parted graphs. So n would be even. So they have n over 2 and n over 2. So they have n over two and n over two vertices in each part. They consider a complete biparted graph and they consider indicator of edges. Indicator of edges would give you a point in the hyperview. And then they show that if you take distances between two such indicators, basically behave nicely, we get a volume of diameter, and they use a result from just the graph the hypergraph theoretical. After theoretical results, saying what would be the chromatic numbers. So I should say the short version of Ansar, which is a discrete example, but it's quite involved discrete example. And Ray Gorotsky, again very roughly, he considered a subset of this. And that this is a good thing. Right. Yeah, so this. Why do I actually mention this? Because I was introduced in 2011 to this problem by Gundarenko back in Kiev, so he was trying to solve or improve this lower bound, and he holds almost the best results. So, the result of Yemen is improvement. Right, so. Right, so we have some lower bounds for Borsworth number. We also have upper bounds, and upper bounds are exponential in n essential. So we already see a problem. You have exponential in root of n, lower bounds, exponential in n, upper bounds, and that's a huge open problem to determine whether you get exponential in n lower bounds. That was stated by Kalai in 2015 in his survey. In history. So I want to concentrate on the last two results of Schram and Borger and Ninderstraus because they give race to kind of two different versions or simplification of what. So Schram in 1988 was the first one to prove this bound of root three halves to the power n. And what he showed, he showed that bodies of concentration. He showed that bodies of constant width one can be covered by at most this many smaller homothetic copies of that body. So in terms of this triangle picture, he was covering triangle by triangles, but he was covering body positives one with smaller homothetic copies, and he was translates all his own notations. And Burgen and Linden Strauss, they covered body K by also smaller than meter. So they restricted their class of bodies to So they restricted their class of bodies that they're using to cover. So one is a smaller homothyne copies, another is horribles. And those are two covering problems that I will be discussing. So the first one, of course, would be the last one. So Burken-Windenstrahl considers this g of k. It's the smallest number of balls that you need to cover k and balls. And the balls have to be over diameter smaller than that of k. And similarly, GeoFan would be the supremum overall of those geophysics. And the problem was circulated by Grimbaugh in the 1950s. At least that's what Berkeley Minister was saying. So I will use G for Grimbaum. Yeah, that's uh yeah. Yeah 'cause for Sham I will use H obviously like that because makes more perfect sense. Uh right so if you cover this set by balls you actually can construct an example that means exponential magnitudes. So in this restricted version of Borset problem you have exponential lower bound in there, you have uh exponential upper bound and Upper bound, and you have the special upper bone, and organic minuscules improved pulse, lower bone, and upper bound for when you're covering the body by pulse. Now, Schram, he considered covering the body by smaller homostatic copies, and Rui Bertras already gave that beautiful explanation why it is related to elimination, so I'll just briefly skim over it. I'll just briefly skim over it. So, how this covering problem is related to a reminder: if I have a convex body, a point x on the boundary of that body, and a direction psi, I say that the direction vector psi illuminates x on the boundary if the ray, starting at the axis direction psi, intersects interior. So, this direction illuminates the blue portion of the boundary, but doesn't. Of the boundary, but doesn't eliminate the black portion of the boundary. And then you ask for a body k: what is the minimum number of directions needed to eliminate every point of the boundary? Plus, example is that for a square in a plane, you need at least you need four. And Bothansky here showed that the illumination number of body k is actually equal to the minimal number of smaller homotophylls. To the minimal number of smaller homothetic translates of K needed to cover K. So it gives you direct relation to POSIC. Because you're actually, when covering the smaller copies of smaller homothetes of K, you decrease your diameter, so you satisfy the POSIC condition. And yeah, the idea of the property, which was shown yesterday, but roughly that. So, roughly, if you have a portion of the boundary illuminated by direction psi, you can take a smaller homothetic copy of the body shifted in direction minus psi, a bit, and then you will almost cover the same proportion to get rid of this or the same boundary. To get rid of the small chunks of boundary, you actually consider just an open uh interior of K, and many useful buttons are given to. Many useful patterns are to say that you can take coefficients more than one. But that's it. And I sh of course should mention the big elimination conjecture saying that for any body in Rn, the nation number is at most 2 to the n, and there is a progress in this direction. The best bound is still exponential in 4. So it's 4 to the n. So it's four to zero divided by some sub-exponential factors. And batteries in that direction. Right. Now, why do we care about bodies of constant width? Why does Schramp consider elimination number of bodies of constant width? Is that there is a result of Egliston saying that if I have a set of diameters I have a set of diameter D. For any set of diameter D, I can find in the same dimension the body of constant width of the same diameter containing my original set. So what that means is that if I learned how to cover the bodies of constant width, I learned how to cover every set with that many copies of sets of smaller diameter. So, again, the typical example of a BRO, you have Example would be a relo. You have a triangle, you can complete it to by f constant width in a plane, which would give you a reload. So, when dealing with Borsak number, we obtain say upper bounds, it's enough to obtain upper bounds for Borsak number of bodies of constant width. And again, if we on top of that restrict ourselves only to considering smaller homothetic copies, we derive to this function package. Derived to this function edge. So you're considering the elimination number of k, where k is a convex body of constant width, and you take the supremum because also numbers. So in some sense, it's what's the worst convex body of constant width for elimination, which one requires the largest number of dimensions. And then the discussion that happened on the last two slides basically show. In the last two slides, basically shows that H of n is an upper bound for B of n because you're using smaller homothetic points. And you're covering variables of constant width, which contain any set. Right, so Schram showed in his paper for this elimination number of bodies of personal width. You have the same upper bound as for Kantian bodies. He used quite different methods, use different sets, he obtained the same. Sets people obtain the same, well, not exact, they have a different little off terms, but the base of its polynomial is the same. And for elimination number, we didn't know any nice lower bound. So the only lower bound still comes from this inequality. And whatever lower bound on Borsa would be a lower bound for H of R. So you have exponential numbers of that lower bound. And Kalai asked again in the same survey the question of whether. The question of whether for the elimination number of what is presently you have this explanation in and blah blah blah. And right I'm ready to state our two results. So we answered our big result would be that we answered the question of how I. So we have a main tech associated to the the problem. So we obtained the exponential overhaul. Obtained the exponential lower bound, exponentially in that lower bound for the elimination number of bodies constant width. And then we also, as a kind of small side product, obtained another lower bound in organic terminals covering bodies by holes. And both of those are constructions. You need to construct a body that would require at least this many smaller homothetic copies, or you need to construct a set that will require at least this many bows. That will require at least this many bowels of smaller diameter to cover it. So the proofs are just construction, and I'll either try to convince you that those work or I will just tell you that those work. But I'll at least so some notation before we start. So angle, my constructions will be on spheres. So I define the angle between points on a sphere as On a sphere, that's just the angle. And if I live on a sphere only, then the angle controls obviously the distance between the points. So if I control the size of the angle, I will control the diameter of the set. That's important. Another definition that I need is a cap. So I take a sphere, I take a spherical cap on it. You can parametrize with different parameters. I will parametrize with a coherent. I will parametrize with a point on the sphere, so the center of the cap on the sphere, and then a graph of a central angle that defines this cap. So this angle phi would be defining the capital. The formal definition would be this, that all points on the sphere that have angle at most five degrees. And I will also need a Falkland result that if I take the normalized surface area of the cat. The normalized surface area of the cat, then the normalized surface area behaves like this. So if anyone looked, but like everyone here looked at high-dimensional spheres, so they know that all of the mass lives around the equator, and what is left is exactly those caps. They have small machine. And yeah, another notation is that instead of doing cap of spherical radius, fine. Radius phi, I will just do the mu of phi. And mu can be considered as a probabilistic measure of the sphere, of course. So our main seat for construction in both cases, in both Grim problem and elimination problem, is this lab. So what does it say? It tells us that on a sphere Tells us that on a sphere I can construct a discrete set, so this set axis discrete, that has many points, exponentially many points, and this number is in a second I'll give you a bit more meaning what this number is, but roughly it's a constant divided by measure. Like if you remember the previous slide, it's constant divided by the measure of the cap. And it's a different constant. And I want two properties of this set. I want that the set is separated both in terms of minimal and maximal angle. So I'm not allowing small, minimal angles, I'm not small angles, and I'm not allowing large angles. Again, not allowing large angles would restrict my diameter, so I can control the diameter. And not re allowing uh small angles would be helpful in other applications. There are other applications, and it doesn't change the proof at all. So, if they omit it, the proof would be still the same. I cannot do much better. And the second property is that the set X will be what we call sinlick spread, which means that no matter what cap of radius phi I take on a sphere, that cap contains a small amount of points of my set. So I take So I take C over a mu number of points, then if I just average, on average I would get C points in each cap. And the part P says that from average you can go to maximum by paying the price of just. And the proof idea is quite standard. You take some number of points, which is larger than what I'm telling you here. So you have more points that you need. Have more points that you need. And you take a set of M points on S here, trend. So they are IID distributed according to this measurement. And then you open your favorite paper by Bolotzk and Minsch. They already took care of Partner for me. They did much more in that paper. They actually covered a sphere by spherical caps. I don't care about the colours. Caps. I don't care about the cover, I only think about the technical part. But if you read their proof, the part B falls easily. Now for part A, you do the standard argument saying that, okay, the points here are random. So I can, for every pair of points, I can estimate the probability of a property phase. And that probability is just twice the measure of the cap. And the picture. Up and the picture, underlying picture here, is that if I have a point over here, xi, then the forbidden set for xj, so that property does not fail, is a cap over here of radius phi and a cap over here also of radius phi. So for every xi, the probability that xj fails in this region, in one of these two regions, is just twice higher. And then usually what you And then, usually, what you do, you do your union bound. So, you say, I don't want the bad events to happen. But we do slightly different things. So, maybe the main moral of this approach is that if you have bad events, don't try to make sure that they don't happen, just deal with them. Life is cruel, deal with your bad events. So, how do you deal with bad events? You consider, well, the parasol bad events. The pairs of pet events, so the set B is a pair of bed events, and you have many of bad events, expectation with a set of parameters is large. So you would not have the probability being zero. So bad events would happen, but you can, instead of using the entire set Y, you can use a subset of Y. And you can show that subset of Y will have no bad events. So how that works, this bad events, they actually define a group. Bad events, they actually define a graph on your points. So if you have a set Y, I would join two points in set Y if they violated conditional. So now I have points and I have edges. That gives me a graph. I can calculate the average degree of that graph. It gives me beta analog n. And I can make sure that average degree expectation of average degree beta analog n. Of average degree 8 analog n, I can make sure that I have average degree more 16 analog n by using Markov, and then I can use the graph theoretical result. So it talks about independent number of a graph in terms of number of vertices and degrees, average degree. In other words, in terms of graph theory, it says that, or in t in our setup, it says that there is a subset of y. There is a subset of y with this many points, such that inside of that subset property A is not violated. So in entire Y, property A is violated, but in some subset it's not. And the size of subset is exactly this. So that's basically it, because you take the sub-independent set, you get the set of the size you care about, and then you. Care about, and then you use approximation for mu phi to get the big settings. You can do a bit better. You can stop here, or you can do a bit better. And a bit better would be this. And it's almost the same. So if I start flipping it fast, maybe you can spot the difference. The difference is in this log. Which, on a scale of exponent in denominator, Scale of exponent in denominator should not matter too much, but it eventually helps to get rid of get a better part. But to get this log, you need to be to do much more work. So I'm not going to tell you everything about it, but basically in this graph that you construct, you need to count triangles, how many triangles you have. It happens that you don't have many triangles compared to the number of vertices. Then you remove edges of those triangles, obtain subgraph. Edges of those triangles of that subgraph. In the subgraph, you find an independent set with even bigger size. You move back to your original graph. Your independent set is no longer independent. So you still need to modify it by the reading vertices to kind of make it work. But it gives you this extra load. So I'll use this stronger version. So let me now maybe derive the two main results and I'll The two main results, and I'll show you five more? Okay, so this g of x is we are covering a set x by balls. And we want to construct a set x on a sphere that needs at least this many balls of smaller diameter to be covered. So I will just use the lemma with a choice of phi. So I'll choose phi to be. Phi. So I'll choose phi to be 60 degrees, phi over 3. And this condition A would immediately imply that the diameter of my set is at most root 3. So I know that this set from lemma has diameter at most root 3. So I am now covering, trying to cover this set by balls of diameter root 3. But balls of diameter root 3, they intersect the entire sphere in cash. The intersection by a sphere in caps of spherical radius at most pi by 3. So every ball of that diameter would be this, would give me this cap, and I know that every such cap intersects my set in small number of points. So every pole bites off just m log n, and I have exponentially many points. And you just divide. And this is why I was fighting for this log, because I'm dividing. Why I was fighting for this log because I'm divided by n log. So I don't want to have logs in my life. I just want to have log logs. So this gives me this problem. Now, elimination. Elimination is a bit more technical, but the idea is pretty much the same. I have the set X that I can construct on a sphere, but if I want to control elimination, I need a bit more structure from that set. If I take convex hole of that set X, If I take convex hole of that set x, I can hardly, I don't know how to control the directions from which the points are illuminated. So, what instead I will be doing, I will be taking points x and for every point I will be adding the four-dimensional circle opposite to that. So, this leads to the definition of the cone. So, on a sphere, I define a cone with angle phi to Angle phi to be and center x to give this set. Basically, what it is, you take a point x on a sphere, you take a cone with half angle phi and x is going through x r. So you take like a solid cone, and then you intersect it with sphere. And so the cone intersection with sphere gives you one point in the top x and the base, which would be a smaller dimensional sphere. Be a small-dimensional sphere. So that's your set. Because we are talking still instead of diameters, we want to control the diameter of this set. And if your angle, initial angle, is at most 30 degrees, the diameter is attained between apex and the base. That's that's pretty simple. Uh what is less simple is that how it uh allows me to control how points are illuminated. How points are illuminated. And we have this level. So assume I have a cone that sits inside of the body K. So here is a picture. This is my body K outside. And inside of the body, I have this code. So I have a vertex and I have a base. And I also have that. And I also have that diameter of my body will coincide with the diameter of the core. So coal is inside of the body, but the diameter is attained actually inside of just coal. Then this lemma says that if the direction eliminates this point X in the larger value K, then X will belong to a certain cap country that might succeed. Center that might succeed. And again, it's maybe a bit too late to give the full proof, but the idea is that if the idea is that if I take the point y on the base of the cone, then yx would be diameter of the body tree. Because yx is diameter, entire body would lie Body would lie to one side of this hyperplane at the edge of togonal tolerance. Because the tire body lies to the side of this hyperplane, I can figure out the angle between our axis and the hyperplane, and the angle would be pi by 2 minus alpha. So my body should live to the bottom side of this hyperplane. Now, if I rotate y along the base, I will. The base, I would get that my body would live inside of this core determined by such hyperbolic. So my entire body lives here. So that means at point x, I still have this angle, by way to minus alpha. So if I take any direction and I hope to intersect interior, that direction should come from this cone. And that cone here. After you write this, basically, you show that this direction belongs to. So if I have this cone and I have a body with a sign diameter of cone, then I can control the angles from which the apex of the cone is illuminated. So now I take many cones. I take my set on a sphere and And those are a set of apexes, and at each apex I will construct a column, and I get the union of those codes. So you have points, circles, points, circles on the entire sphere. Under certain conditions on xi, which are this, you can still control the diameter of the sphere. I was very optimistic when I have 30 slides. But you can now put this whole construction together. Put this construction together. You choose again your angle phi correctly, x6 pi over 14, and you consider your columns. So, yeah, there is an optimization. Obviously, we took like alpha, phi, beta, and we tried to optimize it. So, it's short. But you're taking the columns with this angle. So, this is pi-bray 14. You take your set x. So, your epic is from the column. X. So your episodes from the column comes from lemma. Now you take the union of those cones. This is W. You then take diameter is still the same as diameter of cone. You take now a body of constant width that contains W, it will still have the same diameter by eggs in the result. You use the lemma that tells you that you control the angles. So I know that. So, I know that if a direction eliminates an apex of the call, then that apex should belong to a certain cap, and I know that my caps cannot bite off too many vertices. So, again, it's a bit more complicated than the case of balls, but essentially it still boils down to having caps on a surface on a sphere that intersect your set X. And I think that'll stop. And I think I'll uh stop here. I should stop here, otherwise you'll just remove me from the yeah, I'll just that just all was counterexamples to cause a conjecture I don't actually. It's a game. So I like in low dimensions. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's I don't know. It's it's it's not. So the construction is that you construct two distance. It's somehow it's it's more. It's more geometric than just combinatorial, but what you construct, you construct a set of points that allow only two distances inside of that set. So like kind of remember that the numbers are rich, I use some comparisons for those those yeah, I I'm not yeah, I'm not sure I remember but Not sure. I remember Bonarenko result because I gave a hand distance from him. So he used, he, it was quite a simple procedure, but he had to construct a set of points, a large set of points, such that inside of that set, you have only two distances. Two possible. This is two distance set. And to do that, he used some combinatorials to do that. But Johann Regina. I'll be honest with you. Hope you want to sleep. Okay, let's go now drink again. And we have the
