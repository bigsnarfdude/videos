Yeah, so I will start with something that we've heard about already in other talks, the Heatrian integrable system, which will form a kind of nice example. Well, it's of interest, of course, in many respects in its own right, but it also can be seen as an example of a larger story that. That we may partially be able to indicate towards the end, which has to do with cluster algebra structures and then spaces of stability conditions, PT enmes and things like that. But yeah, I will only be able to give you a glimpse to touch on that. So to start with something concrete, which connects also to previous talks here on this workshop, yeah, let me remind you of the future. Let me remind you of the future integral system and its integral structure. Okay, so we're talking about the Hitchin moduli space in which the space of pairs E, phi, E being holomorphic. Well, in fact, for this talk, This talk most of the time SO2 bundle on a Riemann surface. So, okay, so what we should have in mind is here is some Riemann surface we should call C, Genes G. And in general, we may want to allow tunctures on it, but only what is called regular tunctures to be specific. Okay, so here we're going to save two bundles. So here we have an SO2 bundle and here this is uh say H0 of C oops, sorry, F K and all this modulo, the natural gauge equivalence that acts on this. So I shall not go into much detail about that. We have heard about this already. We have heard about this already in previous talks. So let me also mention, as I explained in our arena, that there exists a symplectic or say some cases equivalently a causal structure on this space. And this is what And this is what we shall use. That is, of course, then the basis for making a completely integrable system out of this moduli space. And yeah, how do we discover integrability following Reiter Hijen's similar work? Here, in that case, because well, to have life and location simple, we're restricting to SO2 bundles. We can We can, from each such pair, define a quadratic differential by taking the trace of i squared. And then we can ask, okay, what's the how does the subspace look like? Sub-space looks like in the Hitchin moduli space that is defined by fixing such a periodic differential, so by fixing Q to be a given one. Well, then as Nigel Hitchin has shown, this is what gives us the structure of a torus vibration. Where, so here this is the point on the base, which is just the spacing. Just a space of quadratic differentials on our remote surface. And yeah, so a particular quadratic differential defines a point there, and over it we have a complex torus. We will describe it a little more precisely in a moment. And in order to do that, I mean here really I'm super fast, but I want to give you just the main features that are very important. That are relevant for us. The base carries a geometric structure in its own right, which is called special geometry. And what this furnishes for us is, or can be defined in this way, in terms of, say, an atlas with local coordinates were denoted A12A. Noted A1 to A D. D will be the abbreviation for the dimension here that is relevant: 3G minus 3 plus N. And we will often maybe just write A for the tuple of such coordinates. So this is one ingredient of, say, a local coordinates description of the spectral geometry, but the key element is basically some. Basically, some function f of a, which do the following for us, which is the following for us. Namely, in particular, it allows us, it allows us to describe the fibers over some cue. Well, now I think of it as a tube of A, so the A is. Of it as a tool of A's, all the A's can serve as parameters for quadratic differentials. Maybe for some subset of the base looks simply as a complex torus, which has a very explicit description into the D. So it's a quotient of the complex vector space C to the D by a lattice, which works as follows. works as follows where this tau here that is a d by d matrix which has matrix elements in the derivatives of that function f which is often say using physics jargon called the prepotential okay so now here our tori Our tori have become very concrete, and we see how they are defined in terms of basically the so-called spectral geometry, which is basically characterized by this particular function. And then this matrix defining our tori is obtained by taking derivatives. So that is one point here. And the other point is that in these coordinates, well, there's a, I mean, I can here use, say, complex. Can here use, say, complex coordinates Z, V1, which of course give us corresponding complex coordinates here on the torus fibers. And the pausal structure on the total space is then very simple with respect to these coordinates, and it is expressed by these Poisson bracket relations. Separate relations with all others. Okay, so in a sense, what we have given thereby is a description of both the complex structure, because A and Z are complex coordinates on our intermodulized space, as well as the Poisson structure, which is here explicit in the relations. So this is particularly nice and simple. In this particular system, of course. In this particular system of coordinates, and it expresses the integrable structure in a neat way. I mean, in again physics jargon, these are what is called the action angle coordinates expressing integrability of this modulus. Okay, so that is sort of basic setup. Now what I want to stress, because that's going to be used later as a setup and rotations. There is a correspondence between so let me write it on the one hand a theoretical basis for Or let me give it names in case I have to use it. So what? So here comes something that is also key object in the description of the integral structure, which I need to define. So one after the other. We have here a gigantic called sigma. It's called the spectral curve. That is the standard terminology of the use these days. So it is the space of, say, complex numbers satisfying this simple equation. So it's a double cover, well, it's a subset of the cotangent bundle of the underlying curve and can be represented. Can be represented as a double cover branched over 4g minus 4 plus 2n, I suppose, points on C. That's the spectral curve, and this plays a key role in exhibiting the integral structure, and that's the thing which appears here. So then we have the spectral curve. It has a first homology. Well, as we're now working with a branch cover, well, there is a Well, there is an evolution between the two sheets simply because here it is defined by this equation. There's this evolution symmetry between the sheets, because we can take two square roots of Q over each point of the curve, C. And then the first homology of that curve sigma decomposes into parts which are even or odd with respect. Parts which are even or odd with respect to this evolution. What is of particular interest here is the odd part. This is what we need, and this is the part for which here this is supposed to be a basis. Okay, so there's these bases, and what I want to stress or point out is that basically there's a correspondence between these basis elements and then a particular collection of functions, a1. A one to A D sorry D A one of F D A D of F right so this corresponds to this and so on. There's a precise correspondence and what is meant here by is okay, we know for example how the change of a canonical A change of a canonical basis transforms these guys. This is a symplectic transformation preserving intersection form. And this will be reflected in a transformation of the vector of these functions by the same symplectic transformation. So this just goes nicely along with each other. And yeah, we can use basically this to set up a natural labeling for the type of coordinate system. For the type of coordinate systems that we have introduced over here. These are labels by basically choices of canonical basis for H1 minus. Maybe we'll introduce shorthand for this. This is a letters before a gamma in the following. And yeah, let me point out the issue here. There can be points, or there are points here, or loci, where in fact this torus vibration and with the corresponding structures degenerates over. So this is not perfectly non-degenerate. It has, say, degenerate subnoci of n And yeah, where this happens and why this happens is easy to describe in terms of this branch covering all spectral curve. This happens when branch points collide. So, what this raises is the question whether we can basically By basically deforming it, improve the geometry to a nicer geometry which is less singular, therefore nicer in this regard. However, basically on the same space. So the goal is to look for a deformation of complex and symplectic structures, one complex parameter deformation that basically improves on these singular features. Singular features that we're having. Okay, so that brings me to the next part of the talk. Any questions so far? Can you explain the correspondence that you just erased? In words, in words. In words, yeah, in words, simply it is that you can define these ported functions A as well as B. Functions A as well as the other functions derivative of f with respect to A as periods along exactly these cycles. So this gives the representation and this gives the corresponding so now comes to the deformed guy and uh let me reduce it. And let me introduce it. So we call it M lambda. And on first side, we can do something very simple-minded, but it has something quite interesting then if you analyze the consequences more deeply. So we now, instead of a space of pairs, X pairs that we started from, we consider That we started from, we consider pairs 12 E, again, holomorphic bundle as before, but now we introduce, we replace the Higgs field by what is called lambda connections. And this is just something that locally local coordinates on the surface y, this will be local coordinate and c whenever I'm using it. C to whenever I'm using it in a convention. So it is lambda dy plus connection one form, which suggestively I also, but it's a little bit of 3D, of course, I also denote by phi of y. I'm doing this here in order sort of to indicate in a very simple-minded form why this is a deformation. Maybe if we just sort of are maybe. Just sort of are naive and send lambda here to zero, then we recover far. Okay, but of course, somehow, then, if it comes to the actual geometric structures, the story gets a bit more complicated. But in any case, yes, and there is natural age equalities again that we can consider by which we divide to get a moduli space. That's our space now, the deformed moduli space we want to work on. Good. Now we have connections, and whenever we have connections, And whenever we have connections, we want to study holotomy or monodomy. So what does it give us? It gives us a map from our, so to each such pair we can associate its monogramy. And what this defines is a representation of the fundamental group of the surface into SL2C. So that is the Character variety. And we're again here. I'm simply happy that I can refer to previous talks where this object has appeared and has been introduced. But here now for say these row two okay And then, yeah, basically, the game is now to introduce coordinates which can be thought of as the deformations of our previous coordinates. And this is what we want to then somehow base the subsequent discussion on. So, that's what I want to discuss a little bit. I cannot by any means. I cannot by any means exhaust that story here, so I have to be very intriguingistic. But let me give some ideas of how that works. So correlates on M lambda uses by monodroming map and exact what is called exactWKP. Again, this has been Again, this has been mentioned before, but okay, so let me give a few elements and a few ideas of that story, which is a nice and reasonably non-trivial story in its own right. Well, the way we've described it, there is a phi again. Higgs fields, I'm glossing here over some issues. Some issues, some subtleties like the necessity to choose a reference connection. So, this is for the experts what we need to take care of in order to be more precise. But morally speaking, here this gives indeed the correct idea that to the leading order in lambda, really our lambda connection is again just the Higgs field. So, there is a phi that describes the leading order behavior. Order behavior. I mean, it could be, you know, more generally, what I should probably have said more precisely is there should be here rather some a of lambda, which depend on lambda, and this then would have to be of the form phi of y plus o of lambda. So, with this, basically, you can describe quadrant situations like you will have to do in hierarchies. But in any case, this cloud here we take, and we again have a quadratic differential, which is essentially really the same as before. And this defines something which is called spectral network. So let me briefly say what that is. So we draw on the surface the lines. On the surface, the lines defined by the equation W equals constant, imaginary part is constant, where W is a new coordinate that I can form. Here we're taking basically the inverse of the phase of lambda in order to make this lambda dependent in an interesting way. And then we're integrating a square root of q. A square root of q, which is well defined on the spectral curve up to the point y, so the point is a new coordinate, a new local coordinate on our surface. And basically, we're taking here straight lines with respect to that new coordinate. And schematically, this will define us on the surface a graph, which looks, for example, somewhat like the following picture. So, here, these are branches. So here, these are branch points of the cover defining the spectral curve. And these here are punctures, these round old dots. And so this is a local picture of some part of this network on the thing. So one can show that in generic situation from each branch point there are two lines defined by this equation. Defined by this equation here emanating, and they will generically fall into the functions like here. But yeah, this can fall into this one, and this can also fall into this one, and so on, right? So that is a local picture, how it can look like. And okay, so then that's the network, the spectral network. And then, what you may note, I mean, this is another sort of key observation. Well, we want to get coordinates on m lambda by using coordinates on the character variety. And well, by whatever, I mean, in principle, by whatever means you find to get coordinates on the character variety, you are inducing coordinates on the You are inducing coordinates on m lambda in that way. And sort of the general idea for how to get convenient coordinates on the character variety is in principle quite simple. You would want to trivialize your connection basically locally in simply connected parts of the surface. And then the information is basically contained in the gluing across the boundaries of the simple connected parts, or the regions connecting. Regions connecting, I mean, intersections of two simply connected regions on the Riemann surface. That's the basic idea. And here, this second basic idea here of spectral network, it gives you a way to do that because it defines your decomposition of the surface into triangles in particular. So it defines a triangulation, which is basically just a dual to what we have. To what we have drawn here as the spectral network. So, for example, here we find one of the triangles of a triangulation, and that's what we can work with. Well, and now comes the third basic idea or observation, which is, of course, at the end of the day, a non-trivial theorem. Going back to Coich and Schaeffer, which has never been published, and then Viktor Nikolaev is now. Peter Nikolaev is now publishing a series of papers where proofs of these statements can be found, which says that, yeah, the parallel transport is borel summable, basically away from the lines of the spectral network. Actually, I did something bad. I mean, these lines of the spectral network should look more straight. Anyway, because these coordinates are just straight lines. These coordinates are just straight lines. All right, has Borrel summable lambda expansion? This is because I wanted to say it right here away from network. Alright, so now we have to work on. Yeah, now we have to work a little bit. There's some combinatorial aspects how you sort of assign nice and natural coordinates to such a network and so on. As a Borel-solvable lambda expansion, so I abbreviate it here lambda expansion away from the network. So, yeah, by basically combining these two things, so we want to parameterize monogramies on the one hand and on the other hand the things should be obtained by summation of the Lambda expansion that one can develop systematically and which is called WKB expansion. One can get a One can get a parameterization of the parallel transport defined by the connection. And this gives coordinates on m lambda, which are expressible in terms of something I have not the time to introduce properly. I have not the time to introduce properly that they're known as World symbols. We've seen it before. I guess Kuhai will also introduce them maybe more properly. So what's the notation here? These are then functions on our moduli space tabled by gammas, which gammas are elements in our lattice. The odd part. Lattice, the odd part of the first homology. Because they are basically obtained by integrating along cycles, by integrations along cycles that are defined by or that represent the first homology. And from that, well, just for convenience, one can also consider, of course, the exponentials of these guys, which are sometimes more convenient to work with. And one can get a convenient dependence here on the choice of. I mean, one can basically extend this from maybe a basis for the first homology to arbitrary elements of the first homology in such a way that this is basically additive with respect to these generators of the first homology. Generators of the first homology, and that we use very convenient notations. Okay, so now we've coordinates. And the key thing, and that is sort of the most beautiful, but also most language thing of this story, is to describe how this changes when we change what. So the story went basically, I mean, we were using the spectral networks in order to do boreal summation. To do Borel summation and get some nice decomposition into simply connected domains of the surface. This is the basis for the definition of coordinates. But of course, everything changes when we change either Q or lambda. Particularly because lambda appears here. Lambda matters also very importantly in that story. And yeah, so changes of Q and lambda would change the network. The network and this will change the coordinates. What's nice is it's a kind of canonical way to set up coordinates, which just depends on data that are in this way of describing connection already. Yeah, and they have very simple form. So, again, I would So, again, I will be just quick and schematic. So, the new coordinates are related to, say, the analytic continuation of the old coordinates by formulae, which look as follows. There is here some exponent given by the intersection form in H1, and there may appear in general some integer which we call omega of delta. which we call omega of delta. But otherwise the formula is uh very simple and very explicit. Okay? So what we discover at this point is basically our coordinates exhibit cluster of the bus structure. That is coordinate observation number one. And the other thing is what is defined in this way. I mean this is something that is a bit subtle to figure out, but of course it is just defined To figure out, but of course, it is just defined geometrically by what happens here in this game of spectral networks and so on. We discovered here some numerical integer data, which in fact have a very deep meaning. They're related to DT environments of some triangulated categories, in fact, which will have an interpretation. In fact, it would have an interpretation as Foucaia categories for certain local calabia. Okay, so here is a misspelled. But okay, so this is just a side remark for those who have heard about it. On the other hand, this hopefully is a kind of sufficiently self-contained geometric story about associating coordinates to spectral networks and then. Spectral networks and then understanding how the coordinates change on the changes of the basic data, on the change of the spectral network, where we simply discover: okay, there's a nice structure here, which is coming from the fact that, well, our formula for changes of coordinates have this particularly simple type. And this is, I mean, the theory of cluster algebras basically starts from something very simple. Something very similar, namely, these basically some algebraic varieties defined by local coordinates and changes of coordinates between local charts of basically exactly that same form plus blah blah blah, which I don't want to take the time to do this. Okay, so here we of course we can complete the story and in particular show that basically what we discovered here from geometry is a particular instance of modern mathematics is X-move. Instance of what the mathematics is axiomatized under the notion of cluster algorithms. Yes, sure. Is there a particular channel group you need to know that these CT engraves would correspond to some Kubernetes for your triangulation? Yeah, well, I mean, in Tom's story, actually, you are associating quivers to triangulations. Getting quivers or triangulations, you can take the triangulations to find our spectral networks, and then it's just dark. Right? Okay, so let me check time and let me just take a breath and round off sort of the second part of the talk. What I want to point out again is we want distinguish. Distinguished systems of taboo coordinates in the story. And we had emphasized in each immobilized space we get such distinguished systems of Darboux coordinates associated to canonical basis of this lattice gamma, the first epomology. And now, due to the fact that, in fact, the exact WKB. That in fact, the exact WKB establishes a relation between, or clarifies, if you want, the relation between M and M lambda and its coordinates. Of course, you inherit basically this classification of canonical bases related to canonical Dabu coordinates. And let me just introduce the necessary notations here. So, well, I mean first we had a basis for the notations for the elements of a canonical basis of gamma, which was alphas. And now, of course, we can use it here, we can use these guys in our labeling of coordinate functions. So we have associated coordinates defined in this way. Defined in this way, and then of course also cycles like this. So this is what we take, or sometimes more convenient, we shall introduce the logs of these coordinates, which are of course just what we call Vorushtims. So log of x of R. X of R. Let me note, okay. I mean, of course, now we can express them, well, having been described or defined through a tech WKB, basically makes them functions of the previous coordinates, the A's, as well as lambda, which look as follows. So the leading part here of the asymptotic expansion will come here the 1 over lambda, and then comes here the AR plus higher alternative. R plus higher order terms. The relation, which is some points worth keeping in mind, and here we've better are identified here derivatives of the prepotential order. So this again basically is a way to clarify the relation and sort of how the labeling of our coordinates inherits a canonical. Canonical, I mean, the the labeling coming from the first model. Good. So this closes sort of the second part, which is sort of about geometry. I mean, the deformation of our modular space M into something which is less singular, in some respects, more nice object, well, more nice in terms of what a space now has, a complex structure defined by saying these coordinates are holomorphic with respect to this complex structure, as well as a symplectic structure. Structure, as well as a symplectic structure, which in fact would be again here very simply expressed in terms of these coordinates for some recognition species. But yeah, the definition of these coordinates turns out to extend over the singular loci where previously we had singularities in the heat-chain vibration. So, in this sense, the geometric structures have improved. Improved. So now we want to use this to define tau functions. That's the next step. Somehow, completely reverting the logic indicated by history, we sort of present the definition from the end, namely from a characterization which has been obtained quite recently, which is nice. Which is nice and telemetric in nature. Good. Let me first note slightly sort of the key rap results in a very schematic nutshell. We have two holomorphic symplectic manifolds that we have to be talking about, which was Mλ and the character. Characteriety which are related by the monogramy map. The two key properties for our purpose, which are mathematical theorems in sufficiently many cases, are this is a local bypolomorphism and uh secondly it's uh symplectic or depending on the case uh at least uh Depending on the case, at least of course basic results that of course now are fundamental for the following. What does it give us? I mean now let us pick the boot coordinates with respect to the natural syntactic forms on these two spaces. So here I don't explain how this is. I don't explain how this is done in practice, but of course we know abstractly that they must exist locally for m lambda, we call them u and v. And for the character variety, well we have introduced them already. This is our sigmas, well I should not have erased them so big, but these are our sigmas and etas. which ultimately were represented as boris symbols. Well, having done all these, there is an object that also has appeared in previous talks, which is called generating function. The generating functions in the sense of just simple epic geometry and that will be in the local port. That will be in the local porous we're using a function of three types of variables. We take half of these variables, we take another half of the other variables, and for later use we introduce here notation for coordinates on the moduli space of C. So we ultimately want to vary also the complex structure, the underlying surface. Surface. So, this is sort of the key pair we want to introduce, which will in a minute turn out to be actually our tau function. But it's the generating function of the monotromy symplectomorphism that we're interested in. And well, the defining equation basically is that ds gives us primitives for the respective symplectic forms, and I'm And I'm here treating slightly by suppressing pullbacks and so on. So just automatically take it, for example, to be this. So the choice here of these primitives basically then defines me in s, this function s, by integrating this one form. Okay. Okay. This is just what we call a generating function. In other words, it is defined by a system of partial differential equations like ds by du is v and maybe ds by the eta are index indices here is r. But it's defined by what? Well, the The monogramy map and then canonical, I mean, the choices of coordinates which are not quite canonical, but which are very, say, of a very restricted type and very natural in this context. And here comes sort of the main player. Here now finally comes the tau function. It's not yet clear that it deserves the tau function, but let me define it anyway. And then tell you why it deserves the tau function. So we consider it as a function of sigma and eta instead. We're basically just defining it by taking here s and expressing your u variable in our generating function as function of sigma eta z which is defined as the through the solution of the equations d eta s equals minus sigma. So by solving this equation, we can express our coordinates u as function of the coordinates on the character variety or monotromy data, and thereby produce something that only depends on coordinates for monotromy data, coordinates for the character variety. And well, Z is a dependence we want to keep track of. To keep track of why, because this is now crucial for exhibiting this y or the s tau function in the traditional sense. And here, what we can refer to as a theorem of Kerkela Hikolotkin was based on a conjecture or inspired by a conjecture of its use of EM2P. Peter Nikrasov has a related result. When we differentiate with respect to these z variables, this finds us a new set of functions on our moduli space, m lambda. And these are guys that are known from the theory of completely integrable systems, namely the integrable non-autonomous systems defined by the isomonodromic deformations of. Of holomorphic connections. So here's some story that I have to skip. The story being very roughly, very quickly, you can, well, remember, we had a connection here, which was our lambda connection. When we vary the complex structure, we can ask how we need to vary A such that To vary A such that the monogamy stays constant under this variation. Turns out that the flows which are defined in this way are Hamiltonian. They can be expressed as Hamiltonian flows with respect to certain functions on our moduli space. And the statement here is that the functions that we're extracting here from the tau function by taking derivatives are exactly the Hamiltonian. Exactly, the Hamiltonians generating isomorphic flows are isomonodromic Hamilton. Okay, so that is the key statement here. And so let me construction depends on the choice of coordinates U and P on the coordinates? On the coordinates like UI and Power. Yes. Yes? I mean, okay. Uh all these guys are local coordinates and the claim here would be that there is an atlas covering the moduli space in which I can choose these coordinates as my preferred coordinates. That's basically all I need. Well, and furthermore, somehow, yeah, this this covering is defined basically by the business of the spectral network, right? Because this was the data, and this was defined by the Q, the quadratic differential, and the quadratic differential, okay, and Tom's theory is what represents points in the space of stability conditions. So, this is how we make everything, say, be dependent on. Be dependent on the stability data if we think in terms of DT theorem. Okay, I'm a bit too slow, but nevertheless, maybe I can get somewhere. Let me know if there's a canonical line bundle here. Canonical line bundle which is defined from the setup. Maybe we can consider again changes of ordinance. Just abstract these sigma eta into sigma prime eta prime and well then there's a similar I mean again there's a generating function for that only I skip that so the generating function defined by the same idea as before then we get yeah any change of coordinate Yeah, uh any change of coordinates um has a between say About coordinates for a Poisson manifold has a generating function defined by these ideas. So a change of coordinate sigma eta to sigma prime eta prime has a generating function, which I can choose to be a function of eta and eta prime. I call it w. And as I mean by the definition, I mean, by the definition of the tau function, this basically implies. I mean, through the generating function here, here we can now just do the exercises in Poisson geometry to see what happens if we change coordinates sigma and eta. And what that implies is that it implies the transformation of our co-functions that we're defining this way. By the equation of the following form of sigma and eta. Of course, I assume that sigma prime, eta prime, and sigma eta are related by a holomorphic map on the overlap of the respective domains of definition. And here plus W of E. Uh and here plus w of eta eta prime. Uh the canonical line bundle is simply obtained by making this here by I wanted to intro advertise introducing a canonical line bundle. I call it L. L. Call it L. L should have transition functions e to the w. Oh no, actually, what appears here is the e to the w the tau is the exponential of s. Okay, so Okay, so let's sum up. We have noticed that symplectic geometry gives us a nice way to introduce, I mean, canonically basically defines an object we call tau function through generating function of the monogramism plectomorphism of the theorem of Bertola Gorkin says identifies it with the idea. Identifies it with the isomodomic tau function in the sense of completely integral systems. And there is a canonical line bundle with transition functions e to the w, w being generating functions associated to it, where of course then somehow the tau function can be considered as a natural holomorphic section of that line bundle introduced in this way. So, this is what from a tree piece of. So, this is what dramatry eats us. And at this point, maybe not writing it down on the board, I want to stress that we had on the way seen a relation in a very special case, in a very special instance, to gadgets called DT environs, which were these numerical data describing changes of coordinates of the special form coming from the spectral networks. And that appears to be part of a much larger story that a particular Richland from Richland is developing. Richland from Richland is developing. So, schematically, the way it works is to start from some theory of dt environments or a definition of dt environments and try to make geometry out of it. So, the slogan of this program is also geometry from the t-invariance. So, the way it works is basically to use these environments, which were called omega, in order to define a Riemann-Hilbert-type problem. Riemann-Hilbert type problem, when well solved, defines something called joy structure. Joy structure, which is some special structure. The important observation that he made on the way in this program is that it defines a complex hyperkelar structure very naturally. And sort of the most recent step that he took is to observe that then in this context there is a natural tau function, which if you specialize to the dt invariance that came just from the change of coordinate formula on our story. Of coordinate formula on our story here. If you specialize it to this, then his story gives, reproduces the tau function we've just introduced and we've just defined. And so in this sense, this story is a special case of a much larger and very nice and deep story associated with Donaldson-Thomas theory. Good, so I think I. Good, so I think I started a few minutes late, so I want if it's okay to spend the last ten minutes on giving you a glimpse in what sense or what else the tau functions have to teach us, in what sense they represent kind of universal generating functions for various kinds of interesting objects, in particular enumerative environments. Oh yeah, so just we put it down here. So yeah, let me put it down here. The slogans of what I want to sell you is the tau functions are sort of universal for mode generating functions at the indicator of what type of truth. Well, there's different types of information in the tau function. One you can exhibit by, for example, looking at asymptotics or expansions. Asymptotics or expansions with respect to various of their arguments. And the other is of global nature. And basically, we have seen the global thing already. It was led to the very definition of the tau functions in our approach here in this talk. So let us now start by looking at today asymptotics and sort of the key observation, which is quite non-trivial and quite amazing still, and really, I think, is the key. And really, I think is the key to sort of many of the deeper aspects of this theory: is that these tau functions admit series expansions of the following form. So we have something here over a lattice to the 2π i taking the f part. So we don't know about n eta, so vector in the eta, so the vector is the standard. And then, okay, the coefficients, this is just Fourier expansion, but the Fourier coefficients are of a very special form, where the end dependence is just the shift of one argument. Note we have here this pair of, say, conjugate coordinates. The eta is explicitly only here, this only depends on sigma, and so therefore we have somehow separated these two dependencies here. Dependencies here. This here is something that in the quality 6 case was conjectured by gamma Ulobov and Lisovy, often referred to either as GI GL or as PF formula. Well, that's where Cruy discovered it. And well, however, okay, then there came various proofs, and in some sense each proof reveals some extra layer of interesting meaning. Proofs are based on conformal field theory or on relation to Mikrasov partition functions and so on. So there's a whole series of proofs by now. And yeah, now the claim is: okay, this was typically in Juno zero situations. The claim we're making here is that in the Making here is that in the framework we have developed, it's a rather general statement that you can make of this type. And yeah, let me just stress, this is truly amazing to be still here. So to give you some indication what it contains is, for example, we can consider the log of what is here and what I claim, and I cannot even. And what I claim, and I cannot even sort of write it down, write down, so instead of F, I'm not going to write down the formula precisely, but claim this, I can then also expand it in a series kind of double series. I don't have the time to introduce all the necessary notations here, but important is it's a lambda, a series in lambda, and then basically the q's are Are just, well, repackaging of sigma. And what appears here is the coefficients are things called Romo-Witten environments. Of what? So there are some local colabiels here behind the game related by mirror symmetry. So we're summing here over beta and H2. Better on the page two of X and say, okay, the easier way of introducing this calabill is here sort of on the mirror dual side by some Goford equation of the form W squared plus Q of 1. It's the same Q as before, right? So we're thereby, okay, we have your four variables, one equation, so it's a three-dimensional local collabion. So, relation to Gromov Wood here by basically the Ginus expansion, the formal lambda expansion of that object. Just that is already one sort of nice thing that this tau function contains, and it is revealed through, well, the step of expanding it and thereby defining the z from the tau. The z from the tau. It's equivalent information, right? You can observe, it can be inverted, you can get tau from z and z from tau. Okay, can I take a few more minutes and I can say a few more remarks that you may or may not find interesting. Good, so this is one aspect and it's just sort of an example. There's maybe other expansions one could study. There's maybe other expansions one could study. The other aspect, of course, we have introduced the tau function as a global object. That is what I really want to stress. And in the definition of this global object, it was coming from the change of coordinates on our space m lambda. And ultimately, the key data for describing these changes of coordinates were these Columbus and Thomas environments again. So Robot behavior. And here I want to sort of highlight two things. Okay, I said maybe just schematically repeating what I wrote before, tau prime is e to the w tau. This was sort of on the one hand defining transition functions in that line table and so on. Now so what is it determined by? So what is it determined by? The two interpretations of these. Well, I mean, I stressed already the T environance on the way. And some very nice way of understanding why tau functions or partition functions that are defined from the Z, taking, I mean, you can revert the logic, right? You take this as a formal series you want to start from, building a formal series. From building a formal series for that, and then, however, of course, you have to make sense out of well, summation of that formal series, which is a highly meltible story. So you can look for maybe some summations, parallelizing oral summation of that formal lambda expansion. And well, that's a good story. You will hear about that in Kurai's talk later, I believe. I want to. I want to, and what he, together with Marcus Morindo, have recently pointed out, so the following nice interpretation basically of this jump formula in relation to the summation or the theory of resurgence of that asymptotic series, namely that the W's described basically the stokes jumps. In the Stokes terms of this putative summation of F. And what this is related to in the physics applications is the description of non-perturbative effects through d-brains. Well, d-brains are described by objects in some by the category of Either category of coherent sheaves or Foucault category. And in the case relevant here, this would be just the things counted by the DT environments. And this is creating a relation here. And this is why this can have an interpretation of this form, namely that the non perturbative effects describe the Stokes jumps of the resurgence of that of that former series. Of that follow series. That is the recent work of Kohai and Marcus that we'll hear more about later. And second, that's a completely different direction. You can also have heard in this conference about relations between bromoflujin and TT environments in the talk of Hulia, and Kerek will also give a talk in this afternoon. Give a talk in this afternoon on a related theme, on a way to understand such correspondences, which quite directly applies, I think, to this class of examples. And basically there, instead of counting brains or objects in some Foucault single objects in some Foucault category, there's a dual interpretation as counting holomorphic disks. However, where Disks everywhere in our moduli space M, and it is the counting of the holomorphic disks which in the SYZ mirror symmetry is made precise by work of Siebert, Eddie Ow, and then many others. Yeah, it is the counting of holomorphic disks which leads to the construction of the mirror, and say in this particular class of example. And say in this particular class of samples, these environments, the DT environments, would be the environments counting the same disks. So if we make this here and this way, it would be very simple here. Or the moduli spaces and okay, now we really have turbulent over time. If we want, there's a remark. But let me just stop here and all other things we can discuss in smaller hours. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for this talk. So, other questions, comments? I guess as how careful they will take its version of M correctly, you're modular. I guess there's some expected as well as the vibration of this thing. I was wondering if do you know for are there particular choices in your setup where you can bring all the similarities together or push them all out to infinity? Or does this depend on what kind of choices in your choice? Yeah, yeah, okay. So this is, I think, Okay, so this is, I think, related to something we started discussing the other day. I think that for continuation of the discussion. I mean, I believe it is related just to that what so far has been discussed from the Virusentry point of view is space of stability structures that appeared here, a relatively special locus. In general, you have in this story, according to Bridgeman, Richmond Smith. According to Bridgeman, Richmond Smith, stability structures are parametrized by the choice of compact structure of underlying Riemann surface and the choice of differential on it, which would be some 6G minus 6 dimensional space. And yeah, of course, then there are very interesting loci where perhaps the description of all this business simplifies and you have particular coordinates and so on. And I think for the precise comparison, indeed, obviously. Offices where exactly in this larger space where we're totally not an expert in this. A few words, please target you get context about fraud or ten minutes yesterday, but okay, yeah, sure. As cow functions, yes, no, this is a very important clarification to do. Tow function is a The tau function is a rather ubiquitous object in the theory of intrinsical models and of course it has many different descriptions, definitions. Yeah, it's not an easy question, ultimately. There is the, for example, well, what Volodia had been explaining us was to how Had been explaining us was to how to describe, for example, things like a p-tau functions in terms of something related to the description of Siegel and Wilson in terms of infinite grass magnumins. There is a unified uniform framework in which both this tau function and one of Ologia appear, which would be provided exactly by the Siegel-Wilson infinite expression. By the Siegel-Wilson, Infinite Crassmannian, or Sato, that's the original name to mention here. However, there are differences, right? So, for example, this is a tau function with finitely many times, whereas the Kp tau functions have infinitely many times. The way to uniformize it or unify it that I know the best uses sort of the relation to conformal field theory that Voltier has hinted at, where it can be described in terms of three fermion-conformal blocks. In terms of three fermion-conformal blocks. So these finite get-tau functions Wologia was talking about, they correspond to free fermion, conformal blocks of a single species of free fermions on a Riemann surface. Here, these would be conformal blocks of two species of free fermions twisted by the local system. So that is sort of the new feature which enters when you have, which can enter when you want to introduce mon A new. When you want to introduce mon-A Bionness into the story, if you have two free fermions, I mean the VOA of two free fermions, it has an automorphism which is given by GLNC group, and you can use it to twist the conformal blocks by local systems, just saying that you can prescribe the monodrome that makes
