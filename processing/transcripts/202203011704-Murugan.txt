Can you can you share your screen? Yes. If there will be some noise, yeah, I'll press it. Can you hear me? Yes. Yeah. So, hi, I am Sugan, grad student of some. Um, grad student of Samriti Sankara at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, India. Uh, thank the organizers for giving me this opportunity to talk at this workshop. Today, I shall talk about the recent work we have done with my Prophet Samridi and others entitled Many Body Chaos in a Thermalized Flow. So, to give a broad overview. So, to give a broad overview, so the study is about many body chaotic Hamiltonian systems, a classical one. So, to introduce, we know that many body chaotic Hamiltonian system has two disparate effects in itself. Namely, the equilibriation, which says given under most of the initial conditions, the system would eventually settle down. System would eventually settle down into a state which has a steady state, stationary equilibrium, and which is whose statistics are described by the thermodynamics of thermodynamical functions, say temperature, entropy, and so on. On the other hand, the same system will have the chaotic part, which can be diagnosed using tools like, say, Lyapunov exponents, the butterfly speed. Exponents, the butterfly speed, the perturbation spectrum across the domain, and column graphs in entropy, and so on. So, any manybody Hamiltonian chaotic systems has this respect, two different disparate effects that we want to reconcile in the study. So, the open questions that arise is: how are these two different effects connected? So, how are the temperature, the thermodynamical variable, is connected to the Variable is connected to the Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic system. So, how does the transport of say a perturbation at one point is transported across the domain in a say strongly correlated systems, be it classical or be it quantum? And so, is there a unifying mechanism which underlies the thermalization part, the ergodic part, and the equilibriation part of a many body system? So, based on these open questions, Based on these open questions, recent in years, both classical and quantum systems have been studied. For example, frustrated and frustrated magnets in condensed matter and strongly correlated field theories and black hole field theories in say high energy physics. So such systems have been studied to reconcile between the both thermodynamical part and the chaotic part of a many body chaotic system. Part of a many body chaotic system. So, to give a quick overview in the quantum part, the study is majorly done by developing the so-called OTOCs. So, in other words, it's just called out-of-time model correlators, commutators, and which bridges a gap between that thermodynamic temperature part and the butterfly effect. So, these are the references. And since there is less time, I'll just quickly give a slide. Less time, I'll just quickly give a slightest hint of what this OCs are. So, suppose we have two operators, V and W. So, we might even take, say, momentum and position. So, it says if you change the position at zero, and then what is the operator momentum feels about the system after a time set in time t. So, that's what is this OTOC trying to capture. Trying to capture. So, this two states psi one and psi two, which kinds of has this ordered in different positions W and V or any two operators kind of captures how the perturbation is spreading. So essentially the OTOC will people will study it as how it is exponentially grown and the exponent of the growth determines the Lyapunov exponent is closely related. Lyapunov exponent is closely related as the Lyapunov exponent, and the OTOC is a thermal average, which means it is taken at a temperature inverse temperature beta or temperature T. So how the lambda varies as a function of temperature is a broad study. Striking result is a conjecture and proof for quantum systems by Maldasina and 16 is that the lambda Lyapunov exponent of a many body chaotic system. Of exponent of a many-body chaotic system, a quantum system is bound from above by this particular form, temperature over H bar, the Planck's constant. So no system can have a Lyapunov X-Men faster than this bound, and people have found systems which have exactly the Lyapunov X-Men same as the bound. So that's a quick overview in the quantum part. Let's switch to classical, which we are interested in. Classical, which we are interested in. So, analogous to OTOC, the out of 10 core commutators, what is the right thing to ask for a classical many body system? So, the answer that people have seen is the decorators. So, decorators are nothing but very closely related to how we measure, say, two copies of a many body system, nearly identical, but differing by a But differing by a very tiny perturbation, and how do they evolve into how do they evolve spatio-temporally different? So, that is how the decorators capture. And to give a quick idea, so let's look at this famous paper by say Abhijit Das and others in 2018, which takes a 1D simple spin model. So, suppose we have a set of Uh, suppose we have a set of n spins in periodic boundary conditions, and the interaction is neighbor. Each spin talks to its nearby spin, and the Hamiltonian is given as such, and the dynamics is given by the Poisson brackets. So now, as I said, to study the decorators between these two systems, so here in this study, people have taken at infinite temperature. So, infinite temperature allows us to take any random configuration is equally possible. So, as shown in the figure, So, as shown in the figure, suppose system A is taken and then you rotate one spin, say X equal to zero. So, by rotating that spin infinitesimally, and then you create another system, so which is also a temperature infinity. So, now how do these systems differ? At t equal to zero, they will differ only at the x equal to zero spin. All the other spins are naturally the same. So, d of x, t would be a point, and as evolves, as evolved by the dynamics. As evolved by the dynamics, the change would slowly spread across the system and it will be felt everywhere. So, here are the results from the paper. The important thing to notice is the spread of perturbations in the form of light cone as shown in the right-hand side of the figure. So, at t equal to zero, we have a perturbation introduced only at x equal to zero, and as we see at later on, it spreads. See at later on, it spreads all over the domain. And so, this was done by taking the ensemble average over different ensembles. And the left-hand side figure is a reduced form of d of x of t, the decoration function, which is taken in logarithmic so that we see a straight line and showing the Lyapunov exponent. And also a velocity. Butterfly velocity, which is clearly seen in this light. T V, which is clearly seen in this light cone spread, which is affecting other areas. So, in similar lines, just as classical Heisenberg spin chains, people have studied other spin liquids, Duffing chain, Heisenberg magnets, 2D anisotropic XXZ models in condensed matter and statistical physics. So, now in the justice in quantum, we have this. Just as in quantum we have this bound. So, what is the current scenario in classical many-body systems relating the Lyapunov exponent to the thermodynamical temperature? There is a conjecture by Kuchan in 18 that based on dimensional arguments on phase-page dynamics that the lambda will be bound as the square root of temperature for most of the many body systems. This was a conjecture by Kulchang. Systems. This was a conjecture by Kurchan. So we try to explore this conjecture in a turbulent flow. So because the primary temptation is that classical turbulent flow, Navier-Stokes turbulence is a classical many body system. So why not apply these? It is non-local, it has the chaotic characteristics, it has intermittency, it's all that we want in a classical many body system. So why not? Want in a classical many-body system, so why not try this in a turbulent flow? But the problem is, it doesn't have a Hamiltonian structure, as we know, it's a driven dissipative system. The presence of viscosity makes it dissipative, and we need to force it to keep a steady state solution. So, it doesn't have a Hamiltonian structure. So, if you have to study such a connection between thermodynamics and Lyapunov, the chaotic part, so we need to. Part. So we need to take, say, inviscid hydrodynamical systems, but the inviscid hydrodynamical systems, 3D Euler, Burgers, Invisible, have problem on its own. It doesn't have a statistically stationary equilibrium. Even existence of solutions is a major topic. So to study invisible system, the way would be to like say a variation of the PDEs, but still. CDEs, but still having retaining those non-linear chaotic characteristics, but it should be in an equilibrium. So, one thing that was known for a long time is that from the works of Lee Kreischner and Oszak in early 50s and 70s, that if you take Euler equations and spectrally truncate at a particular wave number k max, say, so then the resulting solutions in finite time will exhibit absolute equilibrium, which is like. Equilibrium, which is like allowing equipartition of energy across all the modes. So, whatever coordinating is conserved, that will be equally distributed to all the modes. That's absolute equilibria. And that will be our primary model to study this relation between temperature and Lyapunov exponent. So, coming into the arena, that so the model would be: so, we will study the 3D incompressible Euler and 3D incompressible Euler and 1D inviscid Burgess equations under Galerican truncation. So we are not able to, we cannot study the Navy Stokes under this circumstances, but rather we can study 3D Euler and inviscid burgers under the truncation. So in left, we know the actual PDEs and right I have written down the Galerican truncated PDEs. So since it's truncation, the PDEs are actually simply finite-dimensional ODEs in spectral space. dimensional ODEs in spectral space. So the number of equations would be order of kg for the 1D equations, for the 3D equations would be order of say kg cube. So these equations are studied numerically and as I said these solutions do produce thermalized solutions in finite time and that it has been studied on the context of studying the PDE itself by people like Samriti in the case of Burger. Case of burgers and chicheloves and brashi in the case of Euler. So they have reported on the possible thermalization behavior and how it grows out to produce fully thermalized solutions. Rather, we'll stick about, we'll stick to the fully thermalized solutions. We'll not worry about how it started and how it reached. So taking fully thermalized solutions, to have a quick overview, I'll show you the velocity. Velocity in the 1D burgers. So you can see the blue solution is the right weak solution for the 1D burgers, inviscid burgers, which has shocks as we know. But rather, if you look, take a truncated burgers equation, it doesn't produce any shocks. It has solutions which are differentiable up to all time and it is fully thermalized, as you can see in the red one. And the spectrum is equipartition, so all modes are equally. Is equipartition so all modes are equally valid, so it has a k to the power zero spectrum, whereas the truncate the actual weak solution is shown in the blue, which has a k minus squared spectrum. So the velocity, it has a equipartition and Gibson distribution, which means the velocities are the probability distributions of the velocities are highly Gaussian with its standard deviation equal to the defining the temperature of the system. Defending the temperature of the system, which is proportional to the energy. So that was Bergerson. This is a figure from a paper from FARGE, which shows you the isosurfaces of vorticity field in a normal Navy stroke system on the left and then a truncated oiler on the right. You can see there is no structure in the truncated oil, thermalized solutions. So it's just purely of whiteness because all the modes are. Purely of whiteness because all the modes are equally active. It has a K-square spectrum because it's in 3D. So showing you the PDS, where, as I said, it falls into a perfect Gaussian. The red ones are the Euler and the blue one is the burgers. So it's fitted onto a Gaussian, the probability distribution of this fully thermalized solutions. So we'll take these as the models and study the decorrelators, as I said in the spin systems. So this is the paper that we have. So, this is the paper that we have, this work is about. So, moving on, let's define the decorators in this context. So, we have terminalized velocity field. I make a copy of it by adding a small perturbation. It doesn't matter how we add the perturbation. So, to explore all the more possibilities in real space, which is in real space for the 3D system, which I'll show it in red, and the blue corresponds to the. Red and the blue corresponds to the 1D burger system. So in the 3D system, I give the perturbation locally in real space, whereas in the burgers, I give the perturbation in the Fourier space. So it's local in real space. So at say x equal to 0, it is added. And then I study the difference field for both 3D and 1D systems. So it's just Systems. So it's system B minus system A. And appropriately, there is, I take the L2 norm of the difference field. So integrated over the whole domain. So we have a periodic domain for the simulations. So that's a capital Phi of T. That's some of this L2 L2 norm over the domain. And then the radial decoulator, I define it as integral over a shell of radius R so that we can study this special. So that we can study the spatiotemporal characteristics of how the perturbation is spin. So I have perturbed at x equal to zero, say the center of the cube, a periodic cube, and then we see how that perturbation is affected to all other parts of a thermalized fluid. So since because of less time, I'll talk only about the Euler system. Burgers follows as it's a 1D system. So we can. We can try to like arrive at some analytical results based on this decorators because, first of all, it is a thermalized fluid, then the statistics are far more simpler than the actual Navy-Stokes turbulence, which is quite tedious. But in the thermalized fluid, everything is known, everything is Gaussian, so the things can be worked out easily. And we are looking in a periodic queue. So by simply subtracting, say, the evolution equations for like system A and system B. For, like, system A and system B, and then taking a L2 norm of it, not an L2 norm, just a mod square of it, it shows you the first equation. So we can, it's at this point, we cannot look at anything, but the one thing is to notice the second term is a huge divergence term. It's a big divergence term. So, if you integrate it over the periodic domain, it vanishes. So, that so once you integrate the left-hand side, that is. Integrate the left-hand side, that is nothing but the decorrelator that I have defined a few slides behind. So what we can study is that, so by defining the second equation, the derivative of the decorator is of this expression, which is the difference field delta V dot the strain matrix of the velocity field dotted with the velocity field lighting. So the strain tensor is sandwiched between The strain tensor is sandwiched between these different fields, and this is the and averaged over the whole domain. I mean, integrated toward the whole domain. That's why the last term vanishes. All the other terms vanish. Otherwise, so if we expect a exponential growth of a decorator, then analytically, one could define a lambda s by dividing the above equation by 5. So, note that there is a negative sign in the front. So, later, this assumption. So, how does this relate to the numeral? How does this relate to the numerical results of the lambda, actual lambda that we see in the decor literacy scene? So one could move one could move forward and then like decompose this equation because a strain tensor is a nice tensor which has eigenvectors and eigenvalues and which are orthogonal. So one could decompose the difference Decompose the difference field along the along three eigen directions at every point and write this equation in this fashion. And then what it says is since we know in incompressible fluid the sum of eigenvalues is zero at any point, that would mean the alpha i's, the direction coefficients of the difference field along these three directions cannot be arbitrary as the field itself. The field itself. So, in order to give a positive term on the right-hand side of the equation, we need to have, say, we need to understand that the alpha 3 has to be more preferential. I ordered it in this order so that alpha 1 is gamma 1 is a compressional extension eigen direction, and then gamma 2 is extension intermediate, and gamma 3 is the compressional one. So, because of the negative sign, gamma 3 is already negative. sine gamma 3 is already negative. So we need to we should be able to see preparential element of the difference field along the compression ligand direction so that the right hand side of the above equation is positive. So and then the decorator grows over space. Of course at long times decorators will not grow. There is a finite domain. This whole two systems systems A and systems B will get completely decorrelated. It will saturate. But in the initial times when they grow exponentially this When they grow exponentially, this has to be true. So then, since it's a thermalized fluid, not a turbulence, thermalized fluid statistics are fairly simpler. One could write it over and then get the dependence of the lambda, which would be based on the dependence of the eigenvalues, say gamma one or gamma three, on the freedom parameters of the system. The parameters of the system are simply the temperature at which we take a thermalist fluid. At which we take a terminalist fluid, and also the degrees of freedom, which must be fairly large to call a terminal body system. So, these are the analytical predictions that we can make with these equations. And then let's move to the results that I'll show from now. The plot here is showing a section of a thermalized fluid, a 3D incompressible oiler thermalized fluid. So, as you can see, So as you can see at different times, at t equal to 0.3 is the left hand side and 0.7 is the right hand figure. The decorrelation which is introduced at x equal to 0, the center of the cube is spreading slowly and then it is capturing the whole domain eventually. In a moment, I'll explain what this inset is about, but the inset is the same figure as the left-hand one, but rescaled to a different values. As you can see, the Scale to a different values. As you can see, the color bar ratings are different. It is to show some sort of kind of self-similarity growth in the decorator because of the nature of the Euler equations. So I'll come back to that part. But before that, the main result is: how does this decorator fight the local and the global one? I mean, when I take the L2 norm whole over the domain, I integrate it over the domain, then it is the global decorator. And if I just A global decorator, and if I just integrate it over a shell at R, and then that is a radial decorator. And the blue curve shows for the bogus one. And in the semi-log plot, we see a clear exponential growth of the decorators until it saturates at later times. So there is also a dotted line, which is numerical evolution of the linearized equation. Equations for the decorator. So, here I have written the linearist equation where I subtract them and then order delta v square terms are neglected and only linear terms are there. And of course, the linear equation agrees with the actual decoration equation for initial times and then it keeps growing exponentially. And in the insert, I have shown the global decorator in the dark red color, which is also exponential with the Color, which is also exponential with the same lambda, and the fact that we derive this lambda s which is based on the strain formula that if I showed you a few slides back. And then the daughter line is the exponent found in this exponential growth. And the other line is the lambda s that we have conjectured to have that form. To have that form, so it agrees very well with the experiment that we found, and later on, it even goes to zero by itself because I mean, the file cannot grow beyond a certain time. So, okay. So, that's a growth of a decorator. Then, if you look at the exponents of these exponent growth of the decorators, we get the, we call them lambda, the Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponents, and as conjectured, it does follow a root T dependence. So, as we vary the temperature, when we do the simulations for different thermalized fluids, both 3D and 1D, with different temperatures and different degrees of freedom. So, the lambda by NG is plotted against temperature in log-log plot, which shows you a clear straight line. shows you a clear straight line showing that showing the proof of the conjecture and numerical proof of the conjecture and also analytical proof that i have given for this particular classical many body system so this is the main result of the paper in both analytical and numerical part so as i said earlier in the radial correlator uh it is interesting to see that uh because of the That because of the pressure term in the Euler, there is a non-local contribution to it. So, even if you make a perturbation at x equal to zero, unlike for the spin systems and other systems which are having non-linear terms, chaotic, which are chaotic, but they don't have non-local, the interaction is only nearby, but rather because of the pressure term in the Euler, the interaction is non-local. So, the perturbation at X. non-local so the perturbation at x equal to zero immediately affects every other place uh in a finite in in within uh as soon as the evolution is uh started so that's why we kind of see a self-similar growth so these two plots are for the section of the decolators at different times and by rescale by appropriate factor they do look very similar and that allowed us to Allowed us to sort of guess an empirical form for the radial decorator as shown above. So, as we saw that all the radial decorators have the same lambda, but how do they are spread in R? So, in time they have temporal spread, which is exponential in radial directions. Because of the cell similarity, we see a power law. So, shown here is a plot of the radial decorator compensated with the Compensated with uh several meetings. Yes, I'm done. These are my last slides. So we see a radial power law confirming the empirical result. So and the other thing is that also DNS, we have studied the preferential alignment of this different spheres along the compressional eigen direction, as we can see the alphas, PDFs were plotted. Alpha's PDFs were plotted clearly. The red one, the compression direction, is being more preferred than the other two directions near alpha squared equal to one. So I'll skip this over. And coming to the conclusions, so in the using this thermalized fluid, we have studied the temperature dependence of the Lyapunov exponent in one format of a classical hydrodynamical systems, even for different dimensions. Even for different dimensions, three-dimensional Euler or one-dimensional burgers, even under different compressibility criteria, the 3D is incompressible, whereas the burgers was compressible. And this square root bound is consistent with the numerical results of classical spin-liquid study and which was established in numerical basis. Okay, now the final part is to say that, of course, we can, there should be a way to Should be a way to encourage these ideas for a spontaneously stochastic Navier Stokes turbulence. So, this is a part of our ongoing work. I'll just rush through it. So, in the background, we are like a lot of other characteristics of chaos and Navistox turbulence is already established in terms of, say, predictability of the flow, relating intermittency. Relating intermittency in the Navy-Stokes turbulence to the chaos in the Navi-Stokes equations. And the major question, or one of the questions that people are interested in, is the Reynolds number scaling of the Lyapunov exponents. Is it really half as the K41 theory suggests or is it, can it be modeled by the multifractal spectrum given the multifractal spectrum D of H? And several DNSs as I shown in the reference. Shown as I shown in the references, I've studied this and found alpha to have a value greater than 0.5, saying that the Lyapunov exponents grow faster than the inverse of the Kolmogorov time scale should. So we have this ongoing work. We have introduced the same decoulators for the Navi-Stokes turbulence, and similar results hold for these also, apart from the fact that we have a viscous term added to it and then. To it, and then now, then we have another tool, uh, inverse time scale, say lambda s and lambda nu to study upon. And this was a preliminary result showing the agreement of the above result. So, the final lambda is the sum of the lambda from the strain part, and the sum of the lambda from the diffusive part. So, the diffusive part is negative, the strain part is positive, and the sum is agreed with the actual Leipranovic studied in the system. Studied in the system. So, yeah, so that's the end of my talk. I'll be, I can take questions. Thank you for the opportunity. So, I think we already moved directly to the discussion, so we just start with the last talk, the discussion, and then we go to the first and to the second talk. So maybe I have I have a question. So if I understood correctly, so you uh you focus on a s stationary state for the Quadurkian truncated order equations. So I wonder what is the physical meaning of this or Physical meaning of this object because it seems to be far beyond the validity of this calochian approximation? Yes, as a thermalized fluid, it is not a physically realizable system, but rather the intrinsic dynamics or which is apparently had from the same Euler equations. So, it is interesting to see. So, it is interesting to see this as a classical many body system in the context of, say, establishing.
