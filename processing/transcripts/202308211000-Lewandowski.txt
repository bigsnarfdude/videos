Effects of our quantization. So, what is the first correction terms that should be added to some classical formulae, which are effect of some quantum nature of our theories? So, this is what my talk will be about. And specifically, it will be about black holes and Black holes and yet more specifically about the Oppenheimer-Snyder model. It's not related to the recent movies, so it's neither related to Oppenheimer nor to Barbie. It's just coincidence that I'm giving this talk today. Let me start with introduction to this subject. So we all believe We all believe that quantum gravity will change our paradigm of black hole evaporation. And the first people who spelled it out in my community were Abbai Ashtakar and Martin Boovalt. So they considered pretty qualitatively evaporating black hole and And according to the classical space-time theory, after evaporation, some singularity still stays containing a lot of information, and then we develop a new space-time. However, according to this new paradigm, when there is no singularity, there is just a quantum region of space-time, the diagram looks more. The diagram looks more or less like here. So we start with some evaporating black hole. When the black hole evaporates, there is still the interior, which is quantum. So you can see here, even you can imagine that then the horizon shrinks to some Planck radius, then the quantum effects come into the game, the space-time is replaced by some quantum structure. Some quantum structure. However, this quantum structure still conducts all the information. So, in future, again, some classical space-time forms and the result will be like a lot of radiation radiating much more than just the Hawking radiation, maybe looking a little like a white hole, like transition from black hole to white hole. So, actually, this was spelled out by. Was spelled out by other people, by Haggard and Carlo Rovelli. They just explicitly conjectured that the quantum effects cause this tunneling, as they say, from black hole to white hole. So the model they constructed was just taking classical Schwarzschild solution and And, however, extended it in a different way than we normally do. So, extend it to extend the solution in such a way that it contains, that when we are, that it contains two asymptotically, that it contains quite regular asymptotically flat regions, so asymptotically flat past and asymptotically flat future. And the observer is going to see or not to see some horizon. However, the black. Horizon. However, the black hole horizon ends, it sinks in some quantum region. Then there is some quantum region, and then the black hole horizon turns into a white hole horizon when it re-emerges again. So this diagram is very similar to this radiating black hole diagram. However, it's much simpler. It's just outside, it's static all the time. However, at some point, However, at some point, this global structure changes from black hole horizon to white hole horizon, and inside there is a quantum region. And according to new models developed on this basis, this new region is maybe, this quantum region is even replaced not only qualitatively. Not only qualitatively considered, but is also specifically replaced by some specific quantum initial and final state and a quantum transition amplitude between those two states. And the state is matched with the classical space-time in some approximate way. It means that we assume about this initial and final state that there are And final state that they have semi-classical properties, and that the expectation values of geometric operators coincide with the classical values for this ambient Schwarzschild space time. So the common feature of the two models is that observer outside is going to Is going to see this effect of black hole, either black hole explosion or very, very fast evaporation or just black hole to white hole tunneling in both cases. However, there is another family of models which have different predictions, namely this model derived by Ashtekar. Derived by Ashtekar, Javier Omeado, and Param sink. In this model, we start with a quantum theory of black hole interior, and we consider semi-classical state, and then reproduce the metric, classical metric tensor, semi-classical metric tensor. And we find that this space-time is very similar to the, has very similar structure. The has very similar structure to Kruskal, familiar Kruskal diagram. However, the difference is that this green line, dashed line, the classical Kruskal diagram has singularity, and this is the end of space-time. However, in this case, this is a regular surface. So space-time is incomplete. And if we extend it, then we just glue another element of diagram. So we obtain familiar infinite. Obtain familiar infinite tower of diagrams. However, according to this model, if we find this effective classical, semi-classical space-time, which corresponds to this state, then we find that observer that is living outside the black hole actually will never see any explosion, will never see any white hole. The observer will stay here. The observer will stay here. Maybe the space-time is a little modified. It's not exactly Schwarzschild, it's Schwarzschild does some small correction. However, it's perfectly static and nothing explodes. There is no white hole, no black hole tunneled to white hole, just all static space-time and black hole horizons. And next, there are also models which are based Models, which are based on this Oppenheimer-Snyder construction, which I will introduce below, which consists in, so now we consider again this infinite tower of Schwarzschild, of Kruskal space-times. However, we glue it with some other space-time which is. Space-time which is filled with homogeneous spatially homogeneous isotropic dust. And then according to this model, well, this global structure more or less looks like this. I'm only introducing briefly the subject, so I will discuss this kind of diagrams in more detail below. So there are also some. So there are also some other diagrams which have similar properties. However, there is so according to those models, actually the space-time outside, so now in those models, we consider black hole, which is formed by collapsing matter. However, outside, nothing really again, the space-time is static. Is static, and we just see matter which disappears behind the horizon. And as long as we are this observer, then we may never notice, we may not be aware what happened. On the other hand, there are maybe some other asymptotically flat regions of space-time where, on the other hand, there are some white holes, but also they are also static. Static. So quite a different prediction is made by is made. Sorry, I did a second is made by model describing outgoing shock wave. So according Going shockwave. So, according to this model, when a collapsing matter bounces and is surrounded by static space-time, then something breaks and an outgoing shockwave is produced. I think that the next speaker, which is at, probably will discuss or at least mention this. Discuss or at least mention this emergence of shockwave. So, in this case, we have really something very violent happening, that there is this horizon, black hole horizon is destroyed by some shockwave going out. So, we can see that there are several quite different, drastically different predictions about. about about the effects which about the effects that quantum effects in black hole interior have on black hole exterior okay so let me now present some more details and and and and my own um approach to to this subject but let me start with uh so this will So, this will be quantum Oppenheimer-Schneider model. Here, I have to give credit to many, many people who also came up with the idea that when you do quantum gravity, you have to, you can also test your quantum models on Oppenheimer-Snyder models. So, there are many, many, many papers which are very often intellectually disconnected because they start from different models. From different models, sometimes dustically different models, and in different ways approach this Oppenheimer-Snyder, but all of them have this idea that if we have quantum gravity, what about Oppenheimer-Snyder? Okay, so let me start with the classical Oppenheimer-Snyder. So, classical Oppenheimer-Snyder idea was considered a homogeneous isotropic ball of dust. Ball of dust surrounded by spherically symmetric static space-time. And I mean, to start with, it's just spherically symmetric. We don't know whether it's going to be static or not. But then we allow this ball to start contracting. So the space-time inside the ball, this region of space-time which is filled with ball, is described by the same metric. By the same metric tensor as that of Friedman, Lehman, Robertson, Walker. And on the other hand, outside the space-time remains symmetric, remains static and is described by Schwarzschild. Space-time. Well, at some point, the ball, the collapsing ball, passes the radius of horizon, so then horizon develops inside the horizon. Inside the horizon singularity develops. And however, we, as long as we stay outside, we don't know about the singularity. We just see that the collapsing ball disappeared behind horizon and we still have the Schwarzschild space-time. So, this model showed that this idealized Schwarzschild solution can be actually produced by some. Produced by some, of course, also pretty idealized, but maybe more physical process of collapse of homogeneous isotropic ball. Okay, so let me explain more about the mathematics that is before behind this behind this Oppenheimer-Snyder model. So you can view this. So, you can view this model in the following way: that consider a space-time here filled with, so sorry, I keep forgetting that I okay. Imagine imagine space-time filled with isotropy. With isotropic with partially isotropic homogeneous dust that may be either either, well, in this case, I wrote it as a flat model, but it can be also a hyperbolic or closed model. On the other hand, consider another space-time which is Space-time, which is endowed with spherically symmetric and static metric. In fact, pseudo-static because this translation, this time translation generator may be space-like in some regions. And now assume that there is a boundary between the two, and the boundary is along the co-moving observers or Observers or co-moving particles of dust that is filling this internal space. And suppose that the metric is C1, so it is continuous and once differentiable, then the statement is that given metric inside, the metric outside is uniquely determined. So, here we're not talking about any Einstein equations, which is just geometry. There is metric inside, metric outside, assumption about this gluing surface, and then there is that map, which to every given, specifically given metric inside, because this function a of tau is a priori arbitrary, determines some metric outside. So, no equations are. So, no equations are thus far assumed. However, okay, and also the opposite can be considered. This is also remarkable that this picture actually doesn't really, it's a local construction, so it doesn't assume what is interior, what is exterior. So, actually, we could put this isotropic, so we can think of a bubble. Can think of a bubble of vacuum, of spherically symmetric, maybe not vacuum, but just spherically symmetric space-time surrounded by a spatially isotropic and homogeneous. And then the same is true that if we fix this exterior space-time, some kind of fluid or some cosmos, I mean, we fix what is surrounding our. This, this, what is surrounding our bubble, then and assume that in the bubble metric is strictly symmetric. So we can assume that this bubble is us and that this exterior is the universe in which we are all contained. And now, if we assume that there is some surface and that there is that the two spacetimes are glued in a continuous and differentiable way. Continuous and differentiable way, then again, given the metric tensor, the exterior metric tensor, the interior metric tensor is determined, unique. So it's very nice geometric statement. Okay, and now if we turn on Einstein equations, then there is a nice surprise that it's enough to assume that one of those metrics, that this isotropic homogeneous. That this isotropic homogeneous satisfies Einstein equations with dust, and then the other metric has to be Schwarzschild, whether we want or not. No equations assumed it's already a consequence of the first. So in this sense, this Oppenheimer-Schneider construction, it solves Einstein equations for us. So we propose some piece of space-time which satisfies Einstein. Of space-time, which satisfies Einstein equations, and then it proposes the extension of the space-time, which will also satisfy. If we add cosmological constant, then we obtain Schwarzschild ADS or Schwarzschild ds, depending on the value of the constant. So we can see that this mechanism is quite stable with respect to change of various changes one can consider. Change of various changes one can consider. And now, more technically, now, if we consider this isotropic, this spatially isotropic homogeneous space-time, which there are three possibilities. It's either hyperbolic or flat or closed universe. And assume that the junction conditions are as I. conditions are as I described at psi equals psi zero, surface given by psi equals psi zero, then we and we assume that the space-time outside is friction symmetric of this form, then we obtain quite quite we obtain that to start with the two functions have to be equal to each other's. Have to be equal to each other. So, this freight is symmetric space-time is given actually by one function. And secondly, we obtain equation on this function, or we just obtain this function for every value of R that can be achieved by this surface and by the function which describes the other metric. Other metric. So now to understand this, E is a constant, which in case of hyperbolic spacetime is hyperbolic cosine of psi zero, which defines the surface. It equals one for the flat case, and it is just cosine of phi zero for closed surface. But this E can be also understood as the energy of geodesics. Of geodesics which generate the surface between two space-times. So the surface between two space-times is generated by time-like geodesics. And for every geodesic, we can, to every geodesic, we can associate energy. All of them have the same energy. And this is exactly this E. Furthermore, if we write just the Einstein tensor of this. Of this spatially isotropic homogeneous space-time and name its components of this tensor energy density and pressure. But there's no physics here. This is just the way we call those Einstein tensor components due to the symmetry. Then we find. Then we find the following relation between the metric outside and the metric inside. So remarkably, despite of the fact we have three cases here, there is only one equation here. So it's very, very nice property. So for example, if we consider that this isotropic This isotropic homogeneous, this special isotropic homogeneous spacetime is filled with k different fluids. And for each of this fluid, the rho is related to the scale factor in this way, where C are constants. Then the matching tensor, straightly symmetric tensor, will have this form where each term. Where each term here corresponds to one, so we have additional unit, and then each term here corresponds to one term here. However, when there is exponent n1, here the exponent is n1 minus 2 and so on. And the constants d are related to constant c and also to the radius of this ball, which is contracting or expanding. So, this is what. So this is what nice, nice correspondence. Okay, so now we make it quantum. So how to make it quantum? We make it quantum in the following way. That first we know that if we consider some simplest model by Ashtakar Pavolski, sink a quantum model of the Lehmet of Friedman Lehmet Robertson Walker. Of Friedman, Lehmed, Roberts, and Walker space-time. Judge, sorry, can I interrupt you? There is a question if you don't mind to take. Oh, yes, I'm okay. Sorry for that. Yeah, I'm wondering if is there anything special happening on the boundary? Are there delta functions or anything? Or is it actually smooth? No, no, no, this is the point that, of course, it would be very trivial to stick. To stick pieces of two different space-times and then produce any kind of delta functions on this junction surface. But the precision of this model consists in the fact that metric tensor is continuous and differentiable. So the only non-regularity is that Ricci tens. Richetens or jumps on the surface. It's a theta function on the surface. There's no delta function or no stress energy. No delta function unless you consider the third derivative of the metric tensor. And energy-wise, it's quite clear what happened. It's quite clear what happens. We have non-zero energy, non-zero energy density in one region, and then zero energy density somewhere else. So clearly there is a step function in the energy density. But as long as we don't need to calculate derivative of energy density, then there is no delta. So this is nice regular way of producing Producing solution. Now, okay, so now we become quantum in this way that we replace one of the space-times bar by semi-classical space-time, which is predicted by a quantum model. So we consider the simplest possible model by Ashtakar-Pavlovsky Singh. This is a model of isotropic homogeneous universe. And then, according to this model, actually, there is. Actually, there is a different Einstein equation there. So I wrote before the classical Einstein tensor, which is just given by the by the by geom, so it's just geometrically defined. However, here it is that this quantum Einstein, semi-classical Einstein tensor gives the following result. So this is the relation between A dot divided by A and rho rather than previously. Rather than previously, rho is still inverse proportional to a cube. So at the end of the day, the right-hand side, instead of looking like rho, like m divided by a cube, looks like m divided by a cube minus another term which is proportional to one upon a to the power six. And other than that, And other than that, it looks exactly as we know. So, we know what to do with such terms because we can actually very well deal with any term of this form. So, the only difference now, which this considering semi-classical cosmological model instead of classical, is that there is a different, this effective energy density consists now of two terms. Density consists now of two terms. One is one upon A cube, and the other one is one upon A to power six. Now, those coefficients, this rho is the critical energy density. It is given by this number, and gamma is a certain parameter in loop quantum gravity, which, for consistency with some other models, is often assumed to be this. And according to this model, you can see from this. This model, you can see from this formula that space-time, that universe doesn't, if we trace backward in time our expanding universe, it doesn't shrink to a point, to Big Bang. It stops when rho reaches the value of rho critical, and then it expands again. So it means that instead of big bang, we have big bounce. Okay. Okay, and now we can feed our Oppenheimer-Snyder model with this bouncing space-time on one side. Well, here I have a short derivation of that model, but maybe I will skip it because I don't really have much time and I have still much to show. So, what we do is we fit our Oppenheimer-Snyder map. Map with that semi-classical cosmological space-time. And this is what we obtain for this freakly symmetric part. So you can recognize that the first two terms look exactly like Schwarz-Schildmetric. However, we gain one more term, which has opposite sign than here, which is inverse proportional to r to power 4. So, and now alpha is. And now alpha is this contains a Planck length, so it's quantum parameter. This space-time metric is determined by the range of R, but because space-time is bouncing, this range is bounded from below by a certain radius of the bounce. Uh, radius of the bounds. So, for so, for this region, the space-time is determined by this, and now it turns out that this space-time follows, was already already derived by many people, sometimes by using different models, sometimes by using the same. However, there are certainly two different ways of deriving that space-time. Describing that space-time. So, one way is to use this, as I did it here, to use this Oppenheimer-Snyder mechanism and just apply it to isotropic homogeneous universe, but to quantum one, to quantum isotropic homogeneous universe. Another way it's also interesting is that this model was derived by those three gentlemen, Kelly Santa Cruz and Wilson Ewing. Kelly Santa Cruz and Wilson Ewing by solving Einstein is a semi-classical version of Einstein equations. So they independently, they derived this just as a vacuum solution. However, a vacuum solution of quantum corrected Einstein equations. So there are at least two different calculations that a priori don't have to give the same result. However, they do. They do give. they do they do do give the same the same metric tensor which shows that maybe this metric tensor is really somehow distinguished in maybe this correction of of of sparrt is somehow to some sense well reliable um what are properties here notice that that for this kind of space-time it for this kind of It for this kind of space family of space-times, there is a lower bound for the black hole mass. So we cannot consider mass smaller than certain minimal mass, which, as we see, the length of this corresponding length is proportional to the Planck length, which is not so surprising. And for masses bigger, so when mass of So, when the mass of the collapsing ball is bigger than this minimal value, then we have two horizons form instead of one horizon. On the other hand, where the mass of the collapsing ball is equal exactly this minimal mass, then we obtain extremal case. So, for instance, for so, so the conclusion say physics. Conclusion, say physical conclusion, maybe that when black hole is evaporating, that it cannot evaporate completely. The evaporation would stop when mass equals this minimal value. So we have some black hole doesn't disappear completely, just black hole and black hole evaporation stops. Of course it's it's it's speculation because man because this model will have to be really exact. This model will have to be really exact for this to be true. We can calculate those explicitly, those radiuses of this black hole. And we can also consider the global structure. So, now what is the global structure of space-time? Now, I have to start negotiations of time. Negotiations of time. So, how much time do I have? You have 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Okay. Okay. So, let us now first discuss the global structure of this whole space-time, and then I will turn to what it means for our Oppenheimer-Snyder model. So, here is the global structure. The global structure of this deformed of this new semi-classical Schwarzschild is similar to right. Schwarzschild is similar to Reisner-Nordstra, if you are familiar with. So, this is the part of space-time which we started with. However, when we introduce coordinates that penetrate horizon and that can be extended and extended, then we obtain this kind of infinite tower of space-times. So, there is one black hole horizon, then there is another internal. Is another internal horizon. Then there is singularity here. And then we have a Cauchy horizon, which leads to when we cross the Cauchy horizon, we are in a new space-time with new asymptotically flat region. However, in order to get there, we have to cross the white hole horizon. So then we obtain space-time with white hole horizon and the black hole horizon again. Black hole horizon again. And this junction surface we considered, it is given by this red line, is generated by radial geodesics. And in the case of E equals one, which is the case for which this calculation was done, they are they are are they they are are in correspond to an observer in rest in infinity and they bounce and they define static asymptotic flood regions and also trapped regions and static wormhole regions we can extend this analytically this solution and then Analytically, the solution, and then if we extend, then we obtain also again a timeline singularity. Okay, however, now and one more observation is that since that this space-time is not anymore vacuum in sense of exact classical equations. So, we can consider this quantum correction as from a classical point of view, this quantum correction, it makes effect of makes effect of of just some extra energy like space-time was filled with some with some with some energy okay so what is our so now let us finally complete complete our our openheimer snyder model okay so we put inside this ball which consists of quantum data Of quantum dust, the dust is collapsing outside. We have this space-time. So, just a second. I need to store this. Okay, so we are here, and suppose that. And suppose that we are here, and there is this collapsing ball. So, a static observer here, well, at some point we'll notice this collapsing ball, but other than that, the static observer can infinitely complete his or her world line and will never see anything else that. Anything else that affects a black hole horizon, which was formed by this collapsing ball. Right. On the other hand, there is another region, and another static observer in the second region will see a white hole and a tsunami. A tsunami of dust, which comes, is coming from this white hole horizon, and at some point, this tsunami will reach the observer, and the observer will sink in this dust. And there are also several other regions, and there may be also some other observers in those other regions. Intrinsically, one can also consider a quantum Swiss cheese model. Namely, we can think about the opposite scenario that we are in a bubble surrounded by quantum universe, by universe which is expanding, but is given by some semi-classical quantum state. Quantum state. And then this quantum properties of surrounding universe induce some properties, some quantum effects in our bubble, in particular, the same space-time, which is this corrected Schwarzschild space-time. And now we can repeat the same, we can use the same diagram, but now the difference is that we are on the other side. So we are on this. Other side. So we are on this side. So here is our bubble. We live here our creative lives. And then there is that universe outside. Actually, I should start with this part because this is the part which would correspond to the present day. So because this is expanding the universe. So we are living here and we are surrounded by Living here, and we are surrounded by quantum-expanding universe, and the universe induces that metric tensor in our space-time. However, if we trace back our bubble, then we see that in the past there was some, our bubble bounced, and in the past, our bubble was actually collapsing. So there was some other phase of our bubble when our bubble was expecting quantum universe to squeeze it and up to the radius of collapse. Okay. Can I interrupt you for a second? Do you have a cosmological constant here or no? No, here we don't. No, no, here we don't have cosmological constant. No, no, everything can be repeated with cosmological constant, but of course, then there may be some differences in global properties because we know that cosmological constant changes. So no, here cosmological constant is zero. Now I can discuss what are other possibilities. So this model which I discussed Model which I discussed in the main part of the talk, it was the flat model. So k equals zero. However, we have also equations for, we have also proposals for this replacement for classical energy density for other values of k. So we can So, we can, for instance, so for instance, for the closed universe, we can consider this kind of proposal. And now you can see that for each of this, so this row will be again like one upon a cube, this will be like k upon a square, a square, and this is sine of one upon a. This is something new. But still, for this formula, we can consider this Oppenheimer-Snyder model and. This Oppenheimer-Snyder model and see what happens. Here we have more terms. There is also a proposal for a hyperbolic universe. And there's also a single proposal which is good for every value of k. So in our case, k was zero. You can recognize that in our case, k was zero, but you can also consider, for instance, this with k equal plus minus one and derive the corresponding Oppenheimer-Snyder. Oppenheimer-Snyder models and see what they give. Now, but what is Rovelli's reply to this model? So Rovelli and his collaborators, they say that it's not true that this infinite diagram, that space-time should be described by this infinite diagram. Instead, we should remove this region. This region where some singularities happen, and we should glue, should glue the rest, and then we obtain space-time which has the following form. So we have here in our our here so here so here this black shape is our our collapsing matter. Collapsing matter. So we still have the same collapsing matter. However, space-time now has one asymptotically flat region. So this is our past and this is our future. If we live here, then space-time is actually static. However, near the horizon, there is a region which is strictly quantum. And then Rouvelli and his collaborators, they propose even His collaborator, they propose even to replace this region by some specific quantum form. Quantum form is just a history of certain quantum initial state and quantum final state, and make it in such a way that it matches the semi-classical space-time I just presented outside, and consider this as tunneling from some space-time, which initially was here was looking like a black hole. was here was looking like a black hole space-time and eventually is looking like like a white hole space-time. Okay, but since one minute is left, let me go quickly to conclusions. So sorry. Okay, so it turns out that Oppenheimer-Snyder model works also for semi-classical space-times. It's quite inconsistent way with. It's quite inconsistent way we are able to define some space-times. There is a specific correction to the, it leads to specific connection to the Schwarzschild metric. If you notice any type of, I'm sorry, there is a specific correction to the Schwarzschild metric that seems to be robust because it emerges from several different calculations. And this is this correction. This is this extra term. The correction makes geodesics in space-time bounce before they reach r equals zero. And this is what allows putting inside bouncing universe, because bouncing geodesics, they are consistent with the bouncing of the universe inside. Well, according to this model, exterior observer will not see the black-white hole transition. However, we'll be able to. Transition. However, we'll be able to measure some quantum dark matter. However, Cauchy horizons emerge, and this is the price which we pay, and new asymptotically flat ends of space-time. Well, on the other hand, we are aware that there are also some other interpretations of this diagram, which I depicted, namely this of Rovelli, where he replaces some region just by. Region just introduces a whole field with quantum region, and then it allows him to make this infinite diagram finite. And there is also another proposal by Ed Wilson Ewing and collaborators in which this infinite diagram is destroyed by some shock wave, which emerges from a Emerges from the horizon. Thank you. This is it. Well, thank you very much for the very interesting and apparently very timely talk. So any questions from the audience here and then any questions from people in Zoom? Any questions or remarks or comments here? Before we move to see if we have any questions. Before we move to see if we have any questions from the people in Zoom, can I ask you what's your definition of quantum dark matter? Oh, it is just a name for this effect that the semi-classical state that we obtained from the point of view of classical Einstein theory, it doesn't satisfy vacuum equations. So if this doesn't satisfy vacuum Einstein equations, so it means Vacuum Einstein equations. So it means it satisfies Einstein equations with some density of matter, non-zero density. So I called it by definition quantum dark matter, but there is nothing more behind this. It's a self-defined notion. Okay, thank you. Any questions from people who are in Zoom? There is one question here from the audience. Yes, please. Thank you. Sorry, it was the microphone wasn't turned on. You mentioned. Turned on. You mentioned that the equate, the energy density for the quantum dark matter. I'm wondering, does it satisfy the equation of motion of dust, i.e. pressureless? You only give us the energy part. Yes, I'm not sure. No, I don't think it satisfies equations of pressure or dust or even... Or even of any, I think the structure of stress-energy tensor will be more complex. If there are no more questions, then thanks very much for your interesting talk. Thank you very much. So, Ed, are you ready? Ah, so Ed, are you ready to share? Yes, thank you.
