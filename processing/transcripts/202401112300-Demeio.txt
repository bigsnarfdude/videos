Okay, welcome back. So now, Julian de Meio will talk to us about the Grundwald problem for solvable groups. Thank you, Juliet, and thank you very much for the invitation. Thank you to the organizers for the invitation, Miss Beautiful Place. So, yes, I'll talk about the Grumball problem for solvable groups. I want to say this is independent work, but some results have been obtained independently by Jonathan and Independently by Jonathan Anarpaz and Olivia Wittenberger. Okay, so I'll start by introducing the, I'll say, maybe, yeah, but precisely later. Grumball problem. Yes, so it's the following question. You fix G, a finite group. And yeah, maybe let me fix some notation. So, K will be a number field, Mk the set of places. And for gamma K, I will use to denote the absolute Dalai group of K and gamma V, I will denote. I will denote a local Galois group, a local absolute Galois group. So fix G, a finite group, and fix and a finite set S and a finite set S of places of K and let L V over K V be in S. B in S B finite Calvo extensions group D V so we fix some local extensions of groups that embed into G and essentially we want to ask whereas there is a global extension of group G because the composition groups are with local groups DV. local groups db so um yeah does there exist does there exist a g extension okay um whose decomposition groups are db okay as it stated um like this the answer to this question is known to be no um since bang in uh in 14 In 48. And however, it was like already proven by Grumwald. Yeah, and then like his proof contains some mistakes. And then Mang, it's yes, up to up to like finitely like a finite obstruction, a finite obstruction. Obstruction, a finite obstruction on finitely many places.   There is a Brown mine obstruction, which also recovers the original counterexample of Bang. So, okay, so let's refine the question and ask it like this. So, up to Brouwerman in obstruction, is it true now that there is a positive answer? Or, in other words, this can be reformulated in the following way. Does this morphism have dense image? So, I wouldn't wanna um explain. explain or like precisely the obstruction here. As I said, it's really linked to the ramified browser group of this quotient. So I could put the browser group of this quotient there. But what's important, I think, for what I want to say, it's a finite obstruct and it's supported on only finitely many places. And so, the question is equivalent to this is like a reformulation, a more symbolic reformulation. By this, I mean the quotient by G conjugation, by the G action given by conjugation. And this epi denotes epimorphisms. So, not just any homomorphism from gamma k to g, but actually an epimorphism which actually gives a g extension, otherwise it's. Gives a G extension. Otherwise, it could be still a G extension, but not a field extension. And we want a field extension. But in any case, you can also see that it's equivalent to removing this epi here, this epimorphism. And so we could really ask the question like this. So if we have, but this thing has a dense image. Okay. Okay. And as it's formulated, as it's formulated, so conditionally, conditionally on Colyotel and Sansuk's conjecture, the answer should be. The answer is yes. So we expect a positive answer to this question. Okay. Let me say some history on subsequent results on this question. And from now on, And from now on, I will always focus about the solvable case. So, yes. Okay, so as I said, for Giabelian, this is due to Grumbald and Wang. Grumbald and Wang. So it's already known till the forties. For G yes, for G of order. Of order co-prime with the cardinality of the roots of unity contained in k um this was proven in in the 1930s in the 1930s by scholzen rights chart or right Are we still? I thought we okay. I was about to okay. Ah, okay. Thank you. Okay, okay. Yeah, let me see. Okay. Neukir, yeah, seventy-nine. Yeah, maybe uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay, this disrupts the chronological order I wanted to follow, but yeah, so the inverse Kalova problem for solvable G was done by Shafarevich. By Shafarevich um, and this is in fifty six. Um and this is in fifty-six Okay, and then yeah, okay, yes, so then there's like I I'll I'll I'll go to I'll go to the recent results. So G super solvable and visited by Harpazem Wittenberg. M. Wittenberg in 2017. Okay. So the theorem that I want to prove, that I'm proving is yes for For G solvable in general. Okay. No, no, no. Yeah, only the inverse colour problem. Okay. So, yes. Um for for this theorem, um For this theorem, like essentially, essentially, what Harpazzen Wittenberg did was to develop a descent method that reduces the solvable case to a certain fibration matter over quasi-trivial tori. So, to put things into perspective, I want to introduce now a bit in a summary. Yes? Summary, yes winver scale problem. Ah, super so ah, sorry. Um, yes, so this means that there exists a filtration g n equal to g such that the quotients g i by g i plus one by g i are cyclic. And all of these have to be normal in the big G. Okay. So, yes, Harpaz and Wittenberg developed this descent method that reduces the Grumval problem to a question of vibrations over quasi-trivial. Of vibrations over quasi-trivial tori. And that's how they do the super-solvable case. And actually, yes, I should also add that they do, yes, super solvable. And conditionally, and conditionally on Schinzel's hypothesis, Schinzel's hypothesis, every solvable G. Every solvable G. It's your conjecture. Okay, Shinda is not enough. Okay. Okay. On a general, yeah, on a conjecture of verse similar to Schinzel's hypothesis. Okay. Yes. So let me yeah, I I'll state within in a way that is that is more suitable for That is more suitable for the rest of my talk. So, this is a theorem they give in 2022, I think. So, let y bar to x be finite the same type, and I will say what it is. I will say what it is. Finally the scent type under some yeah, finally abelian group scheme A over K then or for then um If like, yes. So I'll say star, and then I'll say what star is later. It's essentially a certain vibration theorem over quadratrival tori. If star is true, then So, maybe here, sorry, let me put it here. K omega, I mean the product of all places of Kv for all places. Okay. F bar is among a realizations of y bar over X. Let me maybe explain some words. So, um, yes, so oh, thank you. Yes. Um we have the same type. Type this means that y bar over x is yes, so let's say blah blah blah is a Galois cover is a Galois cover such that y bar over X bar this group Group has group A and K K bar, yes, yes, thank you yes here, yes and yes, y bar over X. Oh, thank you very much. Yes, absolutely. Yes, and the center type which is rational connect. Yes, thank you, whoever. Yes, so has group AK bar, this has group gamma A, where gamma A gamma A this semi-direct product. Direct product AK bar and it's not a similar product, it's an extension of gamma k by a k bar this is group gamma A and yes and like X Yeah, x bar over x as a group. I mean also like that the gamma k action is the right one, like it's the usual Galois action. Okay, and realization. Realization, maybe let me use an acronym. Maybe let me use an acronym of this final descent type. I mean, a y over x, such that is an eight order, such that y bar is equal to y base change to k bar. Yeah, compatibly with compatibility with gamma kx. So, okay, yes, um I yeah, I still have to uh introduce the vibration theorem. So I will introduce this in stated as a theorem that I can actually prove. So that, yeah, then I can follow immediately from here. So let Q be a quasi-trivial torus quasi-trivial torus and And f from X, yes. So this quasi-trivial torus, you can embed into an affine space of dimension equal to the degree of this finite total extension E over K. And this you can embed then into a projective space of the same degree. Let me call D the this degree to simplify. Degree to simplify the notation and f from x to pd equivariant and equivariant yeah maybe sorry let me let me actually uh directly do it over q at the equivariant at the equivariant um smooth proper Smooth proper morphism where T is a torus such that the induced the induced homomorphism T to Q is Is surjective, it's an epimorphism. Then we want the classical fibration statement. Okay, maybe let's not forget this time the rationally connected fibers. It is an e-taurus. It is an e-taurus. It could act, it just has to act. It just has to act on X and on Q, and F has to be T equivalent. There are two actions: one here and one here, and the vismorphism is equivalent. Okay, um morphism with rationally connected fibers when we set the um I am let me okay omega is equal to the closure. Adelic points on the fibers on broad microobstructive points on the fiber okay. Yes, uh, didn't I? Yeah, proper, yeah, smooth prop, yeah. Okay, um, yes, so um, maybe let me call this finite ability in the cent finite ability. Final bin on the center. So, um, yes, so Harpaz and Wittenberg prove that this finite abelian descent theorem implies the Grumwald problem. The Grumwald problem for solvable G. For solvable G. For solvable G. And so this kind of technique, which I will not go into it for time constraints, is what they use to do the super-solvable case and the conditional solvable case. So now I will focus on proving this vibration theorem. Yeah, maybe what I can say is that as you might expect, the reason why this finite abelian descent does the solvable case is some kind of induction on the derived filtration on G. On G or on a central series of G. Okay, yes, so I have it there, nice. Okay, so Group of star, or like let's say, I will not maybe scheme of star. Okay, um, yeah, so the the first thing is that uh without Is that uh with our ah, yeah, maybe sorry? I mean, this is just a technical thing, but uh, let me put some bullets here. Um, so I think one can remove them by an observation. Uh, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, like, okay, yeah, that's mad. Okay, but uh, in the way I prove the theorem, I will prove it with the bullets. Um, then, uh, yeah. Then, yeah, yes, okay. Let's say it like that with the bullets. Okay, okay. Proof scheme of the star. Ah, yes, thank you. Okay, yeah, we should put it. I should write it here. Okay. So we'll, yes, if V is Archimedean. Um, if V is Archimedean, if V is Archimedean, um, X Kv bullet denotes the set of connected components of XKV. And in the in the K-omega notation, it means that on the Archimedean components, they get collapsed. Um, so this is only relevant for the real places because, for the complex places, it's already connected. Okay, proof scheme of star. Yes. So essentially, there are two main steps. Before coming to the steps, I want to say, yeah, one can easily reduce to the case where E is a field. So I will, without loss of generality, I will assume that E is a field. Okay. And also by another descent method of Harpasem Wittenberg Wittenberg. We may enlarge E at will. So I don't want to get too precise with this sentence, but what I mean is that, first of all, for this statement, you can assume that he is as large as you want. And also, if you want to prove this statement, That if you want to prove this statement for a certain quasi-trivial torus, you can always reduce to the same statement after pulling it back to another quasi-trivial torus where you extend the E. And so even, so for instance, in this way, you preserve the fibers essentially. And there is a way to enlarge E while preserving the fibers. Okay, then once, yes, um taking into account these first general reductions, there are two main steps. Two main steps. So let's start with some points P V V in S, some finite set of places in X X Ks Ks here denotes the product of Kv for V and S and let's say that we wish to approximate these points Pv. Okay, so step one is that we want to approximate I mean rather than approximate them with a point lying on a fiber, so on this closure. On this closure. And the first step is to find a queue such that this set is non-empty. Like we have local points everywhere, and these local points approximate the points PV for V and S. So step one is find points Q in QK. Such that is non-empty and yes it's non-empty and points approximately. Okay, and to do something like this, essentially, yeah, I want to explain like what the main problem is. So on Q is a quasi-trivial torus error, yeah, like that. And if you think about what its points are, they are essentially vertible elements of E. So of a number field. So, of a number field. So, we have a lot of flexibility in some sense, as in terms of like a strong approximation. For instance, we have strong approximation on the affine space containing the quasi-trivial torus, because we may just approximate on this number field D. But the problem is that doing this kind of strong approximation is strong approximation is essentially not enough to get to get to get all local points on the fibers. What you need is something a bit more. So if we make a drawing If we make a drawing of Q, and let's say we have some exceptional locus here. Yeah, so this is Q inside Q, inside the affine space. Now, the problem is that here on the exceptional locus, we could have some non-trivial like geometric covers, and these geometric covers. And these geometric covers are um they so sorry, we have we have vibration, right? We have vibration here and it degenerates on this divisor and over this divisor there is a certain splitting field and and the splitting field in general because of the T equivariance cannot be really like anything possible, but it has Anything possible, but it has to be the splitting field of, it has to be of the form given by a finite extension of the smooth part of this divisor. So for each component here, geometric component, we get that the fiber is split over a finite etal cover of the Of the um of this uh component of the device. Okay, it's not very clear. Um why is that? It's because of a t-equivalence, essentially. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have to take a T-equivalent compactification and for this T-equivalent compactification when you get V-splitting. Everyone's topic production. Let's start with the function.  So, yes, so essentially we have a very special kind of time factorization on the reduction and on a component for the fiber of the reduction. And yes, so V over D, yes, V V over this this move part. Yes, V over with move part of D is a finite etal cover. So, okay. So in some sense, now if you go back to like thinking of what happens, what happens locally. Now, if you want to find a parameter Q such that the fiber above it has points. Fiber above it has points over all completions. What you need, the most important ones are, so we are approximating on S, so we know that we have local points on S, but the most important ones are the ones for which we reduce on this divisor, because for the other ones where we don't reduce to the divisor, we just find points by language estimates. When we reduce to the divisor, then what we need is that we need to lift via. Is that we need to lift via this finite ethyl cover. And now lifting via this finite etal cover is it amounts essentially to certain like congruence conditions, but now I will state precisely in a theorem. And yes, they are in the case where is Galois over. In the case where E is Galois over K, like we are related to some Legendre symbols of self-interaction of the parameter. So let me call it like cyclic strong approximation. And yes, this was also obtained in some form by Arpaz and Wittenberg. So, yes, so E over K is Galois, let's say with group gamma, finite Galois, Galois with group gamma, and let n be such that new n is contained in star. Containing star letter L over E the Lua extension Yes and X V let's say bullet P n S like local points in local points of Q. In local points of Q. I will very frequently use this identification because Q is the Baylor restriction of Gm. The KV points on Q are just the products over all W's dividing V of EW star. So be orthogonal to Orthogonal to the following, yeah, to the kernel of n torsion of the Brouwer group of Q to the base change to L of the intortion of the brow group of Q, then there exists an X approximating approximating approximating xpw let's say possibly after enlarging s like yeah um say if if s contains some s naught that only depends on n and l essentially it's the the places that divide n the Archimedean places and the places that ramify n then there exists an x that approximates When there exists an x that approximates with x v bullet such that if you take the prime decomposition of the ideal x in OES and you write it as p1 times pk greater or equal than one the following properties hold Then, okay. Um, so the first one is that the Frobenius of P1 in L yes, ah, sorry, I should okay, let me put in L in. Okay, let me put in L in the in the abelianization of L is one and yeah, actually of all I greater people and the second property is that so if P i sigma doesn't divide X for all for all sigma different from identity in gamma and they And the Legendre symbol x over Pi sigma is equal to one. Okay. Yes. Maybe let me say in addition, yes, in addition, if C contained in the Galois group of L over E is a conjugacy class. Class C class we may conjure class whose projection in the Galois group of the abelianization is trivial. Then we may assume that the Frobenius of L of P1. Of L, of P1 at L is C. Well, yeah, it belongs to the class, to the conjugacy class C. Yes, okay. So, sorry, it's very convoluted, the statement, but essentially it's like some sort of Chebotarev. But in addition, in addition, we kind of want the want the x to be um so sorry this is the nth um the nth symbol x to be an nth power modulo the conjugates of a primes dividing it and um um if uh if we wanted to impose this on a we to do this with a single prime um i i don't think uh as far as i know I know there is a way to do it. But like with this way, essentially, there are some vague ideas first used in general, in a more wide setting, so to speak, by Shofarevich, that rely in his first proof, that rely on the pigeonhol principle, and these ideas then. These ideas, then if carefully taken, like arranged, can yield this sort of approximation. So the proof I omit it, so uses Chebotarev, Chebotarev, and the Pidginal principle by opidional. Principle in a way that somehow goes back to Shaparevich's proof. Okay, so this is finding local points. This is finding local points. And yeah, I didn't say, and I don't want to say exactly, like, to show exactly. Exactly, like to show exactly how why this statement gives you the lifting here. But I don't know, I can sort of leave it to your imagination, as in when you want to lift here, what you do is you reduce this point to a divisor. And if it reduces to the smooth part of the divisor, that's equivalent to saying that the prime is a split prime. Is a split prime in E over K. So it's different from all of its conjugates, which we have. And so we reduce to the smooth part. And then saying that we lift to a finite cover, if the cover, for instance, is only arithmetic, so it's only given by a field extension, then it's just a Frobenius condition, and it's something that we can ensure with this conjugacy class. Conjugacy class by choosing the trivial conjugacy class. If instead there is actually a geometric cover there, and let's say this cover is like of exponent n, then by choosing the appropriate n, we can impose, through this condition here, we can impose the lifting. If you make the computations of what this means. Okay. Okay. Yes, so the time went on much faster than I would have hoped. Okay. Um step two. Maybe I'll j yeah, uh this is probably the most interesting but The most interesting, but okay. Avoiding Brouwer-Maying obstruction. So once we have chosen a point Q on Vistorus such that we have adapted points on the fiber, now we're left onto finding points that are actually Brower Man obstructed. And what's the problem? Like, what's the problem in this setting compared to more classical fabrication setting? There is this morphism here. There is this morphism here. Ah, thank you. Haravi's lemma. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah, I should have said it. Yeah, thank you. Through Haravi's lemma, one can ensure the better for Gonaldi. So we've, yes, so one, let's say eta is the genetic point, genetic point of Q when we have this. When we have this quotient, and we can specialize it to the fibers. So, what usually happens in the setting of a vibration theorem, for instance, over curves, which is where there are the most results in the literature, is that this morphism is an epimorphism for Q in a Hilbertian set of QK. Of QK. So, but this property is not satisfied in our case. And there is a reason for that. The reason is that it comes from the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence and comes from an H3. So essentially, if you look at the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for, let me do H2 X mu infinity, which subjects on the Brouwer group. Then what you get Then, what you get is: well, this column vanishes by the rational connectedness of the fibers. Sorry, not the Cauchy cell, but rather these fibrations of a Larry spectral sequence. Then you take H naught, Q, now R two, F star, mu infinity. And then here I will put H three Q mu infinity. 3 q mu infinity and we have a morphism here and now if we take instead the analog spectral sequence for the fiber what we get is here an h3 q as a scheme is just k so k mu infinity and here we get an h0 um k of uh um yeah that it's essentially the the the same visit of essentially the the the the same this is a finite etal um sorry this is a netal shift with uh locally constant whose stock at the geometric point q bar is this um is this group here and we get a morphism here so here what we get and you can see what what's happening is that now this thing becomes trivial because k is a number field and it's Because k is a number field and it's the vanishing of H3 for number fields. And the morphism from these to these, you can actually show like with this language was done by Harpazem Wittenberg. Okay. Okay, sorry, I'll have to rush you. Ah, okay, thanks. Okay, okay, thanks. Um, okay, so this is an isomorphism, and uh, but the problem now is that this thing goes to this H3, and this H3 is you can actually get a non-trivial morphism to VH3, and that's the main problem for dealing with the Brouwer-Manning obstruction on the fibers. But like, we literally want, when we approximate on the fibers, we literally want to be unobstructed with respect to a bigger browser. With respect to a bigger Brauer group than what we started with, which is unusual for the vibration theorem, for a vibration theorem. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, what one can do is use somehow the techniques that are already developed for the fibrillation theorem to deal actually with the image that comes from here. And it's now the rest of like the quotient of this image that one wants to somehow have some kind of control. And for that, What one can do is compute these triple variations. So take not only one fibre, but take essentially a grid of fibers for which there are local solutions unobstructed to the big part of the Brower Group. To a big part of the Brouwer group, and then compute the variation of the Brouwer Manning obstruction on different fibers. So, yes, let me yeah, no, okay. Okay, to go as quick as possible, let me maybe say like this. Let B in H zero Q R two F star u infinity be an element going. So this is an example, let's say of what happens going to some element in that. Some element in that H3, let me take a correstriction of something like this, where now this, yeah, visca product denotes this thing. Then you can compute the triple variation of the obstruction associated to be on some choice of adaptic points on the fibers. And if you compute with this kind of variation, then what you get is like a combination of some choosing, yeah, these have to be. Yeah, these have to be chosen very carefully. Chosen carefully. Viadelic points on the fiber. And then what you get is a combination of some things that are red A symbols. Yeah, in different. Yeah, sorry. Okay, yeah, so you get a linear combination of. Get a linear combination of some Reday symbols like this. In this case, you would get this is a sum on six terms with some coefficients. And now these so-called red eye symbols are things that you can control in terms of Robinai, of some other, of some Heisenberg extensions that depend on like the like the first two terms and do not depend on like on the last like the extension depends only on the first two terms does not depend on the last term um and these frobini are are being in extensions that are somehow new they're not really they're related to the parameters that we're choosing they're not related to the geometry um we can choose this probina to be basically whatever we want so um Want so, um, as with a correct torsion order. So, what this allows one to do is to arrange this triple variation to be whatever function you want on some grid. And so, yeah, sorry, maybe I should at least say what the triple variation is. Um, what I mean is that you have you take a grid, a three-dimensional grid of parameters on QK, and this third variation, I mean. And with third variation, I mean essentially the compositum of the three discrete differentials in the three different directions. And so if you do something like this, then you get these red eye symbols and then you can express these in terms of Frobeni, you have freedom over that. And then here you can arrange these. By arranging these, then you can use a lemma by Smith that implies that there is no value. That there is vanishing on a positive proportion of fibers of the grid. Sorry, yeah, time went on much faster than I would have hoped. Thank you. Anybody have any questions or comments? How do the red eye symbols naturally arise? New proof is some brow group theoretic explanation for them. Yes, it's because there's an H3 involved, essentially. So what you do is you can take There is a way to, instead of, you still want somehow to parameterize these quotients, and what you can do is instead of using the Brouwer group, you can use a modified version in derived categories. And it's like the following: you take the cone from you can do it with, yeah, I prefer doing it with check home all. Yeah, I prefer doing it with Czech homology for computational issues, but I mean, there's also like you can also define it without check homology. But one thing you could do is take the H2 of the cone of the pullback from the check complex of Q with coefficients in GM to the check complex of X with coefficients in GM. When I say check complex, it's not well defined because you need to fix a covering, but you can take like a coefficient. A covering, but you can take like a cofinal inverse system of coverings and take the limit only over both. And in that case, you can make this well-defined. And then, so, okay, you can take an element of VH2 of this thing. And of VH2 of this thing contains an element of like the of a two-cocycle here and a free co-cycle of this part. And when you compute the differences, The differences. The part coming from the Touco cycle, if you arrange the points carefully, it simplifies. And the only part that remains is the part coming from the Frico cycle here, so on the base. And yeah, so what you need to do is like when you want to compute it on the fibers, what you do is that you integrate. What you do is that you integrate the free Co-cycle on the specialized point, on the point where you specialize. And integrating that Co-cycle then is essentially what leads to the Reday symbol and to this kind of triple pairing behavior. Any more questions or comments? Okay, if not, then let's thank Junen again. Thank you. And let me thank all the organizers, the local organizers, and the Chennai Mathematical Institute for this beautiful stay in this beautiful place.
