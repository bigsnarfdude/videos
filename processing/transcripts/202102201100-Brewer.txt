Sarah Brewer, Professor of Mathematics at Olebauma School of Mathematics, and Ricardo Camitode, you know, Jusa, will do this session. And the topic is about folding sevens, the power of origami. Yes, so thanks. Hey, everybody. I am going to post a I am going to post a link in the chat that has a number of different documents in it that we will refer to throughout the course of our workshop. I shared the file called heptagoninsquare.png on Slack this morning. If you have access to a printer, Access to a printer, and when we, in just a little while, fold our first heptagon together. If you want to fold it on that image, you may gain some valuable insight there and maybe have an easier time. But I'm going to fold it on that image to help kind of point out some things. So, just kind of wanted to point that out in case anybody just came in. I'll go ahead and post it again. Post it again. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of the sort of context and mathematical background. And then the rest of the time today and tomorrow will be spent folding and all that good stuff. So let me go ahead and share my screen. Eric, can I ask which of those files we should be printing? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So if you are going to print, it will be this one, the heptagon and square. So the one with all the like fancy, fancy lines on it. Okay, so let's see. I'm going to go ahead and just share my desktop because I'm going to flip back and forth between GeoGebra and my PowerPoint a bit. So forgive me if you see yourself for just a minute. All right. So today we are folding seven. Are folding sevens. Just to give a little bit of background, I mentioned this yesterday, but Ricardo and I have kind of been playing around with this for the better part of the past year. This was one of our sort of quarantine projects, I guess you could say. Just trying to, you know, we wanted to take advantage of the fact that origami is a more powerful mathematical tool than Mathematical tool than the ruler and compass, and use that to be able to construct some cool Islamic geometric patterns that normally you would have to use an approximation for. But using origami, right, in theory, you can do it more perfectly. So, that was sort of the motivation for this research. So, first thing I want to look at. First thing I want to look at is just sort of a reminder of our mathematical origami axioms. Okay, so generally, you know, it's understood that we have these seven axioms, and we'll see a lot of these in place today and tomorrow. But our first axiom basically is equivalent to the Euclidean two points define a line. Two points define a line rule, right? We can make a fold that passes through any two given points. The second axiom says if we have two points, we can make a fold that places one point on the other. And that resulting creases essentially the, well, it is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment between those two points. The third axiom starts with any two lines given. Starts with any two lines given and says that there's a fold that will place one line onto the other. Now, if those lines are parallel, you know, that's just the line in between them. But if the two lines intersect, that fold line will be an angle bisector. The fourth axiom says that if we have a point and a given line, then we can Then we can make a crease or construct a line perpendicular to the given line through that given point. In origami, this is cool because basically all you have to do is fold that line onto itself. The fifth axiom is where it starts to get really interesting. And so, what the fifth axiom says is that if we have two points and a Two points and a given line, then we can construct a fold that places one of the two points onto the given line that passes through the other given point. And this is, and I've drawn the circle here to kind of help illustrate this, but it's equivalent to finding an intersection point of a circle with a line algebraic. The line algebraically. The sixth axiom, which is the one that we are primarily concerned with today, and I'll go into a lot more detail shortly, starts with two lines and two points. And what this move does is it places the two given points simultaneously onto the two given lines. And algebraically, And algebraically, this is equivalent to constructing the mutual tangent line to two parabolas. And this is a really cool thing that I'm going to get into in just a minute. And then finally, our seventh axiom says if we have a single point and two given lines, then we can place that point onto one of the given lines that's perpendicular to. That's perpendicular to the other line. Okay, all right. So let's talk about this parabola stuff. So I know that we're all geometers here, but maybe we haven't used this conic section idea in a while. And this is sort of the crux of this sixth origami axiom. And so what I'm going to do is And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually, I'm going to pull up GeoGebra now just to kind of show you how simple this is. So basically the idea is that if we have a line, so here's a line, and we have a point, then the parabola, which can construct my parabola here. The parabola is basically just the set of all points. The set of all points that are equidistant from that point that we call the focus and this line that we call the directrix. So if I just grab any random point on this parabola here, and I'm going to draw a segment to the focus, and I'm going to drop a perpendicular to my directrix. And I'm gonna turn that into a segment really quick so I can hide that line because I just want to hide the line. So now if I move this point anywhere on that parabola, it makes it kind of easy to see that those two distances are equal, right? So this is a really great. So, this is a really great visualization for students to understand what a parabola is. Because typically, you know, in the classroom, students see a parabola that points upward or points downward, and it's, you know, y equals ax squared plus bx plus c. But we don't often get to see the conic section definition in terms of this point and this line. All right, so there. All right, so there's one parabola. So now what? Oh, yeah, so one really cool exercise, which we'll do if we have time, but basically if you take a piece of paper and think about your bottom edge as your directrix, and you just pick a random point on your paper, you can do this cool thing. Paper. You can do this cool thing where you repeatedly fold that line or just, you know, mark points along that line and fold them to your focus point. And the series of creases that you end up with creates this set of tangent lines. Let me go back to my Geogebra here for a second. So this tangent line that I'm talking about. Line that I'm talking about here. So let's see, what is the name of my parabola? Parabola C. So basically, what's happening when you fold this line to this point, remember you're getting this. You're getting this angle bisector, but also it's exactly tangent at that point that is equidistant to that perpendicular at the directrix and the focus. I should have threw that in there sooner. There it is. All right, so we'll do we'll do that exercise later if we have time. There's a really good Have time. There's a really good outline of it in Tom Hall's Project Origami book. We'll refer to Tom Hall a few times in this talk. All right, so when it gets really cool is when we have two points to two lines. So let me go back in here to my GeoGebra and I'm going to color code some things. So we're going to let this first set. This first set maybe be blue since that point is already blue. I'm going to get rid of this tangent line because I don't need it. I'm going to draw another line in here, just any old line, doesn't matter, and another point. So this line is the directrix, and this point is the focus of my second parabola. And so now I'm going to construct another parabola. Construct another parabola and it turns out that these two parabolas have either no mutual tangent lines or up to three mutual tangent lines. The no tangent line thing sort of occurs when When these lines are parallel, and there's no way to get this point onto this line and this point onto this line with a single fold. But let's take a look at what happens. So this is parabolic D. All right, so what I've done here is I've put in my tangent lines and I'm just going to find some of those intersections. Let me get rid of this point that I had here before. We don't need that. So I'm going to grab some of my intersections, right? Because those are all the points of tangency of these things. And I may not be able to see this one up there, but it exists. It exists. We can see it if we move around a little bit. And so, basically, right, the idea is that no matter how I define these two points and these two lines, there's always going to be some fold, which is represented by any of those three tangents. Any of those three tangent lines that simultaneously places this point onto this line and this point onto this line. And most of the time, you know, there's more than one option. Obviously, if we're dealing with a finite piece of paper, you know, there's really only one that we care about. We care about. And I will point out shortly where you can play with some of these interactive Geogebra applets. I've shared a few of them. All right, so now comes sort of this fun diagram that basically has all of the math in it simultaneously. So it turns out It turns out, you know, in order to fold a regular heptagon, right, we need to divide a circle up into seven equal parts, right? So somehow this idea of 2 pi over 7 comes into play, okay? And so what we need to do is actually find the cosine of two positions. The cosine of 2π over 7 in order to be able to construct a regular hectagon. Now, you know, you may be thinking, well, wait, how do I find the cosine of 2 pi over 7? Well, it turns out, you know, there's all these really cool methods that people have developed that allow us to do this. And so, those of you that are up on your trigonometry, On your trigonometry, can kind of think about expanding the expression cosine of 7 theta, right? I can expand cosine of 7 theta using trig identities basically until I end up with a cubic polynomial or cubic in nature. Actually, I think this one ends up being a six-degree polynomial. Polynomial that has cosine of theta as one of its roots. Okay. And obviously, if that is one of its roots, we can replace theta with anything and it'll be true, right? So this polynomial, and let's see, hang on, if I could tell you what the polynomial that we care about here is. I wrote it down. So, if we end up with first, so here it's z cubed plus z squared minus 2z minus 1 equals 0. So, this is the polynomial that we end up with, this nice simple cubic polynomial. And this Italian mathematician named Margarita Belloc demonstrated how we could use origami to solve cubic polynomials. Solve cubic polynomials. Okay, so that's kind of what we're looking at, right? This great thing that origami can do that ruler and compass can't really stems from solving cubic polynomials. So because origami, or excuse me, ruler and compass, we're stuck in two dimensions. We can only bisect angles and solve quadratics because we're allowed to move. Because we're allowed to move through the third dimension, we can solve cubic polynomials, which is really exciting. And so, what Margarita Belloc did is she used this method that was demonstrated by Lil. And hopefully, you can see this okay, but there's this little green path in this diagram from From this blue bolded point to this red bolded point. And that path has lengths from the red point to the blue point of 1, 1, 2, 1. And I know our polynomial has coefficients 1, 1, negative 2, negative 1. But there's all these rules about turning clockwise 90 degrees and going. 90 degrees and going backwards that I'm not going to get into. But basically, the idea is that we construct this perpendicular path according to those polynomial coefficients. And then what we do is we perform this sixth origami axiom that takes those two points to two lines. And so these two points for us will go to our Points for us will go to our vertical and horizontal axes. And then once we do that, what we're able to do is construct these angles. So this line ends up being defined based on, so you can see this little pink highlighted angle here. So if you extend If you extend the line segments making that square path and bounce this particular angle that is the solution. So that is our 2 pi over 7 angle there. So that is the only angle that will allow this line to hit each side of that path exactly. Of that path exactly at that angle. Now, obviously, like, you know, that might be a little bit hard to find, you know, if you don't know sort of the how to go forwards and backwards and all that stuff, right? If you don't know that you even needed the polynomial in the first place. But that's okay. We're going to show you how to find this through. Going to show you how to find this through folding. Okay, so I'll talk a lot more about this diagram whenever we get to actually folding the heptagon, but I did want to kind of throw this whole idea together because we do see the red dotted line and the red point are the focus and directrix of this red parabola. The blue dotted line and this blue point are the focus and directrix of this parabola. And we will fold. Fold a belloc move, as it is called, in order to find this point over here that is the cosine of 2 pi over 7. Okay, so how does this connect to Islamic art? So hopefully tomorrow some of you will go to Samir Meehan's workshop where she's going to show how to construct some Islamic geometric. Some Islamic geometric patterns. But these patterns have been an interest of mine for a really, really long time, and Ricardo's also. They sort of interested me because of the really cool circle packings that show up in the underlying geometric constructions. And I'll probably post a few more links to some cool GeoGebra things that are not quite related to our talk. Not quite related to our talk, but I'll post them on Slack so you can play around with some Islamic stuff. But basically, you know, what do we mean by Islamic art? Well, it's, you know, any of these geometric patterns that you find in parts of the world that were under Caliphate rule. So it's a very, very vague, wide open definition, but most people see the geometric connection, right? You see these. The geometric connection, right? You see these patterns everywhere from southern Spain, the Middle East, India, Northern Africa, etc. And while sevenfold designs and heptagons aren't exactly common in these patterns, they do appear. And I would say more often than not, they appear. More often than not, they appear as irregular heptagons that are just a consequence of the construction around them. But we do have historic evidence of perfectly regular heptagons, especially in the literature. Now, you know, without origami, most of, you know, most of these artisans were using Euclidean ruler and Using Euclidean ruler and compass geometry. And so most of the time they were using an approximation. So a really common one is if you have a radius of one to use root three over two as the side length. And there's documentation for that. But we do see perfect regular heptagons. And the one that we are going to fold tomorrow is this. Tomorrow is this pattern from what's referred to as the anonymous Persian Compendium. So, this document, which only recently, a couple of years ago, had an English translation available. We're not sure of the date. It's got to be post-1500 based on specific references that are made in the document. References that are made in the document that, you know, he does refer, I say he, maybe, maybe it's a woman. The geometer refers to, you know, certain discoveries that had happened fairly late. And so, you know, roughly, let's say 1500. It's just generally referred to as a medieval document. But this pattern has these perfectly regular heptagons. And one thing I love about, so it's written. So it's written in Persian, which I don't read, but so I'm very thankful for the translation. But one of the great things about this, the directions in this compendium, is that the author gives what I have highlighted here on the left in the dark dashed lines and the red lines as construction instructions. And then he just says that, well, the rest of this is easy, God willing, basically. God willing, basically. But we're going to walk you through the whole thing and not assume that it's easy. And a cool, you know, there's so much cool stuff about this pattern, especially the way that it fits inside the larger heptagon, as you can see on the right. So, what we're going to start out with looking at today is just a basic sevenfold rotation. Um, seven-fold rosette pattern because these are sort of ubiquitous in Islamic design. You see these with many symmetries, and so we're gonna just look at a simple seven-fold rosette. But basically, the idea is that for one of these patterns to have the correct proportions, you want your outer four edges of your petal shapes. Petal shapes. So here you can see seven petal shapes around a central seven-pointed star. Is you want those petal shapes to have equal edge lengths on the outer four edges. And your stars, so it's they're generally referred to as star rosette patterns, your stars, which will only be regular five-pointed stars if you're in like a tenfold symmetry. Fold symmetry. So most of the time these stars are irregular, but you want them to fit in perfectly inscribed in a circle. So we're not going to construct this entire motif today, but we will construct the central rosette part. And so before we get into, you know, folding our heptagon and our rosette, you know, I want to sort of put You know, I want to sort of put out a who cares little tidbit here. So, in constructing these patterns with a ruler and compass, oftentimes you have to be really, really creative in your solutions. Insomuch that you want to do as little construction as possible in order to get to your final pattern, right? Right, but in order to say construct an angle bisector or a perpendicular bisector of a line segment, you have to do quite a few moves with a ruler and compass. Whereas if you fold these patterns with origami, well, constructing an angle bisector is just as simple as putting a line on top of another line and constructing a And constructing a perpendicular bisector to a line segment is as simple as just bringing the two endpoints of that line segment onto each other. And so, you know, this idea of folding Islamic geometric patterns totally makes sense. And I see why Ricardo was immediately drawn to it as an origami artist. And I'm sure he can tell you a whole lot. And I'm sure he can tell you a whole lot more about that as we move on in our workshop. But I know, just personally, the process of folding these patterns really gave me a much deeper understanding of their internal geometry, much more so than I appreciated when I was just drawing them with a ruler and compass. And a lot of that stems from, you know, You know, so much of the mirror symmetry that we see in these patterns that we can much more easily and quickly attain through origami. And then, you know, there's just other cool things that happen. Like, you know, you can use these geometric patterns themselves as crease patterns for other origami, whether you want to turn it into Want to turn it into a cool corrugation or a tessellation, and you can transform, you know, what was already something interesting flat with decrease lines. You can turn into something that's three-dimensional and, you know, even use this to construct an origami animal or something. So there's a whole lot of kind of unlocked potential in folding these patterns. These patterns. So, if you look in the Google Drive folder that I shared, there's a paper here called Folding Sevens that basically just like use all the same kind of stuff that I just talked about. So, you have it to refer to later. But on the very last page, there are some links to some. To some interactive geogebras. So if you want to play around with the mutual tangents to two parabolas or anything like that, there's links to a handful of other things. So we're going to be following Tom Hull's heptagon construction. And if you know, you don't necessarily need to refer to that as we're folding it, but if you want to, there's a link. To, there's a link to it there, which I will maybe Ricardo can put that link in the chat. Anyway, so that's yeah, so that's Folding 7's paper in the Google Drive. And so I'm gonna stop sharing now and I'm gonna switch to my document camera. At any point, anyone has any questions? You know, we're going to sort of tag team, I think, monitoring the chat and whatnot. So, all right. I think Joseph and Hadiet has have a Hajed has a question here. Take a look. They kind of raise their hands, so maybe they can unmute. Oh, yeah. Okay, this is Joe Everark. Yeah. You have evidence that in the medieval design, they were using origami folds? No. No. So we don't have any evidence that they were using origami. That they were using origami. But, I mean, there is evidence that. They did do origami, though. Not for Islamic patterns, but they did do origami. There's this famous design called Pajarita, which means little bird in Spain. And it's like famously a reinterpretation of the fortune teller. But it is like an Islamic heritage kind of thing. I think maybe, maybe it's worth going into that deeper. But they did fold. So there's that. They did fold, so there's that. Oh, cool. Thank you. Yeah. And there's definitely, we know that at least, you know, by the year 1000, they knew how to solve cubic polynomials in Persia. And so, you know, there's a lot of this sort of all the pieces were there for them to be able to do this. But, you know, the question of did your average artisan that was Artisan that was putting up these mosaics actually do all this? I mean, signs point to know they probably just used a set square that had that angle right, but somebody made that set square the perfect angle. And that's what, you know, there's little evidence of how they arrived at that in particular. But we know all the pieces were there. Was there another question? Was there another question? Yes, Khajadev also has her hand. I don't know if she would like to unmute her or if that's just going to stay up there. All right. Maybe not. Maybe not, yeah. All right. Holler, if you got any more questions. All right. So I hope everyone, if you wanted to fold on this diagram. On this diagram, has it printed out. If not, you know, take a minute to cut that out. If you don't have this or don't have access to a printer, that's totally fine. We can start with any size sheet of paper and construct a square. So, you know, if you are that beginner at origami that you have not constructed a square from a rectangle. A square from a rectangle before. Well, we just learned how to construct a square, well, sort of a square from a rectangle in the last session, right? But it's a little bit different than that. So we can just take our short edge to our long edge and then remove the little bit of rectangle that you have left over. That you have left over in order to get yourself a square to start with. And certainly, if you already have square origami paper, that's totally fine too. So Ricardo and I will both be folding this simultaneously. You know, whatever view you have controls on your Zoom of how you want to set that up. I'm not sure if the host. The host is going to pin one of us, or not. You can pin me if you would like, but Ricardo is folding also. And then he's going to walk us through the rosette. So I've already got my square here. So you can either cut that off or crease back and forth and tear it off, which is what I usually do. So the reason that I wanted to fold on top of this diagram. To fold on top of this diagram is just to sort of give us these references as to what is actually going on when we make all of these different folds. So remember the idea of the sixth origami axiom, which is going to be the key thing that we use here, is that we're folding two points onto two lines. So basically the first So basically, the first thing that we want to do is identify those two lines and those two points that we want to match up. And so for us, the two lines are our middle horizontal and our middle vertical. Okay. And so those are what we're going to fold first. So, you know, as easy as just folding your piece of paper in half, so you fold your square. So, you're fold your square in half. And if you have the printed one, it's nice and reassuring when your creases show up where they should. And I generally fold a whole lot slower than Ricardo does. So maybe it's a good thing. But if I go too fast, you know, But if I go too fast, definitely unmute and ask me to repeat and slow down. So I'll show the reverse side of this so that you can see what I've done there. So I've just folded in half and in half. So you can see on Ricardo's page maybe that he has a little bit of evidence of that diagonal crease from creating the square from a rectangle. If you did that, just be careful not to be subdued. Just be careful not to be seduced by that fold, okay? Um, because there's going to be a lot going on, and oftentimes, you know, origami, um, the paper wants to do what's easiest, and oftentimes that's not what's correct. So just be careful. All right, so what we want to do is we're kind of thinking about this as a two by two square, and this midpoint is the origin, and this. Is the origin and this right-hand point is the point one zero. Okay, and so the next point we want to find is this point at zero, one half. Well, how do I bisect this line segment? Well, I use the origami axiom that says through a point I can construct a perpendicular to a given line. So all I have to do is. To a given line. So all I have to do is fold this line onto itself. Well, sort of the shortcut here, right, is that I'm just folding that top edge onto that midline. But it also helps just to be able to double check that this line is indeed falling onto itself. Actually, just for sake of seeing what I'm doing, we want that, eventually we'll want that folded back. So this will become a mountain fold. And so now we have three creases in our paper. We've got our vertical, we've got our horizontal, and then we have the horizontal halfway between. Horizontal halfway between our top edge and our midline. All right, so now we want to look, and now that point right here is clearly defined, right? It's an intersection of these two lines. So next we want to find this one, and this line right here is halfway in between this and the bottom edge. So you can either So, you can either like leave that folded and then fold this to that line, or you can have it unfolded and fold it up. I generally find that I have fewer errors, the fewer folds I have in my paper when I make a crease. So I generally like to have that unfolded when I'm folding. But I think it's a little bit of a personal preference. And technically speaking, we don't need this folded all the way across in order to achieve our purposes. And we really only need it folded in this one little area. But just for sake of matching my diagram, I'm folding all the way across. So I've got this line intersecting to define that point. Intersecting to define that point. Now I want this line, which again is just a midline between my vertical and my left-hand edge. So I'm going to fold my left-hand edge to the center. So this is going to be the mirror image of what you would have if you were folding it on plain paper. But Ricardo's got it over there on plain paper too. All right, so now we clearly have our two points defined and we have And we have our two lines. So here comes the bell lock move, right? The sixth origami axiom. So what we want to do is we want to fold these two points to these two lines simultaneously, right? Well, we've got a little bit of a hint here as to where they're going to land, okay? But in order to kind of make it easier to do this, Easier to do this. Usually, what we'll do is we'll fold in such a way that the point is at an edge. So I'm folding this top quarter of the paper back, and I'm folding this left quarter of the paper back. So that now the two points that I want to bring to those two lines are at edges. Okay, and that'll just help us visualize. Will just help us visualize it. If you are using plain paper, what I recommend doing, you know, is with a pen, maybe kind of mark on the back where those points are to sort of help guide you in case you lose them. What line are we folding them to? So, to identify these two points, I folded the top quarterback. The top quarterback and the left quarterback, and I will be folding this point to the original horizontal midline, and I'll be folding this point to the original vertical midline. Right? Because this is the focus of this parabola, and this is the directrix of that parabola. And to find a tangent line to And to find a tangent line to this parabola, I fold this point. Any line, any fold I make taking this point to this line constructs a tangent line. And any fold I make taking this point to this line constructs a tangent line to this parabola. So if I do those two things simultaneously, what I get is a tangent line that is That is tangent, or I get a line that is tangent to both parabolas. Okay, so if I have those both folded back, what I want to do is, you know, you sort of, you don't want to bend it too much, but you just sort of curl it, curl your paper until you find the place where this point lines up with this line, and this point lines up. And this point lines up with this line, you know. She says best you can. So just line those two things up simultaneously. And I'll be in trouble if I don't do it as accurately as I can since I'm demonstrating. And then we want to put in that crease. Now we don't technically need that crease through all of these. Need that crease through all of these layers of paper. The main one that's important is the bottom layer here. But by having those folded back, it does make it a little bit easier to line up those two points to those two lines because otherwise, you know, you have all this paper in the way and you can't see what you're doing. So, hopefully, we've got that. So, is everybody getting there? So is everybody getting there? So these two points to these two lines. Now, it turns out that where this point hits this line, that's our cosine of 2 pi over 7. We just found it. There it is. And so to define. And so, to define that, right, right now all we have is this line. So, what we're going to do is we want to fold this part back perpendicular. So this edge will land on itself. We're going to fold that back exactly through that point. And when I'm doing this on plain paper, I find it. This is on plain paper, I find it again really, really helpful to grab a pen and you know mark that point because otherwise you might lose it. But so we find that point and then we're going to fold this guy backwards at that point. And so oftentimes what's sort of helpful is to make a little bit of a pinch at that intersection. At that intersection that you want, and then you know, use the paper to make sure it's straight, right? So, like, we don't want it all wonky, we want this line to be perpendicular. So, I'm making sure my bottom edge lines up, and I'm making sure my top edge lines up. Mine's not absolutely. Mine's not absolutely perfect, but it's okay. I'll kind of show that again, real quick, just to make sure everybody's with me. So I'm folding the top quarterback, left quarterback, these two points to these two lines simultaneously. This point on that line. On that line defines my cosine of 2π over 7, which we want to find as a vertical line by folding this back. And so then once we have this. So you folding, sorry, could you repeat the by folding this back part? I was trying to draw my point. Yeah, so, okay, so you've got this point. Yeah. So what we want to construct. So, what we want to construct is a line that's perpendicular to this line, which also happens to be perpendicular to the top and bottom edges through that point. So the way I do that is I start by pinching it back at that point to find the point. And then I use the edges of my paper. So I'll sort of flip it over and use the edges of my paper and make sure that they're. And make sure that they're lining up with themselves correctly, and that this line, this midline falls on itself accurately. And just sort of, you have all these references to help you make sure that that line is actually perpendicular through that point. Okay. Hopefully, I did that right. I don't have the printed paper, so that's all right. It is maybe more confusing. All right, so now we've got our cosine of 2 pi over 7. So what? So now what we want to do is we've got this line and we're going to take this point, which is at 1, 0, so this place where we want our heptagon vertex to be, so at the midpoint. To be so at the midpoint of that right edge, we're going to take that point and we're going to pivot it about the origin, so where our vertical and horizontal originally intersected. And we're going to use this fifth origami axiom that says if you have two points, you can always bring one of those points onto a given line. So this is A given line. So, this is our given line, and these are our two points. So, I can always bring a point onto a line that passes through another given point. Okay, now again, we want to kind of set our paper up in such a way that's going to make this a little bit more reasonable. And if I want to pivot about this point, I would much rather that point. I would much rather that point be on an edge. So, when I'm doing this, I like to fold this left half of my sheet of paper back. And I want to think about this midpoint here as my pivot point. Okay, so now it's the midpoint of this left-hand fold. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to fix or anchor. To fix or anchor this point, and we want to think about this as my radius. And so basically, what you're going to kind of do is you're going to loosely fold this thing, so kind of pivoting up on that midpoint until this hits that vertical line that we just folded in. That we just folded in. So I'll kind of show that pivot again. So I'm pivoting from the origin and I'm pivoting until this line segment or this end point of that line segment lands on the vertical. And then once we have that, we're going to put in the crease. And so, what we actually put in is our first actually 14-fold division of the circle. Of the circle. Because generally, if you are going to fold an n-gon, you would put in two n radial divisions. Similarly, if you're trying to construct an n-fold rosette in Islamic geometric pattern, you want to put in two n-fold radial divisions. So, has everybody got that little pivot move there? Awesome. So then all we need to do is extend this line. So right now we only have it folded from here to here. So if you just unfold your paper and then fold it back along there, you can fold the rest of the way across. And so now we have these two lines, and maybe at this point I can almost sort of flip it over. These two lines are really the only ones that we care about now. And everything else here is a distraction, which makes folding a heptagon pretty tough in terms of all. Pretty tough in terms of all the different symmetries and polygons you can fold in an origami, just because there's all this sort of setup you have to do to get those creases in the right place. And so what we're going to do basically now is use mirror symmetry to get those creases all the way around. Okay. And so This is a little trick that I learned from Ricardo. So, basically, what we want to do if we want to mirror a fold across another fold is you want to fold in half. Let's see, make sure I say this correctly. So, you want to fold in half first the line that you want to. First, the line that you want to mirror, and then you fold in half along the line that you're mirroring across. And so both of these folds are already there. And then what we're going to do, so half of this mirror line will be a mountain, and the other half will become a valley. And so what happens? Valley. And so, what happens is when I fold along this line and then back along this line, if I let my horizontal line fold back on itself here, I can now just copy this bottom crease here by just letting this fold flat. Shall I show it again? Okay. Please. Yeah. So what our goal is, right, is we want to copy this line. So I'm not focused on the whole thing just yet. So just this half. I want to copy this line across this line. So I want to. This line. So I want to think about this horizontal line as a mirror line, and this is the line that I want to reflect across that mirror. So I'm going to fold, and this is where Ricardo and I sort of diverge from Tom Hole's heptagon construction directions. So we're going to hold this line that we want to copy first and then And then we want to fold the line that we want to mirror across. So I've got my horizontal here. This mirror line will now be one orientation on the right half. On the left half, it's going to have the opposite orientation. So if I have my paper situated like this, the thing I'm trying to Situated like this. The thing I'm trying to copy is a valley. My right-hand horizontal is a mountain. My left-hand horizontal is a valley. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to let that left-hand side of the horizontal fall flat. So these creases were already there, and this crease is already there. And so all I want to do is just. And so all I want to do is just let this flatten on itself. Okay. And now while we're here, we may as well copy an angle by doing this hinge move. So, what we're going to do is we're going to open this guy up right here, be very, being very Here. Being very careful that our paper doesn't shift. So I kind of like to square it up a little bit before I do this and hold it nice and firm and flat with my hand as I'm doing it, because otherwise, you know, sometimes the paper shifts a little bit. And so what you can do is open this up on a little hinge here and flatten that crease into place as well. And so notice these are really close to some of those other lines that were there in our construction that aren't necessarily needed. So I've got now a few different lines here that we've constructed. So let's see which ones we already extended this one. Extended this one. So the next one I did was I copied that one here. Well, I only have half of it. So just like here, I'm going to refold along that line and I'm going to extend it all the way across. And the same thing. And then, same thing for this one next to it that we copied with the hinge. So, I'm going to extend this one all the way across. At this point, it doesn't really matter if they're mountains or valleys. We can arrange them in mountain valley as needed later. But I notice I only have half of it, so I'm going to fold it back and then continue that fold across. And I'm going to just kind of keep track of the ones I have. So I've got this one. I've now got this one. I've got this one, this one, this one. So I'm just sort of matching them around. So line, line. Line here and here. So we're basically going to kind of do the same process to get the rest of these drawn in so we can sort of, you know, take our pick of what we want to copy. So let's say, for instance, now instead of copying this line across the horizontal, now I want to copy the horizontal across that line. Across that line, right? So this time I'll fold my horizontal first and then I'll fold the, you know, that first pi over 14 or 2 pi over 14 line. So this pi over 7 division. And half of it will be a valley. And half of it will be a valley, and the other half will be a mountain. So, if you wanted to kind of go ahead and situate that, might make things a little bit easier. So, half of it is a valley, half of it's a mountain. So, I'm folding along this side first, and then you know, so I could, I could think about it doing it like, you know, just folding in half, and then I'm bringing. And then I'm bringing this part down along that pi over 7 division, but then I'm letting my paper collapse on the other half of that pi over 7 division. Where I have a crease already here, I don't have a crease already here, and when I flatten it, it will exactly line up with that. With that pi over seven division that I had at first. So I'll show it again. So I'm situating it to where I have that first pi over seven division above my horizontal. I'm folding in half along my horizontal in order to copy this horizontal across. This horizontal across that division, that's going to become a valley, and the other half of that division will become a mountain. And so this crease is, in theory, not there yet, right? But I'm going to fold along that division and I'm going to let this paper flatten with this. With this other half of the division in a mountain. And just like we did before, we can put one of those hinge moves in while we're here. Ah, sorry, Susan. Yeah, this construction can be a lot, which is why so that you're not totally left behind when we do. Left behind when we do the continuing steps. There is just a plain heptagon image file in the Google Drive folder, which you're more than welcome to print out, print and cut out to do the Islamic patterns that we're going to construct. But we will go through the steps of folding the Heft Ghana tomorrow. All right, so I'm going to put in another. All right, so I'm gonna put in another radial division by doing the hinge move here. So now I've managed to copy my crease here and I've put in another one there, which gives me this division and this division. Again, you know, I mean, it kind of Again, you know, I mean, it kind of helps to keep track of them. Oftentimes, like what I'll do actually is take a pencil and draw them in as I get them so that I don't confuse them with some of those other creases that I already have from my construction itself. But I mean, you know, we're almost there. So what I want to do next is I want to extend those two creases into the other quadrant. Into the other quadrant. So I'm just going to fold back along this and then flatten my paper to extend it across. And I want to extend this one that we did with our hinge all the way across. And it looks like now I'm just missing one division. One division, one little division left, which you know we can get a number of different ways. We could do what Ricardo likes to call the double mountain trick, is I could just take two of those divisions next to it and bring those two lines together. So we can make them both mountain folds. them both mountain folds and bring those two lines together. So that's our, what is that? That's our third origami axiom that allows us to bring a line onto another line. So I can mash those two lines up and get the crease that way. Okay, and I can do the same thing on the other side, or I could just fold that in half and then extend it. So I can bring these. So, I can bring these two radial divisions together to get the one in between. Or we could do the copy the angle across a mirror trick again. There's a number of different ways that you can approach this. Notice one thing in particular. You do not have mirror symmetry across this vertical line. So do not let this vertical line here. Let this vertical line here throw you off because once we've used it to construct that cosine of 2π over 7, this guy is just there to distract you and throw you off. So be cautious of this vertical line treacherous antagonist here. So yeah, I'm just going to do the little double mountain trick. So I've got these two radial divisions. I'm missing These two radial divisions, I'm missing the last one in between. And so I could just have the half and then extend across. I generally like to line it up on both sides. And there's, you know, there's some reassurance. And there's, you know, there's some reassurance when you see that these radial divisions. Well, mine aren't perfect, are they? Yeah, so I have a couple of issues here. Let's see what happened. Somehow, when I was practicing this morning, like, you know, everything went perfect and I was like, oh, Ricardo, let me demonstrate the folding of. Let me demonstrate the folding of the heptagon because I have all these great mathematical insights. And then look at what happened. This guy does not go through the vertex. So I did something crazy here. So don't feel bad if your heptagon was not perfect because there is a lot going on. I'm starting over myself. Oh no, let's see what happened here. Here. What did I do? Um, okay, so we did this, and then we did this move, and then I did this one, and so that one was all well and good and hmm. No, it was really just that last one that was the troublemaker. Oh, ha. You know what I did? I was seduced by the vertical line. That vertical line troublemaker, such a troublemaker. That's not the mountain that we want to double mountain because that's not the division. This one, that's the one. This one, that's the one that we had there. You know, do as I say, not as I do, is the saying, right? Yeah, so sorry about that. There I was just verbally warning about that vertical line. And then what happened? I folded on that. So this line and this line are the ones that you want to do your double mountain trick on. And then that will get the line in the right place. Get the line in the right place. Not what I did. Sorry about that. So now I have this extra gross crease that's not supposed to be there, but it's fine. That's where it's supposed to be at the vertex of my heptagon, not that other thing. So. So, oh, yeah, mine is really gross for demonstration purposes, but I'm going to go in and draw these in boldly. Watch out for that vertical line, folks. So, these are the radial divisions that we have now. I got it this time. So, what you can see, once we have our radial divisions, okay, the point where this right-hand end point hit this perpendicular line that we folded in, that's going to be our next vertex of our heptagon. Of our heptagon. Okay, so remember we did this little hinge move, right? Hinging from our origin point to find this point. That point there, along with the point that we folded to it, defines one edge of our hectagon. And so, what we can do is make a Is make a fold through those two points to define the edge of our heptagon. So in theory, we have the radial line there and we have this vertical. So you should have that intersection there through that second radial and that vertical at cosine 2 pi over 7. And so I'm just folding in a line between these two points. And that defines the edge of our heptagon. And sort of from here, I mean, you could do sort of an order. I mean, you could do sort of an origami, okay? Let's mirror that around approach. Or at this point, you really can do. So those of you that are familiar with origami, putting it into that sort of familiar crane or water bomb base where you alternate mountain valley, mountain valley, mountain valley. Valley, mountain valley with your radials. So if you let these fall in an alternating way, so I'm having to change the orientation of some of mine to make this thing work. And then if you fold it to, I sort of lost my, I lost my, I have like. I lost my. I have like having all this information on here really doesn't help. This line, that's the line that I want to copy. So I'm going to have that on top. I just kind of want half of my paper on one side and half on the other. And so, what we can do, sort of, once we have it in this like Christmas tree form. Like Christmas tree form. You could fold through all the layers to get that crease in there, or you can just take scissors or an X-Acto knife and cut it all the way across. But ultimately, you're going to want to cut that off. So if you fold it, you'll have to tear it off or whatever your preferred removal of the outer bit of paper is. But if you have scissors or an exact, If you have scissors or an X Facto knife handy, just cutting across that line is what we want to define. So, this is like the fold and cut problem, right, is getting that polygon with one cut. So, if you wanted to get the creases in the right location, sort of in a simple Sort of in a simple way. You know, you can just fold across and then go back in and tighten them up as you go around. You know, let's assume we don't have scissors and we're just going to do a fold and tear sort of thing. So I like to use my fingernail to destroy. To destroy those fibers of the paper and weaken them. So I'm just tightening all of these creases really good. And I'm going to do them one way and then I'm going to fold my paper over and I'm going to do it the other way. Now, I would normally just cut it across because that's easier, but we didn't say to bring scissors. How did your seven, your, you know, your divisions and your heptagons turn out? So somehow when you kind of So, somehow, when you collapse it into the little Christmas tree thing, you know, oh, Samira, yours looks so good. When you do the collapse, then you can kind of see whether you are accurate or not. That's when all the truth is revealed. And I'll tell you, I've had many, many inaccurate. Many and inaccurate folding of this heption. Like, for some reason, my first one wasn't bad, but then, like, the next five were terrible. And then, you know, it was, no, what happened? I seem to have a hole in the middle of mine. We did do, we gave that origin quite the workout. And notice that the origin, and that's sort of a good, a good point. And that's sort of a good point to make. Notice that the origin of our paper is in this particular case, the same as the origin of the heptagon. Okay. You know, depending on how you fit the heptagon in the square, they may not necessarily be the same. No, so it is not. No, so it is not possible to construct a perfectly regular heptagon by a compass and ruler. There are very, there are, you know, pretty accurate approximations that you can construct using a compass and ruler. And I talk about this a little bit more in the paper in the Google Drive folder. But basically, the rule is that in order to construct In order to construct a polygon, a regular polygon with a compass and straight edge, that polygon has to have a number of sides that is either a power of two or a product of a power of two and a Fermat prime. So a Fermat prime being So a Fermat prime being a prime number of the form 2 to the 2 to the n. And so there's only a few of these that are actually even known. 5 being one of them, 2 squared plus 1. Let's see, I listed them out. 17 is another one. Is another one, two to the fourth plus one. So you can construct a 17 gone with a ruler and compass, but you can't construct a 17 gone, but you can't construct a 7 gone with a ruler and compass. But because of this Belloc move and introducing the ability to solve cubic equations, in addition to being able In addition to being able to bisect angles and get those powers of two, we can also now trisect angles and get powers of three. And so with origami, we can construct any polygon that is powers of two on an edge, number of sides, powers of three number of sides. Number of sides, or any number that's a product of a power of two times a power of three times any Pierpont prime, any number of unique Pierpont primes, which are of the form 2 to the n times 3 to the m plus 1. So for instance, 7 is 2 times 3 plus 1, and 13 is 2 squared. is 2 squared times 3 plus 1. Just do you have a question? Yeah. Yes. Does it take fewer moves in origami to construct the 17 Gon? Which is a famous one from... Yeah, you know, I have not yet tried to construct a 17 Gan with origami, but that's a very origami but that's that's a very good that's a good question um i'm sure it would be i'm sure it would take fewer moves just because simple things like bisecting an angle take such fewer moves using using origami um but um yeah no that's that's a really good question um yeah i have yet to to try to construct um a seventeen gone with with origami yet With origami yet. Yeah, there you go. That one is left as an exercise for the reader. So, yeah, so the steps to construct the heptagon were following Tom Hull's. Let's see, let me grab the link to that for you. Hang on. Hang on. I lost it. Do you think we have time for the rosette construction? I think we do. It doesn't take very long once we have the optagon. Right on. Yeah, so Ricardo is going to take over now, and I'm going to monitor the chat and things. And we're going to pretty quickly, you will be surprised. Will be surprised, turn this into a sevenfold rosette. And I just posted the link to Tom Pol's paper that has the construction steps for the regular heptagon. So if you want to give that a go tonight to have a few heptagons to work from tomorrow, I guess that's a homework assignment. But we will construct a heptagon tomorrow to start off. Gone tomorrow to start off. All right, so I'm going to hand this over to you now, Ricardo. All right, thank you, sir. That was amazing. I got to say thank you for all that. I'm learning every time I talk to you about seven, so I feel like I'm learning something. I don't know if I forget or if I'm just hearing some new stuff. All right, so we're going to begin from where we left off in a way. So we're sort of taking into account that we have the radio lines constructed. The radio lines constructed. That we have the line that goes from the center to the vertex and line that goes from the center to the midpoint of the edge. I have them here color-coded to indicate which one is which. Also, because we're going to need them to be in different fold states. That means that one of them is going to be in a mountain fold and the other is going to be in a valley. The reason being that we need this heptagon to become this reduction. This reduction. This form is usually called a collapse. And in a square, this is called a water bomb. So when we have these lines in a square, we call that a water bomb base. But to generalize it, we don't call it a water bomb in other polygons. Usually, well, it's usually referred to as a preliminary base. If you go in the, yeah, exactly. Sarah shared in the chat the instructions. So there are two ways to collapse this heptagon. Collapse this heptagon. It happens for all polygons. So you can have it in the way that you get these two right triangles, or if you open it up so much that it starts to close in on the other side, you get a kite shape, which is also the same two right triangles, but together on the hypotenuse instead of the altitude or the height. And so we want to be here, pretty much. Although I'm skipping a step here, I always get excited. A step here. I always get excited. So, here's what we need to do: we need to open it up first. We need to be in the heptagon, and we need to do a heptagon inside of the heptagon, a heptagon that's connected on the midpoints of the edges. So, just keep in mind your midpoints of edges, and just fold the line that goes from there to there, pretty much. So, just keep in mind that to there, like this, and you fold. You could also fold this in the kite shape, of course. And what I mean by that is you could be in. Could be in this mode, and from here it's almost like easier kind of to just fold this and unfold it. So you can fold, you can use the edges here as a reference, so you can just fold, unfold, and you perform what is called a little miracle, where you can just take this flap and just move it to the other side. I don't know why, but that's called a little miracle. I forget why. Sarah probably remembers, I don't. But it was explained to us by a fellow folder. I don't know if it was Ben or Mike that told us. I think it was. I don't know if it was Ben or Mike that told. I think it was Mike. I don't remember why it was called that. I think it was because it's the same shape, but now it's like a different part of the region of paper. I don't remember, but there's a reason why, but it's a little miracle when we do this. So you can perform little miracles all around and fold your little vertex down onto the radio line. So off it goes, and you unfold, and you fold, and you go. And you unfold and you fold and you go, following that all around. Technically, we only need to do this once, technically, but we're going to do it all around because we want to, I'm going to assume that you don't have scissors, so we're not going to do a cutout. But if you do have scissors, it's a lot more fun. Or exacto knives rather. So we're going to leave that. We're going to see how that works. Anyway, a lot of the folding or the excitement of folding has to do with the meditative. Has to do with the meditative aspects of it, right? You can just do an algorithmic process, you repeat, and you let your mind sort of drift off into whatever corners it usually goes. So, there it is. So, I'm going to draw in the line that I just folded, this one. And so, because it's an odd number and we only have two sides to this thing, my right-hand side is going to have either four or three flaps to keep balance, right? So, in this case, my To keep balance, right? So in this case, my right-hand side has one, two, three, and four, and my left has one, two, three. It's the most balanced state I can think of because if we have two and five, then it's sort of, you know, a little bulgy. So we want to keep it as balanced as we can make it. So four and three. And then I'm going to orient this this way in a kite shape. And I'm going to take the edge here and fold that onto the radial line. This is the radius because that's the vertex right there. And we fold that onto it and we fold both of them like this. And we fold both of them like this, like that, and we're going to do what's called an inside reverse fold. So, we're going to do a fold like I just did, like there. I'm going to unfold. I'm going to open up this. I call that with the kids, I say it's a crocodile mouth. So, you open that up inside, ah, you know, and this same fold you push it in. See that? Push it in. See that? And you know, here you have the option. You can just take it down as such, or you can just leave it up and wait to finish the rest of them and then do that. Up to you. I'm going to pretend that I didn't fold that. So it's starting to look like that, like I'm shaving off those folds. So I got to do that for all of them now. So off we go. So, off we go. And you can perform your little miracles to keep balance. So, if you do, if you go from the three to the four side and create an imbalance, you can on the back balance it off, right? Trying to keep at all times a four and three combination in order to avoid too much pressure on the center. So, you can just fold, and there's a very um how do you say there are many ways. How do you say there are many ways to do these things? So you can see here for me, I'm instead of keeping my paper sort of condensed or clapped, I clapped. I kind of open it up and fold this within like this. So you can also go like that, depending on how you want to do it. As long as you can return to form, it's all good. This is like that preliminary crane steps. Steps. Yeah, this is exactly how you fold a crane on the square, by the way. Exactly the way. So it's interesting to think of that the crane might hold an Islamic pattern there. We just haven't seen it yet. And you can think of also the congruency that's happening here because we're taking this amount, right? The amount that goes from the vertex to the midpoint, right, and we're putting that on. Right, and we're putting that on the radio line. See, so it's almost as if we're using a compass kind of thing. I like to think of it like that-like it's a circle happening here. The metaphor that folding and circles are interconnected is the reason why it's so powerful, I feel. Just how close to circles these things are is just very inspiring and nice. And it's also what justifies it as a mathematical, as a mathematical. Justifies it as a mathematical as a mathematical tool. So once I have this all folded up, now it looks like this. Do you think we should table this till the start of tomorrow? This 1.32? Excuse me? Should we table this till the start of tomorrow? Are we out of time? I believe we are three minutes over now. Now. Well, yeah, I mean, you can follow the instructions from here, but I'll just show you the most difficult part. So, here's what you need to fold all these down. So, I'm just going to rush it so you can see at least that we finished it. Now, if you follow along, well, we can also do it tomorrow, but I'm just going to rush through it. It shouldn't take a minute. Yeah. How you guys feeling, by the way? You guys enjoying this? Feel free to unmute and comment or whatever. I gave up 30 minutes ago, but I think I'm going to try again tomorrow. It's like 8.30 p.m. here, so I've had a long day. Nice. Is it cold where you are? Is it cold? No, no. No, no, no, no, no. But I've had a long day of doing a lot and it's hard to keep focus right now. So I'm going to try again in the morning. Yeah, I got the advantage that here it's 1.30 p.m. Yeah, you're still fresh. Yeah, exactly. I'm still in the first cup of coffee, too. So here's what you do. So you get these folded down like so, all of the seven. Fold it down like so, all of the seven at the same time. You have this dart-looking thing, right? And now the idea is to take the folder. You can sort of see there, I can have it here drawn in. You can see on this layer, right? And the idea now is to hold this shape, this dart with all the seven sticking out, and then pull these up like so. Like use in the diagram, I showed that these lines are valleys, and then the line between is a mountain, and it's opposed to. Is a mountain, and it's supposed to look like this. So you can just fold it in and squish it on these lines, and it's supposed to like stick out like that. And the idea is that you have to do this for all of them. So the fold is already there. You just have to sort of, you know, stick it out, put it into position, and then return to your dart form and go on to the next one. You can just, what I do is I put my middle finger in between. I lift it up and I use my thumb and forefinger to squeeze on the valley. So the middle finger goes and pushes the mountain up. Finger goes and pushes the mountain up, and my forefinger and thumb push the valleys down. And so, with that motion, I can just pretty easily fold the things. Also, what I like to do is I like to what I call traveling. The idea being that you can sort of see where the fold is happening. So, for instance, here, I can put the point in here. And if I wanted that point to travel, I can sort of do this tilting motion with my fingers and travel to where I need it. To where I need it to be, so that's also the advantage of using edges for folds. So you can just take them where you want them to be. So, okay, all right. I think I have my dart shape with the thing sticking out. Oh, I'm missing one. There you go. So it should look a little bit something like this crazy thing. And now we must return to the kite shape where there was the two right triangles, right? So the folds that we needed are here. The folds that we needed are here already waiting for us. So we need to unfold these. And that shape is pretty satisfactory on its own, but we're going to put a pin on it. So now we return to this, we stick these out, the ones that we folded in, the alligator, whatnot. We unfold those two. And pretty much what you can do is you can just unfold all these folds and just extend these mountains, right? Like this. So, extend them, and now you have this. And we want these folds to extend. You see that? This is the fold that we just copied by doing that sort of motion that I mentioned. And now, these two lines, because the reason why we unfolded these was so it didn't have as many layers there. But now, these folds, I'm going to extend them. So I just fold them, and wherever they land, and I just land and I just completely just fold them strong and just cross completely across in all layers that was one and now the other and boom wherever it may land and the the more confident you fold this the better it's going to look and that's sort of uh I think that's a metaphor for life and now you open it up and that's it that's that's all the information that you needed That's all the information that you needed, and so this cross just goes like it just crosses inside of this shape and then extends outward in the first folder. We did the first heptagon becomes the straight line that draws in on these petal shapes. So it's very interesting to think then that the first move that we did when we took these edges and put them on the radio line was actually drawing the circle where that makes for these one, two, three, and makes for these one two three and four right same for these be the same edge length right so it's a very interesting way of of taking origami and reinterpreting it for its line patterns now there are many ways that you can play around with this thing i'm going to show you the most obvious one really fast if somebody but if anybody wants to interrupt me say something tell me that it's time up whatever i'll take it but i'm just going to show you so here's the idea you fold the line the pattern Fold the line, the pattern line. So I need to finish that, but so all the pattern lines of the row set are going to be valley folds. And then the lines that are inside are all of them, most of them, not all of them, are going to be valleys. They are mountains. And so I'm going to just finish drawing up these. One, two, three. Just getting really crude there as I up the velocity in this thing. So pretty much there's the row set, right? Now, what I like to do here is the same kind of idea. What I like to do here is the same kind of idea where I can picture that, well, my lines are going to be valleys, so therefore my forefinger and thumb trick comes into play. I choose my points, I crimp, I push, and then as I'm doing this, I'm sort of crafting and molding this thing to my liking. Pushing and pulling and clicking and going up and down. So, the challenge here is that this row set needs to be completely different. As you can see, these lines are valleys. Different. As you can see, these lines are valleys, and I need them to be mountains. So, you know, I can either completely take that in stride and just, you know, take a step ahead, just fold those into mountains, or as I'm molding them, just clicking and putting things into position as.
