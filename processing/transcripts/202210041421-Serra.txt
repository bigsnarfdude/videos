But um so today I want to tell you a story which is uh partly uh quite old and partly a little bit less old. So just a little bit about me. The work that I'm gonna present, the new part at least, has been done at Johns Hopkins, even if now I am in Denmark. Most of the work was done by Sean, who is here in the audience, and actually he will tell you on Thursday about Uh tell you on Thursday about the newest uh uh most new part of the work. Sorry, not on the artist. Uh we are timing, but okay, I'll try to figure out. Um and so we have Sean and Jafe and also former undergraduate student Bia and postdoc Misuki. Alright, so Sean will tell you the newest part. I will tell you some about the semi-new part, but there is also a very old part. But there is also a very old part, and in fact, I have retrieved this really old historical slide from 2015, which is the flower steam which was taken at the University of Pennsylvania. And of course, you will recognize some people in the audience. So, also, I will go very quickly on the first part because Mohamed had already talked about I am giving the talk, so this is my slide, so I'm not there. So the story starts with this work by Hamid and Dan about this flower pattern of conic domains and the idea that one can grow dragonfly-like lenses with liquid crystals. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that. We have heard already several times. Already, several times about the structure. We start from a spectral A phase, which is combined between two surfaces. One gives splinter alignment, and that's typically glass or polymer or whatever. And the second interface is air, which as I said this morning gives perpendicular alignment, and then one can create a curved interface and obtain this regular array of focal connective domains. The focal connective domains are our favorite object, and of course. Favorite object, and of course, this is a way to satisfy both biomarkers. We have expanded and characterized the experimental system with some of the techniques that have been mentioned today and that's why I want to show the slide. So, we start with a micropost and then we can take some images in electron microscopy or in optical microscopy and polarized optical microscopy. Polarized optical microscopy, and all of them help you see different things. First of all, they're all taken with different materials. So you might see that the structure is a little, I mean, part of the structure is material independent, part of it is actually not material independent, but that's just a fine point, I guess. The important thing is that in all cases, this focal conic domain arranges around the micropost. Here you see basically the profile of the interview. The profile of the interface. Here you see a cross-section, which was a very lucky picture that we took in electron microscopy. And here you kind of see the same structure taken from the top view in the bright field, the polarized microscopy, and in this case with confocal microscopy. Right, so this is in a way the methods that we've used to characterize this flower structure. This virus structure. Why the dragonfly eye, as Mohammed said also yesterday, it was already shown. Two things actually were shown. One is that somehow these focalconic domains were able to focus light. And the second thing is that the size of the focalconic domain, I mean the lateral side of the focal conic domain, was proportional to the focal length. Alright, so just a little bit of a So, just a little bit of interlude about this dragonfly eyes. This is an inventor of the microscope, Tony van Leuvenhog. This is the optical microscope over here. And this is him looking at the candle through his just-invented optical microscope. It turns out that I found this quote in a book that said that last summer I looked at the meset squirmia through my microscope and eventually said. And eventually said, What I observed by looking into the microscope were the inverted images of the burning flame, not one image, but some hundred images. As small as they were, I could see them all moving. So, this is the concept of the compound eye of the insect, which is made by many tiny lenses, and which are convergent lenses, because the images are inverted. So, we can look at the light through our flower pattern. If we dim the light enough, we don't see anything on the We don't see anything on the focal plane of the flower pattern, but if we move the focus of our microscope, eventually we will see different light being focused by different families of these microlenses as the microlens changes the focal length. The same thing, maybe more clearly, can be seen by projecting some kind of letter or a figure through the lens, and again one can see the same thing. One can see the same thing, and I'm just going to show you a video because I think that's a little bit clearer. This again is part of the old story: the video that we took at Penn. So you can see I'm just shifting the focus of the microscope, and here we can see this letter P for pen that's coming into focus at different points. So, what was in a way the conclusion of this work? We tried to understand why this lens. Why these lenses worked and also why this linear relationship between the focal length and the lateral size of nail existed. And so even with a very simple kind of back of the envelope calculation, we have characterized the surface of the focal chronic domains and have concluded that whatever, how can I say, whatever dimple, whatever deformation of the surface was there was. Surface was there was too small to actually focus light. So, right, one easy way to focus light is just to have a curtain interface, but that was not the case here. So, the only other hypothesis is that it's a matter of the change of refractive index across the microlens, and especially it has to be a change of the refractive index from the, let's say, the edge of the focal conic domain to the centre of the focal conic domain. The center of the focalconic domain. And this is quite intuitive because, in fact, at the edge of the focal conic domain, the refractive index is more or less perpendicular every way to the surface. And then the focalconic domains, I mean, the liquid crystals start to bend. And so the effective refractive index is higher near the center of the lens. And that is promising because that's how gradient refractive index works. You need to have a higher refractive index in the middle. Refractive index in the middle. If we make the probably not true hypothesis that the refractive index varies as R square as you go across the focal cardic domain, then you have this nice, that's the way to create a perfect gravity index lens. If you then consider what the slope of this parabolic shape is Of this parabolic shape has to be. This has to depend on the barofringence of the liquid crystal and this has to depend on the barofringence of the liquid crystal. And so basically we get to this expression for the focal length, which depends on the radius square of the focal conic domain, so that's the lateral size, inversely proportional to the height and inversely proportional to the biofringence. However, the height and the radius are not independent and they are part Independent, and in fact, they are related by this constant, which is a function of the anchoring strength at the bottom and at the top. So, with this in mind, we get this nice linear relationship between the focal length and the lateral size of the parcodic domain, where in fact the focal length is also inversely proportional to the birefringence on the medium, and it depends on this constant, which is just a material property. Which is just a material property, and we have verified by varying various parameters that this is the case. Something about this lens which is quite interesting is that within the flower pattern the lenses are polarization sensitive, meaning that by illuminating by polarizing the light through which we illuminate the lenses, different families of lenses, so different groups of lenses, Come into focus at different times. So the different images are formed for different polarization. In particular, if we rotate, so right here, I be focused and we see a lot of nice smiley faces here. And then if I rotate the polarizer, then we see the smiley faces appear on this other side of this other part of the focaconic domain. Again, like intuitively. Again, like intuitively, why does this effect occur? Well, if we think of how the photophonic domain look, if you look at through the two polarizations of light, this is the generic appearance of phococonic pumains when they have a hyperbola oriented in a certain direction. So if we consider the So if we consider the two cross section, so this is how a light polarized along basically in the plane of the hyperbola would be like. And this is how a light polarized perpendicular to the plane of the hyperbola would look like. And in this case, you can see that along this direction, there is still a very precise variation of the refractive index, but along this direction, Index, but along this direction, this variation disappears because the lenses are all tilted along that direction. So, intuitively, this is what's happening and why the lenses are polarization sensitive. Alright, so we started from this work. This is the old part of the work, so if there are some questions, I'm happy to take them at this point also. Then I'm gonna, if not, then I'm gonna switch gear a little bit and talk about the newer. Little bit and talk about the newer work, which is looking at the system but adding a little bit of phase transition to it. So here we are not looking at flower patterns anymore, but we're still looking at focalconic domains. And we look at focal conic domains inside microchannels simply because it's a very simple system of you know having a one-dimensional array of iconics or one-dimensional array of microlenses. Array of microlenses. So these are, you know, again, microchannels which are formed with some polymer or some plastic material, and they have a free interface to give the homeotropic, the perpendicular boundary condition. And this is what we observe. We have usually an array of focal conics in the channel. However, if we instead of putting the magnetic Metric liquid crystal. If you put chironematic liquid crystal in the very same type of channels, then you will also observe these circular domains, which are in fact based on simulations, they are very likely to be some kind of half torons. So something that has a planar alignment at the bottom, perpendicular alignment of the top, so the helical structure has to rotate. Helical structure has to rotate from the top to the bottom. There is a non-topological defect also in the center of this object, which is, well, it's a defect in the plane, but it's not a defect in three dimension. The thing which we did not know, but we did measure, is that also these defects in cholesteric liquid crystal are able to form lenses. And so here, because I already moved to Hopkins. Here, because I already moved to Hopkins, then please see a letter H, but the concept is the same. You're saying it's an escape, there's an escape plus one. It is an escape plus one in the center, yes. Yes, so I would like to say that we are 100% sure of the structure, but that's not the case. But I think this is what it is. I think this is a half a door of placebo. Can you see the videos? Sorry? Can we see the videos? Or the first video? Later. I'm going to show you later. Sorry. I don't even know the word video. No, I saw that. Sorry, I'm going to show you videos later. So now, as I showed you before, this is what we see in the spectral phase, this is what we see in the pneumatic phase. Somehow, both phases seem to have these circular domains, which are both able to create lenses. So, of course, the question. Lenses. So, of course, the question that almost comes quite natural is: can the two defects, can the two families of defects appear in the same system? Can I make a transition from one to the other? The answer is yes, but with some problems and with some experimental difficulties. So, what we do is that we take the HV, which is, as Lisa said yesterday, is a drosophila of Yesterday, it's a drosophila of semantic lipid crystal, I guess. So, it's a very typical symptomic lipid crystal material, and we add this chiral dopamine TCP team, which is able to induce twist and chirality in the system. And then we observed basically how frequently the cholesterol defects are observed in the channels once the system is heated up above the phase transition. Above the phase transition. And it turns out that, you know, based on the concentration of CB15, the more concentrated CB15 is, so the more chirality the system has, the more frequently one observes these cholesterol effects. I would like to point out that these are lenses per channel or defects per channels, and they're very few. So it's quite a rare event. It's not like they're not as frequent as for valconic. They're not as frequent as for volcanic marine, so this is much, much more rare. Why do I say that it's a delicate system and why is this a problem? Well, because ideally, if we wanted to have a good yield of these cholesterol lenses, then of course we would have to put more chiral goblins. So we would like to put more, to add more chiral material. The problem is that when we look at The liquid crystal distortion, right? So, if we have a pneumatic, I'm sorry, here I'm writing the pneumatic elastic energy. I know that the polysteric has a correction term, but please bear with me. So, right, you have splay, you have twist and bend, and all three are admitted in the polysteric. Of course, here you have to add some Q0 that tells you that there is a preferred angle of rotation. In the smectic phase, In dysmactic phase, that is not the case, and we know that the smectic phase tends to expel the bend and the twist. So, as we increase the amount of chiral doband, the same chiral dond stays there also when the system is in the smectic phase. And of course, the smectic phase does not like that. So, the smectic phase actually gets broken into smaller domains when there's too much carol domain. So, for this reason, there's only a very short There's only a very short, or let's say there's a small window of concentration of chiral dopamine where we can actually observe this system. Why doesn't the chiral dopant phase separate? Like in Lisa's experiments? What do you mean? Sorry. Well, I mean, so the chiral dopant can leave the smectic phase, right? The chiral dopant meaning completely being expelled. Yeah. Well, first it's not really what we observe. First, it's not really what we observe, and if it does, then it gets immediately remixed perfectly as we go into the phase transition. So, what we observe instead is that the focal conic domains, instead of forming a nice ordered array of focal conic domains like this one, they start getting really broken. So, instead of looking at these circular domains, we start seeing domains that have cracks and that have. Cracks and that have almost like it almost looks like a petal structure. I don't have a picture actually on this presentation, but it looks like something like this. Something like that. So we think it's something that's similar to a twist grain boundary that is created because a lot of twist accumulates in some areas and then it makes the the current it makes the phototonic air. So I know this isn't that this is only a study. I'm just asking a question. I'm just asking a question. I heard you say that. In a TGB phase, do you think the CB15 goes to where the defects are? It's a very good question. It could definitely be that it does that. I mean, there was a work a few years ago that showed the microphase separation of of a perfect mixture of two liquid crystals within a near defect. So I would not be surprised at the C B fifteen in a system like that. That the CB15 in a system like that went to the detector. The only thing is that it's a small concentration. I would like to add something. If you wait a long time, the CB15 will save very fast. It's very possible, yes. Because when we did it with the sexual CB, to make the two faces, if you check your samples after two days, you will see two faces. The pneumatic and then the CD50. I think if you wait longer time, if you check like If you wait longer time, if you check like post-color statements. Okay. Okay. The seismic requirement is even two different phases. Okay. So every time we start the experiments, usually we give you an isotropic phase. It actually doesn't need to be necessarily a fresh sample. And we have kept these samples alive for a while, but every time we keep in isotropic phase, it's Every time we keep in isotropic phases before starting. So we think that the mixture is still mixed. That's it. This is the code. And we haven't observed a huge variation of behavior. I mean, unless you wait for a very long time. Is that right, Sean? Yeah, you have to wait, like, I don't know, months. Yeah. I mean, these I pull these over the course of, like, minutes or seconds. So no phase separation, I think, was really. I think was really this is not the only thing we care about. So this concentration of chiral dopant. There's also the importance of the geometry of the channel, but I will skip that for a while and I will talk about it later. And now I can show you the video now. And now I can show you the video now. This is what happens when we observe a phase transition in a channel between asthmatic and cholesterol. Again, with a very small amount of chiral dopant in this case. What we do see is that there is, first of all, not all the focal connect domains become circular domains cholesteric, but some of them do. And in fact, if you look at this, for example, you can sort of see how this. You can sort of see how this central point defect sort of wobbles around this initial position, but more or less stays there. And here I have another video. And you can really see how that is formal starting from the previous one. I'm going to play that again. May I ask a small question here? Yeah, of course. Don't you think that it may? Yeah, of course. Don't you think that it may be related to some memory effect? Yes. Yes, this is what I think. This is also what Sean is going to talk about in a couple of days. So here I'm mostly focused on the lens aspect, but Sean is going to talk exactly about that. And in fact, the same effect can be seen from the two direction. So both from the semantic to the carinomatic and from the carino. And from the charinomatics into the symptic, except that there's usually a big difference, but if so, let's say the conversion between a sematic focal conic into a chirodematic circular defect is a relatively rare event, while the conversion of this cholesterol defect to semantic is much more common. So it is almost one hundred percent yield. The 100% yield. So, if you repeat this periodically, this could also be other locations where you find your circuit defects in the. Yes, yes, exactly. So, it does change. And in fact, Definition Sean is going to show that next Thursday. But with spoiler alert, there is a certain point. So, if you heat up close to the phase transition, but not quite, then it's perfectly reversible. I mean, the defects always form at the same point, but when you go past the phase transition, that is. But when you go past the phase transition, then this point changes. Yeah. So, with this, why do we want to do that? Well, because basically we can have a way to make lenses which are a bit more tunable than the lenses in smacktic. In fact, you know, as I showed you before, like the smactic, well, the focal length of the semactic focal conic domains is essentially fixed once the size of the focal conic domain. Once the size of the focaconic lamens is fixed. And the smettic phase is very resistant all the way through the phase transition, and there's not a lot of variation of size of the focaconic domains. So pretty much you have a lens which still remains always of the same focal length. But going to the karadnematic phase, then one actually get a lens which is more temperature sensitive because that depends on the pitch of the cholesterolic phase, which changes with temperature and is. And especially near the phase transition, it's very sensitive. What we want to. The question we asked after this is, okay, can we have a system which is a bit more controllable? As I said before, this conversion between a semantic defect and cholesterol defect is, in a way, rare and a bit unexpected. You don't know where it happens, and you don't know the location. So we thought, okay. So we thought, okay, maybe we can try to exert a little bit of control through geometry. This is something that, of course, occurs in many other systems. It's been showed defects in toroidal structure, the fact that there is an interaction between defects and curved boundaries and defects and curvature. And we've done a bunch of experiments with pneumatic defects also interacting with the curved boundary. Defects also interacting with the curved boundaries. So, what we did is that Sean made a series of microchannels, but instead of being flat microchannels, just straight, there is a lot of variation and made a lot of small loops, sorry, or small undulations on my channel. So, there are many geometrical parameters that one can control. One can control Control. One can control the width of the channel, the periodicity of this undulation, also how much you feel the channel, so the height of the fluid. And all of this seems to matter a lot in creating regular effects. So for example, there are some geometries in which we don't have any benefit at all in having this curved structure. However, there are some geometry in which this works much, much better. Of course, one has. Of course, one has to be very careful of heating up very slowly or putting down very slowly. So it's a delicate process, but one can get some pretty well-order arrays, funny domains. And then one can see how they can be brought across a phase transition from sphactic to cholesteric. And one can see that all the defects in sphactic are maintained for a while in the cholesteric phase. And by the way, Phase and by the way, also Sean will show that on Thursday eventually they might annihilate. So it's still not a one-to-one process. This also brings the next question, which is what is the influence of geometry? This is very much work in progress for now, and that's the last thing that I'm going to show you. But definitely, we know that geometry plays an important part. So, Sean has been making a little So, Sean has been making a little survey about how all these different geometrical parameters, so the undulation and the distance between defect, how much do they yield good focal connect domains and how much do they yield good well-ordered defects. And in fact, one can see that there are some area of this regions of this parameter space in which ordered defect can form, and some areas. Can form and some areas in which they don't form. And if you change one parameter that seems to be very, very important is the width of this microchannel. And so in fact, let's say even the difference between, let's say, a 20 micron width of microchannel and 25 micron, which seems rather small, can have a pretty dramatic effect in how well this system can be ordered. And of course, here, this is where it would be really nice to have. It would be really nice to have some help from simulations and to understand why the packing is so good in some geometries and not in others, and so on. So, this is where I'm asking for help. So, just to wrap up, and then I'm going to show you the very last thing. Sorry, go back. I'm sorry. Yeah. Those boundaries? Yes. They're like sine waves? No, they're not. They're not, no, they're not quite sine waves. They're supposed to be. So these are kind of triangular shaped, but they're. So, these are kind of triangular shapes, but they get rounded up by the lithography. So, in fact, we have, in this way, we have a way of making isolated pockets which are quite far apart from each other. So, we wouldn't, no, they're not sine waves. I mean, we can make sine waves, but that this is not it. So, we want to have isolated buttons. So, just to wrap up, I hope I've shown you that the focalconic domains are microlenses and they become interesting when they are assembled in arrays. And that also a small amount of coral dopant can actually maintain some of the lenses above the phase transition and make them tunable. How, you know, what is a possible expansion of the system? And this is a very, very preliminary data, but I wanted just to show. Plummer data, but I wanted just to show you some experiment that Sean and John Fay have been doing, which is that I go back to this control of the geometry that I mentioned before and how the height of the liquid in the microchannel matters for the formation of foca-connect domains. So, Sean and Jaufé made some microchannels which were only filled with a little bit of liquid. With a little bit of liquid, and that actually favors the formation of regular domains in smactic, at least in our system. However, they also mix this system, they mix in this smactic some polymerizable monomer. So these are monomers which have more or less the same shape as the HCB, but they can be polymerized. And then they irradiate it with UV light and then they make a polymer network, even if it Make a polymer network, even if it's a low-concentration mono. And then finally, they reheat the system up and then they add more pneumatic, so they add more liquid crystal to sort of fill up the channel until the top. And what they see is that then they pull it down again, and then they see that they are able to form regular defects even in places where. Defects even in places where before they were not able to form regular defects. So, just this tiny layer of polymer network underneath is able to control a much larger bulk of material. And in fact, this is also nicer from the point of view of making lenses because then we have more material to make lenses, we have larger focal conics, so we can have uh longer uh longer focal length, uh sorry uh yeah, more regular focal conic could give you better uh better optimal skill. Better optimality. So, this is just a direction in which this work is going. And then, of course, the other direction is studying this memory effect that Sean is going to talk about. Thanks a lot. So, you were adding this shape in the channel just to force the defects of IGL. The defects of high geography is the goal of the yeah, exactly. And ideally, you know that can mean many things, right? So somehow we seem to be able to form these very large defects. So you see, this is 50 microns. So these are very large individual defects in these pockets. Honestly, we didn't. Honestly, we did not expect to see this large defect in the pocket. My expectation was that there would be a defect in the center and some near these edges. This is also why we initially we designed this mask to be something like that. So I thought that it would be something like this and then have more regular lines. Maybe if you agree as the ch the length of the channel and I mean we have but it's I mean we have, but it seems that either either it's something like that or it's something like completely disorder, like that one. So we don't we have not been able to really find a geometry where we separate the focal connectomines which are not attached also to the edge. On that point, I just wanted to comment that the work with Hu Yang that Mohammed mentioned earlier with the micro posts. There were focal comics. If the microposts are far enough apart, there are focal comics in between the microposts, but only one. And you could make the posts much farther apart than they ought to have been, and there was still just the one focal comic. And I banged my head on the table for about a year trying to figure out why. I don't think we ever really did. I think we really did. But I just remembered that now. It was probably the same mystery as this. And this is enough, it's even a bit more mysterious because It's even a bit more mysterious because the height, so from the point of view of the height of the fluid, this makes no sense because I mean, it's you know, you usually expect that in a focal point, more or less, the height of the fluid is about maybe half of this, from half to one time the size of the lateral size. And in this case, it's not true, like we have a much thinner fluid and a much larger area. So, I think it's probably, I mean, what I would expect to see is that. And what I would expect to see is that there were probably layers which are broken on the surface of this component. But you have just straight edges. Yeah. So the reason I was asking about sign, but it doesn't have to be sign. Suppose you made channels that had the shape of Vornei cells that were separating each of those domains. Separating each of those domains right now. You mean like this? Yeah, see, what I was thinking was: if you had a chain like this and it was stable, then you know that you could make a, you could think you could make a 2D structure by stacking them. The boundary conditions would all match up. So you mean just kind of cutting the yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly. But this is not terribly different from what we did, right? Well, that's, I know, I know. So what I'm so. So, what I'm so I'm just asking this question. You said that you get really big ones. So, that would suggest if you had something which had really big ones, you could take that and translate it up the plane, and you could get a packing where the boundary conditions all match. Alright. And then it would be a bulk, it would be a bulk, it would be a bulk. Gigantic liquid. Very gigantic mechanic. I'm just saying, I'll say it in a way that I can understand it. If you have a minimizer for a shape that has these bumps on it, and you can lock them together, then it must be at least a good guess for a minimizer of something that happens when you build them up and make a bulk's input, right? It has all the right boundary conditions, everything matches, everything's smooth across it. But then what you're telling me is that if you did that, that you could magically remove the boundary. Magically remove the boundary, you break up into smaller. Yes, yes, this seems to be the case, yeah. But those shapes aren't exactly right. It's not done. Use to tile or to fill the plane. Yeah, that's an interesting suggestion. So to kind of uh cut out make it cut out of some known structure. You could translate it and make make full plane with it. And make full plane with it. Yeah. And then you say, well, how come that's not the tried to cut a more perfect shape? Yes, just a small remark because you have a question about the structure of your very large but very thin for gyconics, possibly with organs, magnetic layers. For this, you could do. Layers. For this, you could do some attributing force myself. Because I think that the broken layer you are supposed to see them, we have seen them in the system that Google show. Yes, in fact, I have exactly taken the paper that you suggested, and we have tried to do exactly the same thing. So far, not too successfully. But it could be that there has been some experimental problem with the cantey liver or something like that. Yeah, because I was hoping to have those. Very probably low-key situation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was also hoping to see this car along with the surface and everything, but so far, I mean, the results that we got are a little bit too strange, I think, and I don't entirely believe them. So we see some weird jumps, and I don't think, I think there are some experimental issues. Any more questions? Um, nanoparticles stabilizing, or nanoparticles thrown in to the spectrum phase, would they help you get a higher yield of cholesterol effects at each of those photographs? It's a good, I don't know. No, no, the cholesterol doesn't have point defects, true. But it's still high distortion. Yeah, yeah. Maybe the particle doesn't hear tonight. I don't know. In our case, when we did some distorted cholesterol with nanoparticle new, unfortunately not published, but it does the same thing in the max teacher some simulation. It does the same thing in the pneumatic, so the nematicles are at the same place. So at the same place, there's no cholesterol culture, but they don't go into so much. So distorted but that's the service. Thank you very much.
