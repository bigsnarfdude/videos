The last talk of today. Thank you for letting me come to present my work here. So this is the work I'm doing with my colleague in Thailand, Wan Shalum, and Paolo, who should be on Zoom. Another Paolo. On Zoom, another Paolo and Paulo, Paolo Patocini. Yeah, so I give you some introduction and then some notion of sub-manifold algebra, which I will use in this work. And then I will give you some definition of what is sub-triple and then isometry. Isometric subtriple and in summary, right? So the notion of suboptics in, well, there are, I mean, in commutative geometry, there are many notions of sub-object. There are immersion. Okay, there is immersion, submersion, embedding, isometric, and submitting that there are many notions of sub-manifold. In non-commutative geometry, this thing is not clear because basically there is no notion, no clear notion of a quantum subsystem. Well, the plan is that The plan is that this might be this notion might be able to might be deduced from morphism in the category. For example, if the morphism is algebra homomorphism, this work has been done by Paolo previously and many others. And other choice is that Other choice is that you take bimodal as a morphism between the objects in spectral triple. Precaution, the appropriate choice of morphism is still an open question, but the one that is well accepted is the the bimodal, but which Which has been done. This work has been done by Michelin, but we're gonna try to see how this one worked first. So there are several attempts, as I mentioned, towards the property of sub-object in non-commutative geometry. And what the problem is, there are some instrumentation that you have in differential geometry that's not available here in non-commutative geometry, like I'm sorry. So, like a derivative. So, like derivative, I mean, derivation, lead derivative, that's something that's not well developed in non-commutative geometry. Because, in well, in Alan Kahn approach, things develop from the differential form and stuff. So, this thing is. This thing is been ignored, I guess. So, there is an approach using submanifold algebra, which mainly dealing with derivatives. So, I kind of choose this approach. And we extend it with the notion of some. Notion of some subspectral triple previously mentioned by many others. So what is the submanifor algebra? So if you have a two C star algebra like this and you have a subjective homomorphism. Homomorphism, then you can suppose you have a set of derivatives defined like it's a linear map that is that satisfy the Leibniz rule, then you have derivative. And if you take the certain subset of this derivative, like Derivative like if x is zero, when a is in curve of this map, then you can define a sub-manifold algebra to be the algebra in which this map is surjective. This induced map is This induced map is ejective. So, this is normally not true for general C star algebra, but for some certain class of C star algebra, this is true. So, not every C star algebra that has subjective homorphism. Subjective homorphism will be submitted for algebra, just some certain subclass. In commutative case, if we have a proper embedding, then this will give you that the C infinity of n is submanifold algebra of C infinity of M. Infinity of M. So we got a pretty nice example here for the commutative geometry. Then if you want it to be isometric embedding, what condition would you put? Would you put? So I put this equality, norm equality between the commutator of the rack operator and the algebra to make it commutative. So this is the I didn't use the The canonical the canonical spectral tuple which you would have to put spin structure on it. I use the Hotster Ram thing, which is a lot simpler. And then when you put this condition, you can show that the equality between this thing will imply also. Will imply also the equation of isometric. So if this thing equal to the metric, it means the F is isometric embedding. So So, the previous condition I put is implicitly used the fact that we have a projection on the Huber space H2, which originated from the fact that we can decompose the tangent space in this way. You have the the normal the the normal part of the the pullback of the TFM detachment space and the tangential part right and I I implicitly use that the tank The truncation of D2 is the norm, the norm that's sorry, the norm of the truncation of the two is equal to the this commutator compute in P of H two. P of H2. So there is a tuncation, a cut in the spectrum of the rag operator here. This truncation is the first eigenvalues up to a certain energy. Pardon me? It's a projection operator. Yes. The diagonal Dirac operator up to a certain energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that. Yeah, something like that. Yes, something like that. So that's the commutative setting. If we go beyond that to non-commutative part, then there are some. Some the notion will be different. There are a couple of notions that will be important. So we make this okay, it's back. Okay. We make this definition. make this definition using the notion of sub-manifold algebra and then we need we need the intertwine between representation to make it sub-triple and then we also need a couple of conditions of the direct operator so each condition will will give you different Will give you different kinds of subtriple. So this one is Riemannian sub-triple. Basically, you map one form here to one form there. This one is isometric subtriple, which is the thing I will be focusing on on this work. But you see here, we need the But you see here, we need the truncation that's already appear in the commutative phase. And that is totally geodesic, which is supposed to be a very strong one because it preserve in commutative cases preserve geodesic. So there are relations among these things. Among these things, totally geodesic imply both Riemannian and isometric. And this definition works well with almost commutative setting. I show you how this thing works. So if we give a finite spectral triple like this by By the work of Francesco, this thing is the BUB submanifo algebra of A. And with this, you have the exact sequence of, I mean, you have zero, you have of phi, you have A, and you have B, and it's zero. And it's zero, then because this thing is finite-dimensional vector space, it will split, right? And if you choose particular U like this, you can show that if D satisfy the condition above, then it will be sub-triple. Uh right. So, um in this you you see that I use the it's it's the con distance, it's the spectral distance, not the one you obtain by integrate the metric tensor. And you need this, this is the distance that. This is the distance that measures the length between pure state. And when you have map between pure state, you need this file to be subjective, unless your induced map will not map pure state to pure state. It maps to state. State, it maps to state, but it can be mixed state. So, good thing this thing is surjective. The induced map defined by this formula here and preserves the purity. So, from this point on, I will. I will assume something. I will assume that in addition to this U being a linear map, I will assume it to be partial isometry so that it produces projection. And when you have And when you have two spectral triple, which is this one, suppose this one is the Riemannian subtriple of this one, you can show that the distance is bounded by this one. So it's not equal, it's bounded. The equality. The equality would happen if you have equality between the two norm. Or equivalently, you can say this is equal. Then you get the equality between the distance. So, so from the previous calculation, then it's clear that if you have equality between the norm of commutator, then the distance would be equal. This is also similar. Also, similar in the case of a commutative case. And then if in addition to if in addition to that, we have that p is commute with d2, then then you have the the following uh following thing happen is that uh this this truncation of the rack operator uh calculate on on uh h2 is equal to the uh the whole uh the the direct oper the commutative of direct operator Commutator of derived operator calculate on P of H2. And then if this thing satisfies this condition for all b, then the subtriple will be isometric. So from Riemannian subtriple, you can get isometric sub-triple. So, this is the proof which I will not go through of the point number one. And for the second part, it's kind of automatic because it's already in the lemma here, right? Here, right? So, as I said, in theorem one, in commutative case, there are implicitly, I implicitly impose the existence of P, the projection that cuts the, sorry, let's cut the space of Space of exterior algebra and cut, and also it's also cut the spectrum of the Dirac operator. And then as a colloqui, if you have a totally geodesic subtriple with UU star equal to identity on H1, this thing will also be isometric sub-triple. also be isometric subtipple. Okay, so it's this equality will force u star u to be projection and with that projection it commutes with direct operator and things follow. So this is the example is the Example is the Tu Chi space, which appear in the work of Pierre Martinetti. It's kind of, yeah, as the name suggests, it's a 2G space, like a manifold sit next to the other one, and there is a certain Certain distance between it. So, with this definition, it works okay, meaning that this thing, the commutative one is a sub-triple of the 2G space. So, you have two manifolds sitting next to each other. One is the sub-manifold. Is the sub-manifold of the whole system. And it's the finite spectral triple is also a subtriple of this one. So to do this, you define a certain subjective map and map and define the projection, then you can show that this is actually an isometric sub-manifold with the distance like that, this equality between distance. And for this, this other sub meaning for is that so for two-point space you have for you have for 2G space, you kind of have the relation between any point in this space having distance connect between them, like in this formula. So it's like two space and then this is vertical distance between them and the And the distance between any point is given by a Kitagorean relation. So in summary, what I have done is I show some relation between this notion, this different notion. This different notion of subtriple. And with these, I haven't got the full relation because from this theorem, I can only go one way. I can go from here with some condition to isometric, but I cannot prove backward what's what's proof back what what's what's uh so we do have some idea what's what uh would make the the condition which we can prove the converse so we use the um submanifold algebra Sub-manifold algebra because there is a sudden map between derivative, which if we can link with the infinitesimal distance with that, then we can probably prove backward. Because you see, in the commutative part, this thing. Part, this thing works because you're sorry, I did it twice. Oh, okay, you just do that. Oh, okay. You just do that. Okay, okay, I can kind of do it now. Where am I? Yeah, because in this case, you have this is infinitesimal distance, and you can link it with the norm of commutative of direct operator. That's why you can kind of prove backward. Prove back backward the relation, but in this case, we still don't know what's the notion of infinitesimal. There is a notion of infinitesimal in non-commutative geometry. You have a compact operator, but it's not related. But it's not related to this case. So we need to find some way to do it. Okay. And at this point, what we can do is that we make it work with almost commutative case, but I think to extend to a wider class of To a wider class of non-commutative geometry, you probably need bimodal. You need a different kind of morphism. And a bigger question is that how do one incorporate spin structure in this kind of setting? Because spin structure is not easy at all. Easy at all. How much time? Lots of time. Two minutes. Okay. And thank you. Question. This is the picture of my garden. Mary have seen it. And this is the reference I use in this work. Okay, let's back to this nice picture. Thank you. Questions? Well, I have a question. If you have a non-trivial fiber bundle, non-trivial, you have the isometric embedding of the base space. Would that be an example? Because the volume is your operator. So words, your algorithms cannot be split into I guess so because because for this one we we dealing with just the splitting of the tangent space not the the the non-trivial Non-trivial fiber bundle. So if you want to incorporate fiber bundle, then I don't know. I don't have the answer at all. Most questions? Yes. You take an approximately finite algebra, which is an inductive limit. Oh, yes, then almost finite thing. Yeah, this almost finite. Think. Yeah, this is almost finite. No, approximately finite. So it's like the non-commutative torus or this kind of thing. So it's an inductive limit of algebra. So there are an algebra and one sitting near the other one. Then you can make... So I was wondering, I was asking whether how does this fit in your things? But if you are not familiar with approximately finite algebra, then it may not be. Then it may I'm familiar with the almost finite one, which is uh almost commutative, no approximate almost finite. It's I think it's the same thing as you as you said because you actually have direct limit and the morphism between the finite. Then you can have a direct limit of DIRAC operators one sitting in so this would fit into your scheme. So each one is sub algebra into the algebra into this one and then you fill the you fill the space with this nested sub algebra yes i i think so because actually i i i tell you the secret i built this stuff because i have the problem with that one okay because uh i used to try to build a model of atom from almost uh finite uh geometry and then i stuck with And then I stuck with the notion of sub-manifold between each because there are lots of interesting examples with the Morita equivalences for the torus. If we want to talk about Morita equivalent, maybe I have to change the morphism to buy module to talk about that. Okay. It is a very interesting thing to do. More questions soon? Zoom, there are no questions at this time. Okay, then we think Abi Mok again and we close our afternoon. Thank you very much.
