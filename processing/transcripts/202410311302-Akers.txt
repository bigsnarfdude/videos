Yes. Okay, so yeah, I guess I'm giving a master class. So I'm going to try and treat this kind of like a class. It's a little bit ironic because I looked at the list of attendees of this conference and there's at least four people in the audience more qualified than me to give this lecture. So you'll know who you are by the end of the talk, I guess, because I'll get your name dropped at some point. I'm going to talk about, really, I'm going to talk about Wilton River. Talk about really, I'm going to talk about Wilton ripples, which are a thing I've studied for about 20 years. And is that right? Yeah, something like that. And many other audience members have as well. And they're a particular type of periodic traveling wave where the small amplitude solution is composed of two Fourier modes instead of one. And I'll contrast that to what we would call a Stokes wave along the way, and I'll talk about what each of those are. About what each of those are, and some like pretty modern existence proofs of these things, and I'll talk about how those fit in history. So, that's what you have to look forward to. The model I'll use for today is a family of weakly nonlinear model equations that look like the one here on the screen that are designed to have traveling wave solutions. So, L is a linear operator who's defined in Fourier space. Defined in that's defined in Fourier space. So, there are some examples below on this board, like the Benjamin equation or deepwater widem or Kawahara. Or, I mean, you could think of this as the gravity capillary water wave problem if you like, then the nonlinearity would be a little more complicated. And in these model equations, there's a parameter here labeled sigma called the bond number that denotes like how important gravity or capillarity is in the problem. And for particular values of And for particular values of the bond number, there are periodic traveling solutions of these equations that have two co-propagating wave numbers. And those two wave numbers are integer multiples of one another. So we might call them like resonant harmonics, people use that phrasing. And when that happens, you can ask the question: do there exist traveling waves near that? Waves near that linear solution. And that's the problem we'll talk about today. Before we talk about the problem when there's two co-propagating modes, I'm going to talk a little bit about Stokes waves, which are the problem when there's one Fourier mode that this solution is built around, where the linear solution is effectively cosine of x of this model. And I have here a picture of Stokes for you. And next to this picture, You. And next to this picture is a referee report. Apparently, you can get referee reports for old papers on the internet now. And this is a report, a referee report on one of Stokes' papers written by Maxwell. And I think that's kind of a cool thing that that's who Stokes' peer was when he's trying to get his papers published. So Stokes' waves begin looking like cosine. And Wilton ripples, the thing I'm going to focus on today, are approximately biochromatic. Are approximately biochromatic, which is to say they approximately look like a sum of two Fourier modes or a sum of cosine x and cosine of mx. And if you looked at linear theory to try and describe these solutions, linear theory would suggest that I can superimpose any ratio of these two Fourier modes or these of these two cosines. So I could pick any beta I want. So beta here roughly says like what's the ratio of the nth harmonic with the first harmonic in this solution. And then I have a In this solution. And then I have a picture for here for you to look at of Wilton when he was mid-career. And then this, the article on the right is actually one of the letters of recommendation that Wilton had written for himself when he applied to his postdoc at Sheffield College. And it's amazing to me that people would provide that. But yeah, and you can see it says stamped recommended because he got the job. And I'm going to continue with the history here. And I'm going to continue with the history here. So, Stokes waves, if you look in Stokes' 1845 paper, there's a plot in that paper of a Stokes wave that's here depicted. This is just screenshot from his paper. And then in 1915, when Wilton famously wrote his paper on ripples, there was a picture in that one as well. And I think it's interesting to reflect on how these pictures were constructed. How does one make Stokes when Stokes computed his wave? He didn't just represent the solution as cosine of X, it was cosine of X. Solution as cosine of x, it was cosine of x plus a constant times cosine of 2x plus a constant times cosine of 3x. And that's as far as he went. But then he summed those three trig functions and plotted the sum. And that's what he reported in his paper. It's interesting to think, how did he make such a plot? And I've done a little digging on how one would in 19 or in 1845 make such a plot. And the only answer I can come up with is he like connected the dots. In 1904, Dots. In 1904, there was an invention by Michelson called the harmonic analyzer. That's this picture here on the right. That you could tell it, give plot six Fourier modes, or I think this particular picture has like 64 Fourier modes, and you can specify the amplitudes, and this mechanical device draws it for you. And those were available in 1904. So, in principle, Wilton could have used such a device to make a plot. Neither of them had calculators, but Wilton may have, if his department was very wealthy, had access to a hard. I had access to a Mickelson harmonic analyzer, but probably he connected the dots too. If you want to understand this problem of the Wilton ripples, the first thing you look at is you look at linear theory and say, okay, if I assume I have a small amplitude wave, so I like think of U as expanded in some small parameter epsilon, and I want to see what solutions the problem has, depending on what the bond number is, you may have. You may have a situation where two modes can copropagate. So, I have here pictured the phase speed of an example of one of these model equations. And the ingredients you need in order to have Wilton ripples is you need a non-monotonic phase speed so that you can have two intersections of this phase speed with a particular fixed frame of reference, fixed frame of motion. And then, in addition to that, you need those two intersections to both happen on the integers, on the integer. To both happen on the integers, on the integer lattice. So, here is this cartoon shows you: like, okay, it appears that whatever this dispersion relation is, I could have two co-propagating modes with frequencies one and two, because on the integer lattice, this intersection happens at one and two. And that only happens for discrete sampling of bond numbers. And so, if you look, I mean, just looking at this one for a second, you can see that I cannot have on this integer lattice with this bond number two. With this bond number, two co-propagating waves with frequency three and one, because one is a little bit to the right of where the line that you would draw from k equals three in the phase speed would intersect with a smaller wave number. So the only co-propagating waves in this bond number configuration would be the one, two harmonic. There wouldn't be a one, three or a one, four, et cetera. And that problem was one that Wilton struggled with a lot when he finished his. When he finished his postdoc, he did this postdoc at Sheffield. He stopped studying water waves because he was very interested in what are the solutions of elliptic curves when the roots I'm interested in are only on the integer lattice. And so he spent the whole rest of his career in number theory as a result of trying to find out when Wilton ripples existed in some water wave equations. If you want to look at the non-linear problem, you have to do a little bit more, and the traditional procedure. And the traditional procedure is to reduce by like plugging in a power series expansion of your solution, reduce the problem you're trying to solve from a nonlinear one to a sequence of linear problems. So that's what this is meant to depict here. A is some linear operator and U is the corrections to your solution you're trying to find and B is some known right-hand side or B is some right-hand side which doesn't depend on UN. And well, the classic way that one handles this is with like a Classic way that one handles this is with like a Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure, where you say, okay, I'm going to enforce that these U ends or that these B ends rather lie orthogonal to the null space of A or to the null space of the adjoint of A. And that's going to give me some solvability conditions. And if I satisfy those solvability conditions with some bifurcation parameters, then I can construct an entire power series representation of my solution. For historical context, For historical context, for Stokes's work, and Stokes did all this after this is Taylor, like Taylor series, in 1715. Stokes did this in 1845, so he was fully aware of power series representations of solutions. But Lyapunov didn't do his work till the 1870s, so Stokes was not aware of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction when he did his series. So, what is Stokes's solution then? It's say I. Then, it's say I start with a single unimodal cosine of x, and I expand the solution as a power series and compute the corrections. This is what Stokes did. He recognized that I can't just expand u. I also have to expand the speed, that I can't just say I'm going to move at a particular speed. As the amplitude increases, I need corrections to the speed. So, Stokes' feeling on how this problem might be solved is to say, hey, I'm going to do a power series. Is to say, hey, I'm going to do a power series and I'm going to have to use the speed corrections to satisfy Fredholm conditions in a Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure. He wouldn't have called it Lyapunov-Schmidt, but effectively that's what he's doing. And the result of plugging in this expansion is that you get linear solvability conditions. That is, the equations you have to solve based on enforcing orthogonality of the right-hand side to the null space of the adjoint of the linear problems or enforcing that the right-hand side of your linear. The right-hand side of your linear problems or is within the range of your operator, is that you just get linear equations for the C's. So it's actually pretty easy to calculate these C's. And you can do this recursively. And there is a reasonable history in the 80s. Jean-Marc van den Brock and some colleagues actually compute these for the water wave problems with a clever method that's stable and computes lots of different power series effectively. So, if you want to do the same thing for the Wilton problem, for Wilton ripples, when the kernel of the linear operator is two-dimensional, when you have two harmonics in the null space of this operator, you try and do the same thing, plug in a power series expansion for you, and you can still compute the later corrections if you impose a Lyapunov-Schmidt, or if you do a Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure. And Wilton's Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure, his idea is to use the speed. His idea is to use the speed corrections just like Stokes, and then to say, okay, the ratio of these two modes, linear theory would say any ratio of these two modes should work, but I'm going to correct the ratio of these two harmonics successively and find what the ratio of cosine of x and cosine of 2x should be in the nonlinear problem. So he used C1 and C2 and beta 1 and beta 2 and beta 3. Beta one and beta two and beta three to solve his solvability conditions. And the result of that Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure is that there's a nonlinear solvability condition for beta one, for the leading order ratio of cosine of x and cosine of two x. And it's a nonlinear, it's an algebraic nonlinear equation, so it has roots, but only special values of beta one are allowed. So only special ratios of the two harmonics in the null space generate. Generate an analytic representation of the solution, a parametrically analytic, so analytic and epsilon representation of the solution U as a power series. That was the situation up until 2000 and something, 2008 or 9, where if you want to find a bimodal bifurcated traveling wave like the Wilton Ripples ones, they only seem to exist for particular reasons. Seem to exist for particular ratios of the cosine of x versus cosine of 2x. And you can compute them for all different ratios of the two harmonics. So like a one, two resonance might look like this wave or this wave. People have done it for higher resonance ratios. So between like take wave number one and wave number three, then you get three waves. And lots of these have been computed. In the Wilton framework, In the Wilton framework, myself and Dave Nichols have a proof that these series converge, that u and beta and c are all parametrically analytic in epsilon. It's kind of a bear because you have to compute the nonlinear solvability condition exactly, and then you can use a recursion relation and prove the analyticity of these series. We only did this in 2020-ish. Ish. Preceding us, a number of other groups, so many, at least three audience members, I think, here, have proved the existence of bimodal traveling waves in at least a model equation, if not also the water wave equations, using a different Lyapunov-Schmidt type procedure, where you say, okay, I'm interested in U that's bimodal, so it's got cosine of X and cosine of 2x, and I know that the kernel of the linear operator is two-dimensional. kernel of the linear operator is two-dimensional. So I need to solve two solvability conditions at every order. I need to do the Appanov-Schmidt procedure where I'm going to have to have two bifurcation parameters. And the 2008 to today basically idea is let's not use beta. Let's leave beta free, hopefully. And let's use the speed corrections and some other bifurcation parameter. So I think almost all the articles I was able to find, you should think of it as being the bond number. Being the bond number, this second parameter. Maybe it's the surface tension, maybe it's the period of the waves, but those two things are wrapped up in the bond number and its historical definition. So you can think of these other articles as all using a bond number as the second parameter. And now, if you try this approach and do a standard Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure, what happens? You get linear solvability conditions for the C, for the speed corrections and the bond number corrections. And in addition to that, what you find is these waves exist for almost every value of this ratio between the two modes. And I'll be explicit by what I mean by almost every value. But that's what you would have thought from linear theory to begin. Like, oh yeah, linear theory, I can superimpose solutions so I could have any beta. And for 100 years almost, the Wilton-Ripple scenario suggested that, oh, the linear solution only allowed or allowed for arbitrary. Only allowed or allowed for arbitrary superposition, but the nonlinear problem only existed around particular ratios of this beta, only particular ratios were allowed. And then with this new technique where you say, okay, it's almost expanding the problem, right? We're saying this bond number that appears, I'm going to go hold your breath while I go back, that appears within these linear operators. Like there is a coefficient of a differential term in my equation. And that coefficient denotes like a physical parameter of surface tension or domain. Parameter of surface tension or domain size, if you're using instead the period of the wave to expand with. So we've expanded the problem to not just be this fixed physical scenario, but now a family of physical scenarios when you expand in bond number. That approach, however, suggests that, oh, not only now you have a solution for any beta that you pick, so you have a free parameter in those solutions, beta one. And if I'm allowed And if I'm allowed to vary that free parameter, I don't just get a branch of solutions in epsilon. I get like a sheet of solutions. They have epsilon denoting their size and beta being like the direction that I'm moving along a sheet of solutions. And when these articles first came out, I was very confused because I thought, wait, I thought Wilts and Ripples only existed for particular beta, and now they're these sheets, but the sheets compute not at the original physical problem. The original physical problem does it include the original physical problem? And this has been a thing I've been struggling with for a while. And so I finally decided I'm going to try and understand it a bit more. And I'm going to hopefully help everyone else, everyone here in the audience understand it a bit more. So when you're computing the sheets, you're picking the ratio between these two harmonics, cosine of x and cosine of 2x. And you can think of that like if I were to represent all the Like, if I were to represent all the values of beta, like say with the angle on a circle, so I'll use tangent of theta, theta being the angle on this circle, and I'll represent beta one that way. If I pick theta equals zero, then tangent is zero and beta one is zero, and I get a wave that's only represented at only supported at cosine of x, doesn't have a cosine of two x component. If I let beta be pi over two or minus pi over two, then this coefficient is infinity. Then this coefficient is infinity. So I should think that I don't have a cosine of x component. And anywhere in between, I have a superposition of two different cosine of x and cosine of 2x. And they look kind of like the Wilton ripples qualitatively. And somewhere, so for some values of beta, so beta here marked with a star, there are special values of beta that correspond with what Wilton would have said beta one is allowed to be, marked here by stars. Stars. And on this picture on the right, I have every profile or a sampling of beta, of theta, giving a whole bunch of different views of what these profiles would look like. I normalize them so that the ones that beta at one is infinity don't still fit on the graph. And the black ones are the Wilton ripples, and all the other ones are all the other values of all the other ripples that aren't maybe the ones Wilton described. All the other leading term smallest waves on the sheet. I want to discuss these waves, all of them, not just the Wilton ripples when the resonance is between K equals one and K equals two, not just between the carrier wave and its first harmonic, but also between its next harmonic or however many, whatever the two wave numbers are in the resonance in the kernel of this operator. And the And the way I like to discuss that is within the framework of resonant interaction theory. Labeling resonant interaction theory that is due to Philips. Diane Henderson has a great review article about this that came out, it's probably also 20 years ago, where in resonant interaction theory, you say, I have some Fourier modes, some wave numbers that add to, that sum to zero, and they have some temporal frequencies like from the dispersion relation, which also sum to zero. The from the dispersion relation, which also sum to zero. And if I have three such wave numbers and three such temporal frequencies that sum to zero, you call that a triad. And if you have four such wave numbers, you call it a quartet. And you have five, you call it a quintet, et cetera, et cetera. And I want to use that language to label these resonances, to label the cosine of x and cosine of mx interactions. So if I pick m equals 2, these ripples are actually an example of a triad resonance. Actually, an example of a triad resonance. The resonance being k1 being one, k1 being one, again, add those two together and get two. So, k2 can be two. And there's three wave numbers, one, one, and two, which sum to zero. And because I've assumed that these wave numbers co-propagate, I can also tell you that their phase speeds are the same. This phase speed at C1 or at wave number one equals the phase speed at wave number two. And the definition of the phase speed. And the definition of the phase speed allows you to deduce that, oh, yeah, also their temporal frequencies sum to zero. And I get a classic triad resonance between these two harmonics. And the similar calculation works. If m equals three, then I have three copies of wave number one interacting with one copy of wave number three. And the same relationship can be said about their temporal frequencies. And that continues for higher frequencies. That continues for higher frequencies as well. So, if you, so I guess what I'm saying is, I'm going to call this problem, this solution, a triad resonant Wilton ripple. When it's m equals 2 correspond to a triad resonance in the language of resonant interaction theory, that's when I have cosine of x interacting with cosine of 2x. In that circumstance, if you do the power series representation, you plug in these things. Plug in these things, this guy here, and try and compute the corrections to the bond number. Or at the same time, you try and do Wilton's method and try and compute the corrections to this ratio of the two modes. Those can be calculated in both settings by hand, at least to a couple of orders. I mean, probably to all orders. It gets a little bit harder in the sheets of Ripple's case because. In the sheets of Ripple's case, because you have to expand the differential, if you're doing, say, for the Widem equation, you have to expand the differential operator when you're taking corrections in sigma one. And then you have to think hard about whether the power series representation of that differential operator converges in the midst of this process. But you can do it at least to a couple of orders and get some asymptotics. And that's what I'm going to present here. When I'm considering the triad ripple, m equals two, when you compute the first correct. When you compute the first correction, in Wilton's framework, Wilton says I'm not allowed to vary the bond number. So the first correction of the bond number is zero. And then I compute the first correction, or maybe not a correction. I compute beta one, the ratio of the two modes in the null space at leading order. And I find that it can only be plus or minus. Here I've done them explicitly for Widem. So in WIDHM, it's plus or minus a half, a square root of a half. If I, if I If I instead say, okay, I don't want to be restricted to these two ratios of the two modes, and in exchange for that, I'll expand the value of the bond number, like in the Sheets framework. Then what happens, I find that solutions exist so long as sigma 1, the correction of the bond number, is this algebraic relationship having beta 1 in it. And if you look at this relationship, you see that the numerator vanished. You see that the numerator vanishes when beta one is plus or minus square root of one half, which is the Wilton-Ripples case. And the denominator vanishes, well, if beta one is zero. That's if I'm trying to make this thing be a Stokes wave, right? Beta one is the amplitude of cosine of 2x. So if that's zero, then there's only a unimodal wave. It's not a bimodal wave that's bifurcating. So if I stay away from beta one equals zero, then I can find the first correction. Then I can find the first correction, and I can find that first correction for almost every beta one, then, or beta one, any ratio of these two modes except zero. And the only time, if you look at this ratio, the only time that the surface tension won't vary is, or the bond number won't vary, is when beta one is this plus or minus the square root of one half is the Wilton-Ripple case. So, I guess what I'm saying here is, according to these asymptotics, the classic Wilton-Ripple is embedded within these sheets. Is embedded within these sheets, right? And the asymptotics you get for the sheets of ripples include the classic Wilton ripple branches as a special case. That's really nice from my perspective because there's lots of nice proofs that the sheets of ripples exist that use this framework where they expand the bond number or the surface tension or the wave number or the period of the domain. All those expansions are changing the. Those expansions are changing the physical problem away from Wilton's problem, maybe. And since you don't, in the most of these proofs, they are not constructive, they're a Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure mixed with an implicit function theorem type argument. So the proof doesn't tell you whether or not when, if I look within that sheet, which includes sigma equals zero, or sorry, which includes non-varying bond number, includes sigma one equaling zero, does the branch within Does the branch within that sheet stay at that value? And it appears that they do. It appears that the Wilton Ripples are a member of the sheet. And you can do the same thing with the later, with the quartet resonant waves. So you say I have U is a superposition of two harmonics. Beta one is the ratio between cosine of X and cosine of 3x. When you do the series expansion in that problem, the first correct. Problem, the first correction, and in the Wilton-Ripple problem, where I don't allow the bond number to vary, then sigma one, the first correction, the bond number, is zero because it's not allowed to vary. And sigma two, the second correction, is also zero. And for that matter, all the sigma j are zero because sigma is not allowed to vary in the Wilton-Ripple framework. And then you get a cubic equation for beta one, and the roots of that cubic are the different correspond to the different Wilton-Ripple waves that you would see like in this plot. So this is one value of the. Plot. So this is one value of the one root of that cubic, and a second root of that cubic, and a third root of that cubic, and Wilton's framework would say those are the only three that exist. Get back here. But if you instead use the Sheets expansion and say, I'm going to allow sigma to be whatever it needs to be, then I look, then when m equals three, the first correction, sigma one, is zero. So the sheets maybe are the same as Wilton from that perspective. But if I go one order further, so I had to go to epsilon. order further so i had to go to epsilon squared in sigma 2 to find this out or in in this expansion to find this out starting epsilon here solving for epsilon squared for the u correction explicitly then find the solvability condition at that order and then you find that sigma 2's correction has the exact same cubic that wilton would have asked you to solve in the numerator so if i'm if i am a wilton ripple if the beta one i pick is the wilton's beta then sigma 2 vanishes its numerator vanishes so Vanishes, its numerator vanishes. So, again, the Wilton-Ripple branch seems to be embedded within the sheet. It's the only part of the sheet that allows for non-varying sigma 2. And again, I'm not allowed to have beta 1 be 0. So I get almost every beta is allowed. So again, I get a sheet. The Wilton-Ripple branches seem to be embedded within the sheet. And if you go higher and you say, now I want the second harmonics frequency to be bigger than four. Frequency to be bigger than four, bigger than or equal to four. Then there's an interaction term that drops out, and the Wilton-Ripple problem is a cubic, but now it's a cubic that you can factor in your head and see that, oh, this is a beta cubed plus d beta one equals zero. So beta one, so there is a solution that looks like a Stokes wave that has no coefficient on the cosine of mx term. And then there may or may not be two other solutions, depending on whether the quadratic that remains. Whether the quadratic that remains has real roots or complex roots. If they have imaginary roots, it doesn't make sense to represent the real solutions we're interested in here. And the sheets have the exact same character. They still have that cubic that Wilton wants you to solve for the leading correction in the numerator of the first correction to the bond number. So when I'm on a Wilton Ripple within the sheet, I don't need the bond number to change at next order. And still, I have beta one, the denominator. And now we'll. I have beta one, the denominator, and now well, there was a beta one, the numerator, and the denominator. So maybe there's a hole in these graphs, but there I may or may not be able to define that what happens to the solution when beta, when you have this indeterminate form here, when beta one is zero. So you could preclude it in a proof, or you could allow it, you could maybe amend the proof to allow for beta one, zero in this based on these asymptotics. Based on these asymptotics. Now, that's the formal asymptotics of the solution that suggests that maybe these classic Wilton ripples are continuously embedded within the sheets of ripples that a lot of people have proved exist in many scenarios over the last couple of years. So, the asymptotics suggest that the ripples are embedded. Maybe we could numerically verify they're embedded with some. They're embedded with something independent from our asymptotics. And a historical way that people do that is to represent the solution as a Fourier series, where the unknowns I'm going to now solve for are the coefficients of the Fourier modes that I use to project you onto those Fourier modes. I'm going to Newton solve for the coefficients, the speed, and then I'm also going to Newton solve for, I can't see it because of my Zoom. Wait, hold on. There we go. Wait, hold on. There we go. I'm also going to Newton solve for the bond number. And that's going to allow me to traverse these sheets, right? Because in the sheet power series representation, the coefficients we use to satisfy our solvability conditions in our Lyapunov-Schip procedure, our bifurcation parameters, our speed and bond number. And so I'm going to use the asymptotics I just created as an initial guess for a Newton solver using these for the Newton solver using these for these variables. I'm going to compute larger amplitude branches via continuation. That's the classic approach. And then if I want to compute the sheets of waves, I'm going to fix, I'm going to add an equation in my Newton solver that fixes beta at a particular value. And if I'm not going to compute the sheets, but instead I'm going to compute the classic Wilton ripples, I'll let beta be whatever it needs to, and I'm going to fix sigma with an auxiliary equation. With an auxiliary equation. And so, those two numerical procedures, one will give me the classic Wilton ripples, and the other will compute continuous sheets in principle of traveling waves. And that's exactly what I've done. And I have some pictures for you to convince everybody that everything I said is true, or at least is self-consistent. Maybe they're all wrong. So here I have on the left, I have a picture of sigma one. I have a picture of sigma one as a function of beta. So that's you should think of these as the these sigma ones as telling you what direction I have to move in bond number in the bond number amplitude plane in order to stay on one of these sheets. And there is two particular roots of this sigma one. They're marked with stars, and those are the Wilton-Ripple values. I have in this graph the solid line is the asymptotics of the previous page. Is the asymptotics of the previous page, and the dots are what you get if you Newton-solve for the waves, and then you take a finite difference approximation of your Newton-solved branch to compute what sigma one would have been numerically. So in other words, I have a numerical estimate of sigma one that I'm comparing to the asymptotic prediction for sigma one, and they agree to the precision of this graph. I also have computed here what the sheets might look like if you visualize them in. If you visualize them in, well, I picked a particular three-dimensional plane to plot them in, or three-dimensional space to plot them in. So here, epsilon is the amplitude, beta is the ratio between cosine of x and cosine of 2x, the full ratio. It's not beta one. It's like sum up all the contributions of all the coefficients of cosine of 2x and compute the ratio of the two Fourier modes of the numerical solution. And then I have, then you get these surfaces. I have, then you get these surfaces. The surfaces are bent here, and you can see why they would be bent. This picture on the left effectively tells you what a slice through this thing might look like, that the waves move away from the bond number you started with at zero amplitude, and they move depending on what sigma one is. So the sheets have our fold. So, the sheets are folded, in other words, and the fold is pretty close to where the two Wilton ripples, the classic Wilton ripples, are. So, I have these black vertical lines. The classic Wilton ripple doesn't have varying surface tension, so it stays at bond number one half here the whole time, and the sheets move away from bond number one half for every single value of beta that you pick, except for the two special ones. But you can look at this graph and see, oh, yeah, it sure looks like the classic. The classic Wilton ripples are embedded nicely within these sheets, just like the asymptotics predict. And you can do the same thing for quartets. For quartets, there was a cubic that you had to find the roots of to find beta one. So there's three roots of that cubic. And here's the plot of the numerically computed sigma two, the first non-zero correction to the bond number for traveling sheets, for sheets of traveling ripples. For sheets of traveling ripples was sigma two. And I have the asymptotic prediction again as a solid line and the numerical estimates of that same quantity with circles. And again, the only time that sigma 2 gets to be zero is at these three stars, which are the Wilder-Ripple values. And again, I have here depicted the sheet. The sheet now, I mean, depending on which direction you look at this from, which direction you consider projecting it, it's multiply folded. There's kind of like Folded. There's kind of like a parabola, and then also this fold here. There are three black curves, maybe the third one's hard to see, that correspond to three Wilton ripples, and they seem to be embedded yet again continuously within these sheets. If you go to the next order, all of these pictures I've showed you are for deepwater Widom. If you go to the next order for deepwater Widom and look at a quintet resonance, so between cosine of X and cosine of 4X would be a quintet. X and cosine of 4x would be a quintet resonance. Then the cubic you get here, beta 1 cubed plus d beta 1, it only has one real root, and that's beta equals zero. The two non-zero roots are complex. And since there was a denominator here of beta, beta equaling zero may or may not be allowed from this perspective. And you look here and see that, oh, there is some little, there seems to have been a hole. Little, there seems to have been a hole. You can't really see it very well. I can't zoom in for you. Here, the numerics match the asymptotics, but there's a hole in the asymptotics there, and there is some numerical evidence that something squirrely is happening at beta one equals zero. And if you make the sheets, beta one equals zero is a wedge cut out of these sheets. The sheet of traveling waves, all of them have non-zero sigma two, so they all curve away from the bond number that you started at. That you started at, which is hero quarter, and they all curve to the right. And then at beta one not equaling zero, the sheets don't exist. I wasn't able to compute them at least. That's all traveling waves. And to be honest, up to this asymptotic connection, I feel the traveling wave problem is very well studied. This same architecture. Architecture arises in the linear stability problem for traveling waves and the linear stability problem for not just Wilton ripples but also for Stokes waves or any periodic wave you're looking at. If you were to take these solutions we discussed on the previous slides and plug them into the model equation and linearize in the traditional way and then try and represent those spectrum the spectral data like The spectral data, like the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of that linearization as an analytic, parametrically analytic power series in epsilon. What you would have for the linear problem is a very similar scenario at eigenvalue collisions or at the typical eigenvalue collision. Eigenvalue collisions are going to mean that you have two harmonics in the kernel of the linear operator. The kernel linear operator is a little more complicated. The kernel linear operator is a little more complicated now, but it's still a some linear operator. In order for there to be an eigenvalue collision, the dimension of that kernel is at least two. It might be higher than two, but then it's a really special collision where more than two eigenvalues collide with one another. So the typical one has dimension two, just like the Wilton Ripples had two elements and then two harmonics in their null space. The stability problem has two functions in its null space. And if you want, Space. And if you want to build that power series, you can do it the same way that Wilton would have done it. You can say, I'm going to fix, instead of fixing the bond number, I might fix the flow K parameter. So P here is a flow K parameter. I didn't say that on the previous slide. Like the boundary conditions we put on the stability on eigenfunctions aren't that they have to be co-periodic with the wave, but they're that we apply a block or flow k-style boundary condition. So they can be not have the same period as the wave, and P tells me how. Same period as the wave, and p tells me how different the period is. And if I fix p to be the flow k parameter for which the kernel of this linear operator was two-dimensional, then I can compute the spectrum as an analytic function, parametrically analytic function of epsilon by doing what Wilton would have done. Fix the geometry, fix the period, expand the ratio of the two harmonics. Beta is still the ratio of the two. Two harmonics, beta is still the ratio of the two harmonics as a power series, and then instead of expanding the speed, now I'm expanding the eigenvalue. But still, this idea gives very similar solvability conditions to what Wilton would have encountered. I don't have it written on this slide, but you get non-linear solvability conditions for lambda 1 and beta naught if the ratio of the two harmonics that are in the null space. Oh, wrong way, sorry. Space, wrong way, sorry. If the ratio of k1 and k2 is one and two, then I'm going to have to solve a quadratic to find these guys, lambda one and beta naught, and so on. And then after that, it'll be linear for the rest of the corrections. If there's the frequency difference is higher, I might have to solve a cubic and so on and so forth. That allows you to compute the spectrum for fixed flow k parameter. So this is what the picture might look like. You'll get two branches just like Wilt. Might look like you'll get two branches just like Wilton, or some number of branches, if the frequency difference is higher. You've got some branches of eigenvalues, and you can compare the asymptotics I have here in red and numerical computations with the non-asymptotic solver I have here as dots, and they agree. And that's all well and good, but that turns out to miss most instabilities. So, another way that you might do this, I'm calling it the Sheets way in this presentation. Way in this presentation would be to expand the flow k parameter the same way that you might have expanded the period or the bond number or the surface tension in the computation of Wills and Ripples. And if I expand the flow k parameter, well, I already had enough. Like if I do a counting here, I'm doing a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction in a problem with two-dimensional kernel. So I only need two parameters, two bifurcation parameters. And here I'm adding. Bifurcation parameters, and here I'm adding a third bifurcation parameter that means one of them is going to be free. And so, the way I've done this in the past is I've used Wilton's framework and found beta one and lambda one, and then thought of the bond, thought of the thought of, thought of the flow k parameter as my free thing. And each new flow k parameter, P1, et cetera, that I pick, that corresponds to a direction that I'm looking in flow K space. I can pick any direction and I'll. I can pick any direction and I'll get different, I'll get, I'll be able to construct a spectrum. And for some directions, I'll have a stable spectrum, and for pure imaginary eigenvalues, and for some directions, I'll have real eigenvalues, but all of them I'll be able to construct with Lyapunov-Schmidt. I suppose I could have done it a different way because the way I've done this in the past, I've used beta one as and or I've used the betas and lambdas. And lambdas, uh, I've Dave Nichols and I have a couple papers where we've done this. You've used betas and lambdas to construct the spectrum and then thought of p as an extra parameter. But I, the, if we were to be the most parallel with these traveling sheets of waves, uh, beta is let free and the Lyapunov Schmidt reduction uses C and sigma. Right? So, if I want to be most parallel to that, I don't think anyone has done this, so I'm maybe advertising that Ryan should do this. Ryan should do this. Writing it down as you say. So rather than using P as the free, the flow K parameter is the free parameter, what I maybe should have done is I should have used beta as the free parameter and not had to expand it at all. That's nice, less expansions. And if we believe the analogy, then the solvability conditions for p and lambda should be linear. And then I won't have to solve any of these complications. And then I won't have to solve any of these complicated equations to find the corrections to the spectrum. I won't have to solve quadratics and cubics. The solvability conditions will all be linear. Still, I'll be able to explore the same space. It's just whether I'll be concerned about do I want to fix the flow k parameter or not. So I won't, if you, if you, the way that I've done this in the past, the way that this picture is meant to depict, you pick a You pick a p naught, you compute the spectrum, and then you vary p1. And that in this cartoon on the bottom here says I start at an eigenvalue collision and I look along lines and I get to the lines get to be on angles because I choose what P1 is. So at a particular flow K parameter, there might be an instability, and then there's going to be a whole sheet of instabilities by varying P1 until I get outside of some range for which. Some range for which the solution is just going to tell me, oh, it stops, the corrections stop being real, and I stop having instabilities. And so this is a cartoon of how those, where the instabilities lie, depending on whether the eigenfunctions are undergoing a particular resonance using the language of resonant interaction theory. So if it's a triad resonance, then the If it's a triad resonance, then the instabilities lie between lines. And if it's a quartet resonance, they lie between, I mean, these are like parabolas, sections of parabolas. And if it's higher order than that, they're asymptotically close to a parabola. And you can do the same type of independent, or it's still done by me, but non-a secondary computation to verify that these things work. So here I've just So here I've just used a Newton-type solver to calculate the spectrum moving at all these different angles in flow k and amplitude space, just like this picture on the left. Only I plot for you what's the spectrum doing. And so I still have something to me that looks like a sheet with folds in it in this problem the same way that the traveling waves have sheets with folds in them. So I think that's really the message I'm trying to send to this crowd of This crowd of experts in proving that these bimodal traveling waves exist, that probably this same framework would prove that the spectral data near eigenvalue collisions exists, at least for some distance away from the flat state spectrum. And that's all the messaging I have, except to advertise all the excellent papers that have come out in the last. Have come out in the last, I guess, how long ago is 2009? So, many, many of the participants in this workshop have their names on this slide. Maybe I'd feature some like, I really like this paper, the 2019 Johnson-Malin-Ernstrom-Reminado on the bifurcation diagram of gravity capillary widum. That's the one that inspired me to start looking at the problem this way. But people have done this, similar type of approaches, like Toland has one in the hydroelastic. Toland has one in the hydroelastic problem. Martin and Matiak do it with vorticity. And I think a lot of what Ryan Frieden is working on right now is going to use these, has used and will use these same ideas. So I have some of his papers featured as well. And myself, I'm going to, this stuff I talked about today will eventually appear in a paper and you can read about it. That's almost everything I have to say, except. Almost everything I have to say, except if you want the pictures of Stokes or Maxwell's review, Maxwell's review of Stokes' paper or anything like that, here's the referencing information. And I'm supposed to say that the federal government of the United States does not endorse anything that I've said.
