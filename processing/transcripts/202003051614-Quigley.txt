Thanks for the invitation to be here and the chance to speak. So I'm going to talk about Tate Blueshift for real-oriented cohomology. I was trying to think of a good joke related to the color blue. So earlier so during Danny's talk he mentioned that green is good and red is bad. Mentioned that green is good and red is bad. Blue is actually in the middle of those, so it's neutral at best. And I think Agnes actually said it's bad. So we'll see how this goes. So I want to start by talking about classical blue shift. And there's a couple of different flavors. So first, I better tell you what the tate construction is. Tate construction is. So I'm going to let μ be a finite group. And just to fix notation, I'll write mu p for the cyclic group of order p like in Gabe stock. And let's say that I have x. X be a spectrum with a Borel mu action. So not a genuine nu spectrum, just a Borel one. Then I can make the following definitions. I can define homotopy orbits. X lower h mu by taking the universal space for mu, smash over mu with x. This maps to the home of two fixed points, which is given by taking functions from E mu. By taking functions from eμ plus to x, and then taking the mu categorical fixed points. This is the additive norm, and the cofiber is the tape construction. And there's an explicit model for this. That's E mu tilde smash function. smash functions from e mu plus into x and then you take the mu categorical fixed points of that. And I guess I should just remind you that E mu tilde is defined by taking E mu plus, take the collapse map which sends all of E mu to one point, and disjoint this point to another point, and then the cofiver is Is what I'm calling Eμ tilde. Okay, so this is the Tate construction that I'll be interested in for this classical blue shift discussion. So let me say a few examples. So, first, an example from algebra. If you start by looking at some of the homotopy groups of an integral Eilenberg-McPlane spectrum, and I might as well just complete it too, because I'm going to want to do completion or localization always from now on. And I take the take construction where mu two acts on Z2 trivially. Trivially. Then this is the tape cohomology of mu2 with coefficients in Z2. And this is F2 if star is even, and 0 if star is odd. So this tells us that this takes place. This tape construction is equivalent to, I guess I should write, product over the integers of some even suspensions of HFT. And this is blue shift in the sense of chromatic height from Leonard's talk, for example. So maybe I'll write in red the heights. So HZ2 is height zero and 0 and HF2 is height minus 1. So when we take this tape construction with respect to a trivial mu2 action, we get a decrease in chromatic height. Okay. So there are interesting non-algebraic examples. Maybe the first one is a theorem from, I think, the 80s by Davis and Mahola. So from now on, mu2 is always going to act trivially on everything. So let's say that mu2 acts on connective real K-theory, KO, trivially. Then there's an equivalence between the mu2 take construction of KO and And I think I need an infinite product over the integers of fourfold suspensions of the two x. So if we examine the heights of everything, KO is height one, and HZ2 is height zero. So again, we see this shift. There's one more result in this direction. Result in this direction. So, this was proven, I think, in 84 or 85. The next height up is a little bit harder. The paper came out in 2019, I think. So theorem of Bailey and Ricka says that if you let mu2 act on the map, you can use the mm-hmm μ2 act on connective TMF trivially. Then you get an equivalence between the trivial take construction and again some infinite product of now eight-fold suspensions of KO. And I probably am just suppressing to completion at this point. What is the justification for saying that if two has identical or as pretty bad in my way to think of it for these spectra is the colonologies A mod mod A2, A mod mod A1, A mod mod A0, A mod mod nothing, or A mod mod A minus 1. But I guess you can make it precise. But I guess you can make it precise with the notion of height that was in Leonard's talk using this TN localization. Didn't HF do have height minus one in your calculators? Okay, so you can't really go any further in this direction with a mod mod whatever cohomology. So there are some really So there are some related results, but let me just first state a conjecture that showed up in this original paper of Davis and Maholal. They conjectured that if you let mu2 act on BB brackets N, which is just the ordinary one, trivially, Trivially, then there's an equivalence between this trivial tape construction and a product over the integers of just two fold suspensions of BP brackets and minus one. So for example, this is known for This is known for n equals one by Davis and Mehold, and it's known for n equals two by Davis and Lehold, plus Johnson, Lippenstein, and Wegman. So the way that you prove all of these blueshift results for connective spectra is using a certain model for the tape construction, and then the atom spectral sequence to prove an iso and homotopy. And then you actually have to construct a map. So one thing that I'm going to show you in a little bit is that you can just prove this on homotopy. But you can just prove this on homotopy groups always. So the hard part is constructing that map that realizes the isomorphism. Okay, so I wanted to give a quick survey of these connected results. And I also wanted to mention, I mean, it's already a dating one, but it's something like that I'll say normally for auto primes, with KTP. KP. Um conjectured a lot. If you conjecture the law, you make a conjecture. This one is conjectured for authorized two. Okay. So is it are there any? You said everything was completed at two, but is that enough completion? For this one, I think that's the conjecture. They're doing everything with the atom spectrum sequence constructed maps, if I d remember correctly. Everything's going to be the atom spectrum sign. They're just doing the mod two signal algorithm computations so they So they do correspond to applications all so maybe what you have in mind is going to come up later where we have to complete with respect to more elements. Okay. So I wanted to quickly say why I care about these blue shift results besides that they're just totally weird and cool. And one reason is because these kinds of blue shifts results allow you to prove Results allow you to prove redshift results for the Hololten variance. So let me remark that Mahol-Aldin, his blue shift in a very roundabout way, helps you prove redshift for the Mahal invariance that we saw in Joy. That we saw in Jolie and Dan's talks. And the idea is roughly as follows. One way that you can define the Moholbin variant is you start with an element in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. By Lin's theorem or Goudo-Wardena's theorem, that's equivalent to the tape condition. That's equivalent to the tape construction on the sphere with trivial mu2 action, where again, here I'm too complete. And what the Mahald invariant does, it takes an element from here and associates a new element just in the actual spectro or in the homotopy groups of the sphere. So this is a slightly different perspective on the Maholal. Perspective on the Mahol-Alden variant than what we saw earlier in the week. But okay, if I start with one of these Tate splittings where everything in sight has a Herebitra, so for example, I could start with KO T mu2. Then there's some approximation to the mohold invariant based on KO, which is going to associate Which is going to associate to an element in the homotopy of the tape construction, something just in the homotopy of KO. But now this blue shift result tells me that the homotopy here, it's not height 0 and 1 stuff, it's just height 0. So this is like so this is just something So, this is just some big sum of two addicts. So, if I wanted to compute, say, the Mahal invariant of 2 to the i, as we saw earlier in the week, I would get an upper bound by comparing to this approximation based on KO. So, upper bound in the sense of Jolie's talk. Of Joel East Hawk. So although these blue shift results are just, they appear to be just kind of weird, they're interesting also from the perspective of some complementary color. Okay. So that's one of the applications I have in mind for the first. Mind after the project today. But I don't think I'll say too much more about it. So now let me actually tell you about the classical result that I'll be extending C2 equivariantly today. So the theorem, the prerequisite theorem to what I'm interested in, was proven, I think, by Greenleys and Nate. By Greenlees and May. There's at least a proof in the generalized tattoo homology book from 95. So if you let mu P act on KO or Ku, trivially, then you get two equivalences. One is Ku T mu P. Ku T mu P is equivalent to some wedge of suspensions of the rationals. And you get an analogous result for KO, where instead of two-fold suspensions, I get four-fold suspensions. equals 2. It's an order prime, I want p minus 1 factors in. Ah. Since I only care about p equals 2, let me just do that then. Thanks. And q is q 2? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay, thanks. So they proved this blue shift result for uh non-connective spectra. Non-connective spectrum. And the proof, as far as I can gather, uses, it's not that the proof is poorly written, it's just that I'm bad at reading. It uses the Atiya-Siegel completion theorem. So in particular, this result is really something special about KU and KO, at least with this proof approach. This proof approach. Okay, but we know that Ku fits into some infinite family of higher chromatic height things. So let's let E of n be the nth Johnson-Wilson theory. I'm not going to write it down all the way because we've seen it like ten times this week. Okay, so let this be the nth Johnson-Wilson theory. Johnson-Wilson theory. Its coefficients are z localized with P, adjoin V1 through Vn minus 1. And then Vn is inverted. And we also define an ideal in here. So this is the classical analog of the ideal that Agnes wrote in her talk. I n minus 1 is the ideal generated by P V1. generated by P, V1, and Vn minus 2. Okay. And we already saw a bunch of examples of these. So for example, E0 is rational homology, E1 is P local, complex K-theory. So in particular, we see both of these things showing up. And so there's this cool theorem of Ando-Morava and Sadovsky that's related to this first splitting. So let's let mu p act on En trivially. Trivially. But there's a map from this sort of awful looking thing. So you take the limit over i of a ledge of j greater than or equal to the minus i of e n minus 1 to the tape construction on e of On E of n completed at i n minus 1. So you can construct a map like this. That's the first claim. But more interestingly, this becomes an equivalence after completion on both sides with respect to i and minus 1. and minus 1. And maybe I'll just remark in this case that this I n minus 1 completion is the same as Kn minus 1 localization. Oh, wait, you were all complete on the right, yes. Right, so you have to complete on the left. What is the widths over? This one? No, the widths. J greater than or equal to minus i. Minus i.e., all of you. Uh does it? I can't read this inside the parentheses in the E, who's a red. N minus one. Sorry, I'll write bigger. Is it clear what's written? Okay. So why does the left-hand side look different than? Oh, oh. Oh, oh, I understand. A typo. Yeah, so of course you need to have these suspensions, just like in all the previous results. Yeah, thank you. There's two good erasers. One is hidden, one's on the floor, one's in my hand, so I guess there's three. Okay. So I think this is a pretty interesting result because as I'm going to try to tell you, d you don't need to know something like the Atiosigal completion theorem to prove it. You just need to do some sort of basic formal group block calculation and then understand a little bit about the tape construction. Okay. Or if the end jobs do it. Yep. Yep. Okay, so it's not too bad. Yeah, okay. So what are the key ingredients to the proof? So you have to do maybe on the maybe if P is odd, then it's not 2J suspension, but 2P minus 2. Suspension, but 2p minus 2 times j, something like that. And since you're all you might not care since you're all 1 times 2. I think if p is odd, it's still 2j. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay, okay. So, two key ingredients to the proof. First, you have to prove an isomorphism and homotopy, and second, And homotopy. And second, you have to produce a map. So let's see. First of all, how do we calculate the homotopy groups? So we use this map that showed up, I think it was the first thing written on the board during Jeremy's talk, maybe. So if E is complex-oriented, then we can compute the E cohomology of Cp infinity. C P infinity. And this is just the coefficients of E, power series one generator, X, and degree two. Okay. So from here, you can calculate the colonology of, say, B mu P. say B mu P or R P infinity P is 2. So you have this short exact sequence. Oh no, okay. And applying B to this and doing a little bit of work shows you that the equo homology of B mu p is Is this ring of power series in X mod the P series associated to the formal group log for E. Okay. And from here, for a trivial mu p action, you find that the homotopy of The homotopy of the Tate construction looks essentially the same, but you replace power series by Laurent series. Okay. So we have an explicit description of the uh Explicit description of the homotopy of the tape construction, at least for complex-oriented cohomology theories with trivial mu p action. Let's see. So I want to show one way in which you can use this, related to that conjecture I wrote earlier. So this was proven again by Ando, Varava, and Sadovsky. And Sadovsky. So they were interested in the, I guess it is mu p, take construction on VP brackets n with trivial action. And they showed that this is isomorphic to Lorentz series over the coefficients of, let me do this in the right order. They show that the homotopy of the Tate construction on height n Brown-Peterson theory is this ring of Laurent series over height n minus 1, Brown-Peterson theory. Okay, and what's the idea using this? Description of the homotopy of the tape construction. Well, this side is Z localized at P, adjoining V1 through VN, Laurent series in X, mod P X. And this side is just Laurent series in the same X, but without a Vn. Would that be N? Is that readable? Sorry, it's a little. Okay. So what you have to do is write down a map. So there's an obvious map from here to here, just by including things in. But to write down the inverse map, you have to be a little bit careful. So the Vi's will get set to Vi. will get sent to Vi, if i is strictly less than n. x gets sent to x. And then you have to decide what to do with vn. So vn gets mapped to what I'll call wn. Where does it come from? Well, over here we're taking this quotient by the p-series. So we have an expression We have an expression like p x, let's see, plus over f v1 x to the p, plus over f vn x to the p to the n. And we're setting this equal to 0. So you just bring everything over to the other side. Over to the other side, and you find that bn is x to the minus p to the n times some wn tilde, and this w n tilde is a power series in p through bn minus 1. So you get an expression that makes sense on the right-hand side. So that's how you write down this isomorphism in homotopy groups. So, one of the key points in this Ando-Moravis-Kakovsky proof theorem is that you need to use really nice properties of the tape construction for complex-oriented cohomology theories. Are there any questions before I do part two of this? Yep. So, let's take a look at the point about exactly which side I guess. So for this one, let me see if I have a quick answer. Yeah, I don't think I have a quick answer. When we start inverting Vn and Vn minus 1, the reason that IN minus 1 completion was showing up is that you need to send Vn. Vn to a unit, I guess. And the way to send it to a unit is to do this completion. But yeah, sorry, I don't have a quick way of saying this. Okay. So the other ingredient, too, is you have to construct. Is you have to construct a map realizing this isomorphism. And to do that, you use the following description of the trivial mu p-tate construction. So this appeared in work of Greenleaz in May. So let's say that mu p acts trivially on some spectrum x. X, then we can describe the tink construction as a homotopy limit, let's say over k of x suspended smashed L infinity minus k, where L is a stunted projective spectrum. Projective spectrum. So, for example, again, since I care about p equals 2, this L infinity k is usually called p infinity minus k, and it's the Tom spectrum of the minus k-fold Whitney sum of the tautological line bundle for RP infinity. Or if you want odd primes, you can replace this with B mu p. P. So even more example, if I look at say P infinity j where j is positive, this is just R P infinity mod its j minus 1 skeleton. So there's this really concrete homotopy limit description of the tape constructor. And so now we want to write down this map from some infinite wedge, basically, or a limit of an inf of wedge, into E event smashed with this homotopy limit of spectra. And you just do the obvious thing. So to write down the math. So to write down the map, you have this limit over i wedge j greater than or equal to minus i of e of n minus 1. And you're just going to send this into the p, well, let me do it without the limit. You're going to send this into suspension. into suspension E of n smash p infinity minus 2i. So the sort of slogan here is that x to the j, sorry, x to the minus i gets sent to the minus 2i cell. So that's how you write down this map, and then you take a limit to get the full thing. Okay. So that's the main idea of the proof of this Andomorava-Sadovsky theorem. You prove the isomorphism in homotopy because you're complex-oriented. And then you construct the map using this model for the Tate construction. Are there any questions before I go on? What time? 25 minutes. Okay, cool. So, in the second, slightly less than half the talk, I want to talk about the real analog of this result. I don't. Maybe blueshift with reality is a better term. Okay. So the Anamorovosidovsky result, when you take n equal to 1, is related to this Greenlease May splitting for Ku. But maybe this is a question with an obvious answer at this point of the day. Answer at this point of the day. But what about, I don't know, room for what about, what of this splitting of KO T MEP into I'm just gonna take two from now on, but uh try it. Try it. Okay. So, what about this? Can we recover it? And so the first thing you needed to sort of generalize the splitting for Ku was you needed some infinite family whose zeroth spectrum was rational homology and whose first spectrum was Ku. So what's the obvious choice here? Obvious choice here. Based on Danny's talk, we should look at the real Johnson-Wilson theories, ERN in genuine C2 spectra. So let me just remind everyone. So let me just remind everyone, the underlying spectrum of ERN is just ordinary classical Johnson-Wilson theory. And let me make a convention. ER not bolded N is the C2 categorical fixed points of ERN. ERN. So for example, ER0 is just rational homology and ER1, well I guess bold ER1 was a T is real K-theory. The C2 fixed points are P local KO. Okay, so this is good. We have this interesting. Okay, so this is good. We have this infinite family, and when we take n equal to 0 and 1, we get this side and this side of the equation. P is 2, right? P is 2. Thank you. Okay. Let me set up one more notation before I can write the theorem. So this constant This constant lambda n is going to show up in the theorem statement. And I cannot remember it. It's 2 to the n plus 2 times 2 to the n minus 1 minus 1 plus 1. So we have Kitch, Lew, and Wilson to thank for this. And the reason that this concept is And the reason that this constant is interesting is because there's a fiber sequence from the suspension by lambda n of the fixed points ERM to ERM to classical Johnson-Wilson theory. So if I take n to be 1, this is recovering the wood cofiber sequence. This is recovering the wood cofiber sequence, expressing Ku as the cofiber of eta smashed with KO. Okay. So that's a constant. It's a nice constant. So it's an all your business function? Uh there's a map that they produce called Y. So is this equivalent to the one uh sequence kind of problem for the provider sequence with S sigma, S zero, S two plus? You smash it with ERN? Yeah. That's how they approved the diagram sequence, actually. Thanks. Okay. So maybe the main theorem about blue shift in this talk. Well, at least the main theorem that I was involved in proving. So for n greater than or equal to 2, and you can actually make a similar statement at n equals 1, but it doesn't quite fit with this description of lambda n. So for n greater than or equal to 2, there's a map of Spectra. Again, this funny limit. Now I have to take suspension, 1 minus lambda n minus 1 times j E R n minus 1. So some huge, some wedge of suspension, some wedge of sort of huge feeling suspensions of height n. Expensions of height n minus 1 Johnson-Wilson theory, real Johnson-Wilson theory. And this maps to now the mu2 hate construction on ERM completed at an ideal IN minus 1 hat that I'll say something about in a second. So you can produce a map like this. And it becomes an equivalence after i n minus one hat completion where i n minus one hat is i n minus one bar Minus one bar, shift it into integer. I don't think I wrote down i n minus one bar, so I better tell you what that is too. Okay. Okay, so I think as we saw earlier today, if I look at the row times an integer grading for PRN, I just get z localized in P adjoint elements B1 through Bn minus 1. Vn minus 1 bar and then Vn bar plus or minus 1, where these Vi's are some lifts of the ordinary Vi's from classical Johnson-Wilson theory. And just like before, I n minus 1 bar is the ideal generated by V V1 bar through V n minus 2 bar. So this in minus one hat that I've written over there is just multiply by appropriate elements to move these into integer degrees. Okay, so that's the main theorem. Maybe I'll pause. Are there any questions before I go on? Okay. So let's say you wanted to prove a theorem. Let's say you wanted to prove a theorem. I guess the first thing to try is to just copy Ando-Murava and Zadovsky. But the problem with just trying to copy them, besides that it's probably a little boring, is that ERN, these fixed points, are not complex orientable. So when you try to write down the isomorphism between the homotopy of this tape construction and whatever this side is, you're going to have some trouble just computing this in the first place. Okay, so that's a problem, but as we've seen throughout the day, you can rectify being not complex orientable by keeping track of this C2 action. So working with a real orientation. So, I think we saw a lot of these in Danny's talk. Let's say that if bold face E is real oriental or real-oriented, then we have the following calculations. So, first of all, we can calculate the E cohomology. Cohomology, that's not how you make a star, okay, of Cp infinity R. So this is C P infinity with its complex conjugation action. And that's the ROC2 graded coefficients of E. And then one power series generator. I'm going to write X bar, because this is what it was called in Danny's talk. I might forget that it's called X bar right away. Forget that it's called X bar right away. So X bar is in degree rho instead of U. So your generator is now seeing some additional geometry. Okay. Using the same, so there's a classifying space interpretation of C P infinity R. So just like C P infinity is the classifying space interpretation. Is the classifying space for S1. CP infinity R is what you might call the capital R real classifying space, or in this case the C2 equivariant classifying space of S1. So it's a model for the C2 equivariant classifying space of S1. Okay, and then using the same short exact sequence of groups, mu2 to S1 to S2. Groups, mu2 to S1 to S1, you now apply the C2 equivariant classifying space functor, and you can calculate that the ecohomology of B mu2, sorry, B C2 mu2 is the E homology of joint X mod the two series in X bar. In X. Bar Bar. Okay. So the main idea here is that if you work with real-oriented cohomology theories, the natural thing to do is work with these equivariant classifier spaces. And maybe I want to give one more description that I think is also related to what Jay will talk about tomorrow. So if I have some extension, extension, let's say mu semi-direct product C2 and then C2, I can consider the following family of subgroups of this semi-direct product. I can let F be the family consisting of, let me just do it like this, it's the family of subgroups H. H of mu semi-direct C2 such that H intercept mu is just the identity element. So this family of subgroups showed up in Gabe's talk when he was saying where they have an equivalence for what subgroups about two. It also showed up if you take mu to be mu2 in Bird's talk on Monday. He had a double. On Monday, he had a diagonal subgroup showing up. And the diagonal subgroup of the Klein-4 group also has this property. So it's a really natural family in equivariant homotopy theory. Okay. So we can then make the following. Okay. So I was able to compute the e cohomology of BC2S1. Then we can compute it for BC2μ2. The natural question then, if you remember from the non-equivariant setting, is that when I took the tape construction, I got something like Laurent series over the coefficients mod the p series. E-series. And so you have to ask: what's the correct analog of the take construction in this setting? So, definition, let's let x be a genuine C2 spectrum with, in this case, it's not twisted, but a potentially twisted μ action. I'll take. I'll take μ to be a finite group here. Then we can define parametrized homotopy orbits xh c2 mu by taking let me be careful, okay, EF plus smash over mu. Over mu x. So EF is a C2 semi-direct product mu space. X is a genuine C2 spectrum with a mu action. So when I take these orbits, I'm left with a genuine C2 spectrum. So I'm not taking an ordinary take construction where I would just get a non-equivariant spectrum. Okay, so parametrized tomatopy orbits. So parametrized tomatopy orbits, parametrized tomatopy fixed points, there's a norm between these. And this is, as you'd expect, functions from EF plus into x for this particular family f that I define over here. Mute fixed points. Thank you. Okay. And then the cofiber is the parametrized tape constructor. So this is E F twiddle smash functions from E F plus X. New categorical fixed points. I think Jay is probably going to give a more succinct definition tomorrow in terms of parametrized higher category theory. And that description is why it's called the parametrized orbits, fixed points, and tape. Okay. We can just make this definition. And so once we have this, we can identify the left-hand side of that equivalence I was writing earlier. So what you find is that the homotopy of, again, my E is real oriented. If I take the R of C2 graded homotopy of the parametrized state construction, Construction. Then I get something that looks like the complex-oriented setting. Okay, so this gives you the main thing you need for the algebraic, proving the algebraic isomorphism. And I guess I should say what you actually want to prove. So theorem one follows from theorem two. Theorem two, which is a blueshift result in genuine C2 spectra. So let's let mu2 act on ERM trivially. Then there's a okay, fine. Then there exists a map from this limit. From this limit over i, wedge j greater than or equal to minus i. And now I just get row fold suspensions of E R n minus 1. So I don't have this lambda showing up anymore. It's just rho, whereas classically it was 2. To the parameterized to the parametrized take instruction completed at I n minus 1 bar. I n minus 1 bar as defined earlier. So there exists a map of genuine C2 spectra like this which becomes an equivalence Equivalence after you complete the left-hand side with respect to i n minus one bar. So this is the sort of C2 equivariant lift of the theorem one that I wrote down earlier. And there's no restriction on n in this theorem. So for example, if you take n to be 1, this is saying that Atia's real k-theory, and then you take the parametrized k construction, splits as a wedge of suspensions of constant rational macro functors. Okay. So So that's the second main theorem. And the point of working with this parametrized state construction is now you can just run Ando, Mirava, and Sadovsky's proof more or less without changing anything. So maybe that the proof, as you follow Ano Morava-Sadovsky, maybe there's a couple things to check, but it's essentially the same thing. It's essentially the same thing. And you do have to use a formula for the parametrized k construction as a homotopy limit of stunted projective spectra. So let me just write it. It's the homotopy limit over K of an ordinary suspension of E smash. Smash, maybe I'll call it P infinity minus K, that's a terrible name, L infinity minus K, where L infinity minus K is the Tom spectrum of the minus K-fold topological capital R real line buckle over BC2 mu2. Me too. So I think this follows pretty easily from work of Greenleaz and May, but for this particular case, I wrote it down carefully for this family of subgroups. Okay. So you prove this equivariant theorem, and then to prove the non-equivariant theorem, The non-equivariant blue shift result, you need a comparison. So the last step to prove theorem one is another theorem. So you can construct a map from the ordinary mu From the ordinary mu2 take construction on PRN to the parametrized tape construction and this is an equivalence of C2 spectra and it's actually hard to prove this I think. So the point is you don't even have a map like this in general. You don't even have a map like this in general. So you don't have an obvious comparison from a classical tape construction to the parametrized. So this requires using that ERN is free and co-free as a C2 spectrum. You have to use that, you're taking a trivial mu2 action. Are you taking C2 fixed points on the right-hand side? No. Oh, wait, I'm a C2 spectrum. Yeah, so the left-hand side is a C2 spectrum. Oh, the left-hand side is a C2 spectrum. So it's C C So yeah. So then the bold case R? Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Oh. No, it's more surprising to happen. Yeah, so you have to use some nice properties of ERN and just to construct the map. And then to prove it's an equivalence, you have to use a theorem about orientability of real bundles for Bundles for ERN to check that it's actually an ISO on C2 fixed points. So there's a lot of content to this theorem that I'm leaving out. I just wanted to say one thing before I'm out of time. I don't know when that goes off. The talks this week have been really inspiring, but also it makes me feel like ERN is just the start of this kind of Is just the start of this kind of theorem. So, like, I think a natural question is: if we replace, can we replace the C2 fixed points of ERN and these splittings by, say, the C2 to the n fixed points of the spectrum D inverse. Inverse. Oh, this really takes up a lot more space than I thought. Oh, wait, no, we have new technology. Okay. So I think Danny made a good argument that this is the correct analog of ERN for larger groups. And I think the parametrized tape construction is the right approach for trying to prove an equity. Approach for trying to prove an equivariant blue shift result. So it would be nice to prove something like that and then descend to fixed points. There's C2 to the M. Yes. C2 to the M. And then there's an N here. And then what's the superstrip? C2 to the N. C2 to the N. To the M. C2. I just learned this stuff today, so I could be so I would like to know about this. Okay, I'll stop there. Questions? So this the Li Xi Wang Zhu, the Horaywood image in the ERM. In the ERM paper, observed that the theta i are detected by ERM. And I think I'm right that all the variance of the theta i should be theta i plus 1, but I don't know if that's really fully proven in the case of large i, where they're known to exist. But you mentioned these approximations of molecular. these approximations of Mahal invariance, these E, you know, so like we do something like an ERN Mahal invariance and use this result to try and see that they take the data i to the next data i. So we tried to do it for kappa bar to kappa bar 2, and it's really hard because ERN is not bounded below. But I think there might be a way to do it. Yeah, and then the Do it, yeah, and then the theta i's would be another thing of interest. I mean, really, the goal would be to go all the way to like the can local sphere, but I guess this is close. Closer. No, never mind, it's far, it's back. Other questions? And just a reminder that the first talk tomorrow is 8:45. So this point is given to the ICT. There's a tau for it to improve. So yeah, so that's like new, and so therefore that's the sensor. So what should happen, right, is that the game is there, the gate is right there. That looks bad, right? That's not the right. This is HF2's. I know, but the total size of the columns have blue, right? But it could be that the difference could be there, but that's the same thing. Then I go and see if these are possible. Then I go by saying is it possible that eight is confirmed? Is it possible that eight is squared times this class is there? But that's performed tau text. No, so m squared tau is maximized. Sure, there is a genus extension now, but it's not a meaningful squared. I think what we weren't sure about how to do is code kids. Aren't sure about how to do is come to you to see to your fixed points at all. And that's a good artist. So that's the greatest thing. Like one of you you gotta do it both ways, just You gotta do it both ways. Just contribute to the C2. But I think it's not a note that C2 or the TMU2. That they're clicks on this. Yeah, yeah, where does this come from? Because I got studied exactly. So to construct the map, you just talked about really annoying. Really annoying is that just the listening stuff real oriented. Does it sound like it's a little bit different? So, anyway, I can do my semi-correct. And then you're supposed to dissolve. So, the first thing you have to do is not art. What I was telling you is not a diagram. But you know what? In order to run an argument, you have to know something else. So I'm not sure you've got problems with it actually in that photo. You've got to be careful. No, you've got to be careful about the charts because extensions are usually a diagram. So that's good. So it's not actually good. But I guess our exact top closest. I guess the average average, he'll see that class is killed. That's close to all you sort of deal with. So you just think that's all his classes. Yeah, but that's where it is. So we need to. So I think you're right. It is, I guess, I suppose. I think that's co-founder. Alright. This one's a lot of fun. Sorry, I think the muscle are supposed to be. I'm going to be unable to understand that. Not that it takes more time, but it's a good idea. There probably is a good screen that we click on. Well, it is, but the map we wrote down is not quite the details of the market. So we put the details in the mouse and we're going to post it soon. So I count it in error. Now you're looking in like a Delta. And things are written down. I try and fail to improve exactly this. I think that's a good thing. Very pointed question. That was a very pointed question. Yeah, I forget if I told you. Yeah, I forgot if I told you already about the Kefa Bar company that you were doing. Well, I guess I was interested in it. But I wasn't sure if you had gotten through. I couldn't remember anymore. Okay. It's all blood together for me. Oh, I also remember that. Yeah, you know, there's something really cool that you coming by anyhow. Anyhow, it's all right. So, check this out. I would put some of these things. He's really thinking about the Lucid Tower of Homo 6 points control. But so, a step to get there is math that's a trivial theorem where. This is the norm. And then he asks, okay, so what's the goodwill? Really, it should be called square bottom. So it's a function of between. You should really call it square bottom. So it's a fascinating thing. So let's warm up on this, right? Let's do a warm-up. It becomes a lot of fun. Let's just think about some people to talk to, right? People to talk to, right? What happens when we're doing it? With my advice, it's very difficult because I don't have a quick answer. So I've got an office up here.
