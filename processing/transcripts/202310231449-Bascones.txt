Here at this wonderful meeting and wonderful place. It's actually very nice to see this animal, this moose at the entrance this morning. Well, so I'm going to talk about how unconventional is the normal estate in Twist Valley Graphene. So this is a work that I've done in collaboration. I put the USB in. Yeah. Oh, okay. Ah, because no, but it's this one, it's this one. Um, but I've done a collaboration with um Angel Fridetta, who used to be at our institute in Madrid and is now in Paris, uh and Marie Jose Calderon, uh also from my institute and with Alberto Lampari from Universidad de Buenos Aires. So well, we have a very flat band between graphine and we have the possibility to negate. So there is we really can expect to have correlated states that are going to be tuned out of all the That are going to be tonight, what we're talking. And so, this so with the correlated states, there are different types of physics that it can give us, the correlations. One is symmetry breaking. So, there is worldwide evidence in Swiss phallography that there are different states with symmetry breaking, from of course, superconductivity to ferrostates. Ferro states, intervalic coherence, so on. So, the question is that many times we assume that when we are not in a signature breaking state, we can take a single particle bat as a good description, as something completely valid to describe the Describe the properties that we see in a spring. So, the question is: to which level is this completely true? So, in particular, there is a different type of effect that we know that happen due to correlations in many materials, and it's the effect associated to the formation of local moments. So, you can see a bit how this happens. A bit how this happens. This is for a Haber model. Sorry, this is an alpha. This is a tool of the Haber model. And in particular, you can see here how if this is the type of single particle band, so it's very well defined by K-space. When we increase the interaction, there is a spectral way that is flush away. You see that. Away, you see that there is, well, this positive particle matter, sorry, this band much here. So the band is renormalized, but also you can see how there is this very blurry spectral wave that is going away. These are the Havill bands. And of course, if we continue increasing U and we are at the right feeling, we can Are at the right filling, we can even have a multi-swilling, even without symmetry breaking. So, the question is: to which level this physics is important into his values. And this is what I'm going to discuss. Before going to our calculations, let me remind you some experimental facts in 3-spahography. So, it was early seen, so if we don't have correlation. We don't have correlations. Something that we will have expected in the normal state in a very simple system, if we don't have interaction, is that when we look at the density of a state as a function of token, this density of a state in the absence, it will be just described by just a rigid file sheet. So something that So something that it was observed early on is that when this is our STM experiment, when the density of state is measured with the flat bands field, what it's observed, it's very different to when they are seen with charming traps. And you can see here something important is it is very large. That is this very large energy scale of the order of several cents of millielectron volts. You can see how this happens as a function of doping. This is the color plot of the density of states. Here this is doping and here this is bias. And you see that this happened in a way in which there are, we see that at each of the integer fillets there are asymmetric crossets. And you see how especially And you see how spectral weight here it flows in the way of cascades. There are cascades, there are signatures of these cascades at positive and negative energy. As I say, they have this very large energy scale. And also here, something that you can observe is that the shape is different as the child neutrality point that at the other integers. So we're looking at the density of states. looking at the density of state at the Fermi level, it was seen that in fact the minima show sorry the density of the state show minima at the theophalines. This is what happens when they look at the center of the AA region which is where the flat band has the highest concentration. Concentration of charge. When they look at the these A B points, they see more the remote bands. And what it was observed is that there are oscillations of these remote bands, the remote bands here. And these were interpreted in terms of oscillations of the chemical potential. At the same time when this was observed, there were also comprehensibility. were also compressibility experiments. It was seen that there are, well, the compressibility show self-symmetric peaks, except at charge neutrality where this peak is symmetric. And there is also negative compressibility. There have been many works discussing these cascades. This is what is called a cascade, and most of them. And most of them have been interpreted in terms of some kind of signature breaking. There is also some proposal that charging could have some effect, but normally it has been discussed also comparing the signature bank. So now, something that happens is that when this cascade physics is studied experimentally, this cascade Experimentally, these cascades are very resilient with the temperature. So, in particular, these features in the mescal possibility, you can see how they remain up to at least 60 centuries. And also you can see that in the STM, these effects are still also visible at high temperatures. On the other hand, when people have looked On the other hand, when people have looked at real signatures of the signature breaking, so normally they observe them only at a few Kelvin. So for example, here they observe how these fermentities vanishes around five Kelvin. So for example, also in transport, it looks that somehow this is, for example, an insulated state, it's a d equal to Can a state at 0.2, but somehow it seems that there is something extra going on at higher temperatures, which is not necessarily high order. In fact, there are these resistive states. And those of you who were already at the beginning of the field, so people were discussing a lot how many times they they find resistive states meaning without but not real insulating state, even if they load the terms. Latency state, even if they load the temperatures. So, the take-home method of this talk is that this cascade physics, this cascade experimental signatures are a property already of the normal state. I'm not saying that in twist by layer graphene there is no symmetry breaking. What I'm saying is that the symmetry breaking happens only at lower temperatures of the few coupling and are taking place, are happening in this very Are happening in this very strongly distorted normal state. So they inherit this part of these properties. And in fact, this physics is associated to the formation of local moments and the tendency to excrete them. Okay, so to study this problem, so I'm going to start So I'm going to start from the binaryization of the Mistritz-McDonald model. And so we are using the A-BAN model that was proposed by Carr and Katsiras and Asvin Misanad a few years ago. And then we have eight orbital in each bot. So then in this eight orbital model, so this is a model for the Muare, for Muare orbital. There are many orbitals. There are different types of orbitals, and there are in three different lattices: the triangular lattice at the center of the Moira unit cell, states at the horicum lattice at the ABBA, and states at the camome lattice formed by these called main walls regions between the AB and BA. So, well, if we assume that the interaction is not pre-man. Well, the interaction is not pretty much a screen. That is, we studied the interactions of this model a few years ago. And you can imagine that with so many orbitals, we have a lot of different type of interaction, even having in mind that these interactions are not short-range. There are many different interactions. If we want to study this physics that I want to discuss here, so we need to do techniques such as dynamic. To do techniques such as dynamical mean theory that capture these dynamic correlations, and of course, we cannot do that for this type of so many interactions. However, it was early on noticed by Christian Howlett, there is not all the orbitals are playing the same role here. And you can see that here, the orbitals that they are at the tri two of the orbitals that they are at the triangular lattice, which are that is. At the triangular lattice, which are that is an orbital with P plus and another one with P minus symmetry, are giving most part of the weight in the flat bands. So somehow these orbitals are the ones which are going to have the largest tendency to form the local moments, while the other ones are going to be much less correlated. So, this is in fact what is observed when we When we was observed, when we calculated the interactions. So, for these orbits, the interactions are much larger. In fact, that the bandwidth, well here we are using a slightly more bandwidth than the one in this picture. And so, in fact, we only expect that these orbitals are for local models. Now, something that you Now, something that you can see is that while these other interactions are large, we cannot throw away. So, but what we are going to be able is to distinguish the two type of orbits and the different type of interactions in our model. Before I continue, just one thing here. I'm going to present and also go into the discussion of the dielectric constant before. Most of the data I'm going to present is published here. In the paper, we Here. In the paper, we use epsilon 12. Now, here I'm going to present results for epsilon 20 that we think is giving a better description of the experiment. So in general, most of the results are the same. When there is any difference, I think that the energy scale looks better, but when there is any significant difference, I will emphasize. Okay, so what I will say. Okay, so what I was saying is we can distinguish the two types of orbitals in our system. We are going to have two orbitals per valley that are going to be very strongly correlated, or in principle we expect that they will be very strongly correlated, and they are coupled to some other less correlated orbitals. In fact, these orbitals give most of the weight of the flatband everywhere except here at gamma. Except here at gamma, and this is reflecting the so-called phylae topology in twist phyliography. Now, well, this treatment resembles the one in heavy fermion systems. Now, what's supported here is that so here these strongly correlated electrons are going to interact also with a less interact also with the less so we the less uh correlated orbitals and and these other orbitals are also going to interact by themselves and also interact we are going to have long range interactions so the way in which we are going to treat them is we separate the two type of orbitals and we separate interactions and the interaction that it's more important to give local moment which is the interaction uh of these um Of these AAP orbitals, the ones that are very correlated, but they are the same Mario unit cell. I'm going to treat them with dynamical mean fixed even. The other interactions, I'm going to treat them just at the heart tree level. So this is a double self-consistent loop. There is the self-consistency within the PLSD, the heart tree, and the back. Now, something that is going to I'm going to do here is I'm going to impose Here is, I'm going to impose a note that I'm not to have symmetry breaking. This is because we want to study the properties of the non-order state. I'm going to work at 6 Kelvin. It does not mean that I'm saying that exactly at 6 Kelvin all the order states have died. So, as I said, going to present I have. Well, here, these are the density-density interactions. There are some. Density density interactions. There are some, the model, when you calculate that, there are some holds, some exchange interactions. These are important for symmetry breaking faces, but for here, we don't expect that they are going to, very row, they are not smaller and they are going to throw them away. Okay? So, and to solve the MFT, we are using the CPQ DMFT. Okay, so before I focus. I'm going to focus on how is the reorganization of the density of states. So, this is what was observed in the experiment. In the experiment, as I say, you look separately at the AA region or at the AB region. In the calculations, I'm going to show the density of state for all the systems without distinction. So, this is, you can see, this is what this. You can see, this is what is observed. You see, we see that there is a very strong reorganization of the spectral weight as a function of doping. This is energy, this is doping, and so this is the total density state. And you can see how there is this very strong reorganization that it goes up to energy here of the order of the half r, this U, this is the on-site energy between this. On-site energy between these two very strong correlated states, very strong. And then you see that there are resets at every integer. That here, this spectral weight flows as in the cascade shape, in the same way as in the experiment, and we observe also here this different shape at the chemical potential. We also have here these oscillations, these are the remote bands, and this we also observe. And this, we also observe, have these oscillations. When we look at the Fermi level, we see that in the same way as it was seen in the experiment, there are minima, so the density of state in this result is very strongly suppressed at each of these antiophones. When we look at the When we look at the inverse compressibility, you can see that we get also these out-to-ut symmetric peaks at the integers, except at the charming trial point where this is symmetric. And we also get the negative inverse copycomm. So, here, for those of you who knew the previous Paulin's work, in our previous Pauline's work, we didn't have so Work, we didn't have negative compressibility. This is associated just to a change in the way in which we have defined the chemical potential, and this is all associated to the double counting that we are doing, and the fact that we are adopting with the gate. We haven't changed the double counting, we just have changed what we call the What we call the chemical potential. So, here now, what we are doing is we are just measuring the chemical potential from the bottom of the pan and how it changes. So, when we look at what's happening in the system, something interesting to look at is where are the electrodes that we are adding to the system going. So, in fact, So in fact is that we have seen before that our flat baths are mostly composed by these very strongly correlated sources. Now, when we do this system, so this is char neutrality, so most of the electrons per holes that we add are going to this Going to these very strongly correlated sorbitas, and you can see that there are here weak steps. It is interesting that these steps are weak if we will just have very very strongly so the moment will be just in a standard heavy fermion point of view, normally it will be much much better defined instead. This step. And what is interesting is that we are also doping a bit to some extent these less correlated orbitals. So here the feeling is that both is much smaller. But what is interesting is that this feeling is not monotonous. It's also present. So, how this shows up? Show up in the mass. So, this is, you see, that there is this very strong organization of the spectral wave. This is in the density of space. So, we all suspect that this shows up in the band. So, as you can see, this is the band at charm neutrality. That it's the input band at charm neutrality. This is the band. This is the butt that we observed. You can see how a lot of spectral weight from this flat part has really core here to the HABA path. So instead of being very well defined, you see that this is very blurry, very incoherent. So it's not well defined in K-space. So this is telling us how this local moment is formed. Moment is formed. Something interesting that we propose is that because, and this is associated to this fragile topology in the system, this incoherence does not happen in the same way everywhere in the Riemann zone. You can distinguish the difference between gamma here and the other region, and this is associated to the different composition of the game. The different composition of the bands in terms of our more correlated or less correlated orbitals. You can see here how it evolves with topiet. And it's a very strongly dependent change in this incoherence. And so you can see how these resets are associated to this. This movement of this Haberband and how they end forming a passive particle here. And so when we approach these integers, there is a reset and there is some band flat. Okay, so here this is some new data, some part is data. So we have now look at the resistivity and how it evolves with over. And how it evolves with doping. So, this is still now the results they are now preliminary. So, this is the region for electron doping. And you can see how there are this very, this resistivity is very strongly suppressed at the integers in a similar way to what happens here and here. And here. So we we do find the system. Now, when we proposed this at the beginning of the year, there was many people who really liked the proposal, but somehow there has been so many proposals displayed in the cascade that people were telling us, okay, you have to propose something that Have to propose something that people have not measured. Of course, this is already this way in which these fancy balls and this momentum selective incoherence was a new prediction, but of course it's also not easy to observe, so we want to have more proposals. So we believe that one good way to, I'm not going to say that it's easy, experimental. I'm not going to say that it's easy, experimentally, to look at this physics here and to distinguish the different proposals is to try to look at optical experiments. In optical experiments, we look at optical transitions. So here, well, in the density of state, all the spectral waves is somehow integrated. So here, it's going. So here it's going to be important not only so how these states are distributed in momentum, but also this transition have to conserve momentum, have to conserve the spin, have to conserve the value. So this is expected to be different in this proposal. So in our proposal there are two main outcome of the physics of this local moment formation. Local moment formation and this tendency to form these quasi-particles, heavy quasi-particles. On one side, we have these presets on this spectral weight and how the spectral weight reorganizes at the integers, and we have these oscillations of the energies. On the other hand, we have all these incoherence, these moments of selective incoherence. So, this is how it looks like the optical conductivity. Again, this is in this region in electron dope. So, here you see it in two different ways. So, the data is the same way, it's just the way of plotting. And you can see how in the optical conductivity we do expect to see these main features. Both, you can see here this type of This type of oscillatory behavior, this resets in the energy, how it changes. But also, you see how there is this suppression of the intensity when we go through the integers. So here, in fact, you see how there is in fact this very broad spectral weight that is observed here at this region is really telling us about this. Telling us about this incoherence. So this is, well, this is the main message. It's how all these experiments, this reorganization of the density of states, this outhoot behavior, the best compressibility, and the resistive state. Resistive state can be explained without invoking any symmetry principle. So, this is telling us that our state, our normal state, is very highly distorted as the one that we will have in just perfect, well-defined states. We do expect to have We do expect to have momentum selective incoherence, so this behavior that we hope that maybe in the future can be seen with nano-orpis or quantum, this quantum twist microscope. And we propose to look at the cascades with the optical spectrum. I haven't discussed temperature effects, but well Temperature effects that, uh, well, here this is the paper. And the local moments are quite resilient with temperature. The tendency to focus on the particle is much less. So you can't see here up to, well, you can go beyond, but you see here, so the spectrum is somehow wrong. So before finishing, I want to show consistency with some of the works, of our results. So, very recently. So, very recently, last month in fact, Right Creepa et al. have done a very similar calculation to ours, but they have done it in a different model for the some magnetic model, in a different model for the kinetic energy. The interactions are more screen. So, in our case it's practically one over R. Our case is practically one over art. Well, we cut it at a very large distance, but there is more screen. They include some of the terms that we have shown away. We threw away the hunt and the exchange, and they treat slightly differently some of the interactions. And they use a different solver for the DNT. So their results are consistent with ours. This is not unexpected because it's This is not unexpected because it's very similar treatment, but it's always nice to have that they have chance, but two things, that everything is consistent, so it's robust. And then in their case, they have also studied how this evolves when there is signature breaking. And in fact, they see that really the self-check is inherited in the Shape, it's inherited in the broken symmetry state with some final structure, and in fact, they find the broken symmetry state only at a few Kelvin as we were expecting. So it's good that they have some confirmed. And this is some other, and I want to take someone to call my attention to this work, because I think this is very interesting. Somehow this is a work that they did on channel neutrality with the determinant Pantomotucal. And you can see they look at the effects at 30 Kelvin at the temperature at which they don't have already symmetry breaking. And in fact, what they observe is these blue dots looks really very much the same to what we are getting. Their treatment is very, very Their treatment is very, very different to what we are doing. They are, in fact, doing it in the case space and projecting interactions. So I think we are looking, we are seeing the same physics. And the only thing is that, well, I think this, one has to be careful if when open the system, I think one should not probably why they they are not doing it because they are just studying traffic. But I think that But I think that finally don't be throwing the road can be dangerous. But it's, I think, this is the same. Okay, thank you. Okay, we have a few questions. In other talks, you mentioned what happens if you people need a hard feed turn but take out the hub arcade.
