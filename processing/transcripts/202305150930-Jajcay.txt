Robert will be speaking out about algebraic techniques in extremal graph theory. Please, Robert? I deliver my talk to entice people to join my group. All right, so this is one of the topics that we listed among the possible topics for collaboration. And so I prepared some slides where I say Some slides where I say what we already know, and then some ideas of what I think we could be working on. So we all know what the KG graph is, and if you don't, there is a very nice survey. So I will be denoting by NKG the order of a smallest kg graph and the more bound I think we all teach in the first class. All teach in the first class on graph theory, and a smallest kg graph will be called a cage, so we all know that. And just sort of to get us going, cages are known only for a very limited set of pairs. For most of the parameter pairs, we have no idea what a cage is and what the order of a cage could be, so we only have upper estimates. So these are the settled cases for the degree. The settled cases for degree 3. So, as you can see, we know the situation up to the Girth 12, and after that, it's all wilderness, and we don't know the answers there for degree 3. And I know some mathematicians don't like it when you work for records and you just have a world record in something, but I kind of do so. So, I just want to say this. Okay, so I just want to say this, the second part, starting with the thirteen, it's mostly these are these are actual constructions and we believe that these are the best constructions for those given parameters. So for instance for GERT 14, the best graph has 384 vertices and it's due to random McKay and JeffEx. So this is how the tables look like and Jeff. Tables look like, and just to make sure that I'm up to date. So, Graham and James are already in the table in my talk, not yet in the survey, because we are working on the update of the survey. We do have 24 as well. I missed the 24? Okay, sorry, sorry. Well, the reason there, okay. All right, so you'll get all the credit. So, what I decided to sort of make it clear how little we know about this. And so, there is no general theorem or something that would tell us what the orders are. It's mostly really about constructions and then proving that something cannot be done better or something. And so, in the context of degree diameter, there is the Vermont-Bollbach. There is the Vermont-Bohabasha question that I will translate into cages. It was asked for the degree diameter, but you can ask this for cages as well. So here is a question that I would really like to see. If we answer it this week, I'll be very, very happy. So the idea is, so how far from the Mohr bound? So we all know that a cage must have at least as many verticals. Cage must have at least as many vertices as is the number computed from the Moorbound. And now the question is: how far does it have to be, or should how close can it be? And so, this is a sort of translation of the Bermond and Baulbasch question for the degree diameter. And so, is there a constant such that for every pair of parameters, you can always get a graph of the order at most C more than the Moore bound. Moorbank. So, this is a translation of the Berman and Bolobash question. And we have absolutely no idea what the answer for this is. So, since we don't have any idea, sometimes when I work on this, I get a suspicion that maybe there is a constant, but it's a constant that depends on the degree. So, that's my loose version of this. So, again, so we don't know what the orgas of cages should be. Cages should be. We don't have universal constructions that would satisfy something like this. The constructions that we have, some are universal for infinite number of pairs, some are specific for specific parameters, but if you want to do something like this, you would have to have a universal construction for the end. You would have the K and G, and it would produce a graph within this. And I'm starting to suspect that at the very least, Suspect at the very least that the constant increases with the degree. But this is all vague and magic and just suspicions. And if you if you so there I can even this is even looser. Do there exist infinitely many G's so that you can get within the more bound? Yeah? This, maybe, I know, you know, it's not incomprehensible. You know, it's this not in contradiction with the other. This may be true, but still, this would require a beautiful construction. Yeah, I'll settle for this if we don't solve this. And finally, even a looser version of this, does there exist for every k a constant that there exist infinitely many g's where you don't exceed this? I think now I'm thinking I wrote. Now I'm thinking I wrote it twice the same, right? No, I didn't. Okay, thank you. You're paying attention. All right, so this, the way I see these questions, I'm suggesting that we don't really know much about the order of cages, really? Oh, here it is. Okay, okay, okay. Yes, even if you multiply, we don't know, yeah, which is much. We don't know, yeah, which is much weaker than add-in, right? And we still don't know, okay. Yes, that was the plan. That this is the easiest to prove, maybe, but I don't know, okay? So this is how I see it, that there is a lot of work that we can do and we should, because if we're going to claim that we understand a little bit about cages, this type of questions are the types of questions that we should. Are the types of questions that we should have an idea about? Otherwise, we're still doing the records, which is okay with me, but we would like to have some more universal answers. So, this is my goal. And now I'm going to switch to algebraic constructions. And specifically, I picked the vertex-transitive graph. So, I need to stress that kgs do not need to be vertex-transitive. Vertex transitive. It just happens that beauty and symmetry help a lot. And so, in many cases, highly symmetric graphs do play a role in this. And so, here are three that are actual cages and are highly symmetric. And I'm showing you the table again where in the bold face are the highly symmetric graphs. So, of the settled cages, you can see that there are four which are actually vertex transitive. And again, I don't have an explanation. And again, I don't have an explanation why vertex transitive should play a role, but I really firmly believe they do. Yeah, in some way, especially for the universal constructions where we can get within the multiple of the Moore bound, I'm hoping that that's where some algebraic constructions would be helpful. Okay? And so here I'm listing just for condosiers, I always have to do KD graphs, so that's a Do KD graphs. So that's a very special subclass of vertex transitive graphs. So you can rephrase the question of looking for a smallest Kg graph. You can look for the smallest Kg graph that is simultaneously Kaylee. So one point of view is, yeah, he knows Kaylee graphs, so then he switches the question to something he knows about. Partially that's true, but I'm also saying that if we get a lot done on KD cages, Lot done on KD cages, we will learn quite a bit about the other, the more general cages as well. And just to sort of show, I keep saying that it's relevant, but in this particular case, for instance, this is the Peterson and this is the smallest Cayley graph as five times more vertices, but that's fine so far. So, one possibility is to consider Cayley graphs for candidates for KG. Candidates for kg graphs, small kg graphs, and vertex transitive, and so on. Just to justify that it even makes sense. If you want to look for a small as vertex transitive kg graph, you have to have a universal construction of those for any K and G. This is due to my colleagues, so I'm taking advantage of mentioning Martin Shcoviera and Roman Mediala, who proved first that there exists for any pair there exists a very expensive Kg graph. Very expensive kg graph, so it makes sense to look for the smallest. And for many years, I was trying to convince people that somebody should construct a KVK graph for every KNG. And since nobody did, we did it with Jeff and Josef Schiran. Well, if you don't solve those Berban Bolobash questions, I will have to. But I'm hoping that somebody will help. So for any KNG, there is a K, there is a vertex. There is a K, there is a vertex transitive. And in particular, with regard to the questions, there is a classical result of Biggs, who has shown that what we call the excess is the difference between the order of the graph and the Moore bound. And Biggs has shown that if you consider vertex-transitive graphs, then you cannot answer the first version of the Berman and Bolobash in positive because Because the excess has to increase with the girths. So if you fix the degree and you consider vertex fields, the graphs, the excess will be growing slowly. There is no constant that would limit the growth as compared to the more bound. So this is a classical result, which we sort of gained more of an insight into this with my former PhD student, Slobodan Filipovsky, where we have shown. Down Filipovsky, where we have shown that if you fix the degree and you ask for the Gs for which you will exceed any kind of, not just this kind, but any constant difference between the more bound and the order of the graph, the asymptotic density of those where you get underneath the upper bound is zero. In other words, I'll translate almost all vertex transitive graphs for a fixed Extransitive graphs for a fixed k will be bigger than any constant added to the Moore bounds. So this suggests that the answer, at least for vertex-expensive graph, this graph, the answer to the first question is no, no, you will not find such a constant. But to me, it also suggests that you will not find such a constant in general, for cages in general. But I don't know. Yeah, that's okay. So, just again, once you have the slides, it's easy to alter them. So, we know that there is no constant for the first question, but this is still a valid question. Does there exist a constant such that for every g there exists a vertex transitive graph or the node like x equal? What am I doing wrong this time? Oh, yeah. The k was a constant there. Was a constant there, so k is in the denominator, so maybe this may have some kind of an answer. But let's just look at this. I would really like to know the answer for vertex transitive. Can I get within a k multiple of the Moore bound for some k? Multiple, multiple. That's much easier than the other things, but we don't know whether we have a constant. Well, okay. Felix is not thinking it's much easier. Maybe. Maybe they have to come together and we either solve both of them together or I don't know. But at least for me, it's fun to work with vertex transitives. So I will use that. All right, so what's the connection? I will, okay, I'll maybe need to speed up a little. So I already mentioned not all cages are vertex transitive. The smallest example is the MAGI, which is not vertex transitive. On the other hand, Vertex transitive. On the other hand, it only has two orbits, so it's like half vertex transitive if you allow for that. At least it has lots of symmetries in that sense. But generally, we don't know what the connection is. And so I'm asking, are the orders of vertex transitive necessarily close to the orders of general? We do not know. Yeah, I hope Felix, and you're easy. We do not know. We do not know. We certainly know that the orders for the vertex transitive are greater than or equal to the orders for the general, but are they close? It's hard to tell from the tables. You just get a very small glimpse at the beginning of it, so it's really hard. My hope is the answer is yes. They are close, and if I work on the vertex transit, I will get lots of answers for the general case as well. Okay? Okay. Oh, sorry. And are there, this is the sort of the remaining part of my talk about suggestions, what to think about. Are there some good constructions where you get a vertex transitive graph from a general KG graph? Yeah, so if somebody has a nice KG graph that doesn't have to be vertex transitive, what's the price of using that to consider? Of using that to construct a vertex-transitive guy with the same parameters. That's something that I'm really interested in because that will give me some insight into the relation between the vertex transitive and general case. And then I also want the other way, if I can construct nice vertex transitive graphs, how much can I reduce them still, given that my vertex transitivity, and get a nice Kg graph? Yeah, so this is what I really am. So this is what I really am into right now that sort of gain an insight. What is the connection? And I will just say what do we mean by algebraic? It doesn't have to be vertex transitive. Until now, I spoke vertex transitive, but algebraic may mean many other things. And so I'll just quickly show that if you check the dynamic survey of all those construct, there are many constructions mentioned there. Many constructions mentioned there. And the point is, almost all of them use some kind of algebra, finite fields, well, geometry, people will kill me if I say that projective geometries are algebra, but they are. And so lots of examples where you heavily use algebra for the constructions. And I have a justification for that. We're looking for universal things. So you want some. So, you want some tools, and algebra provides the tools. And the f implanes, different sets, Latin squares, by constants. So, lots and lots of algebraic constructions. And I picked some few examples that, again, I can work on this because I know this, right? So, other people probably would have to read this. But this is an example where I start from any graph, KG graph. Any graph, Kg graph, and I construct a KV graph from it. And I will not go through the details, but the idea is I take this KG graph that doesn't have any algebraic structures, say. And if I can find a family of one factors and then some two vectors that partition the edges, then based on the one factors, I get involutions that flip the end. That flip the endpoints of the one factor. And based on the two factors, I have cycles. I pick a direction for each cycle and I get cyclic permutations. And if I use these involutions and cyclic permutations, I can generate a group. Of course, I can. And that graph will be also K-regular of growth at least G. So this is what I'm talking about. I start from a given graph, and I can construct a highly symmetric by stealing. Highly symmetric by stealing from the given draft. So, details in our paper, but I do want to mention this because recently Vlad contacted me that he pretty much proved everything we did, except he should have read before, right? Because, yeah, then he agreed that yes, we had it in the paper, but I want to mention him because I'm hoping that he will keep working on this. And we didn't prove that it's. And we didn't prove that it's a cover. So here's a recent result of the graphs we are constructing are covers of the graphs down there. And maybe a picture. Here is an example of our construction. Of course, this is already very text transitive, but it's not Cayley. And so here are my involutions. I didn't number that, but this is, these are one, two, three, four, five, and then it's the inside. So my involution is on the So, my involution is on the spokes, and then I have two cycles. So, I ordered the two cycles somehow, and then I could, well, I shouldn't say I. This is joint work with Jeff and Joseph. Okay, so you get this permutation and this permutation. You form the groove, you generate the groove, it happens to be 5 cross d5, and you get this beautiful graph out of it, which happens to be the smallest scaly graph with the parameters. Scaly graph with the parameters. So, this is sort of encouraging that if you apply our construction, you get the best possible, really. Well, this at least once. And I'll skip the easy observations. I'll skip them for the group work. And I'll go another example the other way. I will graphs the groups. So, if I no, this is one more example of this construction. So, if somebody gives me any gives me any k regular graph of growth g then now this is very easy but it's again an example of this i can assign voltage graph voltages to this graph so that i increase the girth to twice the original girth so the idea is somebody gives me a base graph of girth g I can assign voltages sorry for those who don't assign voltages on a regular basis but you can Basis, but you can do that, yeah. And then you will lift the graph into a larger graph which has twice the girth. And I should say twice the girth is quite good. That's doubling the girth is really good. And the voltage group is a very simple elementary above Z two. And the price you pay is what is called the Betty number, is simply the number in the null three edges. Number and the non-tree edges of non-tree edges. The spanning tree, you take a spanning tree and the edges which are not in the spanning tree. That's the power I have to use. And so I'm multiplying the order of the original graph by quite a large number. Yeah, but at least we do have a construction of this type again with Jeff. And now from groups to graphs, I will, please, you will excuse me if I skip the details. The idea is now I have. The idea is now I have a Cayley graph and I want to construct a smaller graph where I possibly give up the symmetry. And the way this particular one is done, I get a representation of the Cayley graph via permutations. And if the representation has some nice properties, I can construct a smaller graph from it. And I think pictures will show you. So this is a Cayley graph, highly symmetric nice Cayley graph that you start with. And then if you And then, if you apply our construction, you get the Medge graph, which, of course, we cannot claim we are the first to have discovered. But the point is, again, this is an example that doing our construction, you get to a cage, yeah, because this is a cage. So the construction I mentioned will deliver a cage. So there is a hope that somewhere up there in the large parameter pairs, there will also be some cages coming from our customer. Be some cages coming from our construction, but trust me, we have tried so far. We're talking large graphs, so you have to make lots of choices. Okay, so that's it. I will only mention voltage graphs in the sense that Peterson is a lift of the dumbbell. So Haywood, which is the next cage, is the lift of the theta graph. So we have spent quite some while working on this. Quite some while working on these, and that's another possible way to do things. And I just want to mention results that we got together with Marston. This is for KD graphs. It depends on the birth that you can get depends on the kind of group you are using. So for solo groups, if you have a derived series of length n, then you get an upper bound. So what this slide is supposed to say, if you want Is supposed to say if you want to have nice graphs, you have to use complicated groups. Which is definitely what it says, trust me. And similarly for lifts, we did this with Jeff afterwards, for lifts of the theta graph, which you can have long arms on the theta graph, or on the dumbbell graph, you have upper bounds again on the possible curve depending on the structure of the curve you use. Structure of the group you use. Okay, and I think I will just mention this. This is not my construction, it's my favorite construction, but this is something I really, really have been thinking about. It's a nice construction of Biggs, where he shows that you can have a KD graph for a very of very large graphs. You may say, why did you have to prove it then? But this doesn't tell you what the graph will be. Tell you what the growth will be, it just says that you can get very, very large and then larger and larger. Yeah, but you don't know what the growth you're getting, and so this, okay, I don't have the time to explain this one, but it's again the idea that he starts from a tree, he assigns permutations, he colors the tree, assigns permutations based on the colors, those become permutations generating a group, and then you do the K. Generating a group, and then you do the Kaylee graph of that group with those generators. Yeah? So, very, very, I highly, I mean, this is my favorite because it has all the features that I like. Everything is extremely symmetric. You start from this tree of depth R, all sides the same, and everything feels very, very symmetric there. So, that's my favorite. And I will just show you the last slide. We don't know the exact girth, okay? Exact girth, okay, for these. We just know that it has to be bigger than something, that it has to keep growing. And I would really like to know the girth of this because I'm thinking if we really settle that question, it will turn out that these graphs are quite nice in terms of extremal properties. So this is something I keep encouraging my students. But it seems hard. I don't know. Maybe I'm telling my students something that confuses them or something, but I hope not. Them or something, but I hope not. And this, I would really like to settle. We have some computational evidence from Jeff that the growth of these things is much bigger than what Biggs was shooting for. Okay? And so I will finish now with two announcements. Don't worry, just two. Okay, together with Jeff, the last time we did the update of the survey paper was in 2013. So Brendan McKay has already contacted. Random McKay has already contacted us saying that that's been a while, 10 years is okay, sir. But it's hard work, please. It's hard work to update this survey. But we are working on it. And we want to, of course, update the tables so that Graham gets the credit he deserves, right? And we also probably add a little more on spectral methods and connections than designs and geometries that the topic of this workshop. Is the topic of this workshop. And then on connectedness and cyclic connectedness, and then we will probably mention bioregular and bipartite biregular. And we will also mention mixed gaits. So those, yeah, I think I mentioned just about anybody who's here, right? If they were not in the survey, we are working on it. Okay, and so I would like to say that we try to watch what is happening. Of course, we read papers. Happening, of course, we read papers and so on. But if somebody feels that he or she has results that should be in the survey paper and they have not been in 2000, they were not in 2013, do send us your paper, please. We promise to read. And if you think you should be there, then you're probably right. So we'll work on that. So that's one thing that I wanted to announce. And the second thing is I already spoke about we have an agreement with the We have an agreement with the editors of the Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics that if we have enough interest, then we can have our own issue of this journal. And so I would, okay, this is the possibility if people are interested in publishing results related to this workshop. We have a place where to put it together because, in some sense, it's nice to put things together. Some sense it's nice to put things together that were created together after seeing similar things. And okay, so that's one thing. It's this, I this is a blurb I stole from them. All right, but before I promise them that we will have a special issue, I would like to hear from you if if you're interested, yeah, because if they give us a special issue and I cannot fill it, uh then we're in trouble and uh I am in trouble. Trouble and I am in trouble. So please, if anybody is interested, I mean, you don't have to tell me right away, of course. If by Friday people feel like we have achieved something here that we will write up, send me a little note that we're thinking that maybe that would be a possibility to publish together in here. Okay? So, that much. Yeah, that's my email address, but it's over there all the time. And you can even write to me that no way. You can even write to me the no way. That will give me some information. And the papers will be referred precisely as all the other papers in the journal, so there will be no favoritism or anything like that. But I hope that people at this workshop will manage to write papers that will pass and will be published. And by the end of the workshop, it would be nice. And this is the end of my talk. And I hope we will have a working group. Thank you. Working group. Thank you.
