Thank you and thanks for the invitation and for this really cool conference. I've enjoyed it a lot the last few days. I'm going to talk about something which is already about two years old, work with you, but I think it fits very well with this audience. So let me just get started and let's recall some of the basics. Remember that an object B in a braided fusion category is co-transparent if the brailing of this Transparent if the praying of this object with any other object in this creative category is the identity. That's the definition I think. Everyone here is audio. And in particular, the collection of all transparent objects is called the Muga center. This is the full subcategory of B on those transparent objects. That's an interesting thing. It's a symmetric monoidal category. And the category B is non-degenerate if this symmetric monoidal category you extract is just a category of vector spaces. In other words, the only transparent objects are the denser units. The only transparent objects are the tensor unit and sums of the tensor unit. And just a sort of comment, if you're more familiar with the notion of a modular tensor category, a modular tensor category is essentially a non-degenerate grade diffusion type category together with some extra structure, maybe the structure of a given structure. And so if you want to sort of drop this structure, I just want to think about the property of being modular. And this is really the sort of non-degenerous concept. This is sort of fuzz that allows you, for example. Sort of fuzz that allows you, for example, from a TFT perspective to think of oriented TFTs rather than flame TFTs, what you would hear. And of course, one reason to like these categories is that we've developed a lot, sort of as a community, we've developed a lot of tools to study non-degenerate rated categories. They're sort of much easier to study than just general graded fusion categories. And so you could ask: if I give you a braided fusion category, can the reduce its or reduce its study to sort of understanding certain non-degenerate categories? Degenerate braided categories. And the sort of most naive question you could ask is: does every graded fusion category embed into a non-degenerate braided fusion category? You can always just think of it as a sub-category of one of these non-degenerate things. The answer to this is easy, yes. You can definitely do this. You just take the trin-filled center of your predictive fusion category. That's a non-degenerate predated fusion category. And my predictive fusion category embeds into this one transfer center. So that's sort of a stupid answer. But what happens if you look at a drink fill center? You look at the Drinfield Center, you've created many new objects which are transparent to B. So if you sort of stand on the sort of perspective of saying, oh, I actually just want to sort of see other objects by seeing sort of what happens if I braid with objects in B, there are suddenly sort of new objects coming up that I can't detect by just braiding with things in B. So you could ask another question, a sort of refined question. You could ask, can I embed Braided, into a non-degenerate braided category in such a way that if there is another object which is transparent to everything in B, Which is transparent to everything in P, then it was already an object in P. So it's like: if I'm transparent, then I already had to be my original sort of collection of transparent objects. And such an extension is called a minimal modular extension. I'm not throwing in other stuff that I can't see from the perspective of. This is the notion of a minimal non-degenerate extension. If it exists, it's not unique. And it's also not clear that it exists. Not clear that it exists. And so the question that we got is precisely the first half of this question: does it even exist? Does there exist a minimum on the character extension for every greater category? And the answer to this took a while. It was given by Drunfeld. I think this is unpublished, but by now we've also seen there are also several examples in published form. There's a counterexample. And I think by now we sort of understand this builds and work of Liang and collaborators, and then, of course, these people here were and sort of. These people here, where, and sort of many, many, many other papers also, like this sort of collection of authors appears repeatedly. And sort of ultimately, then I think in a paper by Cesar and Joda Ceser, where they show that essentially this is a cohomological problem. So you can always take a rate of fusion category, and then there are certain cohomological obstructions you can find. You can sort of reduce it down and study sort of whether a given freight diffusion category. Whether given grade diffusion chemistry has to be monotonic extension. In our paper on this, we have sort of in the last section, we sort of discussed this from a sort of homological perspective, what this obstruction theory is. But here I'm saying almost, because really what still happens is that we reduce the story to one particular subcase, and it is a subcase where you have a greater fusion category whose weaker center is super. So that's always what you sort of have to break it down to. And then, if you look at these classifications, it's always like the first thing then you need is to get. Like the first thing then you need is to be able to extend this. So, the question that then arises is: this every created fusion category whose mug-center is supervector space is the standard meta-minimum and honogenic extension. And all the other minimum and honogenic extensions questions are essentially commodity theory together with this question. And the goal of this talk is to sort of sketch or give sort of ideas for a proof of the statement that every prefusion kinetic because we can't supervector spaces admits a minimum non-determined extension. Let me sort of comment on. Exception. Let me sort of comment on Dietmas' question. This is not unique, but you can show that if you admit one of them, you will admit precisely 60. This has also been shown by this list of authors, most of whom are in the audience, well, not of whom are in the audience. And I should also mention it as approved by Victor, which does that same thing in the weekly truth theoretical case, and which is sort of a difference of difference. I give one reason why it's 16 at the end of the talk, but there are other reasons. Again, it's essentially some cohomology in a computation. There's a certain cohomology group that will be C116. Okay. So that's the statement, and I want to sort of outline a proof of this statement. That means, since I only have 30 minutes, or now 22 minutes, this will really be just a sketch. And I should want to get the ideas across. Everything that I'm going to say is on the archive, and you can sort of read up on the details. Read up on the details, but I just want to give the idea. Let me start with a very brief idea. So just sort of let me go one, two, three, four. What's sort of the proof outline? The proof outline is as follows. So first, we translate this problem into a problem about fusion two categories. If yesterday Tibo was given sort of an introduction to fusion two categories, one thing that appears there is if E is a graded fusion category, I can look at the two category of finite semi-simple E-module categories. And this turns out to be a fusion two category. And I write Fusion to chemistry. And I write this sigma b just because I could call it mod b, but sigma b is just a bit more compact annotation and it's come up all the time and I don't want to write mod for it. Okay. So this is sort of the first class of examples of fusion two categories. Let's just take modules of a braided fusion one category. And whenever we have a fusion one category, what we like to do is look at its Trinfeld center. And so when we have a fusion two category, we should also look at their Trinfeld centers. So there's a notion of Trinfeld center for fusion two categories, and indeed if I take the Trinfelder II categories, and indeed, if I take the Trinfeld center of one of these sigma B's, this gives me a rated fusion 2 category. And this is something, a comment I wanted to make. I actually, I wasn't planning to include this, but since Chelsea gave this very nice talk yesterday about braided module categories, you can understand this completely if you understand braided module categories. This category set of signal is actually equivalent to the two categories of braided module categories. And braided modules. And braided module functions in between them. And this is a statement that I think is due to Dmitry and Alexei Davidov. And indeed, in the paper, I think most of what we're doing in the paper, at least half of it, is just studying various models of braided module categories and sort of understanding various perspectives on these braided module categories in terms of algebraism and braided category, in terms of braided module categories, and developing notions of S-matrices for braided module categories. Categories and so a lot of this sort of comes down to the study of disgruntled modular categories. So that's sort of the setup. How should you think about this? One thing you notice, or you can notice, is if you take this grade diffusion 2 category and you look at endomorphisms of the tensor unit, this will be some symmetric monoidal 1 category. And what symmetric monoidal I category will it be? It will be the muger center of it. So you could think of z of sigma b as being some sort of refinement of the muger center. As being some sort of refinement of the Muger center, it carries the information of the Muger center and possibly a bit more information. And maybe the punchline is that this doesn't actually see very much about the Creative Future category. It mostly sees the Mugger center. And now you could ask, does it see a little bit more than the Muger center? Can I maybe just reconstruct it from just knowing the Muger center? Interesting question you could ask. And it turns out this question is equivalent to the minimum non-degenerate extension question. Maybe you can show that B admits a minimum non-degenerate extension. Show that B admits a minimum non-degenerate extension if and only if there's a graded monoidal equivalence between this graded fusion two category set of sigma B, and you just do the same, but rather than B, you just use the mucus. So you see that B admits a minimum non-degenerate extension is equivalent to saying this graded fusion II category, as a braided fusion two category, knows nothing about B except for its mucus set. And the counterexamples are precisely, the counterexamples of minimum knowledge rendered extension are precisely cases where there's a Precisely cases where there's a little bit more information and a spread of fusion to be categorically than we describe. So it's sort of a slight refinement of the method. Okay, so that's the starting point. And so what we have to do to study minimal non-degenerate extensions is just study these sorts of categories. Let's sort of take the set of sigma B and try to prove that it's equivalent to something else. And why is this sort of a feasible approach? Well, it turns out that there aren't that many categories which sort of fulfill all the properties that this thing. Which sort of fulfill all the properties that this thing has to fulfill. You can almost go in by classification. There are just not that many pre-diffusion two categories which look like a trigger center of something. And indeed, if I already know that the mule center is S-vale, so that the endomorphisms of one in this category will be S-valed, then you can show, and I'll explain a little bit how, then you can show that this category can be only one of two different radar fusion two categories. There's only two different rate of fusion two categories around, which it could possibly be. And the proof then is just, we're just showing that only one of these two predated fusion two categories can even be a trinfell center, right? This is sort of a very classical problem we know for predicted fusion one categories. If I give you a modular tensor category, the first thing you could ask, is this a trin-fail center? And so here we have two different non-degenerate predict fusion two categories. And what we're showing is that only one of them can possibly be a trinfeld center. And so they're actually, all of these sets of signal be, since they're Actually, all of these sets of sigma b, since they're evidently Trinfeld center by construction, have to be just one of them. And so they're actually all equivalent to one another. So all set of sigma b for migration center aspect, they're all equivalent to one another. And that's sort of how the proof goes. And it admits namely. Okay, so what I want to do is basically talk a bit more in detail about these points in 384. But that's the outline of the proof. This will, so this will come up later as well. Roughly, the idea is that these categories are sort of group-like or pointed, and you can build them by sort of starting with some space information and doing some extension theory. This can sort of show abstractly. And then, actually, if you sort of want to have all the properties that this is supposed to have, if it looks like this, the only homological information that goes into sort of in constructing these is precisely this. Constructing these is precisely this cohomology curve. That's one perspective. But we'll later see another perspective from the perspective of extension. Is this the CET area? This sits in the praying. So as fusion two categories, they will be the same. So this is like the highest level of coherence in the Brayding. So that makes it difficult because it sits all the way upstairs. The deepest in the sea. Yeah. Furthest away from you. Yes. Okay. So what are these properties that fix sort of this category? Properties that fix sort of this category. So, for this, we have to think a bit about S matrices. So, if I have a grade of fusion one category, this is non-degenerate, it's a modular category. If you can build its S matrix, and here I'm drawing these little dots because I'm not working in a pivotal category, I'm doing something slightly framed. But this is already in the paper by Dimitri and Victor and Pavel Etonhov. And or in one of your many papers, the the Great Diffusion Category paper, I think, is in here, right? Paper, I think, is in here, right? That you can build an S matrix even if you don't have a periodic structure. And my predefusion category is non-degenerate if none of these S matrix is non-degenerate. And using this notation that we've seen in Thibault's talk, pi zero meaning just a set of isomorphism classes and projects. Okay, you can do the same thing for brain diffusion 2 category. You can build a pairing, but now for dimensional reasons, you notice that the things you have to pair are surfaces and planes. So this is a pairing between objects in this pair. So, this is a carry between objects in the stray diffusion two category and endomorphisms of the tensor unit. And when I write I0 here, now I really don't mean the set of simple objects up to isomorphism. I mean the set of simple objects up to condensation or up to components. So, up to there exists some non-zero morphism. This is sort of this Schulz lemma, this sort of categorical Schulz lemma that we've seen exposed to. This is really what always plays the role of the set of symbols up to isomorphism in these higher dimensions. This seems to be played by the set of symbols up to there exists some other simple one morphism. Some other simple one-morphism. And this gives me a peering. And you can define a grade of fusion 2 category to be non-degenerate if this peering is a non-degenerate pairing. And it turns out that if you look at trinfeld centers, those are non-degenerate in this sense. But here is a consequence that somehow doesn't happen for great diffusion one. I mean, it's not obvious. It's one square. This matrix is not obviously square. In fact, in general, it just isn't square, because it just pairs two different. Square, because it just pairs two different sets. And one consequence of this being non-degenerate is that it has to be square. And so this is like the first thing you observe: is that if you have a non-degenerate predefined 2 category, there are precisely as many objects as there are in the morphism of the test in the vertex. It's kind of like objects of modular case, we have modularities on that and Yeah, that's right. And right, indeed what Theo was just pointing out, this is just when I say diagonal here, it really means square. I don't mean that. It's not the diagonal. I don't mean they are. It's not that they are sorry, it's because it's square, so that's why I'm not such a problem. And so you learn, so in this case that we care about, is a braided fusion is a set of sigma v, where the loops, the endomorphisms of one, is just S. So we know this is a set of size two. There are two simple objects in S. So we notice immediately that there are two components. So there's only sort of two sort of interesting classes of simple objects. They can have many simple objects that sort of sit in one component, but there will be two components. Components of the plan. And these two components are distinguished by what happens if you pray it with the fermion insulin. That's what the isotropic statement is saying. So in pictures, you can say, from sort of looking at the prating of this E, the fermion, with one of these objects. This is sort of a braiding drawn in 14 dimensions. Pretty trivial, though it can be minus one. And this distinguishes the two components. And if you want to if you don't like drawing diagrams in four dimensions, you can think of this as movies of diagrams of three dimensions. Of diagrams in three dimensions. And as a movie, what happens here is that here you have a line, here you have a point, this is sort of a slicing through this line and slicing through the surface of the line. And what this movie is doing, it moves this point under the line, and then it moves it back over the line. So what we're asking is if I pick up the fermion and supervector spaces, have one of these lines, and move it sort of over it and under it, do I pick up a minus sign or do I just get the identity? And so it's very sensible to call such an object, if I pick up the minus sign, it's a magnetic. If I pick up the minus sign, it's a magnetic object. Because it's sort of charged and I'm moving an electron around it. This is sort of how magnetism works. And so we have two components. We call one of them the magnetic component. This is the one where braiding with the fermion is minus one. And we have a trivial component where braiding with the fermion is trivial. This is, of course, like the tensor unit since it's trivial component. That's the idea. So we're already seeing here that if I'm of the form set of sigma v, I can only The form set of sigma b, I can only have two components. And I can only have two, and I'm also sort of force myself to have sort of loops of sort of endomorphism to be especially. So you already see that this is sort of very restrictive, that you start to restrict this category to something that's a fairly good controlling part. And then what you do is after you've sort of extracted some more properties of this sort, you can just go and classify all predated fusion two galactics which have these properties. That's sort of what we're doing. And indeed, it turns out, up to prediction, And indeed, it turns out, up to graded equivalence, there are precisely two non-degenerate graded fusion two categories with endomorphisms of one as superlative species. And this is sort of going back to this question of Dimitri. They have the same underlying fusion two categories. They're equivalent as fusion two categories, but they're not equivalent as fusion two categories. The difference is in the primary. And the difference is somehow in the highest coherence set, this is what we were saying earlier of the privilege. So it's fairly hard to see the difference. And okay, let's. And okay, let's give these names so that we have something to talk about. Let's just give them really bad names and just letters. That's sort of consecutive in the alphabet. Let's call them S and T. The goal, as I said, is to show or to explain why T cannot be a trinfette center. Then we end up. That was the idea. We had these two things. We knew that the center of signal bead is at least one of them. And if only one of them can be a trinfit center, then it has to be S. Okay, so it's just a concept. To be of S. Okay, so that's just a consequence. It implies that the center of sigma b is s, and therefore also so is the center of sigma of s vect, and therefore they have a group of it. So, by the way, for those of you who care about bit groups of non-degenerate categories, something that also follows from this statement, it follows, doesn't follow immediately, but you can sort of maybe roughly see why it follows, that the bit group of non-degenerate rated fusion 2 categories, so there's something you can build, which is sort of like a bit group, is a CMO2. And this guy T that isn't a TrinFit center is a general. Guy T that is in the Trinfield center is the generator of this group. It's a sort of, in some sense, at least up to bit equivalence, the only interesting non-degenerate rated fusion two category. Okay, but I won't talk about this. Right, so how do you show that T is not a Trinfield center? How do you show that a given non-degenerate rated fusion one category is not a trin field center? Usually what you do is you compute some anomalies, some creditational anomaly, if this is a second junction. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work here. The problem is you can sort of see The problem is, you can sort of see from a Bordesmann computation, at least if I'm sort of won't fix a pivotal structure and all these things, that there just isn't any anomaly that you can, like the sort of relevant Bordesmann proof will be zero. So there won't be any anomaly I can write down for a frame, for frame or non-pivotal feature. And if I give it a pivotal structure, if I try to give it a pivotal structure, it will turn out that this anomaly you can then compute actually depends on this choice of pivotal structure. You can produce any anomaly you like by just choosing. Any of them normally you like by just choosing different virtual structures. So we have to do something else. That was the question. Is this like a super wig group because you've got groups that C is super back? No, this is just an ordinary width group. This is the only WIT group of non-degenerate fusion two categories. But they're, yeah, saying you only have two of them when loops is SFEC, but loops can be something else. Oh, loops can be something else. Yeah, exactly. So this loops is not the sort of categorified selected Mooga center of these of these companies. Mugger center of these unplanned pre-diffusion categories. Like you see in this slide, this is an example. This is a non-degenerate predefined 2 category, and still loops is S vector. But you can detect the lines by braiding them against surfaces. So it's still non-degenerate as a pre-diffusion 2 category. So loops here doesn't play the role of a migrant. It's more like looking at the endomorphism of one and a non-degenerate prediction of 1P. That's the non-micosetic algorithm that converts it sort of makes it equivalent to one of these. Makes a good equivalent to one of these. Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's right. Okay. So we can't use this anomaly idea. So we have to come up with something else. And right, how to tell these two things apart. And what we're doing, what sort of turns out to happen, is something which feels more like a Frobenius Shur implicator. So what you do is, if you, let's sort of, suppose C is one of these two, and let's just pick any simple object in the magnetic component, in this component which isn't connected to the other. Isn't connected to the pick any one of these. And you could ask, I mean, you can, right, you can ask what happens if a tensile is itself. It turns out this gives you the identity. So it looks like there's sort of a C mod 2 coming up. And you could ask, can I extend this C mod2-ness to a graded monoidal 2 factor from C mod 2 to C? And this, so can I make this sort of a CMO2 in a fully coherent way? And this only works if my category is S and T this won't work well. S and T this won't work. And then yeah. So that's the idea how to tear these apart. So just pick any simple magnetic object and try to sort of extend it to a functor out of CMOTI, a greater value functor. And here I think of CMO2 just as a great Meriden 2 category with two objects and all a homomorphism such as trivia. So how to do this? Let's do it. Let's sort of pick up an object n and try to extend it to a functor of single. To extend it to a functor of C nature. This is how you do something like this. So we want to prove that this is equal to s, so we do what we said in the last slide. We start by picking any simple magnetic object in the transfer center of signal. Just choose any one of them. Turns out they're two up to a covalence. So here you make two choices. This will this one, fixed one. Okay. Now, next thing we have to do is we try to extend this to a braided two functor out of C12 to the to infinite sector of C. How do you do such a thing? How do you do such a thing? So, building Brady 2 functors out of something like this is essentially a comological computation. I won't comment on this too much, but essentially, once you figure out a good sort of convenient cell complex for this space, Kc2,2, and this is the space that also came up in Victor's question earlier, you find sort of a recipe of sort of a minimal amount of data you need to give to specify such a predator. And you go through this recipe and see what you have to specify. The first thing you have to specify sort of makes sense. You want to say this is a C mod 2. Make sense. We want to say this is a C mod 2. So the first thing you want to specify is an equivalence from m squared to 1. Turns out there are two choices to this. The choices are essentially a torso over the invertible objects less than that of its x-s with torsions. But now we have to do more. If you really want to have a functor out of CMO2, in CMO2, everything is trivial. All the higher sales is trivial. There's no prading in CMO2. So you have to trivialize the prading of this object. Okay? And it turns out this is just. Okay, and it turns out this is just an isomorphism at the top. It's like a two-isomorphism. So I have a torso, and these are all invertible objects. So this is a torso of a C cross. I can sort of scale this by any number, and that's still fine. Now there's many choices we could make. Okay, so let's continue. So this is sort of the data I'm picking. But now I also have to sort of verify some properties. These properties are a bit harder to think about in pictures. There turns out to be some obstruction, some number you can compute once I've specified. Some number you can compute. Once I've specified this data, mr and phi, there is some number you can compute, some sort of endomorphisms of the tensile, of the identity in the tensile. And you need this number to be one. Now we didn't actually compute a formula for this number, but we can show that this number is quartic in this choice of phi. So if I'm multiplying phi by lambda, by some or by something else, alpha, then this number will scale to the power alpha to the four. And so what you can do is you can just And so, what you can do is you can just always make this one, because here I said this is a torso of a C cross. So, you can just sort of rescale this choice to make this obstruction B1. And this means that actually my choices of phi, I only had four admissible choices of phi. Only four of them corresponding to sort of four different sort of fourth rules. And so, actually, my torsor choice here actually has now reduced to four different choices of phi. Okay, so that's good, but then there is another obstruction. There's another obstruction which only depends. There's another obstruction which only depends on the choice M and R on this isomorphism in this simple object. It does not depend on this fine anymore. And this is sort of the problem, this obstruction. This is where things get difficult, because this obstruction isn't obviously sort of you can't just rescale things to make this go away. This is something that's sort of a genuine obstruction. And indeed, if you play this game, you can sort of succeed in this game. If you take S or T, this game will succeed up to this spot. This works in both cases. But here is where things differ. But here is where things differ. Namely, the difference between T and S is that for all choices M and R, whatever I'm choosing, any simple magnetic object, any equivalence, if I compute this number, it will either be 1 if I'm in S, or it will be minus 1 if I'm in T. So this is like the difference. This is a way to see the difference in the sense-graded value structure. And you see, this is some sort of, I'll say a bit how you compute this number in the second, what this number is. That's sort of an actual obstruction you have to deal with. Okay? And. And maybe let me comment two things on this. First of all, we've seen these braided module categories. And I said that the center of sigma b is equivalent to the category of braided module categories. So let's sort of think a bit about what these choices mean in terms of braided module categories. So the first choice is you have to pick some indecomposable magnetic braided B module. The second choice is you have to pick an equivalent from N tensor over Bn to B. And then some other choices that I won't discuss. That I won't discuss. And what this really means is that this construction, essentially, sort of checking that this works, is in some sense constructive. Because what is the M and B? It reaches the B plus this plated model category. And these choices 1 to 5, this is essentially what, this is the necessary condition for this to admit a plated model construction. And the additional condition that this is magnetic, this is what ensures that this. And of course, this is another way to think of this construction, then it's just a C2 created braided extension. It's just the C2 created extension of B, which is determined by this graded monoidal two functor in this paper for Alexia integration. So, this is what we're doing. And so it's really about building greater monoidal two functors. And the only obstruction really that comes up here is this last obstruction. So to wrap up, let me just say how to compute this obstruction. What is this obstruction? And this obstruction, we give a string diagrammatic formula for this obstruction. So what we've chosen is we've chosen a simple object M. We've chosen this equivalence from M to. We've chosen this equivalence from m times m to the unit. And now, using these two pieces of data, I'm going to describe a string diagram, so surface diagram and alpha. And what the surface is, unfortunately I won't draw a picture, but it is a client bottle embedded in alpha. And it's not just a client bottle, there's some framing information on this client bottle. So it's a certain projectively framed time. And in fact, this number you can compute for any dualizable object M and any self-duality, because the Klein model of course is not an oriented manifold. Is not an oriented manifold. So you have to use the self-duality to fail. And this is the sort of Ferguinius Schura indicator that I'm thinking about. Somehow you have to choose an object n, you have to choose the self-duality, and then you can compute this number out of it. And it turns out that this number doesn't actually depend on these choices of the object M, and it only depends on the class of the object M, and it doesn't depend on the choice of self-duality. So it very much behaves like a Frobenius Shorian. And okay, and then the end of the proof is that you just go in, fix a B and with Fix a B and with migration S value, and you choose a simple magnetic object and some isomorphism like this, and then you go and compute this number. So you've computed this. Turns out this number is one. And so you know you don't have this obstruction, and then you get a minimum under terminal extension. One thing I wanted to comment on before I end is, there was this question about do you see these 16 choices? I forgot to say this, but indeed in this construction, when we're doing this, there were precisely 16 choices coming up. There were precisely 16 choices coming out. There were two choices of simple object, two choices of equivalence from m times m to b, and then these four admissible choices as far. This makes two times two times four is 16. Those are the 16 choices. And I think that's a good point to start. Thank you. Yes, so on like on the previous slide, wonderful. Yes, so like what Yes, so like what so you're checking out that this functor extends to a braided manual of the function, right? And the abstraction to it is in the fourth abelian Kahamovich or C. Yeah, okay, the ability to case into comma to the column. And so like basically all this like you know struggle is just which is the two, I mean yes, that's what I believe homology is simpler than the normal form. Yes, homology, there is kind of neural There is kind of a neurological description. So, all this struggle is just to show that this Bilan-Foker cycle is three. Exactly. Like, the problem is, in some sense, you can think of this as like the obstruction group. But the obstruction group is non-trivial. It's a CMO2. And so it's sort of weird because the obstruction group is non-trivial, so you have to actually go and compute the obstructions. And all this struggle indeed is just showing that this co-cycle is trivial. And this formula, this Km, R, if you want, is a string diagrammatic formula which computes the value of this. Computes the value of this constant P. That's what it does. Like, this is also what the C complex of KC2, 2 is doing. Like, this is just our formula for what this last cycle is. Yes. So, another thing that sort of makes this problem hard compared to the other ones is that in the, say, in the Tanakian case, the obstruction group might be non-trivial, and every obstruction is realist, and that's the sort of cycles aren't realistic. It's like very different cases for humans. It's like very different cases. So here, the obstruction group is non-trivial, but nevertheless, you only see trivial obstruction. As opposed to the obstruction group is non-trivial, and you can see every obstruction coming up. There's some more general problems where bobs work also. What's this problem with actually? I don't know. I mean, in the end, the context. I don't know. I mean in the end the explicit computation uses semi-simplicity, that just uses a lot of sort of counting simple objects that have certain properties. But I think once you sort of leave the semi-simple word, I don't know, maybe there is something I don't think. It's like asking, is there a bigger world where T is a center? I guess that's right. And it's like, I mean, I already from Moach Latenza Kai. I mean already from modular tensor categories, from modular tensor one categories, that's an interesting question, right? But it has a big overall idea. Yes, that's integral or useful. I have a question. If you start with a minimum modular tensor category, which is a super modular tensor category, with a spherical structure, can you extend it with the minimum module extension? That means that you also have a means that you also have a spherical structure that we strictly small. Does it work this way? So one thing that follows out of this is if it's pseudo-unitry, if the spherical structure, the rhythm structure you start with is the pseudo-unitry, the positive one, then just by pseudo-unitarity that is canonical this would work. If you don't have a pseudo-unitry, no, we don't show it in this paper. But I think one could try to redevelop all of this in a spherical world and try to see. But I don't know what the answer is. But I don't know what the answer is. But I think the method should still work. So that means the result cannot be extended to arbitrary, like the ribbon supermodel attached. So I think there will be another layer of obstruction theory there, and you just have to go through that obstruction theory as well. But I mean, this will be part of it, but then there's sort of more things you have to check. Where in the choices is Choices will kind of different networks, extensions like positive versus VC or different brands that are using the first or in the second? Yes, I think it's in the first one. It's like the choice of M, I think. It's two different choices. You actually get a group C16 and not just a close. And this is just the there's only one way that's 16, that's like two pieces that. Two pieces in it. The first choice is pointed versus unpointed. The second choice is if work. Yes. And then the rest of the rest contracting data. Sorry. If I follow this, it's constructive. So if I give you the so what you write, what you basically have to do is this, right? You have to go and say, choose any magnetic-graded model. That you choose any magnetic proted module. So you choose, and where do you find these things? You can look at the drin field center of your category B. This is a paraded module over B. And you can just decompose it into indecomposable modules. And one of them has to be, at least one of them has to be magnetic, because it's a generator for braided modules. So you should pick this. Choose whatever, one of them you like. And then here, go and just pick any isomorphism. And then you just continue making these choices. This is like the Making these choices. This is like this determines what the underlying category is and how B acts on N, and how sort of the Pradesh can interact with N. This determines how the multiplication of an object in N and M gives you an object in B sort of compatible with the praying. And this higher stuff, I mean, I've never actually really unpacked this. I'd like to go through these lists and really see how this defines a praying. But just from sort of abstract non-sense, this is these will exactly be the questions you have to ask to give this category a prayer in, which is compatible with the braided module structure. How do we have to break a module structure on that? But is there ideally like two flavors? Because like for um extensions of a sphere, these two flavors um correspond to the central charge, whether it's a limit or non-plimitive rotor unit. So here the central charge can be pretty much anything. It's just like in a disturbance, of units. So you cannot really tell which of them are kind of pointed and which are not. That's right. That's right. This is like this choice of magnetic. There's no battery. Like there are two magnetic modules. No beta, like there are two magnetic modules, but none of them is like preferred over the other one from the summary. In fact, you can compute the automorphism group of S as a graded fusion two category. The automorphism group of S, I mean, pi zero of the automorphism group of S is precisely Z16. Yeah. Giving these 16 changes. So this is a completely right, yes. Saying the um the variant is for being a screw like how literally should I take it? Literally, I think? Uh not literally. You can just take it as sort of an analogy. So if you pick up an object, you choose some maybe symmetric self-duality on it, and then you can compute some number out of it which you couldn't have computed without making this choice. And then this number somehow doesn't depend on this choice of symmetric self-duality, and it tells you something interesting about the object. That is all somehow. Okay, there's a lot more. Yes, but it sort of makes sense, right? Because what I didn't, like, again, you have this object, you peak a metric septo arms, now you come. You pick a metric septo almost, now you compute one some number. That number must be some unoriented two manifold embedded in alpha. And it turns out that a good choice, and at least one that gives you this instruction, is the Klein bottle. The Klein bottle is a good unoriented two manifold embedded in Alpha. In fact, we do need, since we just pick a self-duality and nothing more, no sort of higher coherence, it has to have a projective framing. So you can check it, just you can't just be some unoriented multifot. It has to be unoriented, but in sort of a higher dimension, it looks as if it's framed. If it's framed. And I actually don't know that many projectively frame two manifolds. I think the Klein bottle is, the Klein bottle is sort of like the torus in that respect. The torus is sort of a frame two manifold, and the Klein bottle is sort of a generating projectively frame two manifold. There's a Borisman group of projectively frame two manifolds, and the Klein bottles generate. And so it does make sort of there isn't that much you can do if you want to sort of copy the Frobenius Shore type game. Can I ask a question? What do you mean by projectively framed? What do you mean by projectively framed? Right, what do you mean by projectively framed? You have a map from BO to BC2, which is the determinant. You take the fiber, that's the structure group you want to have. So you trivialize the projective tangent button. The projectivized tangent button. You take the tangent button, you projectivize it, and you trivialize it as a projective vector button. I see. Thanks. Last question. About the main idea? This one? Oh, yeah, the one that's from numbers. About the equivalence between the. This one? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So this one comment is that I think that theorem refers to it appeared as a conjecture of failed to theorem. This one. This one, yes. Another, I have elementary questions. I'm a little bit lost when you say that why the Juvio sender help button your Tior has. What's the missing behind that? Oh, because you just say there are, so this is going to be a non-degenerate plate of fusion two category with endomorphisms of one areas. The lines in that areas. That's what it is just by sort of looking at it. And then the theorem is when you. Is which comes here, up to graded equivalence? There are precisely two non-degenerate fusion two categories, the slide by aspect. Yeah, that I know, but why have to be minimal in that sense? I would confuse. These two are sort of a minimal gener extension of the these are the only two non-degenerate grade diffusion two categories with lines are aspect. Set of sigma b is a non-degenerate grade of fusion two categories with lines. Another general creative fusion two categories of slides are SLA. So it has to be one of these. Because it can, like, these are the only two things that are not a general predictive fusion two categories of lines as well. So if you give me a non-determined prayer fusion two category of lines as well, it has to be either this or that. Well, I can see the contender part to see why the other instances have to be this two. There's an early result to saying that it is only two. Yeah, exactly. This is by Theodore's father. Exactly, this is by Theo. Exactly. We have sort of another proof of. Exactly. We have sort of met a proof of this in the paper, but this is the same. I just forgot that. Exactly. So it's just a cohomology computation. You let go in, you see what's sort of there. Great. That's just worth thinking. Again, let's take a 10-minute break, so we'll start at 10 minutes.
