Just give the talk, and you'll have to trust that I am, you know, here and not doing anything crazy. So, first of all, many thanks for the invitation to speak. And since my time management is known to not be great, I thought I should get the important things out of the way first. So, my thanks to Brian and Polka, and also, I understand at some point, Keith, for putting this meeting together two years ago and then. Putting this meeting together two years ago and then putting it together again. And my very best wishes to Tony. May you enjoy your retirement and all the fruits that it brings. So I also given the current audience how to use some notation, which I know is not favored by everyone, but throughout this talk, today I'm only dealing with the projective tensor product of Banach spaces and not the operator space. Spaces and not the operator space tensor products. So I'm just going to use hat over the tensor for the Banach space projective tensor product. And some of you may wish to mentally insert a gamma or something as a subscript, as a reminder. Hopefully that's not too objectionable. So actually, much of what I want to talk about is not really about amenability per se, but I thought that for some people in the audience, at least, I should explain where the motivation. I should explain where the motivation comes from quickly. So, I need to introduce two maps, mu and kappa, just for notation. So, mu is for multiplication on the algebra. It goes from a tensor A to A. And kappa is the standard embedding, the natural embedding of a banana space in its bidual. We then say that a virtual diagonal for A is an element, not in a tensor A itself, but in the bidual. Tense array itself, but in the bidual. So, which is this is usually some hard to understand big space, but it's well defined. And we say that delta is a virtual diagonal if it satisfies these two conditions. So, this one is kind of approximate, well, it's a centrality condition in some sense. It's saying that if you act with A on the left of this big space, and if you act Of this big space, and if you act with A on the right, then the two actions agree on this special element delta. And of course, if that was the only condition I had, then I could take delta equals zero, which would not be interesting. So I obviously need another condition. And the other condition that is relevant here is this one, which if you haven't seen it before, maybe just think about it as saying that applying the multiplication map to delta gives you the identity. I mean, this is not literally. I mean, this is not literally true, but it's the idea. And where these come from is from work of Barry Johnson in the 1970s. And this gives one of the equivalent definitions of what it means for a Banach algebra to be amenable. So can I just check that my slides are moving? Is that all right? Good. So the thing today is more the quantitative. The thing for today is more the quantitative aspect of meanability rather than the qualitative aspect, and therefore there is something interesting to be said even for finite-dimensional Banach algebras. So every finite dimensional Banach space is equivalent in norm to every other finite dimensional Banach space. So if you don't care about norm control, then as we'll shortly see, there's not much to say about immunability of finite dimensional Banach algebra. Of finite-dimensional Banach algebras. But if A is finite-dimensional and we care about norms, then we still have this identification that the bidual of a finite dimensional Banach space is itself. And therefore, we don't need to work in the bidual. We can work in the original tensor square. And then we usually call this thing a diagonal element for A. So these are quite, I mean, it's conjectured that for every infinite dimensional banner. For every infinite-dimensional Banach algebra, there are no diagonal elements, but that's another story. So, what do these things look like, and where does the terminology come from? Suppose you have a Banach algebra that is isomorphic as an algebra to n copies of the complex numbers with pointwise product. So, in some sense, the nicest possible scenario you can get. Then, this algebra has a diagonal element living in a tense array. Living in a tense array, and in fact, it has a unique diagonal. And if I am identifying A with C to the n, then the diagonal is the element corresponding to this, hence the name diagonal. That's where the name comes from. But notice that it's not clear what the norm of this element should be in a tensor A. Well, one case where we can We know exactly what's going on is for things like L1 and specifically L1 of a finite group. Unlike the previous example, this group doesn't have to be commutative, so this is not necessarily a commutative algebra. But if I take the standard basis vectors, EG, and I form this element living in the tensor square, then one can check fairly easily that this. Fairly easily, that this satisfies the conditions on the previous slide. Moreover, each elementary tensor here has norm one, and you're averaging a bunch of tensors which have norm one. Therefore, the norm of this thing has to be at most one, but you can also show quite easily it has to be greater than or equal to one. So the norm is exactly one. Okay. So So, that discussion sort of leads naturally into the words in the title, talking about the amenability constant of the BAF algebra. And it's formally defined in this way. We take all possible virtual diagonals for A, if there are any. We look at their norms and we take the infimum. And the convention is that the infimum of the empty set is plus infinity. So they is not amenable. We declare it and we. They is not immuneau, we declare its immunability constant to be plus infinity. And perhaps in some very non-rigorous sense, you might think that small values of the immunability constant mean you're somehow more amenable. You know, some amenable algebras are more amenable than others, as they might say. So, in the example I just mentioned for a finite group, I wrote down an element which witnesses the fact that the amenability constant is one. Constant is one. Because it's a diagonal which has norm one, general principles tell us that the immuneau constant must always be at least one, and therefore one is attained. The same is actually true much more generally, although I don't really know exactly who first sort of stated this or claimed this. But the first kind of solid sort of proof of this I know of is from a paper of Ross Stocky, which I believe was. Which I believe was came from his PhD thesis with Tony. And Ross actually put together the requisite kind of nets and quasar-central bounded approximate identities and these things to show that if G is amenable as a group, then L1 of G does indeed have a virtual diagonal of norm one. And thus for L1 group algebras, we've got a sharp dichotomy. The immunability constant is either one or plus infinity. Or plus infinity, because recall that if a group is non-amenable, L1 of G is not an amenable balance algebra. And since I'm following from an operator algebra's talk, I should also mention the same is true in C-Star world, but that's, I think, very hard. I think that needs Hobruk's nuclear implies amenable paper. So, in other words, for C-star algebras, if they're amenable at all, the amenable. They're amenable at all, the amenity transit is one. So, for L1 algebras and C2 algebras, the value of this thing is either one or plus infinity. But for Fourier algebras, this is very much not true unless one was discussing operator amenability, which I won't do today. But some people will know about this. Okay, so for a finite group, let me talk about the Fourier norm. About the Fourier norm. I wasn't sure in the audience, there are many people in here who have worked on the Fourier algebra much longer than me, but perhaps not everyone has. So for a finite group, we have a very concrete description of the Fourier algebra norm, which I wanted to mention. For a function on this finite group, f, we define sigma of f just to be the result of integrating the representation. Integrating the representation, and the integral is just a sum, since this is a finite group. And based on that, you view this as some kind of matrix-valued Fourier coefficient, and then you can define the following norm, which is something like a weighted L1 sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients. That's how it was classically thought of. So, this is sometimes difficult to work with, but it is at least very explicit. Is at least very explicit. But when you take the projective tensor product, what's going on here is you're taking the projective tensor product of Shatten class, Shatten one make classes, and that's known to be quite nasty. However, despite all this, there is actually an explicit exact formula for the amenability constant of the Fourier algebra of a finite group. So I'm going through this a bit quickly, but I just wanted to set. Going through this a bit quickly, but I just wanted to set up the right notation. So, this is from Barry Johnson's one and only paper on the Fourier algebra, which I have gone back to many times. If G is a finite group, then the amenability content of the Fourier algebra is given by this explicit formula in terms of the degrees of irreducible representations. Useful representations. And from this formula, a bunch of things follow. One of them is that if G is abelian, then the amenability constant is one. Now, the high-powered approach to that claim is to note that if G is a finite abelian group, A of G is isometrically isomorphic to L1 of the dual group. And I said earlier that L1 of finite groups. Finite groups are amenable with constant one. But you can also see it directly from this formula. More relevant to today's talk is a certain gap phenomenon. So I believe after the coffee break, John will say more about gap results for immunity constants in a different setting. But I wanted to say something about this, even if it's very quick, just to show that some facts about finite groups. Some facts about finite groups seem to be very hard, as people will know, but this is not one of them. This is actually quite an easy result. That if G is a finite non-abelian group, then the mean ability constant is at least three over two, and that's sharp. You can attain three over two. And roughly speaking, the idea is that when you look at this d pi cube, you would like to say that this is at least 2 d pi squared, and then we squared, and then we know that the sums of squares of irreducible sums of squares of degrees of irreducible representations is the size of the group. So this is a quantity that we have an exact expression for, and we'd like this to be a lower bound because d pi cube is surely bigger than 2 d pi squared. Except it isn't when d pi equals 1. So you have to add on a correction factor and we can control the correction. And we can control the correction factor because it turns out to be related to the size of a certain subgroup. And so there's a kind of discreteness phenomenon going on here. So this is all sort of known. This was all observed back in Johnson's paper. Now, I have usually tried to avoid being the person who defines the Fourier algebra, and for reasons of time, I can't give. Of time, I can't give any of the current definitions here. Many of you, I think, in the audience have seen it. If you haven't seen it before, maybe let me just make two remarks. One is that there is a definition for all locally compact groups, which extends what I did for finite groups, but has to be done in a different way, obviously. The other thing is that when G is locally compact abelian, A of G is somehow the Gelfand transform of L1. Transform of L1 of the dual group. And so, what's motivated, I think, a lot of study of the Fourier algebra is this kind of philosophy of non-non-commutative Pointry-Argen duality. We saw quantum groups mentioned in Amy's talk, and it fits into that bigger picture. I also want to make an observation that what is hard probably about understanding the immune constant of the Fourier algebra when it's not infinity. When it's not infinity, is that we're having to deal with this projective tensor product. And again, I remind people I'm using the Banach space projective tensor product. So there's a canonical map from here into here, which has dense range, but it usually messes up the norm unless G1 and G2 are very, unless one of them is very special. And in fact, usually this thing isn't even surjective. If it's surjective, then either G1 or G2 has to be virtually a beat. G2 has to be virtually abelian. In some sense, close to being abelian. Now, and it turns out that the class of virtually abelian groups is in some sense characterized as certain properties of A of G. So I forget the original notation that was used in the papers. I'm using this sort of slightly barbaric notation. Of a slightly barbaric notation. A diag stands for anti-diagonal. So if you sort of draw, if you picture g cross g as some kind of, you know, the plane, then this is meant to be the anti-diagonal in the geometric sense. And some years ago, sort of this is sort of the end of a long and interesting story, but Brian and Falker, among other things, Brian and Falker, among other things, characterized the groups for which A of G is amenable as a Ballach algebra. So the first step or the key step somehow was they showed that if A of G is amenable, then the indicator function of this set actually lies in the Fourier-Steltsches algebra of G cross G with the discrete topology. And they were then able to leverage work of various people, some of whom are in the audience. It's a long story, I'll skip all the details. But it was known somehow how to get from here to saying certain things about the operator space behavior and thence to showing that G has to be virtually abelian. So, this is making use of works of Ilian Sprong and Victor Lozet from further back. Instead, what I want Instead, what I want to talk about is the first point. So, Falker noticed that the method of proof actually gives you a lower bound on the amenability constant. Essentially, you take a virtual diagonal, you approximate it somehow, you push it over into another space, and you take a limit. And I find this very striking, this lower bound. Striking this lower bound, and it's remarked in that paper: it remains to be seen whether this will eventually lead to a more satisfactory bound from below for the amenability constant of a Fourier algebra, because very little seems to be known of the norms of eigenpotence in Fourier-Stilts' algebras. And that is still true to some extent, but I would counter that we can actually say quite a bit about the norm of this particular eidem potent, it turns out. And I need a name for this, so I'm just going to introduce this notation AD, standing for anti-diagonal, I guess. And this is the Fourier-Dilches norm of this 0, 1 value function. And I think it deserves further study. Perhaps I will, for reasons of time, I will skip over the remarks here. But maybe I'll just draw people's attention to the fact it is monotone in the sense that if you have. Monotone in the sense that if you have a subgroup, then the AD constant goes down. So in my remaining time, I want to talk about some new results, a paper that's been submitted not that long ago. And maybe I want to draw people's attention to what happens for finite groups, because we are sometimes as analysts feel, oh, well, the finite dimensional setting should be easy. Things should be easy, but if you have to do quantitative things with finite-dimensional Banach spaces, they can be hard once again. Now, g is a finite group, then the Fourier-Stiltsches algebra is the same as the Fourier algebra, and we have a formula for the norm. Here, the group is G cross G, so I've written out the Fourier formula for the Fourier norm of this thing as some kind of expression using the matrix value Fourier coefficients. Now, you might say, oh, this. Coefficients. Now you might say, oh, this, you know, what have you gained here? This thing on the right-hand side, you know, doesn't look very helpful. But we can actually say a lot. We can actually calculate the Fourier coefficients of this indicator function. And interestingly, I wasn't sure if there's a reference for this. I'm sure I'm not the first person to have done this calculation, but the Calculation, but the Fourier coefficients, the Fourier transform in some sense of this thing, is supported on the diagonal of g hat. So when pi and sigma are inequivalent, this Fourier coefficient vanishes. And when pi equals sigma, you can actually write down exactly what this matrix is, it turns out. The proof involves sure orthogonality. I can chat to people afterwards if they want to know more. And this operation. This operator or matrix X is the flip map. You can calculate everything you want about it, including its trace norm. And plugging this in, you find that the AD constant, which is meant to be a lower bound for the immunability constant of the Fourier algebra, actually equals this thing, which equals Johnson's original formula. So for finite groups, this lower bound was actually sharp. Bound was actually sharp, which is unexpected. Okay, so what I mentioned in my abstract was that we can actually do things now for infinite groups. So let me try and, in my remaining time, say a bit about that. I'll probably have to skip some details. We know it's enough to look at virtually abelian groups because of Brian and Falker's theorem, because if G is not virtually abelian, then... Because if g is not virtually abelian, then the Fourier algebra is not amenable. So we've got plus infinity. And you know, plus infinity is certainly bigger than three over two. For technical reasons, I want to look at countable groups. You can probably remove this technicality if you want to reprove lots of results about disintegrations of the Leumann algebras, but I don't. So let's assume G is countable, but So let's assume G is countable virtually abelian and set up this basic machinery of the Plancherel measure, which some people may have seen in different contexts. And I normalize it such that one is equal to the integral over G hat of D chi. So actually, this is a finite measure because G is discrete. So the dual is compact in some sense. And it turns out that you have under these Turns out that you have, under these assumptions on G, an explicit formula for this A D of G, the Fourier-Stiltsches norm of the indicator function of the antidiagonal. And so I don't know very much about the norms of general eigenpotents in that Fourier-Stelches algebra, but I do know about the norm of this particular eigenpotent. And in particular, finite groups are virtually abelian, but you can check that if G is finite, then this Planchorelle. If g is finite, then this Planchorel measure is just dπ divided by the size of the group. And if you plug this into here, you'll see that we once again get one over size of G sum over d pi cube. Okay, can I just check? Do I have one minute left? Two minutes left? One minute, two minutes. Okay, right. Okay, I'm aware there's coffee waiting for the chosen few in band. The chosen few in banff. So I apologize for moving this little thing around all the time. So this is more for the aficionados in the audience. And really, I wanted to give a shout out here to sort of Canadian alumnus Maya Gandhihari, who tends to be my go-to source for all details about what is in our Satch's thesis and isn't. And she pointed out to me that some results from the end of Arsenal's thesis might help. And indeed, they define an isometry from some operator-valued L1 space to the Fourier-Sielches algebra. So the way the proof works is to essentially use the finite setting, finite group setting as an ansatz. You construct some operator value distribution on g hat cross g hat, which is cooked up so that the Which is cooked up so that the inverse Fourier transform maps it to the desired function. And because our sept's result tells us this is an isometry, a d of g is the L1 norm of this F. And I'll have to skip over the technical thing at the bottom, but this is just to show that there's a very explicit formula for F, which may remind you of what was going on for the finite group case. So Let me, I have more, but just to stay on time, maybe I'll just finish with this slide and I can talk about the remaining stuff later or people can, I can, I'll send people my slides. So I'll finish here by saying that we can now give an affirmative answer to a question raised in Holker's paper of whether Johnson's lower bound is true in general. The answer is it is. Is it because if you have a locally compact group which is non-abelian, well, if it's not virtually abelian, the amenability constant is plus infinity, and as I remarked before, that's fine. If the locally compact group is virtually abelian, we can pass to a countable virtually abelian subgroup and then apply our formula, sorry, together with. Together with this fact, which is an analogue of the basic result about finite groups that I mentioned before. But my time is up. So, once again, my thanks to everyone and enjoy, Band. Any questions? Well, I have one about. I mean, if you replace the Fourier algebra by Talabanca Hertz algebra, so the only result, as far as I know, is that if some locally compact G, if you got Talabanka Hertz algebra, is a PG is amenable, then it has to be a building. Be a building. Do you think your methods might reach into that kind of realm? It's possible, but one would need to create some new machinery. The problem is my methods are largely based around the Plancherel formula in some sense. Yeah. And as you all know, even for abelian groups, we have problems. Like if we take Lp of an abelian group and look at the Fourier transform, then things are not so. Then things are not so clear. It might be an interesting perspective to start from. I haven't thought about it, but I think a lot would need to be done. You can't just pick something off the shelf the way I did here. Okay, thank you very much. So any more questions? What about those who are present digitally in spirit? Okay, if not, let's thank the speaker again and have coffee afterwards. We will start again at 11 o'clock.
