And we will hear about Motiv Aloha theory of dimensionally regularized finance. Thank you very much and thank you to the organizers for the invitation to this lovely place. And I guess today's talk will be the first test of how well we can heed Matt's advice from the beginning of the conference about listening to each other. Also, Also, thank you to Francisca, who did such a good job of introducing the motivation for this type of work in physics. So, I don't have to do that much work there. And right, so I will start with, as Francisco promised, I will start with the sort of more formal introduction to more details on the formalization of this business. This of this business, but I don't want to do, I'm not going to do it completely. I'm not going to give every definition in detail. I'm going for a sort of an intuitive idea of what the formalism is. That's going to be the goal here. So we'll start with just periods, which I'm sure we all know, but let's just remind ourselves they're integrals of this shape, where we have quotients of polynomials of differential form, a cycle on the complex, and a cycle over which. The cycle over which we integrate, which is given by, which is a cycle on some on complex points on some algebraic variety x. Now, one of the reasons this class of numbers is interesting is that there is this very deep conjecture that there is an algebraic group over the rational numbers, which I'm going to call Gmot, acting on periods and preserving all algebraic relations. So here is the sort of Here is the sort of action, this action language, where an element of GMOT acts on an integral like this by acting on, it can act either on the integrand or on the domain of integration. Typically, it's written like this. But anyway, this is conjectural. Dually, we can think of a co-action. So instead of acting with the group, we co-act with the algebra of functions on that group. Algebra of functions on that group. So from the P stands for the ring of periods, we go to periods, tensor, functions on GMOT. Now, functions on GMOT are what Francisco called the RAM periods. And those who work in this field will know as the RAM periods. And I'm not going to use that word that much because we're not going to focus on them in this talk. It's just going to say functions on Gmod when I talk about these things. And so the shape of the co-action will be something like this. Something like this. An integral will be sent to a finite sum, a finite sum of tensor products, where on the left-hand side we have some other periods with, so the integrands are changing here. And on the right-hand side of each of these, we have a function on GMOT or the RAM period. Okay, now I said this is all conjectural. So we want to sidestep those conjectures. And for that, we're going to use this scary word cohomology. And so, what this means is basically we're going to consider these two vector spaces. So, we have here a Q vector space of K cycles on the complex points of X, modulo boundaries of K plus 1, something K plus 1, of dimension K plus 1. And on the other hand, so it's a Q vector space, and think of sort of domains of integration sitting inside. Sitting inside. So, the Duram algebraic Duram cohomology of X is a K vector space where K is the field of definition of algebraic variety, a K vector space of closed algebraic forms on X. So elements in the kernel of the differential from K to K plus 1 forms on X, modulo exact forms on X. And these two. And these two vector spaces have a perfect pairing between them here given by integration. So for an integral that we started with, we want to, for an integral omega integrated over sigma, we want to find an x such that the integrand generates a class in the algebraic Duramco homology and the domain of integration generates a class in the what's called Betty homology. What's called Betty homology, i.e., dual of cohomology. And then we can realize, and that allows us to realize the integral we started with as coming from this pairing of Betty and Durampo homology. Okay, so this will allow us to state something unconditionally. Namely, we have this abstract collection formula, which is unconditional. So here on the left, So, here on the left, you should think of this as an integral, as that integral we started with, an integral of omega over sigma, with some additional data. So, the data that we add is this data of the cohomology of x. So, we add basically x to the integral. And then the square brackets are here because this is then taken modulo obvious relations, namely Stokes, billinearity, change of variables. Change of variables. So, how you should think of this is: so, there are some deep conjectures in the theory of motives, which would tell you that there is some minimal way for every integral, for every period, omega over sigma, there is some minimal way to choose this object. And so that would make this collection canonical. What we are doing here is choosing something and adding that data in order to go around the projectures. To go around the projections. But you should think of the coalition, as canonical, even though there is some choice happening here. Okay, yes. Sure. So for the integral, so the integral of omega over sigma, you just think of, so as I said earlier, some algebraic variety x on which sigma gives a is a cycle and omega is a differential form. And omega is a differential form. So you just add that data of the geometry to the integral. That gives you this thing, which I call the motivic period, which people call motivic periods. Okay? Sorry, how do you come up with it? This is this depends. No? No, not necessarily. Okay. So So the integral is a finite sum of, sorry, the coaction is given by the finite sum over the basis of the RAM Kohomoji of X, so the basis of forms. We have here a basis of forms. It's a finite dimensional vector space. So it's a finite sum. On the left-hand side, we have here those integrals. So this you should think of as the integrals of EI over sigma with this additional data again. And on the right-hand side, we have the functions on GMOP, as I said. Gmod, as I said. So let's see an example for zeta values. The action would look like this. So if I take a g in gmot, it would act on, let's see, well, it would act on a zeta value in this way. We have here, I'll explain why this notation in a second, but this is a Q, this is a rational number, this is a rational number, and that's the zeta that we started with. That's how it remote acts on zetas. The co-action version, we write The coaction version we write as it's a two-term coax. We have zeta censored with lambda to dn. As I said, this is a function on g mod. So here we are evaluating lambda to power n at this g in g mod, because that's a function on g. And here we have one tensored with an. So this will give us this rational number once we evaluate it at g. Unconditionally, we can write something, this is We can write something. This is we can write something for motivic zetas. So we lift each of these zetas, which is a period. We come up with some x to represent it. And then we can write this formula with m here. And that would be unconditional. Yes? Well, if it's even that zero, and then you get, because it's 2 pi i, you get a one-dimensional representation. It's 2πi, you get a one-dimensional representation of the motivic Gallo group, and odd zetas give a two-dimensional representation. Yeah, thank you. Good point. Okay, in physics, this gives us, this gives rise to this idea of the cosmic Galo group. As we discussed earlier, it's a very cool name. Nothing to do with cosmology, though, unfortunately. Action on, okay, so the motto here is the action of the Motiv-Galo group closes on Feynman integrals, thereby giving you some sub-quotient group. Giving you some subquotient group of G mod that we call the cosmic algorithm. And so we have formulas like this. Here, Hg is some cohomology of X. Also, we can also allow boundaries. This is a slight generalization of what I was talking about. I'm not going to go into that. This object was canonically, was defined for, I think, well, for some class of Feynman integrals in parametric form by first by Bloch and Euro and Primer and then by Brown. First, by Bloch and Europe primer, and then by Brown in sort of in for generic kinematics and so on, of scalar and scalar Feynman duals. So we have this H, we have the object here, the Feynman integrand and the Feynman, sorry, the Feynman integrand and the domain of integration. Here I mean the Feynman integrand in parametric form, right? So something like this, where u and f are the semantic polynomials, and we have some powers depending on the number of edges and loops and the dimension we're looking at. looking at the yeah g is g is g is a fixed Feynman graph right and this gives us a collection a collect like this and because it closes it's supposed to close on the on the space Feynman integrals we we these Gi's are other Feynman graphs right that's the that's the idea and in fact it's stronger that this should be stronger than than that in that these Gi's should be somehow subquotients of G. Subquotients of G. And the weights, we keep talking about the weights of these objects should somehow be related to the numbers of edges and so on, which gives rise to this idea of, and I'm going to add a bit of motivation here in addition to everything that Francisca said, the constraints on the space of finite integrals, which Francis Brown calls the small graph principle, meaning that if you take into account weights, you can look at graphs up to a certain number. Graphs up to a certain number of edges, and let's in some theory, and let's suppose you prove that a certain period doesn't appear. Let's, for example, zeta 2 doesn't appear up to a certain number of edges. The co-action tells you then that any period that has that period that doesn't appear in your theory, any period that has that period in its co-action cannot also appear in your theory. So, even a single, proving that a single period doesn't appear in your theory at a small number of edges. At a small number of edges gives you an infinite number of constraints to all loop orders and numbers of edges. That's the small graphs principle. However, there is a problem with this story, and that's regularization. As soon as you try working this out in practice, you run into the fact that actually these formulas would be much nicer if you are allowed to include in some way regularized Feynman integrals. And that's where Abro Britto de Roguian Matthew came in and conjectured that the coaction. Came in and conjectured that the collection, and I'm just vaguely stating here something, the collection is compatible with dimensional regularization and also can be made diagrammatic in that both sides of this, we should also be able to write this side in terms of they write in terms of cut graphs. So this is, I'm not going to discuss this part, but that's what I mean by diagrammatic. So both sides of the collection being given in terms of graphs. Okay, so let's now step back. So let's now step back. We want to talk about DIMREG. So let's step back and see how this would look in math. So let's say x is again an algebraic variety over k for some subcule of c. And we have here a bunch of algebraic functions on x. So a bunch of functions on x to g m invertible. Omega is an algebraic differential form on x as before, and sigma is a cycle again as before. We could add boundaries. Again, I'm not going to go into that detail. What we want. What we want, in order to prove something like the statement that previously mentioned physicists made, we want the coaction actually for integrals of this shape. So algebraic Mellin transforms of f. I've just chosen one f, your n is one for this example. So integrals of f to the s omega over sigma. So this is an algebraic Melling transform of f somehow, and we want And then we want to look at the expansions around s equals zero of this integral, and we get a power series that looks something like this. Now, what's important about this expansion is that these coefficients in the power series expansion are classical periods. You can rewrite the powers of logs as algebraic integrals, as periods themselves, iterated integrals of periods. So you can. So you can you can you can this is this is a classical this is a classical period. However, this is not This just doesn't fit into the framework that I just described before so we have to extend it in some way simply because simply because unless s is a rational number, unless s is a rational number, this is not gonna, you won't be able to write it as a as a, yeah. Yeah. Okay. More generally, we might want to look at several f's and several s power, several sort of power s, like on the top right here. An example of this with n equals 2 is the Euler beta function. So a beta function is an integral like this. If s and t were rational, this would be a classical period of a Fermat curve, but it's not. But it's not in general, right? And we have this expansion. This is kind of traditional, this is classical, that there is this expansion where zeta values appear as coefficients in the expansion. So what are we going to do? We are going to lift these zetas to motivic zetas, just add hoc, and apply the collection formula for motivic zetas that I stated earlier, right? So we apply term by term. Right, so we apply term by term, literally, just plug it in into this equation here. Just plug in term by term, linear linear in S and T sort of thing. And a priori, what do we get? A priori, we get a power series in S and T, the coefficients of which are tensor products of motivic periods and functions on GMOT. Okay? I want to really hammer home this message. So what happens is delta of a power series of A power series of something like s to the k times a period, right? If you do this, you would get the sum of s to the k a priori sort of period tensor function on gm, on gmot. Right? Something like this. However, However, in terms of, oh, thank you. It turns out that we can rewrite this as a product of two power series. Okay, so instead of writing it like this, we will be able to rewrite it in terms of literally SK times a period tensor product. So this is like all of this taken tensor product with power series s to the k function. function on GM on Gmod. Okay? So, right. In order to do this, by the way, note that we need to scale S by the inverse of lambda. This is the same lambda that appears here, this lambda. It's a function on G mod. So we have to scale it like this, and I'll explain this if I get to that point. So if we do that scaling, we can rewrite this formula by B B motivic S T. B B motivic S T, I just mean this previous formula where you put M here for every zeta, right? So B so the collection on B motivic is again just B motivic on the left, so the whole power series, tensor, and then this factor, and then we have exp. And in there, we have coefficients, which are we have coefficients which are functions on G mod. So an is that an, lambda to the power n is that. By the way, this is a power, this is not a power, this is why the pair. power this is not a power this is why the parentheses so lambda n over sorry a n over lambda n okay so we get something of we get something of this shape so to to repeat a priori beta delta of beta of m it should be m up there uh is in in this space tensor products so power series with coefficients in tensor products but actually it lands in power series with coefficients in material periods tensor power series with coefficients in functions on gmod i.e the ramp Functions on Gmod, i.e., the run periods. Okay? I can rewrite this in terms of group actions. This is just playing the game action versus co-action duality that I explained for Zeta. So it would be G acts on B motivic by, here we have a rational number, and then exp of, so this is going to be a power series where coefficients are rational numbers, but it's a power series in S and T. And then times. Power series in S and T and then times the motivic beta again. Okay, so the upshot is the coefficient of Bm is something in Q power series in S and T. Okay, so this is different from, well, Laurent series in principle. So, well, sorry, power series in S and T, but we have negative. But this is similar to, if you remember, so I'm just going to go back quickly. Here, when I wrote Here, when I wrote this example, of the zeta, g acts on zeta n, we had coefficients in q, right? So, all we are claiming that if we if we expand, I'm claiming that if I expand, if I expand some sort of an algebraic Mellon transform and then apply the correction term by term, actually I'll get an action via Q and then just adjoined S T. Okay? So, power series in S T, sorry. The theorem is that this always happens for algebraic Mellon transforms. So let LIS be the Taylor expansion of an integral of this shape. For G in the Motivi-Galo group, G acts like this. So G acts, as you can write it as a finite sum of something in K double bracket S, L I. L i k s, this li k s are some other other, so Taylor expansions of some algebraic Melling transforms of some new integrands, omega i. Okay, the upshot is it's a finite sum of the object of the same shape and with coefficients in these power series. Okay, yes, yes. Yes, this happens in this, this is this, this should be, we haven't worked out the Durham projection for Taylor expansions, but this is because beta sort of is a genus zero object. So this is the same reason that you can This is the same reason that you can identify motivic zetas with the Ram zetas up to 2πi. So this is the reason this looks the same, right? If we were to start here with the dimensionally regularized integral, dimensionally regularized sunrise Feynman integral, you wouldn't be able to quite do that. No, no, you just not going to be beta with plus. Be beat up with plugged in, it's not going to be the same object with sort of replacing Duram periods, replacing material periods by Durham periods. It's not going to look exactly the same. It's still going to be, it's still by this theorem, it's still going to look, it's still going to be a power series in Duram periods times a power series in Mativic periods. So that still holds. It's just sort of how do you how you this correspondence is between Mativi and Duram is not there in hygiene in general. Okay. In hygiene in general. Okay. Yes. Is the Taylor expansion of this? Full expansion, like I was, like I was giving, like I was talking, like for the beta, the expansion that I was considering. Okay? N? Which n? N, nothing, just some, some finite integer. The point here is that it's a finite sum. Right. finite sum. Because a priori we get this infinite, if you apply term by term, we get this infinite series, infinite power series in S with coefficients which are these kind of tensor products. I'm saying that actually we can rewrite it as a finite sum of one series, tensor, another series. Okay? So the slogan is the Motivi-Gala group acts on Taylor series of Algebraic Manny transforms via power series. Okay? Back to physics. For G-affement graph, Physics. For Geoffeyman graph, now let's look at, instead of just a parametric Feynman integral, we add this element here, which is, and then expand around epsilon equals zero. This is Dimreg's here. I've included sort of Laurent. We can work with Laurent series, not just Taylor series in this whole thing. So, okay, so we have that expansion, and we want to see what happens when we apply the previous theorem, right? Previous theorem, right? A part of the conjecture of abrobritaudur Guardian Matthew is that the co-action should give us a finite sum where on the left-hand side we have dimensionally regular, again, dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals for some other graphs g k related to this graph G, but not yeah. And on the right-hand side, this is why I said. And on the right-hand side, this is why I say part of this conjecture. On the right-hand side, this should be a power series with coefficients in functions on G mod, but they give an interp in, at least in some cases, one loop, some higher loop cases, and so on, they give an interpretation of this in terms of cut graphs. It's not obvious to me yet how this works. If somebody knows, I'd be happy to learn. Anyway, the theorem in this part of the conjecture is true. Is true. Okay, so there are there are uh there we can in fact if we if we co-act on dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals, that is there yeah on the expansions that we get from that we get again objects of the same sort on the left and then power series in coefficients with coefficients in functions on g mod. There are some subtleties here. First of all, you might ask, well, what are these gk? How do I come up with them if I only These GK? How do I come up with them if I only know G? And there are two things that you need to do. You take subquotients or you add dots. So you either, if you start with a sunrise, you might get objects like this, or you might get objects like this. This is what I mean by that. Okay? So, and you'll have to bear with me a little bit on the, this is an imprecise theorem at this moment. The goal is to give you a This moment, the goal is to give you a precise recipe for this, given a graph G, a precise recipe for what are the GK, right? It's just not quite there yet, but it'll be there soon. And for the number of the added. Yes. And yes. Isn't that the s same same thing? Yeah, the director's like up to some time there. So you agree. And I can do like a double pole and lock equivalent with the dimensions. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, dimension shifts. You can allow dimension shifts, yeah. You can allow dimension shifts, yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. In fact, the shortest formulas you get if you do. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely would do that if I were doing it in practice, but and then leave it to others to choose the dimensions that they like, because it complicates the formulas if you're forcing something in that sense. Yeah. I mean, to me, these, okay, so I should say, to me, these dimension shifts and adding dots, it just means, you know, adding something in the numerator. Adding something in the numerator, and that's fine. Okay. And then the second subtlety, much more complicated, is how do we interpret these Duram periods? Especially beyond Geno zero. In Geno Zero, we can do it. It's not too hard. But so one loop and whatever, things like that. But if we go to something more interesting, like the type of objects that are interesting to people at this conference, then it's more complicated. Okay. Why does it hold? Why does it hold? Ah, yes. Okay, so now we get to the. What's my time? Really well. Less than 30 minutes is far. Oh, lovely. Okay, so I can take my time. Does anybody, okay, so good. Does anybody have questions up to this point? Because we're going to go into more technical stuff. So really, like. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay, so I have a problem. I still, I don't, there is a missing piece in connecting the Ram period, these coefficients of this power series, in connecting those to motivic period. So, what's happening here, what you want, if you, so a cut graph is still an integral. A function on g mod is not an integral. A function on g mod is given in terms of a A function on Gmot is given in terms of a differential form and a dual differential form. So that's not something that's obviously related to some integral, which is a form and a cycle. So in genus zero, there is a prescription called the Duram projection, which associates, if you will, integrals or motivic periods to these functions, right? In some way, up to 2πi, in some way that's very reasonable. So in particular, it sends... Okay, so in particular, it sends an odd zeta, a motivic odd zeta, to a Duram version of that. And so there is a way of thinking of the right-hand side in the same way as we think about the left-hand side, which then you can take the next step and associate that to somehow cuts. Okay? Problem in higher genus is that that map doesn't, it's not there anymore. I could, after this, I could sort of give you an example with the sunrise of how it breaks. Of how it breaks. But there are some choices involved that don't allow you to make that association of motivic periods to these functions on GMOT. And that's a crucial step of understanding what's going on. There's another step, which is understanding cuts in terms of parametric integrals, which actually we don't want to do, because there is a student of Clemence, of Clement DuPont, one of the people on this project, who is working on momentum. Was working on momentum space motives, which will then allow us to write down what a motive for a cut graph is in a much easier way. And then maybe we do some abstract nonsense to relate motives of momentum space and motives of parametric space. And that will give us sort of that connection. Okay? So there's still work to do. Okay, yes. It's a difficult question. So, yeah, people have been thinking about this. I have been thinking about this, but there should be things that one should be able to do, but it won't be the obvious thing that we expect. It won't be. thing that we expect it won't be so yes i guess what part of the answer is it won't look the same as in it won't be a motivic let's say a motivic elliptic elliptic dialogarithm to a diram elliptic dialogarithm it won't look like that right yes there'll be some there'll be some wedges quotients some weird stuff going on uh that that that will give you something that you can then interpret uh in terms of integrals maybe uh or relate to some Maybe, or relate to some integrals up to something that you know. Well, yeah, that's the problem, right? There is so much ambiguity that it doesn't mean anything to make this association at the moment, right? So how do you account for this in some structured way is a bit out there at the moment. I'm sorry, I can be more precise. I can give you an example of exactly what happens with the sunrise and with literally one elliptic curve and like paths on it later if you want. Yeah. Okay, yes. Which subgroup theorem, sorry? Oh, yeah, but that would be exactly. That would be the same. It would exist here as well. In fact, if you have a zeta 3 somewhere anywhere in the expansion, you won't be able to get anything, you won't get anything with more edges or whatever that also involves, you won't be able to get a period that would also involve that in its expansion, which involves the tree in its expansion. So it's the same idea. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Okay, right. So we move now to twisted cohomology. So in order to do this stuff, we want to somehow expand the theory that I explained earlier, which was this Duram and Betty cohomology and cohomology, right? So another slogan, the coaction, hence all algebraic relations on algebraic Mellin transforms. So these integrals that I keep talking about, this is what I'm talking about when I say algebraic Mellin transform, is controlled by Is controlled by twisted homology. Okay, first, let us fix a generic complex number C to relate to some work that's already been done. And consider this integral where we fix S to be some complex number S zero. For each point on sigma, now the problem is that for each point on sigma on this domain of integration, we also need to, in order to make that make sense, we also need the determination of this function f to the s naught, right? Because, well, for each. Right? Because, well, for each point in the domain of integration, you may choose another branch of, if you write this as e to the log of s zero and choose another branch of that log, you may get that this is f to the zero times e to the two pi times s zero, which is some generic complex number, so that's not going to be the same. So we need for each point on sigma to choose a determination of f to the s0, and this is what goes by the name of law. And this is what goes by the name of local systems in mathematics. And I'm going to call that determination. So, this is just an object that contains the information of determinations of f to the s0 over x, where sigma is a cycle on x, okay, the x that I was talking about this whole time. Okay, so this homology group, this is where cycles lived, if you remember, is replaced by this thing, which is just cycles plus choice of branch of f to ds0 on. Of branch of f to ds0 on those cycles, and I just add that l early ls0 there. Yes, good question. Okay. In order to make this work well, you you Well, there is a lemma somewhere where you need to say what kind of things you allow here in order to make the pairings be kind of the things that you want. You're right. There is something around that. There's a subtlety. It's in Francis's and Clement's Loricella paper. There is an example of this, and this will be extended in this paper to work in all of these settings. But yeah, there is something around that. It's true. Okay, so, but let's. Okay, so, but let's try to give the general overview. For the integrands omega, we consider for the integrands now, instead of, so remember, this was defined with just x, this, the algebraic drama homology was defined in terms of, you know, kernel of d of the of the differential of forms on x, modulo, the image of the differential. Here we are going to replace d with this connection. So instead of, so in the connection, sends a form omega to d. sends a form omega to d omega plus s df over f omega. So this is what we call twisting the differential sort of in the definition of the algebraic drama cosmology. So we have added added added some information there as well. Okay, Deline tells us then we have again a perfect pairing. If we extend these things in such a way we have a perfect pairing where a cycle with the determination of f to d as zero pairs with a form. By the way, this form now is closed, but closed under the circle. is closed, but closed under delta. So it's delta omega is zero, not d omega is zero. Okay? And the pairing integrates those two and gives us the thing we wanted. In physics, people have noticed already that this is very interesting. In particular, this gives us IBP relations. The basis of this twisted DRAM homology group is what you would call the basis of master integrands. The basis of master integrands, their intersection pairings, and so on. And here we have a lot of people working on such things, doing some very interesting stuff. Right. So the problem is, however, in order to relate this to our story of expansions, well, unless S0 is in Q, twisted cohomology groups have nothing to do with classical cohomology groups for any y. You can't come up with some y so that you can relate that integral. So, that you can relate that integral to something coming from a perfect pairing of these things. Just to give a counterexample to know what you're talking to me, so you know what I'm talking about: if S0 is a rational number, then you can find some x prime, this is the y here, x prime, such that the twisted cohomology groups, these twisted cohomology groups where s0 is k over n for every k from 0 to n, including this one, I'm assuming this is smaller than n. So those are direct summons of this classic. Direct summons of this classical co-homology group. So, in particular, x prime you get as a fiber product of f, the function we started with, by an n-fold cover of gm, whatever, it doesn't matter. You can come up with some x prime such that your twisted cochlemology group is a direct summoned of a classical cochomology group. This does not happen in general, okay? And that's what we have to deal with. Yes? Yeah. No, no, you can find you're fine. You work with rational numbers, you work with twisted cochomology groups, intersection pairings, all that, all fine. I'm just saying that you can. Yeah, so just think of an example, beta evaluated at two rational numbers, s rational, t rational, can be written as a some as some period on a on a Fermi curve, x to the n plus y to the n. Curve x to dn plus y to d n equals one, whatever. So you would be able to come up with a cycle and write an equivalent of those. All right. So what we need to deal with now is the expansions themselves. And for this, we define an object. And let's try to think of this sort of systematic. To think of this sort of systematically, it's not, it's kind of bottom-up, it's not very complicated. Starting from the integral, we want to come up with some twisted cochomology groups that spit out expansions of this, right? The expansions that I wrote. So these types of things, s to the k integral log k f omega. Right? So we want this to come out of some perfect pairing. This is to come out of some perfect pairing in the same way that we did with the previous two objects. And what we do is: well, instead of looking at just differential forms on x, maybe twisting them, twisting, twisting the differential, we're now going to add a formal variable s. Okay? And we're going to see this object. So by hk, I just mean take the kernel of this modulo, the image of this, in the same way I did before, okay? Same way I did before. Okay. And this we can write as an inverse limit, and I'll explain what I mean of these types of things. So here we have, so okay, so this here, oh, sorry. So this here are polynomials in S up to degree n whose coefficients are forms, algebraic differential forms on x, such that they're close. such that they're cl so in in if they live in this hk they have to be closed under delta s and delta s is given by the same formula we had before d plus s df over f okay so this taking taking the inverse limit means that we have to have some compatibility between these polynomials if you pick some n you have some polynomial with coefficients in differential forms okay and then you look at you truncate one one you truncate s to the n term s to the n term the previous one kind of S to the interim, the previous one kind of has to be in S minus one, the previous object in here has to be that thing that you get by truncation. It kind of has to project back in order for this to make sense. This, you can define, if you're unfamiliar, this is how you can, yes, this is how you can define sort of the ring of power series in terms of the rings of polynomials up to a certain degree, right? So that's all I'm doing. I'm just adding forms as coefficients instead of some elements of a field. Okay, so that looks complicated. So that looks complicated. However, the things inside here, these truncated, these polynomials, these kind of things which are polynomials in forms, they come from something motivic, meaning they come from something classically geometric. So some cohomology groups like this, something like HK to DX that we're trying to go back to in some way. So, okay, so this is a bit vague, but bear with me. Let me try at least to say something. Let me try at least to say something. So, these objects come from what's called the motivic fundamental group of Gn. This has been studied by Gontrov and Fain and whatever, all of these very grand people. And this, okay, so the key point is that this can be expressed in terms of classical cohomology groups. So no twist here. For some pair of spaces X, D, D is a subspace of X in this case. Subspace of x in this case. The periods of this are, if you do this, this is very vague. What I say here, what I say here, it goes by the name of Baylin's construction. If anybody wants to look it up, how do you relate this to this? And how do you come up with X and D to relay those things? It turns out that if you write then these cochomology groups and you write their periods in the classical way that I did at the beginning of the talk, you get all powers of log. Okay? So this contains all powers of logs. This contains all powers of logs, and those will, for us, do the job of accounting for these powers of logs in our power series. That's how that goes. In particular, that S that's been appearing everywhere is a generator of the cohomology of Gn dual. So the cohomology of Gm is generated just by DX over X. The Ramcohomology of X is generated by DX over X. S is just the dual of DX over X, which explains why it has to be scaled by lambda minus 1 at the By lambda minus one at the very beginning. Okay? There is also a Betty version of this thing where we replace forms with, again, cycles with some determinations. And this, again, has to have some sort of property that, some sort of projection property to fit into an inverse sum like this, an inverse limit like this. And it gives a perfect pairing that's valued in In, well, Laurent series in S. Okay? Oh, sorry. So this is really the object that gives us S periods. So these are the objects that I was just discussing with these inverse limits. And their periods, the objects of their periods, the objects that come out of the perfect pairing of the RAM and Betty in this setting are these Laurent series. Are these Laurent series of this shape? Okay, on the other hand, we talked earlier about this traditional twisted cohomology in all of this literature, Japanese literature, Misera, our friend Pokraka here, and all the other people. Those are these objects. I haven't quite related them, if you'll notice. I haven't said why should. So, the claim of the main theorem is that the coaction here in this setting somehow looks the same as the coaction here. It's kind of bizarre. Here. It's kind of bizarre. There is no connection between these two objects a priori. But there is, of course. And what you do is kind of obvious. You don't need to be to figure out what you need to do. You need to replace this S naught in the first setting of the traditional statistical homology with some formal parameter S that you can then expand around. Because if you fix a complex number, you can't expand around. It's not a function of S, you can't expand. Okay. And that's something that I'm not going to go into in this talk. Something that I'm not going to go into in this talk. Unless people are interested, we can discuss it later. We need to define a third kind of twisted cohomology, which we call formal global twisted cohomology. Basically, the results of its intersection pairings are integrals like this, where s is a formal variable. These things are very interesting. The Duram version of this is, so the version with forms of this is a D module. of this is a d module um we we've proved what it is a d module what how it's related to d modules it's a it's an algebraic melling transform of some well actually it's an algebraic melling transform of some d module and and and so these things uh uh encode difference and differential equations um of um of these types of algebraic mellin transforms so they're very they're very interesting to study and then there are two other theorems which tell you how to go from here to here so From here to here. So basically, you tensor this thing with power series. Essentially, you tensor this with tower series, and you get something isomorphic to this. So that's one thing to prove. So that corresponds to taking this integral and expanding around s equals zero. Or you tensor it with, well, with some field whose, with the field sort of k parentheses. K parentheses, k adjoined s0, where s0 is a particular complex number, which then is isomorphic, which will be isomorphic to this. So, so a generic part of this is isomorphic to this. And similarly, when you expand, it's isomorphic to this. So, this also has a non-generic part, a sort of a, it can have a version and so on. So, it's a more complicated object, contains more information. So, it's a more complicated object, contains more information than either of those two. Okay, that's kind of the final picture I wanted to leave with you. There are these three kinds of twisted cohomology. They control, so I mean this one really does, controls this action of the Galois group and therefore the relations between algebraic Melling transforms. And it, yeah, it's really that these things, these objects are related in such a way. Again, this was studied quite a lot. This was not studied, except in the algebraic Mellon transform theory for this. Algebraic Mellon transforms for D modules. I mean, this is the. Okay, so that's all I have. Thank you for your patience. Yeah, thanks a lot for a beautiful endeavor talk. And let's go on with more questions. That I can do what we call like the include the extra part. I studied the working on my function. So I I do a lot of expansion by integral and then I started the collection average metric functions for results and then this field is going to work. Okay, the good good question. So I would argue that this, okay, so the way this looks to me is that Me is that I was going to say us, but no. The way this looks to me is that what is currently missing in the coaction community outside of pure mathematics is the appreciation that the geometry really matters. In the following sense, in that the collection, as far as I understand, has been studied pretty much by degenerating to the genus zero case. By degenerating to the genus zero case and applying the Gontrov coex. What we are, and then extrapolating from that for various things, for DIMREG, for whatever. However, I would argue that it's important to put in this business of geometry, X, into all of this and really appreciate how things become more complicated for the coaction once you move away from genus zero, which is kind of the point of this conference, and genus one. And this And this is a formalism which allows you to incorporate that stuff. So it allows you to incorporate the data of the geometry and really not kind of not wing it, let's say. I have nothing against experimental mathematics, right? I'm just saying there will be you at some point, at some loophole, you will run into inconsistencies. I would argue probably sooner rather than later, right? And this allows you to really, if one was to understand this language, To really, if one was to understand this language, well, you know, you can, or whatever, however, you prefer, you could then study the collection really with all the information it has inside of it. So the mativic collection, let's say, instead of all of these ad hoc coactions that people have been coming up with. I mean, your choice, what you'd like to do. This is just the correct framework to incorporate the geometric information. And I would say, so I understand, so to go back to Matt, his advice. His advice of we he's his idea of you know we want to preserve as much of a polylogarithmic structure as possible to higher genus. I get that. I would also say that there are definitely new things that are going to happen. So always sticking to just the polylogarithmic framework is maybe not the most productive way to do things. So yeah, this is an offer to think about more complicated geometries. Yes. But on that point, I do understand your Point. I do understand if you're saying that's the framework, but there would still be choices that you could make to be made. Let's say I encounter some cloud fourfold on which my five will live. Are you saying that if I could work through this, I'd get a unique co-active? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, so the question so the okay, so good, good, oh, actually, excellent question. So in the class. Excellent question. So, in the classical story, so for HK of X, you know, in the classical motival group, there's only one, there's this motivational, this, this action and co-action, they come from the fact that this, that these, that motives form a Tanachin category. That's sort of how you say it in a fancy way. What it means is these things are, the category of these objects is a category of representations of a group, and it's one group. The Tanaka theorem says this is the group, right? This is the group, right? And this is how it acts, right? So the action is well defined. There is no choices. This extends that. So all three of these settings can be formed 10 acting categories. They have their own motivic Galois groups, except not classical motivations. This would be called a Mellin Galo group or something like that. And for each of these settings, you would get unique current. A unique, correct sort of canonical co-action. Okay. This one looks a bit, this one has been set up actually. The technical kind of, if you want to see it, is in is in the Laurie Sheller paper of Brown and DuPont. And they explain kind of how it's related to this one. But without this picture, it's not really, like, it's very ad hoc. It's very specific to genus zero and it doesn't look particularly great. The correct thing to do is to look at this. The correct thing to do is to look at this color group, really, and then deduce, you know, specialize S when you want to do that. So, again, coaction is canonical in the classical setting. This extends it to a canonical co-action for these twisted settings. Further questions? What would be your favorite? What would be your favorite Genus1 toy example of such integrals, like the Genus1 analog of Euler beta function, for instance? I played around with the sunrise. So I don't know what the favorite, I don't have a, like something that's not, yeah, I was inspired by the sunrise. And I can, one can write down the, one can write down the basis of this for the sunrise or something like that. And you could, you could, from, from this story, you would kind of know what the collection should look like. I didn't write it down. Should look like I didn't write it down, but yeah, yes, yeah, an infinite number of s orders or epsilon orders in the sunrise for which you deduce a collection formula or which you could deduce. Yeah, so for a collection formula that comes out of this story, it gives like works for two all orders because of what I just the main theorem, right? It says for this, for this, for any expansion like this, in particular, the epsilon expansion, you know, I mean, the coaction. I mean, the co-action is the co-action of the Motor Vigalo group through these power series. So, yeah, you get the whole thing. Yeah. Would Riemann-Dörtinger also work in principle? The what, like? The Riemann-Döttinger integral. I'm not familiar with it. I'm sorry. We can talk about it later. I'll be happy to see what. If there are no further questions, then let's thank Mattia again.
