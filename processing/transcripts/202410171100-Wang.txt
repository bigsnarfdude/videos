Thank you, Dan, for the introduction. So, my topic is about its Parthian version of valuations, and this is a joint work with Hong Di Wang, Tangxing, and James. Both of them are here. So, at the beginning of this year, I kind of like have a small goal for myself, like to add a little bit of AI flavor to every talk of this year. Talk of this year, so that I came up with the first slide. So, let me talk about the whole structure of the talk. So, I will talk a little bit about motivations, how we define valuations based on some works in non-commuted geometry. And I gave you the formal definition and talk about a very special kind of valuation called phaseful Poisson valuation. I have some links to actually coming from. To actually coming from the first part links to arting conjectures. And at last, I talk about a main application of these valuations, mainly say how to use these valuations to compute automorphism groups of certain Poisson algebras. So maybe we should start with the first slide. Now, before we approach forward to define Poisson valuations, I thought that might be a good idea. I thought that might be a good idea to move backward to evaluate the values of valuations in the theme that we value so much this time. So that's I came up with the first few slides. So I know all of them are trivial to you, but forgive me to have some time to talk through. So non-commutative projective algebra geometry arose in the 1980s through Artine Schaulder-Tate Vandenberg's classification of The Vandenberg's classification of nowadays, so-called S regular algebras, and they can be thought as the coordinate rings of the non-commutative projectives that we see in previous talks. And also, they have relations with a collabial algebra, which are introduced by Ginsberg to transport the geometry of the collabial manifold to a non-committee algebra. To non-committee algebra charge. So our definition of valuations is motivated by Artin's conjecture. So maybe I think I will take a little bit more slides to talk about it. And also we'll see later how the connection between them. So actually in 1995, Artin spoke on an Oslander conference where he presented some problems on three-dimensional grid domains. Great domains. And the main idea of his talk is to expand the well-known bi-rational classification of project surface to the non-commuted project surfaces. And so at that time, Artin has a list. We'll see the list later. I'm not going to give it now, but he had a list that he saw that if the graded non-community domains are nice enough, satisfy some nice conditions, then all their division. Then, all their division rings should be within this list. And that's now formally as the Artin's conjecture. So, Artin's conjecture is arguably probably the most important open questions in non-commutable projective geometry, and various methods are proposed to do that. And I think up to the nowadays standard, it remains still wide open. Uh, still wide open. So, I want to give you this. I always call it the so-called golden triangle that how to support the relation between three different areas. So if we start with the first triangle, that's the classical birational geometry of surfaces. And if you look at its non-commuted version, we're talking about we're ending up with the right triangle called division rings. Right triangle coordination rings of transcendental degree two. And what we are focusing now in the sort of like the middle part between these two are Parson world. So make analogous of what we're treating there. We have the corresponding objects, which are Parson fields of transcendental degree two. So these are classical fields in the number theory, but they also have a branch. But they also have a bracket which has some, like, how to say, inherits some non-commutativities from the non-commuted algebraic charge. Okay, I think now it's time to give you the definition of what is Poisson valuations. And I still remember this Monday afternoon, Jason suggests that might be a quicker way to do any talk on Poisson algebra just by talking about something not Poisson. By talking about something not person, and I don't add the word passion everywhere later. I think I'm following his suggestion at least for this part. Okay, so Parsoon bracket, let me give you a background. So, Poisson bracket was introduced by French mathematician Saint Parson. The original goal is to express some equations of Hamiltonian mechanics in a coordinate-free formula. And if you take the right golden triangle. The right golden triangle, at least before, now it's translated to something like the following triangles. So, right top is algebraic geometry. We're doing commutative algebras. If you add a non-commutative flavor to that, you arrive at non-commutative algebraic geometry. And you can talk about the middle part, zoom between them called Poisson geometries. And we like to do the algebraic version. To do the algebraic version of that, so many were doing Parcel algebra. So now, right, with the story of Parcel brackets, actually, if you translate it using a standard English dictionary, they also call the fish brackets. And it was actually appear in one of Parson's thesis. So I actually took a picture of his, how to say his. His, how to say, his background from the Wikipedia. And I think that might be a good idea. Also, for this slides, I'm doing something AI. So I basically type a picture of Parson in AI and generate the next picture for him. I hope it's better than the previous picture. So next, I'm going to give Next, I'm going to give you the running example of relate to all the topics of properties I'm talking about today. So, we are specifically interested in the following example. So, take A as a commutative algebra, which is standard polynomial ring in three variables. And we take an element in A we call omega. Then, out of this omega, we can build up a Poisson bracket, which I denote. Bracket, which I denote here, the bracket between two polynomials, is a Jacobi determinant of Fg plus this fixed polynomial omega. And sometimes this bracket is also called a Jacobian structure on A. And omega is called potential. And it's very easy to check that omega is actually lies in the center of this Poisson algebra. The center Poisson algebra. The center, I just mean least center, but turned out to be a algebra sub-algebra as well. So I will denote this Poisson structure by pi omega. So when you see pi omega, it just means pick omega and consider the Jacobian structure on the three-dimensional polynomial. And since omega lies in the center, I can consider this quotient. So I use p omega just denote its quotient, which is also a Poisson algebra because omega is in the Poisson center. Because omega is in the Poisson center. Oh, too quick. So the case we are interested is when omega is homogeneous. In this case, we have a grading both for the multiplication and the Lie bracket. So we call A omega and its quotient P omega graded Poisson algebra, where the grading refers both to the multiplication and Poisson bracket. Python bracket. So now let's say what is a valuation. So I just copy from the standard book for any valuation you can find. So let K be any field. Now it's a commutative field. And sometimes called discrete valuation, but every valuation in my talk appeared to be discrete. So I just use valuation for that. So a valuation on K is just a set map. Using V denotes that. So it's a set map. Denotes that. So it's a set map from k to integer plus infinity with some properties we have to follow. There are three of them. First is a number only can be signed to the infinity if zero. So another way you will see for alternative definition is from the invertible element in k to z and sine infinity to zero. They are same. And it has a nice property which changed from addition to model. addition to multiplication to addition. So if you take the product to valuate it, it's same as first valuate z plus. The third property is like the degree cannot too small. So if you evaluate the sum of two, it cannot be less than the minimum of these two elements valuation. And for most of our talks, we are going to work with a base field k. So when that happens, Base field K. So when that happens, we always assume the valuation on Z, the invertible element in this base field K is zero. So it's usually called a valuation from K slash little K. And actually, the third condition, which I referred before, that the degree of the valuation value cannot jump, you can deduce more, say more about that. It's actually if the two AB valuations are the same, always pick the lowest. Same, you always pick the lowest, and we will see that how it means if we use a different description very soon. And also, out of the valuation come with the discrete valuation ring, which is central, right, in the birational geometry of at least the project curves. So, we take all the elements which have positive valuation, maybe with zero as well, then it becomes a standard called dvr. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, please. First line, which line is the second line? Oh, it's infinity. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Do you have any other questions? Okay, so let us look at some standard examples to I call it its warm-up time. So let's Q be the rational numbers and I will take a prime P. Now, the valuation the NA number theory would like to consider is the so-called p-adic valuation and you complete, you get the complete local ring. So you take n a integer, you can write as powers of some fractional. P's powers of some fractionals m over n, where m and n are not divisible by p, then the piece adding valuation just taking the possible power of p there. And it's easy to check is a valuation called mu p. That's one example. The other example is maybe I already said it is from the projective algebraic geometry: is if you take a complex project curve and for every smooth. Curve and for every smooth point you look at the local ring, it's naturally a DVR. And the associated valuation is just given by you pick a uniform miser for the local ring, then you take the possible power and read it as the valuation. Okay. Now we can add Poisson, as we said before, to the valuation. So what is a Poisson valuation? Poisson valuation, if we consider k as a Poisson field, it is a valuation underlying valuation, but we need one more property. Now, the property is a definitive, this gives us something which respect to the bracket, right? So that's our proposal for the bracket. So if you take valuation on the bracket, it's always greater or equal to the sum of two values a, b. And we'll see that this definition. And we'll see that this definition works out, at least for the examples we are considering. And for the sake of notation, why not just take capital VK as the valuation of all on K? Now I want to give you another definition of valuation, which is equivalent, but it gives us more control of really valuation means, especially in terms of computing them. So the next definition is using. The next definition is using filtrations. So, I think we are going to review what is filtration, and as a usual trick, we add Poisson to everywhere. So, what is the filtration or algebra A? Now, when you say filtration, that's two choices of them. One is decreasing filtration, the other is increasing. And might some of you prefer increasing. I strongly want to increasing, but because the classical definition of valuation here. Definition of valuation here, we have to choose decreasing filtrations. So, in terms of language, filtration on algebra A has several properties. One of them is the unital property. One belongs, the unit of A belongs to the first, the zero filtration, but not the first. Algebraic filtration, which is anticipated, multiply two filtration. Multiply two filtration lands in the right degree of the filtration. Third one, separate means if you take a complete ring, you don't lose anything. So the intersection is zero. A fourth one is you capture everything by your filtration, so-called exhaustive. The last one is Poisson. So, how are you going to add Poisson to the filtrations? You have to be well-behaved with respect to the bracket, the fish bracket. So, if you take bracket. So, if you take bracket between two filtrations, it lands in the right degree. Okay. So, now out of filtration, the standard techniques for filter algebras and certainly for filter Poisson algebra, you take the associated gradering. So, that's the next slide we're all about. So, I start with the Poisson domain because I want to consider valuation. So, a priori is everything in the domain. Priori is everything in the domain. Then, if we have a filtration of the Poisson algebra A, here I think filtration already means Poisson filtration. Then we can do the standard associate-aided grade ring construction just by taking quotients of all the consecutive filtrations, add them together from all the index. And this one is denoted by grade FA. F denotes the filtration, grow means you're taking the version process. In the version process. And this we can give it a Poisson bracket to make it a so-called greater Poisson algebra. And the process is exactly the same we did for the algebra structure. You take two elements in the corresponding quotients. You just take their representative and make the bracket work over there. And it's a direct check that this makes a greater possible bracket. And we have a notion so-called good versus. So-called good versus evil. So, what is good? Good filtration means a social group ring is still a domain. I leave you the exercise to define what is evil. So the next result gave us the so-called alternative choice for Python valuations. So I tried to summarize in the picture, but I'm going to take some time to explain. Going to take some time to explain what's going on there. So, if A is a Poisson domain, I want to say the fractional field is K. So, one thing which I didn't say is that if you have Poisson domain, the bracket naturally extends uniquely to the field. So, the fractional field now is a Poisson field. Then, we can consider valuation in three perspectives. So, first is the valuation on A. So, you take the, though, I have to say. So you take the though, I have to say a little bit though, the definition is defined on fields, but you can do it on any Poisson domain. So take the same definition, but restrict to A. The right corner means the usual definition on a Poisson field, and there's a one-to-one correspondence with them. And the correspondence is given, labeled in corresponding arrows there. And on the left vertex is the good filtrations. Good filtrations we defined just in the previous slides, and also there's one-to-one correspondence. So, maybe that way I should explain a little bit more. So, if you have a good filtration, you can assign a valuation for A just by taking A, the principal part in the grade-associative gradient, and take the degree. And vice visa, if you have a valuation, you can define a filtration just by taking all the element which has. Taking all the elements which have values greater than i. And it's a direct check that these two concepts now coincide. So instead of using valuations on A or its fractional field, we can think about them in terms of good filtrations. And that helps a lot when we consider the application. That's why it's kind of like a fundamental lemma in our research. Yeah, I think as long as you consider invaluations, it's unique. Yeah, at least because K A is always a sub ring of K, so you just restrict to A, that's unique. Restrict to A, that's unique. And if you go backward, you write a quotient because the property we have for the valuation, the quotient valuation, is a summation, subtraction. But are you talking about the projective case? Where we are in the alpha case, I don't know, maybe that makes it unique. Yeah, maybe we can talk about later. Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure, but yeah, we definitely can talk about later. Okay, and we denote the associated grade ring respect to the valuation as simply denote by rho mu A. Then the next result is if Then the next result is: if we are in landing in the setting of graded Poisson domains, okay, then there are only two valuations associated to the grading. And we will use it later as new plus or minus. So the u plus identity, just reading the degrees of A, basically the lowest degree of A, if you write A as sum of homogeneous P's. And the And the lower part, the other opposite degree, is you're reading the highest degree, but we flip the degree. And because it's a great part zone domain, it's easy to check these are well-defined valuations. So one consequence of that, if you treat greater ones, you already have two valuations. So the main problem is whether you have more, and that is up to our calculation. So the next one is with So, the next one is: we want to define a little bit more on Poisson valuations. So, we define what is a phaseful Poisson valuation, which is a subset of the valuation we defined before. And previously, actually, we want to use a name called the prime valuation, just trying to match with the prime dividers they considered in the non-commercial world. But later, James suggests that maybe since he might have some other things. Since he might have some other thing in his mind, so using the faceful. And we always have faceful in James' suggestion, so I think it's a good name. So what's the actual condition for faceful? They actually add three more. First, the valuation of mu has to be subjective. So everything in the image can hit the whole thing z plus infinity, which hits by zero. And also, we want the degree to be nice. So you take the social grade ring, you take the GK dimension. Social grade ring, take the GK dimension that will match with the transcendental degree of K. And most time we're not equal to, but if we equal to, that's exactly the faithfulness we want to. And the third one is uniquely Poisson. We want the bracket on the search degree ring is K, is non-zero. Remember, when you have a Poisson filtration, which comes from the valuations, then we can take a search degree ring. Then we can take a social degree ring and we can define a bracket. So the things we care about is: I don't want the induced bracket to be vanished. So that's the third condition. And if you set up all the three conditions, we call it faithful. And so, and I have a subset of capital VK, which remains all the faithful ones. And that is some definite or proper subset of all the valuations we have. So now we also want to abuse our language a little bit, as we already did for the Python valuations. We say evaluation is faithful, not in the field, but in the domain, if it is faithful when you extend to the fractional field. Then I want to work with one simple example, okay, just concerning the running examples we have. And I want to use Examples we have, and I want you to see how to compute the faceful valuation so you have some idea how the things work. So, take the original three variable polynomial. Omega is cubic potential. Here, cubic is two, then for sure, the bracket is graded. So, take a degree three, and I want the product of A omega is smooth. So, with only isolated singularities, and the valuation we consider is the quotient. We consider is the quotient. So it's basically the high of the surface in Morris' talk, right? The over omega. So let's compute the valuations on this portions. So first thing is I want to do some concrete calculations. So I have to bring to a standard form. I know the most standard form for the curve are well stressed form, but as a non-commuter, we like high. As a non-commuter, we like HESA forms a little bit better. So I'm running in the HESA forms, just three cubic sum plus a tail turn, three lambda XYZ. And being smooth means the cubic of lambda cannot equals negative. Just get out of the singular cubics. Then the key idea for computing valuation is trying to figure out what the valuations on the generators and to show that if you know the valuation on the generators, you're going to. Valuation on the generators, you're going to know everything, just like in the graded case. So let's figure out what the valuations on the generators and arbitrary can be A, B, C. But how to do after that is using the last condition regarding the Poisson bracket. So the bracket of fxy by the Jacobian structure is very easy to figure out is 3z squared plus 3 lambda xy. And if you take the valuation on both sides using some properties, Both sides using some properties, you get a plus b less than 2c. 2c is a valuation on 3z square. Here, we definitely use the fact the v is vanishing on little k. So v3 is 0. And this part is using the inequalities we define as the Poisson valuations. And this is symmetrical, right? So instead of using x, y, I can use y, z, I can use z, x, and it gives us two more additional inequalities. And by the condition, Inequalities. And by the condition, the valuations image is subjective. We immediately get the three values has to be one or negative. Now, the next part is the most crucial part, is to answer the question if whether the information on the generators is good enough for us to do valuation on every set. And that is formula can be formulated using the filtration. So we have two filtrations: one filtration coming from the valuations, the other is so-called. The valuations, the other is so-called induced filtration. So, you assume degree on the NF monomial just by extending multiplicative. And then, usually, a natural map from the induced one to the real filtration, a circle ring. And the key is to prove it's an isomorphism. Once they isomorphism, you know they are the same. So, here we have to use a little bit of fact about for sure we have to use it. It's a smooth cubic. And some good result, I think, is from. Some good results, I think, is from Lemonoff and Uberieff. They show that this quotient Poisson algebra is always projective simple. Means if you have a homogeneous Poisson ideal, it has to be zero or cofinite. So using this fact and also the conditions on three or two, we get that that is always an isomorphic, means knowing valuation on the generators that determines everything. So as a fact that this quotient part. This quotient Poisson algebra only has two valuations. I think here we definitely use the fact that the valuations on the algebra is good enough on the fractional field. So maybe we should discuss a little bit, but I believe it is one-to-one correspondence at least for now. Okay, so now we go back to the original motivation we had from the non-commutative geometry that the how to how to say. How to say, assemble, how to say, stimulates from the original Parthian conjecture. So, actually, we did a little bit more than the example we did in our rounding example. We are trying to compute all the fields we like to know. So, there are several transcendental degree two-point fields. We give the names according to their quantization, I should say. The Poisson field, the skew field, the greater version of elliptic curves, elliptic type or. Elliptic curves, ellip type omega, smooth projected curve with genus greater than three. So the last part is pretty general. You have to take a cubic curve which has genius greater than three. The genus one is the ellipse curve, right? And we just do the same trick we did following what we did in the running example. Take more time, but the picture is complete. We have different valuations there. There. And you can see the numbers are different. And the black we consider are just given by some potentials omega, right? We just choose different omegas. And these two are not coming from omegas, but they are coming from S regular dimension too. So one consequent of this, which is also the original Artin's idea for introducing prime dividers, is we can differ these skill fields by reading from their valuation. Reading from their valuations because they have different valuations. So, one immediate consequence we can tell these Poisson fields are not isomorphic, right? I don't know if it's an easy job to show, but without using valuation, it probably take a little bit more work to show they are not isomorphic. Because you have all these rational maps, how can you show that not a rational map from one to the other? We speak the puzzle practice. So, that's some consequence we can know from computing the puzzle brackets. Brackets. And also, now that's the time to actually see Arting's original list. And we see that pretty like the same because the one we consider just the semi-classical limits. So we expect that to be similar in some sense. So we have the wild field, the skew field, the greater version of ellip time. It's basically the scanning algebra divided by the omega. And also we can consider the ellipse. And also, we can consider the ellip type. And in non-chemical geology, there's one class which right now parents don't have the Poisson analog is these birational PIs. Because I think when you want to emulate what's happening in the PI case, you have to move to characteristic P. So that's some part we don't know. But other than that, all the prime value, faithful valuation, the prime divider examined. The prime divider exactly matches each other. So it's like they have a very good analog in the Poisson world as well. Okay. So now we go to the last part. I want to show that using Poisson valuation is beyond which is known in non-community geometry. Actually, the same idea can be made in the non-committee world as well. But I want to, at least in the Poisson world, you can do something more. Poisson world, you can do something more just telling the distinguished different Poisson fields by counting the number of valuations. So that drive more topic we can talk about, but I'm fixing this topic called automorphisms. I'm showing how to show you how to use Poisson valuations to compute automorphism groups. So the main question about automorphism groups is if I'm given by a Poisson algebra, A, right? Algebra, A, right? How are you going to compute the four automorphine groups of alter PA? Now, the same question can be asked for all sorts of algebras, right? We're focusing on the Poisson case. Now, what is the Poisson automorphine groups? I want to say a little bit more. So it's the algebraic automorphism of A, and the same time is the Lie automorphism. So if you take the bracket, apply the automorphism, same as apply the automorphism to two components and bracket it. Into two components and bracket it. Okay. So I want to still go back to the running example we have for the cubic ones. And there's a very nice result in 28 by Lemonoff, Tourus, Berko, Wa and Ubiyev. They actually computed the four automorphism groups of A omega, and it can be summarized as follows. First is they show First is they show that every possible automorphism of A omega is automatically graded. Grading means preserving the degree of A as an algebra. Second, since it's graded, it's easy to check. It's a subgroup of GL3. So the actual computer in details is a finite group, the semi-product of a group, diagonal groups with the cyclic group of C3. So that's what they get. So, what we did is trying to sync something with higher genius. Okay, so now I will say the result we get. So, take A as a polynomial of three variables. Omega is a homogeneous polynomial of degree greater or equal to five. So, yeah, the genius is greater than three, but embedded in P2. Then, also we assume the project is smooth. The project is smooth because the singularity actually plays a big role by controlling the automorphism and the valuation. So we have to throw out these being smooth. Then we have two properties. Actually, we can say a little bit more just than the automorphism. So we have all the automorphism are the same. From left to the right, I will introduce them individually. So on the very left side, that's the automorphism of the Poisson field. So Q means take a fractional field. Q means take a fractional field. So we take it automorphisms. So we can say all the birational maps between the Poisson variety. And the other one is the original Poisson automorphism group with the three dimensional variables. The third member of this family is a quotient, hypersurface, Poisson hypersurface, the quotient ring, and the last one is the graded ones. So we prove that every automorphine is graded. Automorphism is graded, and also the fractional field and the original partial algebra have the same automorphism. And also, we want to get a little bit more hints on what the automorphine looks like. So, actually, consider the sequence of automorphine groups. The left side is a quotient, but I'm quotient not by omega, but more general for omega minus C. C is the number. The right side is the automorphism group in the first. Automorphism group in the first line. The right side is taking the determinant end up with a k cross. And this is an exactly sequence of automorphism groups. And using this automorphism group, we can bound the order of the automorphism by the following formula. It's actually coming from the Hoori's automorphism theorem by smooth curves. So that's how we get it to the bound. So every time it's a finite group. So, every time it's a finite group. Yeah, that's a good point. Thank you for your questions. Anyway, I'll say the reason is our argument failed in degree four. So, we guess that works, but you'll see that why the machine went wrong. Yeah, if I have time. Okay, so the idea for this is we are taking a bit more step than valuation. Bit more step than valuations, we want to get a so-called W valuation. The reason is when you do a semi-classical limit, there's a parameter you can choose to look at how deeper your commutative is, right? The same thing reflects in the Poisson bracket. So we want to absorb that information in the definition. So if I take an integer omega, we can say a W evaluation just by throw W here. So one thing you can W here. So, one thing you can see that is the more bigger W is, the more non-commutativity you will see in the deformation quantization. It's like the very unique thing in the Poisson world. You can detect the commutativity by adding omega there. And we say there's V omega k as the collection of all Poisson W valuations. Now we make the same phase four definition by taking phase. By taking faith in Jan's suggestion. So, what is the faithful? Is everything the same? But you just say instead of consider the homogeneous grading, because you take the W grade Poisson bracket, which means that the bracket you defined in the circular ring is not homogeneous of degree zero. The ring is because the bracket now is different from omega. So, the right notion to take is take the w greater. To take is take the W graded bracket, means the grading is homogeneous of degree w. Okay, and I want that w graded bracket now. Everything else is there. Then we use VFW to be the collection, a sub-collection of all the W valuations, which appear to satisfy the previous three conditions. And the key idea is to get some invariant out of these valuations. When you define something, it's good to consider. When you define something, it's good to consider what kind of invariant associated to these things. So this we came up with a definition called a gamma omega cap. So it's defined to be you take all the possible W valuations, you take the correct down filtration, you intersect the positive part and see how many things will always stay positive. It's like taking the DVRs, right? You take everything that positive. But instead of considering one valuation, you consider all the valuations. All the valuations. That's kind of like the algebraic invariant immediately coming from the definition. So, and we have some easy lemmas to how to assist our computations. So, I summarize as following lemma. FK to Q is a Poisson homomorphism from two Poisson fields. Then, by the definition, we see that any Poisson homomorphism will map for the W cap of K to W cap. W cap of k to w cap of q. So it sends the invariant here to there by restricting to every double. And this just coming from the definition, because if you have a valuation on q, you can call back to k. So after that, you have a subset of q valuation coming from k from q, then you just take the intersection. So the first one is almost like falling from the definition. The next one is. Definition. The next one is also falling from the definition: the more omega have, the more deeper information you're trying to get from the bracket. That means you are decreasing chain of invariants. And you always have K there, because as I said, K is valid at zero. So you always contain K, but it's a decreasing sequence. The last one is kind of like crucial, is kind of reconstructing theorem from Parson field. If you start with Poisson field is if you start with the normal Poisson domain, if you take the first W equal to one, then the W cap of the fractional field lies into A. So if you want to apply that, the most important thing to show is actually equality, right? If you use equality, unit one, you see every automorphism on the fraction field restrict to A. So that's actually the key idea we get. So that's actually the key idea we get. And maybe a quick answer to your question is that if omega has degree equal to four, that one wouldn't hold. So that's where I'll take a breakout. That's actually, you'll see in the next slide very soon. So let's A to be a polynomial with three variables, and I take omega be a homogeneous of degree equal, greater or equal to phi, and also smooth. I take P C. P as right portions where I have a parameter K there. So if K0 is just the greater version we considered before, but we need some variations minus KC okay. So what we did is for every omega greater than five, there's a unique valuation, but not in zero valuation, but it's actually degree omega minus three valuation. That's a unique one. And that valuation, if you take the And that evaluation, if you take the negative part valuation, is just the linear space plus k. And that's very important because we know automorphism fixed the valuation. So, immediate consequence is every automorphism is linear by computing this possible valuations. The next one is if omega is between one and the degree omega minus four, the w variation actually equal to the to the fraction field equal to that. And that bound makes if omega is. Bound makes if omega is 4, it just breaks out. So we don't know that what happens in omega 4, but we guess it might work. Just that gamma invariant doesn't work. And also you can do the same thing for the quotient. So now that's almost the second last my slides, but this slides may be a little bit more detailed. So I may take a little bit explanation. I may take a little bit explanation how we get to the main result. Okay, so first I'm using the first gamma cap for omega of degree greater than phi. By the previous result, we know that the gamma one invariant of the fractional field equals to algebra. So a consequence of that is every automorphism in the fractional field can be restricted to the gamma one invariant, which is exactly the automorphism. Is exactly the automorphism on A omega, so we get the fractional automorphism equals to the automorphism of A omega. That's how we came from the fractional field upon 2A. The next argument is to argue that the automorphism is actually linear. And that's also using such unique valuation that whose negative one filtration is exactly the linear space. Exactly the linear space. Since we can pull back valuations through remaps, that means that every value automorphism will fix this linear space. In another way, we say every automorphism is linear. But we have to do a little bit more because graded is more restricted than linear, right? So what we do is using the smoothness of omega to show if you have linear automorphism, the k cannot appear, which is basic from the definition with no singularities. So we can get So we can get the second argument: the automorphism of this P omega is the same as gradient automorphism of A omega. The next one is to argue that these two are the same. And we need more arguments. So let me show you the following key lemma to show that why every automorphism of the original one passed to the hypersurface. One direction is clear. If you have an automorphism of A omega, Have an automorphine of A omega, you always can pass down to the automorphine of the projector surface omega. The key thing that why every automorphism then can pull back here. So, and that's exactly the following lemma we have. So, it can do a little bit general. So, let's A to be a polynomial ringing n variables. Omega is a homogeneous polynomial with n isolated singularities, and that's the condition we need. So, suppose you take a automorphism of the polynomial. Automorphism of the polynomials. And we have the following three conditions. And you can easily show if you know that one is graded. You can take a composition with automorphism here to make at least the form of the possible lifting satisfy these three conditions. First is fixed omega. If you quotient of omega is identity. The third one is that if you quotient out an arbitrary C, An arbitrary KC, which Kc is not zero, you are linear. Then you can show that this automorphism has to be identity. Since I'm teaching communicative algebra this semester, now I have an idea, probably assign this at home to my student this semester. So here you use the property is isolated singularity. So probably you use the Kazoo complex to prove it. But it's Do it. Then, by uniting this, you can show everyone here, just below uniting this. Oh, yeah, that's a good question. So, linear is actually, I think I can explain the slide, is to look at the space of this, right? If I'm greater means I'm making XYZ to XY itself, because they are the same degree, meaning that I only preserve the futures rather than the degree. Rather than the degree. So XYZ can be mapped to anything of the same degree for one less than. And if you have this properties, the future. So in the category of futures. Yeah. Then let me explain the last line how to bound the automorphism groups. So we look at the singular chart. So we look at the similar tricks we did for the three-dimensional one is you can embed the automorphine groups to the automorphine of the and there will be some kernels which given by the d minus three multiplicity group in k cross and we know this one has a finite degree if omega has genus greater than one right so that and we can use the fouried automorphism theorem which have a boundary over here Which have a boundary over here plus something extra and give a bound output. And that's the whole idea how we get the boundary of every automorphic. Mainly because the geometry of the hypersurface of it. And the last slide is contradict to my students because currently I just have a student defending her oral exam and I really like her last slide. So I'm going to use her last slide. She told me the joke, even though I couldn't figure out. I couldn't figure out, but thank you for your patience. That's all.
