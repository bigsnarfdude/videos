Uh the work that the work that I have done. Okay, so uh there is a rich literature uh documenting the importance of dynamic contracting methods in various fields of economics. So in international finance, in development economics, and in corporate finance. So it's kind of like the principal agent problem, it's kind of like the cornerstone also of a lot of work in corporate finance. And so let me walk you through the development of modern dynamic contracting in which Contracting in which there were two major watersheds in the development of modern dynamic contracting. So economists had been thinking about principal agent problems since the 1970s at the very least. And when they started thinking about it dynamically, it seemed that the standard techniques of dynamic programming were not going to apply. Because essentially there is a principle, let's say, an ISR, okay, and an agent. So he would give me a contract, and then I have to make some choices dynamically, like a control program in which I should. Dynamically, like a control problem, you check which action to take at every point in time. But then Niesler has to anticipate what I will do, right? So then he also has to solve his own dynamic optimization problem. And so they say, well, it's kind of like dynamic programming square, and the standard dynamic control that economists were familiar with didn't seem to apply. But then they sort of like discovered that there is a recursive structure to the contracting problem, in which what you can do is you can use the continuation value of the agent as the state variable. Of the agent as the state variable. So now Nisari is solving his optimization problem, sort of anticipating what I would do, and he just keeps track of what is the amount of utility of the value that I will get moving forward after a certain history and after a certain amount of time has elapsed. The second major watershed took place in the mid-2000s, and some people sitting in this room were also working on these topics. But by and large, I'd say the economic profession has given credit to UDES. Has given credit to Yudi Sanikov for using Martindiel techniques to very easily characterize the incentive compatibility constraint of the agent. So now Nissar wants to incentivize a particular action for me to take. So then he knows that he has to use my continuation value as the state variable. But then to incentivize a particular amount of effort, then he can match the volatility of the continuation value to the effort that he wants to implement. And then to say that after that, then we can sort of like Then you can sort of like rewrite the program in a way that is written for the standard stochastic control program. So the state variable is the continuation value of the agent, and then he would control the volatility of that continuation value. So by and large, a lot of the literature that has followed this work has been done under the neoclassical exponential discounting assumption. So in the discounting, the usual discounting that we are used to, e to the minus delta t. Delta T. So this is in contrast to the success of present bias preferences have had in explaining a lot of economic behavior. So the person who we give credit to for sort of reviving this literature to economic profession is David Layson, and hence the title of the paper, in which there are these preferences that are referred to as the beta, beta-hat, delta preferences. In which, whenever you are here in this corner, this is the type of preferences that we're used to, which is the time-consistent preferences e to the minus delta t. So these preferences have been very successful in explaining, for example, savings behavior, the fact that people don't seek to save enough for retirement, responses to monetary shocks, and gym memberships. So let me use the example of gym memberships to sort of motivate the way that this The way that the kind of behavior that these preferences can capture. So if you have the rational, the standard way of modeling people's preferences, then these are the kind of people who join the gym and go to the gym. So let me say that this is kind of like Stefan. I know Stefan is an athlete. And so Stefan is the kind of person who joins the gym and thinking that he will go to the gym and he actually goes to the gym. The G. There may be some people who disproportionately value the present. So, beta is going to be a preference, it's the parameter that is going to capture by the disproportionate amount, but which should discount the future. So, if you give the future some amount significantly smaller than the present, then we will say that this badness is strictly smaller than one. So, you are biased towards the present. So, if you look in this 45-degree line, these are people who we should refer to as sophisticated. Refer to as sophisticated. So they are aware that they disproportionately value the present, but they also know that in the future they will have the same type of property. So let me say that this is going to be like Camilo. So Camilo, every morning he wakes up, and then he says, I'm going to watch one more Netflix show today, and I will not go to the gym. And he also knows that tomorrow when he wakes up, he will behave in the same way. So he has this sophistication about his self-control problems in such a way that Camilo is the kind of person who Such a way that Camilo is the kind of person who doesn't join the gym because he knows that he will not go. And then there is a third kind of person. So let's say this one is me, in which I think today I wake up and then I say, okay, today I'm going to watch one more Netflix show. But starting tomorrow, I'm going to become exponential. So starting tomorrow, I'm not going to display present bias. Starting tomorrow, I will start going to the gym. And so I am the kind of person who joins the gym thinking that I will go. Gym thinking that I will go, but then I don't go. And so my contribution is to try to, I guess, quote-unquote, teach Nizar how he has to contract with somebody like me over here. So, you know, we know how to contact with people like this, we also know how to contact with people in the 45-degree line who are sophisticated, but maybe not quite as well how to contract with somebody who displays this type of behavior. So contracting with this. So, contracting with this type of agents has been done in the two-period setting. So, about 10 years ago, okay, it was done in the two-period setting. And the important insight from a theoretical perspective is that you have to enlarge the state space, but there is an additional constraint. So now, Nissan has to anticipate that there are two actions that are important. That I think that I will go, so the perceived action, I'll refer to this as the perceive action, that I think I will go to the gym, because otherwise I will not join and will not pay him the fee, but that I Will not pay him the fee, but that I actually don't go. That tomorrow when I wake up, I don't go, because if I go, it's a problem for him. The gym becomes very crowded. Okay, Stefan will get upset that there are too many people in the gym. So here are the methodological insights as to how we can just adapt our standard techniques from dynamic contracting to be able to extend it to the situation in which the agent displays this type of preferences. So the first one is that a recursive. So, the first one is that a recursive formulation for the problem exists, but you no longer use the continuation value of the agent, but the perceived continuation value of the agent. So, NISAR doesn't have to keep track of what I'm actually going to get out of the contract. So let me approximate my Brownian motion with a finite tree. So, he no longer has to keep track of what I am going to get in each of these subtrees, but he has to keep track of. Sub-trees, but he has to keep track of what I think that I will get out of these sub-trees. But of course, what I think that I will get is different than what I will actually get, because I will behave in a different way than I anticipate to behave. So that's the state variable that is required to unlock the recursive formulation of the problem. Of course, if the person is sophisticated, then the perceived continuation value is the continuation value of the agent, and that will restore our standard. Our standard set of results. The incentive compatibility, so this is the action that I actually take when I'm at a given node after a given history, will follow very much the structure of Sanikov, in which now what you have to connect is the volatility of the perceived continuation value. So, the volatility of this distinct variable, the higher that volatility is, the more you will be able to incentivize effort, but it has to be this. Incentivize effort, but it has to be discounted by the actual discount factor, which I will refer to as this better. So the actual amount by which I disproportionately value the present relative to the future. And then the third constraint is the perceived choice constraint, which has to relate to the action that Nisari is going to make me think that I will take from the content that he offers me. And again, you will see it's a very simple link between the volatility of the perceived continuation value. Continuation value with the perceived action, but by the perceived discount factor. Or the perceived discount factor is usually underestimated. So, once again, it's usually with model situations in which people think that they are more patient than they actually are. Let me skip this slide and give you a little bit more of the structure of the model. For those of you who are familiar with it, I will essentially build on the DeMarshan-Sanikov framework with variable F. Of framework with variable efforts. So, a continuous time model with infinite horizon, the principal is going to be risk-neutral and deep pocketed. The agent is going to be risk-neutral, limited liability, but the novelty is that the agent, namely me, can display present bias and potential naivete about this present bias, so not being aware of my present bias. So, to model present bias, To model present bias, I follow the harrison and make some paper in the loss on the technical. So the principal has to contract with me to manage a project where the project is going to follow this type of process, of this law, this arithmetic Brownian motion law, in which the drift increases in the action that I actually take. So the amount of effort that I take every day when I wake up is going to increase the drift of the of the realized uh Of the realized level of cash flows. But only I know this, and this is only going to be able to observe the path of output. So the contract will depend on the path of output, so hence the moral hazard. So he only can contract on the actual realizations of output. Only I privately know how much effort I put in the project. So here again, let me re-emphasize how the contract space has changed relative to the baseline case. Has changed relative to the baseline case. So the contract space is going to specify some consumption that is a function of outputs, I guess I should say, measure with respect to the history of output, some termination clause tau, and then two actions. The action that Misai is going to make me think that I will take, and the action that I actually take. And just to foreshadow in general, this is going to be bigger than this. So because I'm going to think that I'm going to put more effort than I actually To put more effort than I actually do. So the state variable is the AS perceived continuation of utility. Let me denote it by d hat, in which what is this? Well, is the discounted net present value, the consumption that I'm going to get out of the contract, so I'm being paid after every history, net or some effort cost, where importantly, there is a hat here and there is a hat there, which is saying that is the Which is saying that is the perceived continuation value, so meaning I anticipate taking this action, and so this is how much it's going to cost me to take this action, but I anticipate inducing some distribution over the day, so inducing a certain distribution over output in the future, and so therefore I take the expectation with respect to that probability measure. So that is the yes. Why A is a part of the contract? Yes, so I guess I'm writing the contract space this way, but later I'm going to check that it is incentive compatible and satisfies the prescriptions constraint. So you're right. So I guess in the standard contract theory, you would say something like, you offer to pay me something after a certain history and you suggest me an action. And then later, we check that what you suggest me, when I solve my own optimization problem, is what I want to follow your suggestion. But you're right that. Suggestion. So, but you're right that you could write it, you could think about it like this, but it's a larger contract space for them. You just check expose that it's in central that your suggestion is what I actually want to do. And so, importantly, the agent incorrectly anticipates his future sales to exert an effort policy A hat. So, the agent is thinking his future sales. So, here is, you know, I was offered this contract, this is me today when I signed the contract. When I sign the contract, and then I imagine my future selves in the future, and I think, well, this person is going to exert a different amount of effort, this future that I handle is going to exert a different amount of effort once I'm there, okay, than what I plan when I sign the contract. So, following Sadikov, let me apply the Martinier representation theorem to the perceived continuation value, which is one thing that I defined before. And this should look relatively similar, in which the contribution value appreciates us at a particular rate, the discount rate. There are some payments that are made, so you subtract that. And the important term is that this φT is going to control the power of incentives. It's going to control the power of incentives. So, how sensitive is the perceived continuation value to the reliable? To the realized value of output. So let me give you now the definitions of incentive compatibility and of the perceived choice constraint. So this definition for this type of community is not rigorous enough because I'm using the English language, as opposed to a more rigorous mathematical language. But I'm going to say that this contract is incentive compatible if the action that NISAR is Action that Nisard is planning on implementing on me, so the one that he thinks Alejandro is going to choose this is the one that I actually choose when I'm at a given node, when I anticipate that my future selves will take a hat. So when I wrongly anticipate that my future selves will take a hat, once I'm at a given node, I ask myself, do I want to take action A? And if the answer is yes, then I will say the contract is incentive compatible. Then I would say the contact is incentive compatible. Let me give you, let me convince you that this makes pretty good sense. Suppose that I'm here, at a given node, and I'm going to ask myself, do I want to take action A? So if this equation is true, I will say the answer is yes. And this is the reason for Lucha. Do I want to take action A? Well, I ask myself, what is the marginal cost of accepting action A, this G prime A? A is G prime A. This is the cost that I'm paying today, once I'm at a given node, for that extra marginal unit of effort. And what is the benefit? So the benefit that I get is going to be proportional to the incentives, to this 50. Why is that proportional to incentives? Because 50 in some sense is the difference between the utility that I get in the in the absolute three and in the three below. So what? Three below. So the volatility of the continuation value, but essentially it's telling you how much happier are you in the three following high output versus the three following low output. So this is the marginal benefit, discounted importantly by this amount B, better. So by the true discount factor of the agent. Because these incentives are in the future, in the form of future compensation that I'm going to receive. So the marginal. Receive. So the marginal cost is paid today, the marginal benefit is in the future, is proportional to the incentives, but I have to discount this by my true factor of impatience. So this is a small number. Now, the perceived choice constraint. So the perceived choice constraint is as follows. The perceived choice constraint essentially tries to tries to answer the following question. Today when I sign the contract, do I anticipate my future sales to take action a hat? To take action A hat. And so I'm here today. And I ask, once I'm there, will I want to take action A hat? And I claim that the answer is yes, if this condition is satisfied, which again should be very intuitive. So I envision the future at the hand on a particular node, and I ask, and I think, okay, this is going to be his marginal cost of effort. And then I think, what is going to be his marginal benefit? His marginal benefit. His marginal benefit again is proportional to the volatility of his perceived continuation of value to output. So, in other words, to how much more utility you get in the sub-tree if output is high, minus the utility you get in the sub-tree if output is low. But discounted by this beta hat, because I'm underestimating my true discount rate. So, you can think of this beta hat maybe in the extreme case as being equal to what. So, I think my future self. One. So I think my future selves are patient in such a way that the marginal cost is going to be in the present and the marginal benefit will be in the future, but I don't discount it quite by as much. And so this is a very simple way of representing the perceived choice constraint. So my contribution would be to represent the perceived choice constraint in this very simple manner. In this file, you get this from Martinier representation under So what in the representation, I C and B C. Thank you. So I welcome suggestions to help me make this work more rigorous. And we can talk more later. I'll be very grateful for this. So this equation is new in the literature. So it's kind of like an analogous condition to the incentive compatibility constraint using Stanikov techniques. This constraint that is well known, but the perceived choice constraint. Perceived choice constraint, it has this very simple representation. And then once you do that, things are going to follow quite easily. So now Nizar is going to solve the problem of discounting the net present values of the cash flow that the project generates, net of what he's going to pay me. Of course, this has to be computed under A, because he knows that I'm going to take action A, right? He knows that I'm over, you know, thinking that I'm going to work super hard, but I'm only going to accept effort A. Subject to incentive compatibility, procedures, constraints. Compatibility, perceived choice constraint, and the participation constraint. And he only has to keep track of the value of the perceived continuation value of the agent. And now, let me represent this under PA, just for illustration purposes, everything looks the same as before, except that there is a negative drift out here. And I will refer to this as some sort of like exploitation effect. So Isa is thinking, okay. So, Misari is thinking, okay, this is Alejandro's perceived continuation value, but at each point in time, he's exerting less effort than what he thought he was going to take. So that's going to induce a downward drift on my perceived continuation valve. Because every day I'm waking up and I'm exerting less effort. I think there's no way that you can do the 12 signs. Okay, oh no, no, no. There is appendix. There is appendix, yeah. So now you can go and write this in. It's just a standard. Write this in, it's just a standard ordinary differential equation, two constraints. Let me give you some of the economic insights in two minutes. So, I guess what is new from this contract relative to when you contract with somebody who has the standard exponential discounting? The first one, super intuitive, there will be a signing bonus. In most of these contracts, there is no signing bonus because Nissar would like to see that I actually perform well before he pays me. But if I display a lot of present bias, then he wants to. Display a lot of present bias, then he wants to attract me to go and work with him. Otherwise, Dylan is going to offer me a contract that pays me some signing bonus. I disproportionately value the present, so the participation constraint will make me go and work for Dylan. So it is going to be a signing bonus, no questions asked before he sees any kind of performance. And then I'm going to take this comparative static, which I think is the one of most interest, which is, I'm going to see what happens when NISTAR goes from contracting with What happens when Nissar goes from contracting with someone who is sophisticated to someone who is naive? So, here is his value function as a function of the state variable at the perceived continuation value of the agent. So, the first thing is that he gets happier and happier. He gets happier and happier when he's contracting with someone that underestimates their severity of their present bias. How does the contract change in such a way that he gets happier and happier? He's going to give me more and more high power incentives. More high power incentives. He's going to offer me more and more carrots after very good performance. Why is that? Well, because I think I'm going to work super hard. Like I observe these big carrots after high performance and I think, oh, I'm going to work super hard and I'm going to get these very big carrots. But in reality, so not the perceived effort, but the actual effort, doesn't increase by quite as much. And then the second thing that he does is he's going to backload my incentives more. So he's going to pay me later and later. So he's going to pay me later and later in time he's going to tell me, just keep on working, Alejandro, I'll give you this bonus after a very high performance in the future. And I think I'm going to work super hard and this bonus will be realized, but in expectation is not realized quite as often. Then I can characterize exactly what I call the exploitation effect, which is the difference between the actual continuation value that I will get from the contract and what I think that I will get. So of course I will actu I will get much less than what I thought I would get. Than what I thought I would get because Nisar is aware of this and he's exploiting me by designing the contract in this specific way. So let me conclude. So in terms of the methodology, fairly easy to adapt the standard methodology of contracting when you are contracting with somebody who has this type of naivete. Use the perceived continuation value of the agent instead of the continuation value. A very simple link to extend the incentive compatibility constraint to match Sadikov and then the perceived choice constraint. Of and then the perceived choice constraint, which before had only been modeled in two-period, it has a very simple representation in the full dynamic model of continuous time. And then, in terms of what is new from economic insights, there is a signing bonus, and then naivety leds to very backlog incentives, extremely high-power incentives that in equilibrium are not realized. So, it's kind of like, I joke when I present this to my colleagues, that is kind of the content that the dean wrote with me. He said, if you publish 20 papers, You said, if you publish 20 papers, I give you 10 years. Okay, and so it's a great car down there. And I thought, I'm going to work super hard and publish 20 papers. Every day I woke up, I work a little bit less hard, and then you don't publish 20 papers, you publish 10, and you don't get any. So in hindsight, you were sort of like exploited by this type of document. Thank you all. One quick question to prepare for. Question to prepare for discussion during everybody. I mean, on slide 12, you have this dynamics for the continuation of the meeting? Okay, this one. There is still the gamma, which comes from exponential discounting. I would expect that because you have this discounting present bias, you should Present bias, you should include some beta or beta hat. What's the objective function for the agent? So, okay, so the objective for the, so I could multiply everything by beta and I would just have another agent. So, either of the state variables would work. Either this or this multiplied by beta. Write down the value, the expectation for the agent is what the gamma from the exponential distance. Gamma comes from the exponential is the future consumption minus the cost. Where does the bias come from? Beta and beta hat. So I guess this is a feature of the fact that it's infinitesimal. So only for one instant, you give the person a full value of one, and then moving forward, you discount everything by an amount beta. But you are right that if I asked an agent, what is beta? Agent, what is the continuation value that you are perceiving? It will be beta d hat. That would be the answer that you would get from me. But for the purpose of using dynamic programming for this, it doesn't matter whether I multiply by that or not. Because it's just a linear transformation of the state variable. I suggest that we continue discussion over the break and uh Discussion over the break, and let's thank Alejandro again. And let's reconvene at 10:30 as planned on the program. Reconvene at 10:30, which finishes. So that's that's the last slide that is over, which is the percent of what I think that will be there from the contract will be smaller than what I will actually in utility. And because it's with neutral, it's almost in money. That's an exploitation. I would write to you five seconds and just how I write something. I won't read the problem. But what's the problem? So, how much is it? Yeah, it's like there is a mediator so it's not a problem. I don't think you can use it after it was a problem. Yeah, yeah, it's also not valuable. And the CS might be different. It could be different from the one you can. I mean it's just like I have to tell you because Tao could be whatever. I cannot use different. Because the terminal payment maybe have different natures. You'll write a PCP. So Cassie is always a photo comment. And then the thing that's going on here is just the number 3. Now we can see that. And then this thing here um Here and another maximum. Maximizing your agent tool here. This is what the different sources of your paper would place.
