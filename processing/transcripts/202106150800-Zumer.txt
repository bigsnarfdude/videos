Okay, so thank you for inviting me to this interesting and stimulating meeting. And I would like to talk about our rather recent study of active nematic turbulence, which was done in Ljubljana and with the younger co-workers. The younger co-workers, Juray Aplins, Simon Chopar, Giga Kos, Guillam Poy, and Michael Ablik. And our study was motivated by a growing interest in active soft matter, particularly ranging from biological to collider systems. And topological soft matter, particularly, was also in the center. Was also in the center of our interest. And what else is to the shift from experiments in 2D to experiments in 3D? So the three-dimensional experiments were first published by the group of Dogich in 2020. And this really stimulated that there are many more studies also of more kind of. Also, of more kind of the 3D dynamics. A particular interesting paper, which I should mention here, is also machine learning actinematic hydrodynamics from groups of Di Pablo and Vitelli, which appeared this year. And my outline here is a phenomenological approach to active pneumatics, modeling of active in 3D pneumatics in droplets. In droplets, variation of activity from low activity to the situation where actinatic turbulence appears, and then geometrical characterization of such state, and also topological characterization of the events which are occurring in this situation. So, pneumatic ordering and The rig and its deformation. That's something what people studied for many years. And here I just briefly repeat this. So important feature here is that the director is not a real vector, but because of equal n and minus n, that means that better description of the systems is so called tensorial nematic auto. Tensor nematic auto parameter where this travel is work come. Now, the main features of the tensorial parameter are degree of order on one side, partial by axiality on the other side, and then eigenframe. Eigenframe here is given by the main director and to biaxial director. Two biaxial directors, and then in the eigenframe, this tensor has a traceless and has a simple form. Now, static deformations in the systems are caused by confinement to different geometries, and particularly by anchoring on surfaces, and then by static external fields, or then depending a lot of intrinsic. Depending a lot of intrinsic properties like electricity and chirality of the system. Now, in basic deformations which occur in these systems, there are so well-known splay and band and twist deformation, and we will see that they appear often here later on. And particularly important is also that confinement often leads to frustration of the system, and we have And we have stable defects in such systems, also on a long term running. While our topic is in fact confinement to a droplet, but a droplet with particular conditions, so that we have a normal anchoring at the surface of this nematric. So that means there in center is a defect. Means therein center is a defect. And now, dynamical deformations, which will be our main topic, is that they are caused usually in passive systems by thermal, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, external changes. And there we see that the relaxation of the dynamic of the tensor is also accompanied by flow. Accompanied by flow or black flows. While here, and we will be focused on the situation where there is driving of a system, what is a so-called active magnetic, which is coming from energy stored in the constituents, or it could be also provided from surroundings. So this will be This will be our sorry base for nanometer dynamics here is simply a free energy which has a simple form of Lando-Dejen type. So we take only a single elastic constant here and out of this via the minimization procedure we get molecular Procedure: We get molecular fields, and this molecular field is driving the changes of the tensor Q tensor. But there is a presence of flow, which is relevant for this advection and alignment. In particular, alignment term is a rather complex function of the Q tensor and velocity gradients. Now, out of this, there's the Out of this, this dynamic equation for the Q tensor has then two parts: one comes from the molecular field, then the other comes from this alignment tensor. Now, this, because we have flow inside, which is changing the director, also director affects the flow, and this is described by the individual and metady. Usual name method dynamics here extended to some extent to with the so-called generalized Navier-Stokes equation, where the stress tensor in this Navier-Stokes equation includes contributions from passive systems, the same as the passive system, and the viscous terms, which are again the same as passing the matrix, while the active term here is a crucial. Here is a crucial for the whole driving. It's very simple. We take something what other people have used and it looks that it's a good starting point so that the stress and active strength is proportional to the Q. That means if the Q is inhomogeneous, that means that this will definitely enter here also in the NMI method. So, and then a minimum. And now, the free factor here is activity, which in our cases will be selected to be positive. So, these coupled two equations cannot be solved in a simple way. We usually approach numerically and it's important to take into account properly these boundary couplings. These boundary couplings, and all together, the useful approach is so-called hybrid lattice-Boltman algorithm, which was introduced by a group called Julia Humans. But also some relevant introduction to these complex descriptions is also in the book of Barrison Edwards. So, for a particular description, Description oriented to a spherical confinement, we have here our paper which appeared like two years ago in this about this system. But before going into the results of our simulations, we need to say more on defects. So defects in the nematic field are discontinuous in the direct field. discontinuous in the director and there is a strong variation in the nematric order and by axiality and it can be driven externally and by intrinsic effects. So important is that these are topological objects and there is needed to take into account symmetry of the numeric ordering and the related conservation law. Conservation law. Now, our defects here will be all line defects, so important for this 3D description, disclinations. And it's usually characterized how on the about the direct with the director, how it turns when you go around the center of a discrimination line. So, because of this special symmetry of our director, also half-integer. Vector, also half integer of winding number is possible. And these are really the lowest energy discrimination lines, and the ones which appear most are practically always. Now, the core of a discrimination is always a singular part where partiality order decrease tension. Now, to plot or illustrate the profiles, we usually We usually use either director, like these lines here, and either glyphs. And here, iso center of the disclinational line is given by so-called isosurface or the nematic order parameter, which is here decreased compared to the bulk value. And then the areas, which are here marked by different colors. Are here marked by different colors are areas of large spray and areas of large bands. And then obviously, if we look at our examples of discrimination profiles, plus one half, so that is the main most interesting for us later on. It has a very asymmetric director profile around. If we take higher around if we take minus one has a three-fold symmetry so it has uh is much more uh has higher and and then we have a the twist disclinations where you twist out of plane as well and this is somewhere in between in the how it affects the flow because activity depends how much the directory is changing and this thing And this thing is the most pronounced, particularly with this plus one-half distinction line. And therefore, many times later on, it will be mentioned that we have a kind of self-propulsion of a plus one-half line. And while the minus one-half line is propelled, not propelled just because of this three-fold symmetry, while twist one is propelled less. Is fourth less than the plus one half. So, and these details have been perhaps nicely described in the paper by Binish, the SPRIA paper in 2020. Now, but our discrimination lines in the spherical confinement are strongly affected by confinement because confinement is such that the boundary condition is normal. Condition is normal for a director, and discrimination line cannot approach the surface, it's expelled from the surface. So, that means the discrimination line must form loops because it cannot end itself. A singular destination forms loops, and these loops are confined to our spherical. Geometry. So, topological charge is still important, which is also given by a particular boundary condition. That's the total topological charge of everything what is inside must be plus one. And then the drop, these drops will have disclination loops which have charges. What charge can have a disclination? What charge can we have a distinction loop here? We will see that plus one is the charge which occurs always. And then there are zero topological charges. What is the difference between the two? One has a uniform profile of plus one destination, this profile, while the zero chart loop varies the profile. We have sequences of plus one half twice. One half traced, minus one half, twisted, and again back to plus one half. And you can have more zero topological charge loops because they are not restricted by our confinement. Now, the situation is illustrated here, the results are illustrated depending on the activity strength. So here are situations along. Here are situations along this line here. You are having increasing activity, and here we have certain situations for low activity. There is a small loop inside. It's a practically point defect with little flow around. And then at larger activities, this loop is expelled from the center toward boundary of the sphere. Of the sphere, and with even increasing further pushes towards surface is stronger, but also the flow, which is circular, mostly circular, is also stronger. But then if you increase more activity, it comes to this situation which we call chaotic situation, but in between this loop grows very fast. Loop grows very fast and then it starts to separate to more loops, and then these more loops annulate, and so on. So, we have a dynamical situation which is very different from this stationary dynamic here. Now, if we want to understand what kind of loops are here, here is a situation of this where we have two loops, one, two, and what is. Two and what is plotted here is the bar is the isosurface of the other parameter. Simply red color is for this. But if we use our coloring for the band and for splay deformation, we see that in this small loop has a constant profile, while this one has a varying profile, splay, band. Profile display, bend, and here also we show his twist is present. So that means with our illustration, we show that a definitely small ink has a charge one, and a large one has a charge minus one, zero. Now, if we illustrate how this dynamically goes, perhaps what is here is you just having a constant value. Value of activity, but which is smaller than the activity used for two billions of seconds. So we see we have a constant flow here around, more or less constant, and then rotating ring. So it's a stationary situation, driven stationary situation. But more interesting is the case when you have higher activity. We start with the initial state, with With the initial state, which is the same as in the previous case, but we select activity in the range where we have chaotic situation. So starting again the simulation, where we see here on this side is the presentation of flows and of destination lines. Here is a kind of simulated micrograph of this. Micrograph of this guy, if you look along the axis down or orthogonal axis. So, but definitely for situation in nematics, what we take here is usual nematics. So, it's not Lyotropic type with low indices. Now, here is also important is angular momentum is presented how it behaves with time. Now, if we run now. Now, if we run now our simulation here, we see the beginning looks similar. But then this starts to grow rather fast, we will see, and deform, and then not only deform, but it will separate to different rings. And then we see all that components of the angular momentum is changing, and then new appearing ring. New appearing rings disappear or reconnect, and so on. So we have splitting and hyation, merge, and crossover what is present. And general situation looks chaotic if you look to the optical microbes. Now, how to classify this in a way that using some kind of geometrical characterization? What we use here is We use here is counting the defect length, defect position, angular momentum, and probability for a number of loops. And here constant loop length up to a certain point, then it jumps and then it increases. Here it's average because this one is very chaotic. And if you go back, we see that here. So if you go back, we see that here we have history in between. So then it's a transition, a kind of first order transition between two states. And the defect position also shifted to the boundary, but then it jumps back on the average is somewhere on the one-third. And then angular momentum here is increasing linearly at low activity, then it's saturated for high activity and fluctuating along. And fluctuating alone. Number of loops is increasing, average number of loops, probability that five loops occur in this case is rather small. Now, if we plot the phase diagram out of this, this phase diagram has here radius and here activity. And in this range are situations where we have stationary driven system. Hybrid-driven system with the circular form, and in this range on the other side is ectoturbulence, so chaotic state. In between is the hysteria. Now, if we look at the kind of topological characterization of this, it's simply following evolution from the beginning along the timeline here, and then plotting what. Plotting what happens here in between: either split or anhylation or merge or crossover. So, first one loop splits to two, then they merge here, then again splits, but one annihilates, the other continues, and then rewire, and so on. But perhaps to look one particular case here, like situation here, where we have three. Here, where we have three loops coming from the side, and these three loops are here. And if you and if we make more precise analysis of this, you see that there are two of them have zero charge. Obviously, from structure, for instance, here going from minus one half to plus one half in between is a twisted one. So, this is the situation. So, this is the situation here. And then another example is point C here, where we have this one loop and some one splits out. And this was this point here. When this one, which splits out, very soon disappears. We see here, this becomes smaller and smaller and disappears. So, this is this situation. Then, merging of Then merging of two is illustrated here. So if we come on this side, two loops, then we see two of them, then they merge into a single loop. Or another thing, a complex single loop is reforming into less complex, so rewiring, crossover happens. And this one was happening here. So this is this topological characterization. Logical characterization. Sorry, I must stop here because I see that I am a little about the time. And our theory simulations for this 3D active nematric turbulence confined in a simple drop is a kind of example of what can go on also in larger systems, different systems, particularly this characterization based either on geometric. Based either on geometrical aspects or topological events, can help to analyze bigger systems as well. But the importance is that certainly our system was simple thematic, but if you go to allotropic systems or to biological systems or to colloidal systems, you have also different boundary conditions. And contrary to our homotropic boundary is the A tropic boundary is the so-called planar boundary, and which allows also that lines touch the surface. So no loops are forced in. So here I should stop. I see that I am beyond the time. Thank you very much.
