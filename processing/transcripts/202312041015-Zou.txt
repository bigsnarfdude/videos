This is a joint work with Professor Yasuhite Fukumoto, the first speaker. The outline includes MHD instability and the energy, and also the kinematically accessible perturbations, which is also in MHD code. Is also in MHD called the isomagneto-vertical perturbations and also the energy formulas of the ideal MHD, especially the isentropic incompressible MHD. So MHD instability has a lot of applications. For example, in the astrophysics, the magneto-rotational instability. Rotational instability is believed to be the mechanism to trigger the collapse of the accretion disk to form a star. And also in the experimental regime, like in the togmarks, the instabilities have to be controlled. RNOTS provides a sufficient condition. Provides a sufficient condition for the instability, and it states that if the energy of the disturbance is positive definite, then the equilibrium state is spectrally stable. Also, by the current theory of homutonous spectral, so if there are two modes to coexist. Two co-existence modes with opposite signed energy, or they both have the zero energy, then they can collide and trigger instability. For example, they can collide at the origin. So the imaginary part of the omega corresponds to the instability or they can collide at the Or they can collide at the real axis and have the instability. The basic equations in ideal MHD includes the momentum equation, the continuity equation, the conservation of entropy, and the induction equation of the magnetic. Of the magnetic field, and from this induction equation, we know that the magnetic field is flowing into the fluid. In these equations, rho is represented as the density and the p is the pressure, s is the entropy, and the u is the velocity, b is the magnetic field. And the j, which is the curve b is the electro. The electric current density. In that system, we know that there is some advected quantities, which include the local mass and the magnetic two form, which is a magnetic flux, goes through an infinitesimal surface elements. Surface elements and the helicity density, which is A is the vector potential of the magnetic field. So the helicity density is the vector potential magnetic field with inner product with magnetic field and over the density and also the entropy. And this also showed in the previous talk. So, the ideal MHD has a homotopy structure, which is constructed by Mollison and the Gray in 1980s, and by using the Lee-Poisson bracket. And in this structure, it used the momentum, which is rho u, and also the volume. Volume volume and volume density of the entropy, which is rho s and the f g all those functionals are functions of the momentum and the magnetic field, the density, and also the entropy. The homeotonic, the Lipp-Poisson bracket also can be represented. Can be represented by using this form. Well, the G is an anti-symmetric operator and can be written explicitly like this. And the circles represent the position of the operator. And the ideal MHD basic functions can be written in the operator form by using the Using the operator J with the Hamiltonian functional derivative with respect to the where W is vector. Because the Liboisson bracket is degenerated, so which also is same as saying that the operator J actually is not empty. actually is not empty or the curve of the kernel of the operator is not empty so it admits cashimir which is defined to be c a functional which has the has the leap person brackets of c with any any other function functional g equal to zero or in other words the operator j Acting as the functional derivative of C with respect to W equal to zero. So the Cashimir is the conserved integrals of the system. So we will construct the kinematically or dynamically accessible disturbance by using the Lipoisson brackets. In the Lip Poisson bracket, similar to the basic functions that is constructed through the Lie-Poisson brackets, if we replace the Hamiltonian here by using some arbitrary functional k, then we can get, and also here the time t replaced by a virtual time tau, then we can Can construct the disturbance by represented as expansion. So the virtual time derivative of tau corresponds to the first order disturbance. What's so for this? So, for this kinematically accessible disturbance, what is interesting is that if F is a cashmere, then it's going to be conserved after the disturbance is added. Because the cashmere has the property that the LiboSon bracket with any function becomes zero. Comes zero. So, if we, so for example, we use the k and we write the functional derivative of k with respect to the momentum magnetic field density and the entropy by using this vector Cauchy theta, lambda and sigma, then we can write our Disturbance, first order disturbance, like represented by Cushy, zeta, yet, and sigma. And this is a form of the kinematically accessible disturbance. So, in the when there is no magnetic field for the Euler flow, we know that the helicity, which is the That the helicity, which is defined to be the viscosity in the product with velocity and the integral, is a Cauchy Mir, so it's conserved. And Kevin Arnold in 1965, they said that steady Euler flow is the conditional extreme of the energy as a vertical sheet. So when the vorticity to form and the heading. To form and the helicity are preserved after disturbance. In this case, they found that the H1, which is the first order disturbance of the energy, equal to zero, and the second order energy, which will determine the instability. And the formula is given in. In COPEF and 2000 and the Hilot of Komoto 2008. Since for MHD, the helicity is no longer an environment. So what the energy form looks like for MHD is what we are looking for. First, let's look at what iso. This is a magneto-vertical seat. So, for ideal MHD, magnetic geodes is brought into the fluid and the magnetic two-form is conserved. This is what we showed before. And also for ideal MHD, it can be proved that magnetic helicity and cause helicity are cashmeres, which is for the which is for the it is given for the incompressible case. Well the helicity magnetic helicity is defined to be the magnetic field inner product with the vector potential of the magnetic field and the integral and the helicity is a cross helicity is defined to be the magnetic field in the product with Product with velocity field and take the integral. And we also prove that kinematic for the kinematic accessible disturbance, any question actually satisfy that the disturbance is going to be zero to any order. So if the disturbance So, if the disturbance keeps the magnetic helicity and the cause helicity preserved, we call it the isomagnetovertical disturbance. And it means that the flow is going to be disturbed, but still keeps the magnetic helicities constant. So, for the kinematically accessible disturbance, we can also show by using the repo bracket that the first order energy disturbance is zero. So, by using the operator form, because this g delta g g delta h delta w which is at the equilibrium is zero so we can we can prove that the first order energy equal to zero and we also have the kevin announce theorem in the m hd which states that the steady ideal m h d is a conditional extreme of energy Energy and isomagneto-vertical seat or the kinematically accessible variations. So this is the energy of the disturbed and the H1 is also zero for the MHD. And if we can find that the energy is positive definite, then that will give the sufficient condition. Give the sufficient condition for the instability. So we can to calculate the second order disturbance of energy, we can use the Lipoisson bracket again to the or take the virtual time derivative to the second order and we can find we find the energy. Find we find the energy is something represented like this. But we will want to know what is Cushi, what is yet, or what is the curl data, which we denote it by yet, and what is the evolution equations. So, Cushy is known as the Laglangian displacement, which he describes the difference of the fluid particles trajectory after disturbed and before disturbed. For example, the solid line is the equilibrium trajectory at the time t the Time t, the particle is at the position x0. And after time t after getting disturbed at the time t, the the position actually moved to x0 plus theta. And so we can find that the this Disturbance of the velocity has a relationship with the Cushy, like this. I think the printer does not work very well. And the log engine displacement has satisfied a very famous equation called the frame and rotation. Equation called the Freeman-Rotenberger equation, which is a second-order differential equation. And here there is a force operator S and this force operator is a symmetrical operator. So, by using the Freeman-Lutenberg equation, the wave energy actually. Um, wave energy actually can be written as two parts. First part is the kinetic energy, which is represented by the first order time derivative of Cushy, and the potential energy, which is represented by the Cushy dot the force operator. And since we already know that to calculate the energy, the force operator is very long, but we know that. Operator is very long, but we know that the first operator equals to this left-hand side of the Freeman-Rotenberg equation, so we can replace it by it. So we can find that and also by so we can simplify the second order energy to be to be this form. To be this form for the stable wave. But for the unstable case, the second-order wave energy is actually equal to zero, which is proved by Cuddles 2008. And if there is this formula is good, that we can see that if there is no flow. No flow for the basic flow, then the wave energy for the stable case is always non-negative. So we have the Cushy, but what is the yeta? If we look at the disturbance equation, we have the Cushy here and the Yeta, which is the curl zeta here. So for the for the For the momentum equation, the place of Cushi is the velocity u, and the curzeta, the yeta place actually is the electric current j. So by using this similarity between the u and the j, so u in the disturbance is replaced by qi and Replace it back sheet and the J originally is E N U minus U E. Well, E is a unit current, unit charge, and N is a number density for the electron, and U and U E represents the velocity of the ion and the electron. So we can So we can think that the yet actually is the En which multiplied by Cushi minus Cushy E, which is the Lagrange displacement of the ion and the electron. And then we can get the evolution equation for yet like this. And the G, if we assume that the mass of the electron is very tiny, if we neglect it, then we got the equation for eta s s in 206 kilo dash eta and her medi. And if we further assume that neglect. assume that neglect to the difference of the cushion way actually result in the evolution for yet as in the bloody milof morphology the iling 1990s so by using the evolution equation of yetaway um we can simplify the energy formula The energy formula by using the we can simplify the energy formula and it becomes the simple simplified form like this. Well, this first part is the part from the hydrodynamic part, and this is introduced by the magnetic field. And this formula also can be obtained by from the By from the Freeman-Rotenberg equation, and by assume the isomagneto vertical disturbance. And this formula is for the incompressible and isentropic MHD. So, if we consider the whole effect. Consider the whole effect if we consider the whole effect, then we consider that the electron is not moving with the ions, so they have the difference. Then the MHD equations, the change is in the induction, is in the induction equation. Well, now Well, um now instead of the magnetic field instead of frozen into the flow, now precisely is frozen into the electron flow, UE. And also the magnetic two form is conserved following the electron flow. Then the energy formula can be extended to the whole energy. The only difference is here the Difference is here: the Cushy Lagrangian displacement is replaced in this term by the Lagrangian displacement of the electron. So we will see what is the merit of the new energy formula since we can see that omega is the vorticity and B is the magnetic field. They are separated from the distance. From the disturbance. So, this formula will simplify the calculation of the energy of waves when the vorticity and the magnetic field of the basic flow is localized in a thin region. For example, for the vortex tube. So, this is an example of application of the Application of the energy formula. So consider a circular vertex patch where the vertex is concentrated in the region of the cylinder where R, the radius is less than A. And the outside of radius R equal to A, the vorticity is zero, then Then if we assume that the boundary of the vortex patch is disturbed to be in this form represented by a plus a small term by using the cosine function, then we can calculate by using the evolution equation for the Lagrangian displacement, we can calculate it. We can calculate it Cushy R and Cushy zeta and find the energy formula is calculated like this and this is in in is the same as the calculation by using the velocity disturbance, but by using the formula is much simpler because the vorticity is The vorticity is, we only need to calculate the integration inside the cylinder. And also, by using the we also calculate a rigid rotating flow where the velocity is in the muscle direction and the magnetic field in the actual and also. In the actual and also in the added music direction. And from the Freeman-Rottenberger equation, we can get the Heinrich equation for the radius direction log energy displacement. And by using the simplified formula, which is from the Freeman-Rotemberg equation, we can calculate. Freeman-Rottenberg equation: We can calculate the energy like this, and we by using the boundary condition, we get a dispersion relation. And compare with the wave energy, we can see the Clan's collision, where the instability occurs when the energy both modes become zero or one is positive. One is positive, the other one is negative. For the conclusion, we showed the properties of the isomagneto-vertical disturbance, which is also known as the kinematically accessible perturbation. And also, we obtained the energy formula for the kinematically accessible disturbance. The future work will be the application of the energy formula and also the extension. And also the extension of the formula to the compressible and the baroclinic fluids. Thank you very much.
