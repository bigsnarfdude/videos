This is the derivative and this is the initial price, okay? Minus the the market price of the derivative. And then the constraints that I've been talking about already, they will have this part, okay? These are three parts. So I'm including this alpha, is the one that is decided by the money, okay? So you you put the alpha, you say, well, this is the lower bound that I would put into wealth, this is the intrinsic wealth. This is the intrinsic value of this couple of things here. So this is the capital time t, and this is the intrinsic value of the derivative at time error t. And the other thing is just the monitoring that is moving according with the okay, so I have these restrictions that are model independent. Model-independent process. And this, so we have an agent who do have a probabilistic structure. And the probabilistic structure is here. And then, well, some restriction on the final. That is the problem that we want to look at. This is the general framework. And then the idea is how to solve this. Well, let me just give you a couple of examples of what is happening with a model-independent frame. So, what happens? So, suppose that we have a strategy which super-replicates the derivative C sub t with this. The C sub T with this initial value, K, Kappa. And suppose that with the C0, where C0 is the market value of the derivative, we are above the intrinsic value of C 0. Then, using arbitrary arguments, then we can conclude that if kappa, the relation between kappa and C0 The relation between kappa and C0. If this happens, then it is never of the market of the trader to put the option in your portal. So this is a good first example of what happens with the relation between numbers here. And here is another one. Okay, so if you have a strategy, okay, which is sub-replicate. Okay, which subreplicates the derivative C sub t in this sense, and then this belongs to the admissible set, and then we also have this path constraint. But now, starting with this capital C sub zero, then it can be proved that if kappa is bigger than C zero, then the trader can find both the polarising arbitrarily large. And this can be done. Okay, this can be done just making some uh manipulations and some arbitrage arguments. Okay, so this is this somehow summarized theme. What I have said, so the market price is bigger, the cheapest super discussion price, and this is bigger equal, but model implied prices, which is momentum price. Okay, now let me move to how we solve the problem, okay, for some specific. I mean, what we have done so far are just basically the first steps, okay? So we have solved the problem for some basic model. So this is just the first step of what I'm presenting here. So that's that. So let me concentrate in the case when In the case when we have a complete market. So we have only one format measurement. So let's see what happens. So then we have some density, HT, okay, and then so we have this framework where we can replicate exactly any random variable y. And then we have this resignator. So like this is the frame. This is the problem. Okay. So how can we solve the problem? So we will transform the problem. So I will write it in a different way, in an equivalent way, so I can go from one to the other. But I will use some tools which are very useful. So instead of thinking now in terms of wealth, In terms of wealth, capital and capital T, I will think in marking age and submarting ages. So, the problem now that I will try to convince you is that if we look at this problem of characterized martingral tens of T, which maximize the expected utility of U at a time capital T. Time capital T of this martingale, okay, or u is any convex function with these constraints, and we have a supermartingale j such that this can, okay? So this is the problem that has been studied before. Okay, so we have a supermartingale, we want to find the marking of that supermarking, which maximize the expected utility at time capacity. That's a problem. Okay, and for that problem, And for that problem, in fact, there is a very nice solution. I give you some preferences. Okay, so in fact, if this lower bound J is not a supermarketing, well, we can work with the snell envelope of that process. So we will have a supermarket dominating J. Okay, but if we are interested in finding But we are interested, in fact, in a particular class of supermarting gates. And so and we are interested in supermarting gates which have this representation, okay, in terms of this, another process, J super star. What is behind this representation? Well, if you want, if you want, you can think in the marketing representation. The martingre representation theorem. It is the usual, the most close and general result that we may think when you have a martingre, supermarking, and you want to represent. Okay, in terms of an integral integrated around a friend, let's say. But here, we are looking for another representation. In other words, we are looking also for a different algebra. Algebra of the Stochastic processes, the Max Pros algebra. In fact, that's what we are looking at. And this work, in fact, has been done by this work with Asu in 2008. And in fact, they solved this problem. The equivalent problem I knew. Okay? So they found, in fact, So they found, in fact, that this the optimal martingate for the equivalent problem will have this form. This is the representation theorem and in fact this martingate satisfies the constraints and optimized is the optimal solution to this problem. So they of course dominate this They made that work. So we'll use that to solve our our problem. So there are some complications to adapt ideas to our ideas. So we need to, because we are dealing basically with different probability measures, we are taking utility expectation with respect to P and we have some equivalent marketing measure. Have some equivalent marking and measure, and we have constraints which are model-independent. So, we need to deal with all these things to transform our program into a frame. Well, I will work with this family of functions, not normal. So, this is another way, the way we can write that problem. Way we can write that problem. So we want to choose this random variable with this investment strategy, which maximize this expected utility of this wealth and subject to this restriction. This is the original problem. So what I will do is to choose this terminal wealth. This is the random variable y sub g. I will define it in this way. And then Well, for this random variable, I have this condition, then this is the expected value, and well, I will need this quantity, which is the difference between the hedging price and the market price of the object. Now, then I'll need this other process Y sub t, okay, which is just the conditional expectation, and then after some manipulations, After some manipulations, in fact, one can prove that the restriction that we have in mind can be written in this form, with this initial condition. This is the initial capital and the different delta C. And this is the point now that DY is a marking under Q and we want to maximize under probability D. So we introduce another, we make another change of measure, okay? And so we introduce this problem the divide Q bar. Q bar, okay, and then this derivative, and then we are able to manipulate everything and put everything under this measure q bar. So now we have a problem where we want to maximize these y bars of t subject to these restrictions. Okay, what is important is that now I mean, now we are more or less on business because now. Or get some business because now I need to look at this quantity. And this quantity turns out to be in fact a cube or supermarketing it. So this is the so we are if I go back, then it means that I am very much in the framework of Nicole of L C Row and R, okay? So we have the floor, which is a supermarking game. I want to find a martingale. Okay? So we're in weight. And in fact, some recent results by Peter Bank and Leslie, then we have in fact that representation for this process, defined. So in fact, this representation So in fact, this representation calls, this is the representation that we need in order to to get the optimal solution to our problem. Again, this is base, this representation is easy to obtain. In fact, it is difficult and they may have great work to to to get that. But n and the connection is the market representation theorem. The market representation term, but they're looking at a different action. Okay, so then we have this result. Okay? So there exists a feasible solution and then we have a form of the optimal terminal world. Okay, and in fact, this with all the restrictions satisfied. So we have a solution. But now, Solution. But now, so this solves the problem. However, we need this strategy and we need to say something about the process J star which are involved here. Okay? So this is like the, again, like the representation term where you know that the process exists, but you don't know. You cannot touch it, right? That's a problem. So let me just show you in a few minutes in the rest of the talk. Few minutes in the rest of the talk, some ideas on how we can get, in fact, the explicit form of the process chain. So suppose that we have a long position of colloptions. So we have lambda units of this colloption with strike K. Then this restriction, so how can we find the optimal strike? Well, first we realize how the restriction looks like in this case, and you have Like in this case, and we have this one. Okay? And then if we observe that this is a Q martingate, then we can write in fact this process in terms of the local time of the process at this point. So it is the main two. Once we have this representation in terms of the local time of the process, of this process, then in fact we can write down In fact, we can write down defining this process here, phi. This is the Radonikomini derivative, this is the bonus process. We can write this expectation with respect to the original Q-bar measure in terms of this integral. This integral is with respect to this local time function. And then, in fact, we are able to prove that some conditions which I will not written here that these two. But written here, that this soup, in fact, can be written in terms of this function. So, this is the explicit form that we can get for the process, for this process that we need in order to construct our strategy. Okay, so these are the main results. Um there are some other questions that I will uh loot in the references. So, here in fact, here they are. Here, in fact, here they are. So, this is the work that I mentioned by Debank and Weslich. This work, this is the one that I talked about today. This is a preprint. And this is the work by El Caroly Misiu. And of course, this work is related with these other proper works, which I didn't mention explicitly, but this But this is work of right on his owner and David Coxon. So this is related with your question. How can you make robot sketching look at some specific options? So this might be some conclusions. So we have what we have done so far. So we have some let's say first steps Let's say first steps uh for some specific models, like the black choice, the black checking model, in order to obtain explicit formulas for the optimal investment strategy. That's the most difficult part. How can you get the explicit form of the representation? And well the stochastic representation for supermarket engagements, for more complex models, this is a challenge, and we are developing. I'm working research in this direction. Of course, there are network extensions to multi-general models, for instance, stochastic productivity models. PhD students of mine is working on that. And an interesting question, the last one is in fact very interesting because you can ask, what is the optimal value of the code option that I need to include, that I will include in my portfolio in order to optimize the one hand. Optimize the on one hand to optimize the expected utility and on the other hand satisfy the constraint that I only don't see. That's one very interesting question. Any question? Okay, so in the case of a complete model in which black shoals fit, we know the solution of that. It's that. We know the solution of that. It's delta hedging, right? And if you go for complete market, even though in a more general case in batches, it's still the delta hedging. So what is the difference between what you find in terms of the specific solution and the delta hedging? That's a good point. I mean, on one hand, you have the hedging for the pouch. It's right. And the And we are also investing in the stock. The question is: you use the delta for which alphas, for instance, the constraint along the trajectory in which that's one hedge. Well, it satisfies the final condition, of course, we know that. Sure, uh but you are the optimizer somehow. Optimized somehow. If you are interested only in the fetching, of course, you're going to need to invest. But if you are included and you have an intrinsic valuation of unit derivative, and that condition should be satisfied with any model, model derivative. Model. The restriction is modeling the practice. Any further feature?
