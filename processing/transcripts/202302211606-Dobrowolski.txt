So not really there shouldn't be anything which is like technically too heavy to digest and mostly I'll just talk about results proved in some contexts in positive logic and maybe a little bit about difficulties but I will not really go through the proof. So yes, if it's about non-stability then probably you can guess the first slide. And And okay, so actually, there are some interesting creatures which didn't make it to this map because they're not first order. So, I want to zoom this map out a bit. So, we zoom it out to the setting of positive or fake positive theories, which was introduced by Vita Renyakov, who's fortunate to be with us already. And I want to kind of I want to kind of uh argue the saying meet a claim that for thick positive theories neural stability works basically as well as for first-order skills, okay, or maybe tension work as well. Okay, saying like first order as opposed to positive first order maybe is not the most correct thing to say, but I would just skip this word full first order. So to me first order is just the usual model theory that we do and positive setting is exceptional okay so what's what's the idea? Setting is extension. Okay, so what's the idea? So, why would you want to consider something more general? Well, there are several ways you can obtain classes which fall into this framework. So, one of them is when you look at non-companionable inductive theory, and then maybe you still want to get some understanding of existentially closed models. So, that's one of the sources of examples. But there are also this kind of examples coming through. Coming from continuous logic or some things of similar flavor, where you want to have a sort or you want to recognize in your structure some classical object like the real numbers. So maybe you want to have metric with real values and you want this to be actual metric, real valued metric, notes like non-standard real valued metrics when you increase the model. So this positive setting is also a way to do this, and in particular we can deal with hyperimaginaries of first-order. Of first-order theories, and also you have some other examples like in bilinear spaces where you want them to be over a fixed field. Then again, you can do it with positive logic, but not with first-order logic. Okay? So maybe I'll just go through the examples which are here later, is each one? Good. So in the bottom, I've just put first order and hyperimaginaries for each of these non-stable classes. Of these non-stable classes. So let's look at the other examples. You have randomizations which preserve NIP, stability, and NSOP1. They don't preserve simplicity. I should also mention names. So this randomization is done by Itai for NAPN stable, and for NSOP1, this was by Itai and by Artium and Nick. Okay, and now this kind of more Robinson theoretics. Robinson theoretics style examples. So existentially closed exponential fields studied by Kirby and Fakassian, existentially closed fields with a submodule studied by Itai Kaplan and by Christian Loubet and Leonard Hauser. And a simple example, bilinear spaces over a fixed spirit, which I've just mentioned a second ago. This was done by Mark Comms. I mean, you want bilinear form which doesn't. Bilinear form which doesn't, like, the field doesn't grow with your structure. So you only have to. Sorry? Predicate for x scalar itself, I would go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You want to add predicates for yes, like the bilinear form on xy equals some fixed real number or complex number, whichever thing you want. Okay, just um let me mention uh very briefly that you can you could actually zoom it out even further, like this. Even further, like this. So, this is abstract non-metric categories, which is a common generalization of abstract non-metric classes and positive theories. And it also does include other examples, which I don't want to explain now because it would take some time. And this framework was developed mostly by Markansma. So, here we only talk about stability, simplicity, and then also P1 because it would be problematic to actually define NIP or NTP2 because you don't have formulas in the setting. It's just you have a category of You have a category of, well, some kind of, you think of them as structures, but these are just objects, and morphisms between them, which are supposed to be thought of as elementary marks. And you can say that you have a nice ternary independence relation, and then, you know, if you have a, using this, you can define stability synthetic and so p1 just referring to existence of independence relations such as good properties. But yeah, it's much less bother theory transcripts also. So, this kind of claim would be maybe problematic in this setting. Nevertheless, there are very interesting theorems showing that some canonicity happens at extremely abstract and general level, like uniqueness of independence variations, which satisfy independence theory of other compartments. Okay. So, first, before I go into syntax, just let me briefly say that positive formula is just one built using conjunction, disjunction. Conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantifier, and you also have these symbols. Sorry, you also have the symbols for formula which is always true and formula which is always false. Okay, always true, you have x equals x, but always false. Sometimes you need to add it because you don't necessarily have x distinct from x in your language. So basically, we're not allowed to use negation and universal quantifier. Now, Now, so this may seem restrictive because we look at less formulas, but actually, you can always make up for it with extending your language if you want. So, if you want, you can moderate your language, and then all these positive formulas will be just the possible formulas. So, this setting actually generalizes the first-order setting and is wider, right? So, it allows also to treat hyper-imaginary structures as just sort of. Sort of analogues of first-order structures, and you can define forking variations and formulas and so on. And more generally, continuous logic also in certain aspects falls into this framework. If you have a continuous theory, you can encode it as a positive theory. Although you do have some machinery in continuous logic, whose counterpart was not sort of looked at in positive model theory, so it's a little bit of a different flavor in these two approaches. And then the Robinson logic, which is studying exercises. Which is studying existentially closed models of well, usually non-companionable inductive theory if you want to be in non-first order setting with the amalgamation property. And there are other examples like this, but inner spaces, it does not fall into any of those categories above for actually some kind of fundamental reasons. Its space of types is not semi-haused, so it cannot sorry it's not housed, so it cannot be seen as a as a continuous structure. As a continuous structure. Okay, it was also used by Prushovsky. Positive logic was used to construct definability patterns, but these are bounded, so although it's like a very interesting thing itself, it's not really relevant to the stock, because the bounded thing is obviously trivially stable, just like finite structure, which is stable. So we're not really interested in that. Now, this is actually a very brief Is actually a very brief overview of the history, and then actually, most of these, or like okay, some of these I will explain in more detail in a second, so this will be very brief. So, this is like the beginnings of this go back to Shellac's observation that basically stability could be done for Robinson logic in parallel with the first order setting. And then it was extended later by Khushovsky. And then, Pillai looked at simplicity in this context. Simplicity in this context. Okay, and the motivation comes from cosmorphisms of stable structures, one of the motivations. And now Itai introduced this broader framework of positive theories. Okay, and there is this thick, this mysterious word thick, which just means that industriality of a sequence is terrible definable. And this is a very, very mild assumption that almost non-examples actually holds. So there is this setting of fake positive theories. Of thick positive theories, and in particular, okay, basically it translates all the simplicity theory from first-order Tutor. And more recently, Heikazian and Kirby looked at existentially closed exponential fields, which again, this is not a companionable theory. And they prove that this is NSOP1 in the sense of positive. So basically, very roughly, existential formulas are NSOP. Roughly existential formulas are NSOP1. Then there is another example of NSOP1 theory by Christian and Itary and Lauren, namely you fix some ring and then you look at the class of fields with R submodule for the string R. You are the predicate for it. And this is always in a Soviet one and often this is non-companionable. For example, if this ring is set, then you just get Is set, then you just get generic and subgroup, and it's known to be not combined. Then Jonathan suggested a project to develop chemical independence in this setting. So we count the sober models with Mark Kamsma. And then recently Mark also came with this example of linear forms. But this is simple, not in a simple. And very recently with Rosario, we looked at NIP, so we basically look at, yeah, we examined the Examples, yeah, the basic theory of NIP, but more interestingly, we have got some algebraic examples which I'll mention later. So, this is just a repetition of what was previously, what was a positive formula. Now, a positive axiom is basically saying that one positive formula defines a set which is contained in a set defined by another positive formula. Okay, and this is basically what we need to take a limit of structure. To take a limit of structures with respect to homomorphism, I am to still be in our class. Okay, so just like you have inductive theories, they're preserved under unions, then this is preserved under units with respect to homomorphisms. And a positive theory is just a set of positive axioms. So we are allowed to express more in the axioms rather than in the formulas that we want to look at within the theory. Now, Now, yeah, we say that the model is positively existentially closed if, whenever you consider some homomorphism and the positive formula phi, if this phi is true, sorry, if it's true after applying your homomorphism to some element, then it must actually be true before applying it. Okay? Do I have this on the next slide? Yes. I have this on the next slide. Yes. So it's similar to the notion of just being existentially closed, except that we're only looking at positive formulas rather than existential formulas. So often these two are the same, but not always. Now, yeah, there is this example to show you that you need to be a little bit careful with choosing your language. So if you choose your language to be just the Your language to be just one binary relation, and you express that this is a strictly narrow order, then actually the existential formulas coincide with positive existential formulas because negations of quantified free formulas here are positively definable again, right? You not say equal if you're greater or smaller, and so on. So, this is just usual existential closedness, and you get tensilinear orders. Linear orders. If you look at non-strict order, then you just get singletons as the existential closed mode. Because whichever structure you consider, okay, let's say you have some structure M, suppose it's existentially closed, you can consider the constant homomorphism. It is a homomorphism because it preserves non-strict inequality. And then, well, if you look at any two elements, x and y, after applying. Elements x and y, after applying this homomorphism, it's true that they are equal. So that must be true before applying this homomorphism. So everything is equal to each other, and you get this situation. So basically, you need to be careful about choice of your language. But it doesn't mean that you always want to add negations of quantify-free formulas, because as discussed before, if you want to have like, you know, this like bounded sorts, like real uh the reals or something like this, then then you don't want to allow negations at some of the Negations of some of the atomic formulas. So, again, this is something basically, or this idea: if we are in the situation where negations of atomic formulas are positively definable, this is just usual notion of existential closeness. Questions? We can continue. So, some very basics of how we adapt the approach from usual model view. The setting, well, we want to have like The setting, well, we want to have, like monster model, we want to have some notion of completeness, first of all. So we say that T has joint continuation property, which is just, well, the adaptation of joint embedding property to this positive setting, where homomorphisms are not necessarily objective. So we basically say you have JCP if for any two models there is a third model and homomorphisms from your two models into the third model. Right? Yeah, so this is another of completeness, and it allows you to construct sort of notion, to construct a notion of a MOSE model. So it will be saturated, but only with respect to positive formulas. But it behaves very, very similar to the usual one. And now, yeah, so we will, like for just software, actually work in such a monster model, we will assume JCP. So, in other words, we kind of assume completeness of our theorem. Assume completeness of our theory. And we say that the set of formulas, okay, a formula will, in this talk, will mean a positive formula. Can you just say broadly what you mean by non-similar in this case? What's the difference? Yeah, like, okay, so it's, for example, it's saturated, but with respect to positive types, okay? But it's also homogeneous, but not with respect to elementary maps, but maps, but to maps which preserve the existential sentences. No, no, no, this is okay, this is this is exactly they need not well, but if no, if they're immersions, then no, this is like if and only if, so then from equality on any side. Yeah, yeah, so it's like for, yeah, if you if you look at elementary maps in this setting, they are injective, homomorphisms are not, but elementary maps or like images. Not but elementary maps or like immersions as we call them they are injective because you want to have if and only if so yeah but the monster model is defined with respect to homomorphisms well so homogeneity is not with respect to homomorphism it's but then it is embedding so that every model embeds in this monster model it is just by homomorphism no no no immersions by immersions immersion No, no, no, immersions, by immersions. Immersions, so sort of counterpart of elementary maps. Okay, so here example is a strict decoding OS there. Yeah. It's the cache CP, because that's my two points, right? Yeah. So what is the Monster model? It's a single point, it's the Muster model. Yeah, I don't know. With great flexibility comes great responsibility. So like with the theory of in our authors, that you gave an example, that this book at the model are just The model are just simpletons. Yes, yes. Yeah, monster model is a simple ton here as well. Nice. Very introvert. Yeah, yeah, because it's with respect, I mean, it allows embedding of immersion of any other existentially closed model. So like counterpart of what you think about model of T is existentially closed model. And any other existentially closed model is a simple tool. So it's true that it's embedded. So it's very universal. It admits, you know, versions of operator T. Admits, you know, versions of. Computer science people would like. Possibly. Okay. Aha. So this was a BI speech, I think? No. Or maybe? Let me check. By a complete type, we mean maximal consistent collection of positive formulas and type of A over B is just a collection of positive formulas which are true. You can also say for home models, you can also say that it's most modeled if every model at least. Every model admits homomorphism input. If it happened to be EC, then this is necessarily an immersion. Yeah. Yeah, but this is just one of the properties of most models. You will also look like kind of homogeneity, right? No, they're just saying that. Yeah, but you don't need to insist on immersion. I mean, immersions are automatic what if the source is all I'm saying. Yeah, right, that's true. Yes, yes. Actually, if you have homomortons from like existentially closed thing, then it's immersion is kind of elementary. Yes, like source. Okay, so. Okay, so we do have a compactness for positive formulas. So a set of positive formulas is consistent if only if every finite subject is. So for example, you can think consistent as a realization of most of all in some packet exception. Now, so what could be problems here? So although we do have compactness, we cannot really use it in all the ways that they are used in first order, because for example, we cannot. First order, because for example, we cannot express the equivalence of two formulas. So it's hard to express intersectability, especially if we don't assume thickness, but it's even more problematic. So working in the model of first-order theory, if you have just a countable sequence, you can find another countable sequence which is locally based on it. And this is not true in positive logic. In positive logic, so this phase is a very easy example. If you look at the positive theory expressing that we have omega-many disjoint predicates, then in tech models, every element satisfies one of these predicates, because otherwise, if it didn't, you can look at homomorphism into a model which in which actually you add these elements to a predicate, and say homomorphism it is in the predicate. After the homomorphism, it has to be default to express positivity that predicates Positively that predicates are disjoint? Not positively, but with these implications of so you can that disjoint positively, but meaning like h inductively, yes? So you are allowed to like say for all x and then implication between two formulas. So you say, okay, p0, let's say, of x and p1 of x implies the bottom, the zero. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Okay. Okay, and this causes problems. So, although we can actually, if we increase the length of AI, we like use this, you know, like this bed omega of t or something like this, then you can actually extract things. And this is very useful for settings like NIP, where we work with sequences. And then if you want to extract something indiscernible, we just start with a sufficiently long sequence. But if you work with trees, then actually get. If you work with trees, then actually it gets more problematic because this indiscernible extracting it uses that it's, you know, that everything can be done at the level of omega or like you don't. You need to keep the track of the cardinality. So this actually, well, it goes into the subtleties of the proof of Scheller, let's say, of indiscernibility, of the extraction of indiscernible genes. Okay, so this causes some serious problems in the NSOP one case, because it's much harder. One case. Because it's much harder to obtain. What's the problem already? Well, you don't have modelling property for indiscernible trees. But okay, at least the proof doesn't work. But why does it follow the sequence of the not the trees? Because the proof is different and much harder. The point is that you don't have the Erdogrado theorem for trees. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yes, yes. For sequences, it's just Erdogrado. For trees, it's like some For trees, it's like s something Erdo Schrado-ish, but much di much more difficult. There is like a version of Erdosrado by Schella, and yeah, it just doesn't work. Okay? Okay, so yeah, this is actually a repetition of this. And yeah, okay, I've already said about this. Now, we've already mentioned thickness and semi-hausedness and house ofness, so we only like talk about thick theories, so this. Theories. So, this says that the condition that your sequence is indiscernible is type-definable. And this is weaker than saying that the condition that types of two elements are equal is type-definable, because, well, if you can express this, then you can apply it to all tuples in your sequence. And, of course, you get type-definability. And there is even stronger conditions of Hausdorffness, which at some level corresponds to continuity to being expressible as a continuous theory by. To be expressible as a continuous theory by results of the type, which basically tells you that the space of types is host of. Where the open sets are components of type definable sets, right? Problems of theory. Yeah, okay, continuous relationship. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh now yeah, so we have this series of implications and and And what I want to say is to develop the stability, all we want is this thickness. So, really, really very bad design. In particular, in this map at the beginning, all the examples were thick. Actually, all of them were semi-host. Now, so I want to discuss three settings: Simplicity, NSOP1, and NAP. So, Simplicity was done quite a while ago, by Itai. While ago, by Tai. So he defines simplicity by saying that dividing independence satisfies local character. And dividing is really defined in an analogous way to first order. And then for thickness, basically, okay, I proved that like everything works the same way as if you have a thick positive theory, then T is simple if and only if you have an independence relation admitting exactly the same set of axioms as you know from the first. Axioms, as you know, from the first-order setting, and this actually characterizes this independence relation. There could be only one such. And without thickness, you also prove that you basically have the same, but over a restricted set of base sets, right? So only some very saturated models. Aha, yes, you can be even less than the thickness. You can just assume a distance and On thickness, you can just assume a distance, and then the rest follows. Yes, actually, that was pointed out by Annette going before that. Okay. But yeah, yeah, as you're saying, the point is that you don't even have A independent from M over M or A independent from B over B if you don't assume thickness, right? So basically, for thickness, everything works exactly as in first order. And there are some other, like, more advanced things from simplicity. More advanced things from simplicity theory like D-ranks, canonical bases, and definable groups, theory of generics, and definable groups, all generalized by this state. Now, okay, there is this example that we shortly discussed in the beginning. The theory of fields with n-committing automorphism is not stable for any n. Yeah, and this kind of suggests a question: well, you have arbitrary group G acting on F. Group G acting on a field, depending on the group, where is going to be this structure on the Nelsagman. Depends on language, right? Yeah, the language means a lot. Yeah, oh yes, it matters a lot. Yeah, so I would say you add multiplication by G, right? And just use your inverse, yes, and then maybe zero. Yes, and then maybe 0, 1. Usual language. So there is an example by Markham's bilinear spaces over fixed fields, as we also sort of like mentioned in the beginning. We fix infinite fields. Okay, it could be finite, but then we are just in the first order setting. So let's say it's infinite, and then we look at the language LK, which is one sorted language of k-linear spaces. So you have a function symbol for multiplication for every scalar. And then you have predicates for your form on xy equals lambda for any. xy equals lambda for any lambda from the k. And then, so what's the problem? Why can't you do it in the first-order logic? Well, if you want to do this in the first-order logic, then by compactness, you will always get in your big models that there are two elements x and y to which no lambda is assigned, right? Because you can always negate a small set of formulas. But if you look at positive logic and you look at positively existentially closed models, Positively existentially closed models, PEC models, then actually you do get genuine bilinear spaces, and moreover, they're characterized as finitely injective k-bilinear spaces. And this also has variance for symmetric bilinear forms or anti-symmetric bilinear forms with exactly the same statement. So yeah, it's such a very nice example, but it's such a question: like, how much can you push it? Like, how general is it? It's like, how general is it? So, basically, you look at some other mathematical structure in which you have some classical objects. Let's say, for example, R-valued field, yeah, R-field with R-C-Median Panigroup. So, this is sort of similar to what Ikai did here, but not, I think actually, if you try to do it like this, you might end up with something which is not Hausdorff, so maybe not really for similar reasons as here, maybe like you will you're not able to amalgamate uh two things uh Two things because maybe you have some elementary extension in the first order sense in which valuations are not assigned to x, and maybe you can put some valuation in one extension and another valuation in another. So this is basically what happens in argument of TANSMA that this theory is not Hausdorff. Hushos you fail amalgamation, but it's sort of funny. Finally injective, okay, so if you have Injective, okay. So, if you have finitely dimensional, say, V0 and then V1 homomorphism, and then injection of embedding of V0 to V, then it extends to injection of V. And these two are finite dimensions. So, it implies V is quite rich. So, don't do this. So it's semi-hausdorff. It's semi-hausdorff. Yes, it is figure. Yes. Okay. Now, yeah, so a little bit more about examples. So this is sort of one of the motivations behind Itai's work on simplicity. So you have, you know, this usual notion of a type of a hyperimaginary, which this is a conjunction of the stype-definable conditions, overall formulas in the. Definable conditions, so we're all formulas in the type of AD. But the question is: you know, can you actually see formulas here? And you cannot really see it as first order because if you negate such a guy, it is not type-definable anymore. So you cannot do it in first order, but you can still say that you declare it as a formula in positive logic. And then if you apply eta is machinery, you actually get back the usual notion of a type in hyperimaginary source, which was considered actually this order. Which was considered actually before you. Yes. Okay, so this is the solution. How to see it uniformly. And recently, also by Bjorn have considered hyperimaginaries in these current objects. So it shows that actually hyperimaginaries could be useful also beyond simplicity and such, motivation to look at them and more general setting of positive theories for an SOP one. Theories for SOP1. But we also have these other examples. So this is okay, let me be very brief because we've seen already this definition. So I could just say what's the difference between the original first order definition of NSOP1 and the positive definition. So this was in the paper by Hackers and Kirby. Well, the difference is that when you're saying this is, okay, maybe let me start from here. That this thing is inconsistent, you want to. Is inconsistent, you want to find a positive reason for this because you want these kind of configurations to be preserved under homomorphisms. So you need kind of like positive weakness that these two formulas are mutually consistent. So for this, you are demanding that you actually have another formula psi of xy, which tells you that if it holds on two different parameters, y0 and y1, then the corresponding instances of phi are inconsistent. Yes, sorry. Yes, yes. So formula means positive. Yes. So this is the only difference. And of course, if you specialize it to first-order logic, you get exactly what you hoped for. So basically, here with Mark Kamzma, we've generalized the theory of team independence of our model, and we got all the properties from the usual work of Artium with Nick and Nick with Itai, and Junghan with Artium and Nick. Actual mechanic, and all. Like all together, this gave the full Kimpi-like style independence theorem in first-order logic, and we generalized this to thick positive theories. We had to use Lascar invariant types rather than invariant types for trivial reason that invariant types might not exist in thick set, like invariant extensions of your type over a model, if I do exist. Okay, so Okay, so now, okay, this is the statement of the theorem. So, here I wrote for Semi-Hausdorff, but there is also a version for thick, where you just replace equivalence of types by Lascar equivalence. And this is Laskar equivalence over models. So, in first-order settings, this is the same as just equivalence of types, but in positive, these two things are different. Lascar equivalence over model, which is not sufficiently big, might be different from. Sufficiently big might be different from equivalence. Well, okay, you look at indecency sequences like with respect to positive formulas, what one is bigger. So, okay, so this is basically the theorem was already discussed. So, let me just move on unless you have some questions. And as I mentioned, the technical difficulties in this proof come from the fact that that we don't really have this uh three indiscernible three three models. In the Roman counter, you don't care that the MI decides possible. My side that was deep. Nothing at the work, I think, but what we had in local character was the local side. And yeah, right, okay. This is to be weaker. Yeah, take up the VT plus for that. Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, I think. Okay, I think this this, yeah, might be an. Yeah, it might be necessary to put the T, but so this was basically we put the same proof as yours, so I guess there shouldn't be much difference. There were some differences in proofs of symmetry and in the penance theorem and transitivity, but here it's your argument, so unless there is some trivial reason for dropping these assumptions. Yeah, you might be right. Yeah, thanks for checking. So if you're in a C theory, this being like for example B minimiser will be a green discernible and this type of discernible. Um yeah I think yes, I I I think I think the answer is yes, yes. Okay, so we actually used some kind of weaker notion of modeling where we only preserve EN type and we used that this EN type tells you it's indiscernible. So yeah, I think it's true. I mean I think we've used it, but it was a while ago. If an SOP theory of existence, then Kim's lemma holds over arbitrary Existence, then Kim's lemma holds over arbitrary sets. So we have this, and then in view of Nick's cock from yesterday, this probably should suggest that we can then somehow get for free all the properties of our arbitrary sets. Hopefully, okay, so I'm looking forward to seeing the work of Nick with Italy. Also, existent transfers from, if you have a first-order theory T0, which satisfies existence, then this also satisfies an actual analog. As an actual analogy of existence, and then the scheme dema falls. So we can do all hyperimaginary source. All right, but actually in this case of hyperimaginary extension, this was basically already developed by Bon Busu, the student of PRAM. This is also key one of the zero paper. Yes, it is. So all the properties you've seen on the map, they are preserved by. On the map, they are preserved by, for instance, by GPU concepts. Okay, and two more examples of NSOP1 theory. So, in exponentially closed, sorry, existentially closed exponential fields, chemical dependence is given by ACF independence of the smallest closed exponential subfields generated by the sets AC, BC, and C. Okay, so basically to obtain this AC, you have to iterate ACF closure with up. To iterate ACF closure if applied exponential map. So you have omega steps and then you get this exponential algebraic closure. And in the work of Christian Laure, the king independence is given by ACF independence together with this nice condition that if you generate algebraically closed field AC and BC and then you intersect with your submodule, you get the same as uh when you first intersect with uh with the submodule and then uh and then uh other. And then other together. Okay? So obviously, okay, if you are here in the right-hand side, you're also on the left-hand side, but the point is the other important point. Now, yeah, I will talk briefly about NIP, the joint project with Rosario. So, definition of NIP, again, we want to have a positive weakness to the inconsistency condition. So, we are looking at NIP, we want to say that if you have your formula phi together with you know if you have your formula phi together with this uh a i in omega and say b w is indexed by subsets of omega if sorry it should be small i here again here if small i is in w then the formula holds but if it's not then not only the formula does not hold but you have some positive witness for this uniform. So just for phi you have this negation of psi inconsistent with phi such that whenever i is not in w you have this negation of of phi. This negation of fall, this positive negation of five here. And then alternation number we define it for a pair of positive formulas which are usually inconsistent like here, meaning like you count the alternations between phi and psi, not just between phi and negation, of phi, what between phi and topsi. And then basically, yeah, everything seems to transfer. So you have alternation number characterizes IP, and then it's enough to check. And then it's enough to check NIP in a single variable. Also, set of NIP formulas is closed under conjunction and disjunction, and under reverting order of variables. Now, with counting types, it's slightly more subtle because usual version of color doesn't work in the sense that, again, trivial reason, they need not exist. So, there is an example by Poisar, but I think it was noticed by Rosario, that in this example, Telling that in this example you don't have any invariant extension. So, in fact, okay, you don't have positive cohorts. So, you don't have types which satisfy the condition that whenever you take a formula from them, then it's finitely satisfiable in some small model. But you always do have negative coherence, so that's why we consider this definition. So, it says that if you have phi routine. Phi, if you have phi which is not in P, then its negation has a realization in the submodel M. So sometimes we call this still like members of, like negative members of our type, although I prefer the formalism when we just treat E as a set of positive forms. And then this actually allows you to transfer the usual content type here. So T is an IP even only if you have this bound on the number of invariant extensions, and this is actually. Extensions and this is actually always weaknessed by negative cohorts. I mean, if this does not hold, then this is because of negative coheres, so you have this third. Also, another county counts. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I am. Right, I didn't look at this before. But we did look at border definability, and then you basically, okay, you kind of have boreal definability, but if the size of t is uncountable, then you may need to intersect like. You may need to intersect like the size of T. Okay, I don't know if you will need it, but what we were able to prove is that you can obtain it as a conjunction of size of T many quantifier-free conditions. So if the language is tantable, you just get portal definability of types. I'm not sure if it holds for untantable language. So I think that's the question. Is that true in first-order logic? Yeah, I think in first-order logic is. Okay, now very briefly, especially because there is like large intersection with Hobert Wolfak. So, this is this example I discussed there. So, this is kind of our motivating example for studying NIP, order WN groups without automorphisms. So, if you have a linear order, if you have SOP, you up-generate automorphisms, and you never coincide with it. So, this is not first-order setting, but still you have NIP. And NIP, the way we obtain it is we prove amalgamation property, which does. prove amalgamation property, which then amalgamation property for universally axiomatized theory tells you that in PEC models, existential closed models, every existential formula is definable to possibly infinite conjunction of quantified free formulas. And then by compactness, from this you can see that it's actually enough to check NIP for quantify-free formulas or atomic formulas, and this is just very easy. Nothing can do fine. Variables can do it by. Now, finally, okay, so the question is actually suggested by Nick, like to get a full characterization, where adding automorphism preserves Nick. So actually, the most honest answer is still that I have no idea. Can you go back to the study? Well, I mean, you've seen it a month ago. All the Nebelian groups will be tomorrow. Yeah. So I don't really have a good idea what would it be, but let me fantasize a little bit, right? A little bit, right? So, okay, so first, like, how far can you push the techniques we developed with Rosario? I think there is a non-zero chance that it would work for omina theories just because of the structure of the proof. For digital theory, I don't really have any arguments why it would work, but I also don't see why it wouldn't. So maybe just an NIP of your And NIP of of your generic automorphism adds to your theory. Assuming the initial theory was called. So I yeah, so yeah. So okay. Uh I think assuming the initial theory was ominal, there sh is some kind of reason to believe that you will still have NIT after adenocotomorphism. For this theory, I don't know, but maybe. And then sort of using these characterizations in stable theories where when you get when you preserve an When you preserve NIT, basically, by Zoe and Tamant and by Scheller, and the decomposition of Pierce-Mon, you know, to like compressible parts and to generally stable parts, so sort of distal part and generally stable part, maybe you can somehow put all of these together and only check this condition in generally stable types. But this is like very, very speculative. What? Yeah, if you have this style theory, you add automorphism, whether you are still an ID. Okay? Question. Very briefly, okay, NTP2. Again, let's not go through the definition. Just a question. There was nothing really seriously studied here. Yeah, can you generalize the theory of NTP2? For example, can you generalize this nice independence theorem of eta and t tai? Oh, is it R2? Instead of Oh, is it Arcto? Instead of instead of who? Instead of you. Oh, sorry, Arcto. Sorry. Is that it Arcto? And it's very final question. Look at the theory of valued fields. Sorry, valued different fields. Is it NTP2? Maybe it's a silly question, but I don't see a limited reason why it wouldn't be. Philosophy is: you've already dealt with the value group, because we understand an active. Because we understand the NNP for values different uh sorry for for uh all those groups uh automorphism and maybe residue feed is not too harmful uh for NTP2 and maybe cut some hope all together but I don't know. Okay, thank you. Alright so there are a lot of questions during this time too but we have time so more questions? So I wanted to go back to Artemis' question. So the claim was that if you're an ethic positive theory should be tied to findable, say, of a collection of people, they form a tree, wouldn't it? Yeah, I think it should be true because you can kind of definitely we were sort of running into this kind of problem and then it wasn't like immediately. Like immediately obvious, but we sort of had to. Okay, so you fix your tuple, and then you want to, okay, you only interested in equality of the type of this and this, but then you extend this to actual, you know, like infinite sequence, and then you express that this is indiscernible. And then it extends to an indiscernible sequence space. Yeah, but for some reason, I think I only was able to express the like Alaska distance at most two. Like last car distance at most two. I'm not sure why. But at the moment, I don't remember why. But we kind of, okay, maybe I was able to find, like, okay, look at this pair and then find another thing and put this and this on an industrial sequence and this and this using using industrial condition. So yeah, yeah, I mean, it is true. It is true. I can show you later. But I was talking about this tree discernible, but if something is a tree discernible, then these two Descentable, then these two guys would be on an indescrible sequence. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think they would be on Atlaska distance at most. Yeah, maybe a posterior, yes. Oh, oh, that's a question, okay, sorry. Yeah, I'm actually not sure. Definitely there was something with distance too. But you can also express distance too. Yes, yes, exactly. That's why it works. That's why it works. Right then? What is it? Two layers.
