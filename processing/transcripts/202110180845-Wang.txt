So we have the second talk of the second session, and it's my pleasure to welcome Professor Shu Shawg from Australia National University, who will talk about the LP-Minkowski problem. Please. Thank you. First, I would like to thank the P, Professor Yev. Professor Yef talk for organizing this workshop and give us the opportunity to communicate our results. So today my talk is about the LPM ecology problem. I find this screen. Okay. Okay. So the LPM encoder problem was introduced by Lufth. Was introduced by Luther in 1993. The problem is some kind of extension of the classical microscope problem. So in the complex bodies, so far he introduced the P sum. Then based on P sum, then not worker, he introduced the LP microscopy problem. Then we have the equation. This is the equation. This is the equation, a multiple equation on the sphere. And here f is a given function. The h h is the supporting function. H is a supporting function of a closed convex hypersurface M. And in the equation here, I is the user matrix. F is a given function, non-negative function, and p. function and the p is a constant so i will use this to denote the lp includes problem so given a closed convex hub surface m then we can define the supporting function by this formula so i will use a picture in the next page to explain A picture in the next page to explain the supporting function and the hyper surface. So if we have a convex solution to the LPM including problem, then we can also recurve the hyperset M simply by this formula. If a p equals one, then we have this equation, and this is the classical. And this is the classical microservices problem. So it's easier to draw a picture and explain the relationships between these quantities. So give me a convex hypothesis. Here is a curve, but anyway, it's true for all dimensions. So the curvature in the case of a curve that is equal to this quantity. Quantity and given the hyper surface M, then given any point X, X, on the user sphere, so X is X is the point on the user sphere. So X is the user vector. Then at any point at theta, any point at theta, so we have the outer number is X, the HX is a supporting function. The supporting function is a distance from the origin to the tangular plane or the hypersurface m at the point theta. Then any piece on the hypersurface, the area of this piece is equal to this integral. So here, this is the determinant of this hash matrix. Then g gamma g Then g gamma g is the Gauss Map. And the volume of this duct part, this duct part is equal to this integral. And we have this very useful relation that is the eigenvalues of this Hessian matrix is equal to the principal ready of the hypersurface. Hypersurface. So therefore, the Gauss met the Gauss curvature, the Gauss curvature K is equal to this number. So it's the Gauss curvature. Then we have the volume. If we computed the outline equation of this volume function, then we obtain this municipal operator. So these are the basic. So these are the basic, very basic factors about the machine variation on the sphere. So to study the P menculative problem, L P motivation problem, we may compare our equation with this very popular simulated elliptic equation. So for the simulated ellipse equation, I use this rotation p data to load this equation because here the operator Question because here we the operated data. So, this is a prescribing scale curvature on manifold if a p is equal to this number. So, this is the critical. So, this number p is a critical exponent in the sober inequality. So, if we consider the RP inequality problem, this is our equation, then it is the prescribing Gauss-Coch equation if a p equals one. Gauss colleague equation if p equals one, so it's the microjol, then we have a critical exponent, it is p equals minus n minus one. And this critical expense is related relative to the Braschkis and Tano inequality. So these two equations, there are kind of similarities between these two equations. Similarities between these two equations because both of them are related to a famous inequality. And because of the inequality, we can divide the problem into three cases. One is so-called subcritical case, one is a critical case, and the other one is the supercritical case. So let's make a very brief review of the results for. Review of the results for the for this equation, this is the semi-linear equation by the solar embedding then by three cases in a sub-click in a sub-critical case. That's it, that is the impede in this range. Then we have the uniform estimate. We have a uniform estimate for solutions. And because of the uniform estimate, then we can prove the existence of solutions under suitable conditions. So, why we have the uniform Why do we have the uniform estimates? That's because by blow-up, then the low solution to this equation ERN, UFP, is in the subtle in this range, low low-zero solution. Then in the critical case, then if I equal to one here, then it's the Yababi problem. For general R, then it's the prescribing scale culture problem. Describing skeletal problem. And it's well learned that I should mention that the RIP problem is finally solved by Xiong, or because before Xiong, but other people made contributions. But because we don't focus on this problem, so we just want to make it very brief. And after that, then a few years ago, then a few people like Brenda, Xiong, Marcus, they proved that. They prove that the set of solution is compact if n if the dimension is less than or equal to 24. And then in the proof, a very important property is that the unique geometric profile for the global limits is a function. We know that these unique global limits, that's a very important and every important and every other argument is based on that property. Then for the supercritical case, for the supercritical case, when p is greater than this number, then many people have tried to work on the problem and you can find many papers, but all the papers only consider very special cases under some special conditions. So this is for the seamlinear elliptical equation. The same linear elliptic equation. Then, for our problem, for the LP McCulloch problem, then by the Black P centannium inequality, we also have three cases. In a sub-clinical case, that is when P is greater than minus 1, then we can prove the existence of solutions, but we do not have a uniform estimate. This was a surprise to me actually. I thought before in the sub query, we should have a uniform estimate. Quick because we should have uniform estimates, but I worked on the problem with my collaborators and later we found that there is a low uniform estimate. Then the low uniqueness when P is negative. In the quadratic case, when P equals MS1, an important property is that this quantity is irrelevant under projective transforms. Transforms. So this invariance makes the equation very interesting and useful. And the equation, when the right side is continent, then the solution must be episode. And such kind of episode is called elliptical affine spheres, because this is a very important quantity in affine geometry. But very little is learned. But very little is learned for the extension of the RP critical problem for general F. The reason is that in the critical case, if you use a block argument, you do not have the classification of the block limits. That's the main problem. So here is my remark: the LPM because of its. My remark: the LP mechanism is more complicated than the P data problem. First, in the subcritical case, it does not have the uniform estimates. So, uniform estimates in the subcritical case is true for the P data problem, but also for our P-me-click problem. And the block limits is unique for the P data problem, but also for RP membrane problem. So, these are two very important properties. Very important properties are true for the p-data, but not for the p-microgy problem. So it looks like the p-mequility is much more complicated than the p-data problem. But on the other hand, very recently, with my collaborator, Guan Chiang and Chile Li, we proved that in the shape credit case, in the shape of credit case, we proved that the solution for all See the solution for all the supercritical equivalents. But on the other hand, as I mentioned before, for the p-data problem, very little is learned in the supercritical case. So that is why I want to give a talk today on this LP material problem. So this is my reason for my talk today. so i make a i draw this very uh this picture to see the value of a p so this is our equation p magnetic problem then this is the p if a p equals m plus one then this equation is homogeneous so we can regard it as some kind of eigenvalue problem if p equals one If p equals one, then the value side h to power p minus one and validation h equals one, then it is the classical menu problem. If a p equals zero, then it is called the logarithm mean quality problem. Therefore, p greater than if in this range, if p greater, p greater than this number, minus n minus one, then it's the sub. mash1 then it's the subcritical case where p less than this this blue line then the supercritical case then p equals the mass mass one then it is the critical case and it is affine invariant and in this case the problem is called central affine mequicity problem and i mentioned quite a few times the blasphemy is antenna inequality it is this this one so for any convex closed For any convex closed hypersurface M, we have this inequality. We first take shoop in H. So H is the supporting function of the hypercept M. Then we take inf casi. Here, cosi is any point inside the hypercept m. So cosai is a point. Then the integral here, the volume of the hyper volume enclosed. volume enclosed by the half surface half surface m and this here the integral y over h is supporting function minus cassette dot x h minus cassette cassette dot x actually is the supporting function if you translate the hyper surface m such that the data is origin then h mass curve x is the supporting function of the hyper surface Function of the hub surface after this translation. So, this is the brush case antenna inequality. So, to talk about this LP mechanical problem, of course, we should mention the classical mercurial problem. So, the classical mechanical problem is this one that was solved many years ago. So, and the result is very clean. That is very clean and very beautiful. So, if f is a positive and here, I assume with continuous, but this continuity is not needed actually. And we can assume it's L infinity. Then there is the solution U, which is a unique option translation to the Minkowski problem if and only if F satisfies this condition. Satisfy this condition. And this problem actually was introduced by biomimicry, and he proved that these weak solutions, then we want to learn if these smooth solutions and in dimension two, that was Lindenberg and Polyloff independently, they provide the existence of a smooth solution. Then hard dimension, In Haita mentioned, it is a problem of an Xenya. They obtained a smooth solution. To continue, then we should mention some important property or applications. First, I would like to mention that this equation is invariant and projective transform. And projective transforms. So that means a solution to this problem if and only if it is an ellipsoid of the volume B1. Because obviously B1, if H is identical equal to 1, then it's a solution. Then, because the equation is irrelevant under a fine transform. So any affine transform and any transform of a unimodulous matrix, then it is still a solution. And this episode are called elliptical financial fields. And I mentioned before that the projective environments makes the equation important in image processing. There was a paper by these four guys. One also, I think everyone knows him. Other people, maybe people don't know. They have a paper with this title, this study this equation, and they call this equation fundamental equation in image processing. Because why? Because they emphasize that this equation is evaluated. That this equation is irrelevant and projective and transform. Then the LP record problem is related to another important application that is the gauss culture flow. So if we consider a set of similar solutions to the gauss culture flow, then so this is the gauss culture flow. If we can see the set of similar solutions, then we have this equation. Solution, then we have this equation. Then, an open problem. So, the galaxy could follow, I think it was first studied by Kaisin Sov for alpha equals one. Then the solution shrinks to a point in fact at the time. Then an open problem was the uniqueness of the self-semblance solution. That means the uniqueness of this equation. The uniqueness of this equation. So, this was a major problem in this area. And it was proved that the uniqueness was proved by Ben Char in a case of an alpha equal to one of n. That by Andrew, he proved the result for dimension n equals two and alpha equals one. And this is the conjecture by Fiery. And also in the case of an alpha equals one of n plus two. equals one of n plus two then by and he proved that the solution must be an ellipsoid then the problem is general case of the final resolved by choice and that's the color polis for alpha in this range then by blender he joined it in then they solved the problem in all this They solved it probably in all this case. But for our LP recovery problem, it was connected, it connected related to the allisotrophic gautical flow. That means the gautical flow will have a factor F. So F is not a constant. Then I see of some solution. some solution satisfy this equation this equation so this is exactly the LP material problem for p equal to this number so because of this region then the problem has been studied by many many people so here I mentioned a few lamps here but the LP microphone in recent years had attracted more attention than Attracts more attention than that was started by even more people. So I listed the very people's name here. A special case of the LP mechanology problem is the case of MP equals zero. And people call it the logovism mechanism problem. And in this problem, a very famous result was by followed by and lot of work yan and zan they obtained the certain sufficient condition for the existence of solution when f is even so today i will talk about the existing eulocentric regularity for the airport problem but our main focus on results Focus on results by myself and my collaborators. So, here are my collaborators, Kai Sen Tao, Guan Chan, Chile Li, I just mentioned, we just solved the supercritical case. And also, a few years ago, I also collaborated with Faiyuji and Lujian. So, for regularity, it has many different regularity. This gravity theory for Marshall Black equation. So let's just recall the result for the Marshall Bay equation. For the Marshall Bay equation, if phi, the right side of phi, is a positive and holy continuous, then you strict convex and you see to alpha. We can apply proposition one to the KRP micro problem. So if f, we assume, we assume f is part of Assume F is positive and C alpha. Then the solution H to the RP McCulloch problem is alpha if H is positive. So if you want to know if the solution is smooth, then you just need to check if H is positive. So we know that H is positive, if and only if the orbiting is lost on the hyper surface. Surface hyper surface m then how can we know that the object is less on the hyper surface m then if a p is greater than or equal to m plus one or if a p is small then we can show that the h is a positive then for other p, for p in the other ranges then it may happen that the origin is on the hyper surface then in this case then In this case, then H may not be positive. But in that case, then the solution is still smooth at other points, except near the origin. If the origin is on the hyper surface, then the solution may not be smooth near the point, but it is still smooth elsewhere. So, for the solution, I think we do not have much to say. So, in the following, we will just focus on the existing uniqueness of the solution. Let's go back to the picture. So, we have different cases. This is the picture we have talked before. Well, P is greater than n plus 1, then p equals n plus 1. This is the homogeneous. Then p equals n plus one, this is the homogeneous case, then we have the eigenvalue problem. Then, for p between this range, we have a light case. Then, if a p equals one, then it is the classical mucus problem. If a p is in this range, then it's some kind of a subcode case. If a p equals zero, then it's a logarithmic problem. If a p equals minus n minus one, then it's a central fine mechanism problem. Central R5 problem. That is the critical case. Therefore, P less than less than minus n minus one, then it is a supercritical case. So we have so many different cases. So in following, I will talk case by case. There are so many different cases. And of course, we cannot tell details about all the cases. Details about all the cases. So I think for the results in the cases from case one to case five, this results, actually, there are a lot of new results. There are very old results, actually. Some of them are many years ago, and some of them, like the line leak, like the line leak infinity solution, it was published a few years ago. Only in the case six. In the case six, it is the result we obtain a very vision. So for people working in this area, let me, if you are interested in my talk, so let me first jump to the last cases and talk about the new results. Then I will see how much time left. Then I will talk about the early other cases. So let's go back to the end. Other cases. So let's go back to the end of case six. Oh, here I should. Case is supercritical case for P less than minus M minus one. In this case, a typical result is ituvian without Andrew. He considers the Temperature flow of a curve, not a hypersurface dimension one. So, this M is a curve in R2. Then he considers this curvature flow. Then a question is what is the like like that is what is the several solution for this. Self-semple solution for this flow. Then he proved that if alpha is in this range, then the only embedded homothetical contracting solution, that means self-serving solution, are circles. So for alpha in this range. So for alpha less than one of eight, then he can prove that they are embedded. Embedded homothetically contracting solution or circles are the self-simple solutions as well as unique unique optor rotation and scanning curve gamma k alpha and this gamma k alpha is a k-fold symmetry for each integer. So this is intriguing results. And he also clarified, he also showed that if alpha becomes very small, then the solution is very close to circle. So this is an interesting result. And it was published in JMS. So our main result is, as I mentioned, this is a result of Baguan Chai and actually we just have We just finished the paper. So we can see the ship clear case P in this range. We assume F is a positive and bounded. Then this is the solution to this LP included problem. The main difficulty is to prove the result. The main difficulty is the lack of a uniform estimate. If you have a uniform If you have a uniform estimate, then the highway gravity for the Monchable equation now is standard. So the main thing is to establish the uniform estimate. Now, how to prove that? Our strategy is to use gauss coverage flow plus a topological method. Now, what is topological method? We use topological method to choose a very special initial condition such that the solution to such that the solution to the gauss coverage flow satisfy the uniform estimates. So this is our idea to prove the theorem. Then in the following, it's the main steps. So we choose this Gauss culture flow. So actually we do not mind what kind of gaussi culture flow to choose. Actually you can choose a different gauss. Actually, you can choose a different Gaussian culture flow as long as it satisfies a couple of basic properties. The first one is that we have the functional for the problem. So, this is the functional. So, the gauss curvature flow must be monotonous, either decreasing or increasing. So, this is the fundamental property we must have. So, for this gauss curvature flow, then it is increasing. Increasing for the function. You can choose a different gauss culture for as long as I said it as a couple of fundamental properties. So this is Gaussian flow when we have the functional. The next we need to another property of the Gaussian curve flow and actually functional. This is This proposition says that for any constant A, we should go ahead and this value. So J is a functional. J is a functional. If any of the quantities among this, if any quantity among these four is sufficiently large, then the functional is greater than A zero, the constant. And here, E m. And here, Em is the eccentricity or the minimal export of the hyper surface M. And here the volume M, volume M to power minus one, but distance from the origin to the hyper surface M. So this proposition says that if the shape of the Of the hyper surface is bad, or if the volume is too large, or if the volume is too small, or if the distance to the hyper surface is too close, then the value of the functional will be very large. And this property is very easy to prove, but it is very functional fundamental. So, the proof is that if the volume is large, then because If the volume is large, then because we have this inequality, so of course. If either of the other three quantities is large, that means the origin is very close to the hyper surface. So in a functional, we have two items. The first one is a volume. The second one is this integral. And here p is negative, very negative. And negative, I mean, this is this is this is. like means this is this this is this is minus one minus p become positive so this integral becomes very large so we have this proposition two so as i said probably two means if m had a bad shape or too close to the origin or the volume is too big or too small then the functional becomes very large so this is the water this is the property This is the property. Now we can prove the theorem, and the proof consists of the following steps. First, we introduce a set of episodes. We use A to derive a set of episodes. The ellipsoids that origin is in the interior of the episode, and the volume of episode is not too small. Is a lot too small, so the V bar is more constant, not too large. And the eccentricity of the episode is bounded. So this means, so here the rotation means that any electrode in the domain, so in the cell A has a good shape, share of size, and has a positive distance from the origin. So this is the picture. So this is the feature of the set A. Next, we modify the Gautic flow such that for any initial condition, the solution exists for all time. Why we want to modify the graphical flow? That is for convenience of the proof. So any solution you can test for all time at a maximum statement is simple. Makes our statement simpler than how to modify the solution. So we so given an initial condition, then we have a short-time solution, then we keep going, then the solution to the gaussi flow. If for all the time, if the functional, the value of the function is bounded by a zero, then we let. Then we let m bar equals mt. So we do not change the flow. If at any time it happened that the function, the value of functional is greater or equal to a zero, then we fixing, we flee the hub surface and we do not use the Gaussian culture flow anymore. Then we just choose this hyper surface. We fix this hub surface for all time afterwards. All time afterwards. So, this is the modified follow. Now we come to the key idea. The key idea for the proof is that we want to prove that for any given time, so here, for any fixed given time t, there exists an initial hyperset n, of course, n depends on t, and n is in the set A. A such that the minimum episode of the modified solution is the user ball. And here the user ball is centered at the origin. And the idea is that if it's not true, then we can define a continuous mapping per psi from A to its boundary, such that the mapping is equal to the identity mapping on the boundary. The identity mapping on the boundary. That implies the topology of the boundary is simpler than the topology of the set itself. But we know that usually, given a set, the topology of the boundary is a lot simpler than the cell itself. So here, then we can compute the how the The homologic group of A and the boundary dA, then we reach a condition. Sorry, we reach a contradiction. Then, of course, this to compute the homology of A and D, this is a very difficult job. Actually, at the beginning, I didn't think it's possible, but my collaborators, Guan China, Xiu Di, they work hard. Guan China Zhu Li, they work hard and they asked some of their friends because we are lost in the area. But finally, they were able to work out the old dimension. So that's a very difficult job for them to do. But anyway, finally, we are able to calculate the homologic group of these two sets. This process, then we obtain a configuration. This is a key step. Then, once we have this step, then we can choose sorry, what happened? Why? Just maybe just close and Close and reopen. Okay, a little bit close and reopen. Strange. Okay, does it look okay? Okay, so I finished the first few steps, then now we come to the next one. Steps, then now we come to the next few steps. We cannot see your screen. You cannot see my screen. No, maybe you have to share screen again. Okay, let me share screen again. But it didn't work. I click on the share screen, but it it doesn't strange strange I click the share screen, but okay, it comes. Oh, okay. Okay, now we can see your screen. No, it's okay. Yes. Okay. So let me see. How many time do I? Oh, you can take a few more minutes. Okay, then I can finish this slide. I think it's time almost. So. So so so we this is the key idea. Then next we choose if the minimum absolute of so for the because of the key key idea here, so that means by the contradiction, then The contradiction, then there exists a special hyperset that at a time t, the minimum absorpt of m bar t is usable. So we have reached this step. Then if the minimum episode we have reached this step is useful, then we can show that by the multiplicity of the function. Modelicity of the functional under the Gauss curvature flow, then we know that the functional, the value of the functional is abounded by this constant for all time before t before t so that means this m bar t is equal to m t. So, here this here, I should also have bar. So, this bar is not here. So, that means. So that means the minimum episode of the solution is in the cell A for all time before t. But we have explained that any episode in the cell A has a good shape, has a suitable volume, and is not close to the origin. So we have very good properties for the solution. Now we can take a sequence Tk to infinity, then we obtain a sequence of the initial condition. Because they all have, as I said, a good shape, suitable volume, and a lot close to the origin, of course, it converges by subsequent limit. Limit. This limit is still in cell A. It's a good initial condition. And because we take this limit, so this limit, this good properties is true for all the time. Therefore, we obtain a sequence, we obtain a very special initial condition such that the solution to the gauss. Say that the solution to the gas coast flow has a good shape for all time. A lot to the side, they're not big, a lot small, and the origin is not close to the boundary. Sorry, origin is not close to the hypersurface. Therefore, we can use the monotonicity of the functional and we can prove the convergence using the regulatory theory for each and a pair. For ellipse and a parabolic multi-byquis, then we can prove at the commodity limit. And this limit is the solution to the PM equals problem. So that fits the proof. And I think also the time, I have used all the time. So let me stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much for this very nice talk. Maybe we have time for some quick question. Professor Wong, can you go back to the class of A? The last third page? Yes. Yes, no, the one. Yeah. So it looks like if you take a fine transform for the ellipsoid, I mean, if you take a fine transform for the epidemic, I mean if you take a fine transform for this class, it's still inside a fine transform for this problem. You have the keyboard origin should be originally you cannot change the origin that affine transform. Yeah, but if you take a fine transform of ellipsoid is still it's not But when p is in a shoop critical case, then the equation is not invariant under affine transform. So we do not use affine transform in this case. And if p is in the credit case, then the equation is invariant under affine transform. Well, what I mean is if sometimes you take a function to the side, you can get the ball immediately. Immediately. But I'm not sure because if you make a transform, then you can't change it. Because it creates a lot of fine environment in a supercritic case. I see, I see. Okay. Thank you.
