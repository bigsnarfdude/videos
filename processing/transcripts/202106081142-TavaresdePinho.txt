And I want to acknowledge the funding of Portuguese Science Foundation and two host institutions in Lisbon and Porto, and also the availability of computing resources in PRESE and also in Coimbra and in Brazil. Now, our motivation has been the calculation of visco-elastic thermal flows for engineering, where the use of EMS is prohibited. And in order to do these engineering calculations, In order to do these engineering calculations, we either resort to Reynolds-Everage and Stokes type of closures, for which a lot of work has been done over the last 20 years for viscolesic fluids, but essentially for channel flows or LES. Now, the RENS models have limitations, inherent limitations in unsteady flows, in flows with separation, in flows with curvature rotation, but especially in unsteady flows where the unsteadiness is associated, is induced by the turbulence. Associated is induced by the turbulence itself. An option to do that and to solve the shortcomings is to use large articles simulation. There is much less work done for visceral acid fluids. The earliest work, as far as we know, was by Gilman Montp√©rat and his co-authors, Lille. And then this has been used by Wang. But these models, first of all, it's called a temporal LES, which is a rather complex and elaborate. Which is a rather complex and elaborate way of doing LES. And there were some shortcomings in the models that they point out in the paper. And it was done for channel flow. Now, channel flow is, I say, the most complicated startup to develop LES models because LES was built on the inherent scale separation between the large scales and the small scales. And in channel flow, as you go close to the walls, this is exactly where this large scale separation fails. And so it's the harder. Fails. And so it's the hardest flow to start doing developing LES models. And that's the reason why we entered into this business by looking first at homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in this 2016 paper where we developed the so-called distortion similarity model. And the purpose of this talk today is to show you what happens to the distortion similarity model when we have it inhomogeneous flow, but still away from walls. But still away from walls. And for that purpose, we have selected a planajet. Now, the way this is done is based on DNS, so the planar jet flow. DNS, by the way, that was presented in the previous workshop in RedWare two years ago. But based on that DNS, we test individual closures for the sub-grid scale terms that appear in the login equations. And once we have all the individual closures, we put all of them together and see how they behave together. See how they behave together at the same time, the so-called a posteriori analysis by performing the LES. The code where we do the DNS and the LES is the same. It's a pseudospectral code in the Y and Z. Y is the transverse direction, Z is the span wise. And in the streamwise direction, the derivatives are discretized using compact, six-order compact differences. And the evolution of time uses. Uh, the evolution time uses a three-step third-order run kuta. The code is, of course, parallelized. Um, we have for the viscoelastic equation for the Phinep, we use also central differences. You cannot use a spectral for the Phinep equation, and we use second-order central differences. And the stabilization method is the crude and altered more that we saw used by Theran and Collins for the very first time about 15 years ago. About 15 years ago in DNS of channel flow. The domain equations for the Phini-P for the DNS of Phini P fluid are these: the continuity equation, the linear momentum equation, where the fluid extra stress is the sum of the polymer stress and the Newtonian solvent. And the polymer stress is described by the PhiP model here written, in which the polymer stress is a function of the confirmation tensor, and then there is the evolution equation for the confirmation tensor. For the conformation tensor. Now, remember that this difference here appears both in the polymer stress equation and here in the evolution equation for the confirmation tensor. But we do LES. And in LES, what we do is we, instead of resolving all scales, we only resolve large scales and have to model the small scales, what is called the sub-grid scale or the residual stresses. That is done through a filtering operation. So the instantaneous quantity is the sum of those resolved. Some of those resolved and residual quantities, and the filtering is done in this way. The filter needs to have some properties, and we use the box filter. There are other possibilities. The box filter is local in physical space and also is similar to what people use when doing engineering calculations, which is discretized with finite elements or finite volumes or finite differences. And so this is more adequate to and more similar to those engineering type of calculations. To those engineering types of calculations. Now, what comes out of the filtering of the DNS equations, the instantaneous equations, are the filtered governing equations. This is the continuity, which only contains the resolved loss of field. The momentum equation contains also resolved fields, and whatever is subgrid comes here and there. Now, this is the so-called subgrid-scale stress tensor, which is also present in the context of Newtonian fluids, and this needs to be modeled with CRD5. Model with CRD5. And finally, the risk of filtered polymer stress is actually given by this quantity in which you have the total filter of this product. And this total filter of this product can be decoupled into the resolved quantity and the sub-grid scale contribution. Now, remember, because this difference was present in the evolution equation for the confirmation tensor, so once you filter and you split these into this, this is also present in the filtered governing equation for the confirmation configuration. Filtered governing equation for the confirmation tensor. But there are also, and so this needs to be modeled. This is to be closed. We will talk about that shortly. But there are also two other nonlinear terms, the advection term. So this is the resolved advection, and this is the subgrid scale advection. And there is the resolved polymer stretching and the subgrid scale polymer stretching. So all these quantities with circles or ellipses around need to be closed. We start, by the way, before we go into that. Start by the way, before we go into that, I'm showing you the definition of the sub-grid scale advection and the sub-grid scale polymer stretching. Now, to develop the sub-grid-scale models for the polymers, we have worked with the instantaneous evolution equation for the trace of the conformation tensor, very much as we did for the flow, the homogeneous isotropic flow. Whether we don't need in the planet yet, this was sufficiently good. Of course, in the future, Sufficiently good, of course. In the future, if you want to assess the model or extend it to more complex flows, you may need to use all the instantaneous equations for all the components. But for the planar jet, this was sufficient. And of course, in the filtered evolution equation for the trace of the calculation tensor, again, you have the sub-grid scale terms, the relaxation, the advection, and the polymer stretch. Now, using DNS, the DNS that we did two years ago for a huge Did two years ago for here are the Reynolds number and the Weissman number. Tau P is the relaxation time, and the flow as a co-flow, the co-flow is needed because of the pseudo-spectral method. And what matters is the far field. So initially, you have an hyperbolic tangent velocity profile going through the nozzle where some noise is put in the shear layers to help develop as fast as quickly as possible the turbulence. Quickly as possible to turbulence, and once it becomes fully developed, then we are in the so-called far field, and that's the far field that I'm going to analyze. Now, we need to develop four closures, as I said. The first closure is the subgrade-scale stress tensor, and we use the Newtonian closure, the classical Smagorinsky model, in which the eddy viscosity is given here as a function of the filter size, the norm of the resolved radio tensor, and there is a constant Smagorinsky coefficient. The constant Sagorinsky coefficient, we use the Newtonian value zero. We use the Newtonian value 0.16. But we also did for the planar jet simulations, we also use a dynamic Smyrnski model in which this coefficient is computed at each point based on the concept of scale similarity. I will talk to you shortly what this is. The second closure that needs to be developed belongs to the viscolastic fluids and is the sub-grid-scale polymer relaxation term, which is here. And as I Term, which is here, and as I can see here, it's modeled as zero. In fact, when you did the cross-correlation between this quantity and this quantity, not only see that they are nearly identical, but they have a very high correlation coefficient. And that means essentially that one is identical to the other. This happens regardless of the filter size for not only for the Weisenberg 1.1, but also 2.2 and 3.3, the three simulations for which we have DNS. And all the data here is The all the data here is not at a single point, is the data along the center line within the partial. So, for X over H between 10 and 18. We already knew this would be a possibility from wall flows, both the LES data of TIEs, but also we did in the past some filtering of DNS data and also in RAMs equivalent to these where the overbar then denotes the Reynolds averaging operator. The notes Reynolds averaging operator, we also observed this to be true. And also in amaginous isotropic couples, we knew this was going to be the case. The third closure is also a viscolescal closure. It's the sub-grid-scale advection of the conformation tensor. And what I'm showing you here, the PDFs of the advection in blue and of the subgrid scale polymer stretch. And what you see is that whereas the subgrid scale, the PDF of the Scale the PDF of the subgascal infection is symmetric, it's not symmetric that of the polymer stretch, indicating that, in fact, the polymer stretching term is going to be more relevant than the advection. And so, we essentially neglect the subgrid scale advection compared to the subgrid scale polymer stretch. Now, we have these brackets. These brackets indicate averaging in the homogeneous direction Z. Remember, we are talking about a plan. Remember, we are talking about a planar jet, and Z is the span-wise, the homogeneous direction. And when we analyze data, we average in the Z direction. And also in the next closure floor, there's going to be a coefficient in which we will average in the Z direction. So the final closure is the one that we cannot neglect, the subgrid-scale polymer stretch, in which we are going to assess the distortion similarity model. Now, what is this idea? Model. Now, what is this idea? What is this? The model. The distortion similarity model is based on the concept of self-similarity of the sub-grid scale of polymer strategy. And the idea of self-similarity is used in dynamic models, like in the dynamics Migolinsky model. So the idea is the following. We know that within all the turbulent scales within the inertial sub-range are structurally similar. Therefore, a quantity like the subject scale stress is. Is structurally similar to a proxy, which is done built in the following way. You take now the result scales and you filter a second time the result scales using a test filter, which in our case and usually is about twice the size of the original filter. And now you can build the subgrid scale of this second filtering operation, which is this quantity. And if they are structurally similar, then Structurally similar, then this is proportional to that, meaning that the coefficient of proportionality is of order one. This really worked. And this is the basis of the dynamic models like Dynamics Magolinsky. And this is what we used for our submit-scale polymer stretch. This is what we want to model. And now we have the proxy GIJ in which we filter the resolved scales, the resolved velocity field and the resolved confirmation tensor field. Confirmation tensor field according to the definition of the polymer stretch. And now we have a joint PDF. Here I'm showing you the joint PDF of the trace quantities. So gamma II GII. And as you can see, there is a very high correlation. Still, when you make the filter larger, the large correlation remains. It's not as high, but still a very high correlation. And at different in higher estimate numbers, again, here, all the data mixed up at different points in the far field. I mean, points. In the far field, I mean, points along the jet center line in the far field. Now, the model is then this one, and we need to quantify C gamma. We are using the same model as inhomogeneous isotropic turbulence, meaning a single C gamma, an isotropic C gamma. For that purpose, we use the same idea as inhomogeneous turbulence, which is to use the evolution equation for the instantaneous conformation tensor. We filter it, and now we are going to look at the Now we are going to look at the filtered equation. And let's plot first PDFs of the various terms in the individual, in the filtered equation. So here we have the time derivative term in blue, which is a semantic PDF, which is essentially coincident with the PDF of the resolved advection. And in fact, the resolved advection and the resolved time derivative are anti-correlated, meaning that one is positive, the other negative, and vice versa. So there are some. Negative and vice versa. So their sum is essentially negligible. And this tells us that this right-hand side is essentially identical to zero. Now remember, this is the resolved polymer stretch. This is the subgrid polymer stretch. So the sum of the two is a total polymer stretch. This total polymer stretch is essentially in balance with the polymer dissipation or polymer relaxation. This, in fact, is exact in homogeneous isotopic turbulence. Isotropic turbulence. When you do the global balance, meaning you do the averaging in the homogeneous directions, the brackets, all directions are homogeneous in isotropic turbulence. In the case of the planar jet, what we found is that averaging in the Z direction also gives essentially verifies the same identity. Now remember, the total polymer stretch is now the sum of the resolved polymer stretch and the subgrid polymer stretch. And since we want to use a single C. We are we want to use a single C gamma, we can let us say approach this quantity by this, and this equation gives you C gamma. So it's based on the elastic energy equilibrium, equilibrium between polymer stretch, production by polymer stretch, with dissipation by the dissipative term. So let's put everything together to see the LES simulation and the so-called a posteriori analysis. Called a posteriori analysis, meaning all the closures at the same time. We did four LES simulations in a fine grid and four in a coarser grid, including one Newtonian for each one. And we start with contours of instantaneous normalized vorticity on the left DNS and on the right LES. On the top, Newtonian at the bottom, the highest Weiss-Magnama simulation. So you can see that the structures are similar, except, of course, you don't see the fine-grained, the small scales so well because it was filled. Well, because it was filtered in the LES. Another important point is the jet spreading rate. Delta is the jet half width here plotted as a function of the streamwise coordinate. What matters is the slope. So forget about this initial region. What matters is the slope in the far field. What we have is that at Love Eisenberg number, the jet spreading rate is essentially the same as the Newtonian. And then as you increase, And then, as you increase at the higher Weisabach numbers, like 2.2 and 2.3, we see a smaller, a lower jet spreading rate. And this is, of course, seen also through the decay of the center line velocity. You see center line velocity divided by the inlet velocity to the power of minus two. And again, you see the slope decreasing as you increase by severe number. And at 1.1, you essentially have the same thing as the Newtonian. thing as the Newtonian result. The slope is more or less the same. Mean flow properties, what we see is the transverse profiles of the mean velocity profile normalized with the center line velocity and the transverse coordinate normalized by the jet thickness. And they all match. DNS, LES of all flows match because in fact they are normalized by quantities which evolve differently depending on the fluid. Depending on the fluid, and here we see the transverse normal Reynolds stress is normalized by the central line velocity. Um, and where the DNS is this data here, so what better is this region, which is the far field? And as you can see, there are some differences and in particular, but anyway, we see that the dynamics Vagorinsky is better than the classical Svagorinsky. Dynamics Vagorinsky is in red, the classical Svagorinsky is in blue. Magolinsky is in blue. We also plotted the variation of the polymer stress, the maximum polymer shield stress along the center line. We compare the LES, the symbols, with the DNS, and the scaling is very good again in the region of the far field. Okay, in fact, this scaling, this particular scaling, which is explained in a paper, I don't have time to In a paper, I don't have time to talk about this, is based on the equilibrium at Irveisenberg numbers, the equilibrium between production of turbine kinetic energy with equilibrium with the polymer stress work. And the scaling is very good and should work only at high-weiser numbers. It should not be verified at low Weisabuck numbers. Nevertheless, it's not bad in this region, although it's not supposed to be verified here. We also have a good scaling of We also have a good scaling of the Reynolds stress tensor with a particular type of scaling that is explained in the GFM paper last year. So the LES simulations also show a good match again as the DNS. So I'm not showing here the, well, sorry, the lines are the DNS, maybe, or maybe not, but they collapse. They are essentially on top of the LDNS profiles. Profiles. So, I want to conclude by saying that the model developed for homogeneous isotopic turbulence works in inhomogeneous loads in the absence of roles like in the plane jets and other situations like mixing layers, should work in mixing layers, should work in wakes. In fact, we know we are finalizing some work on wakes. And C gamma is computed. Is computed as in homogeneous isotropic terminals where there was equilibrium between elastic energy production dissipation here in the player jet. There is not equilibrium, it is log is near equilibrium. Okay, so it still can be computed in the same way. And so the distortion similarity model works well, especially in combination with the dynamic Smygorinsky model. Thank you very much. Thanks, Fernando. Thanks, Fernando. Why don't we take that first question from Said then? So you've answered it in the chat, but maybe you just want to show the plot of the jet spreading angle. Yeah, you can see now the presentation, right? Yeah, you can see it. Yeah, so the Heisenberg number increases. So you can see as Weisenberg increases, the slope decreases. Similarly, the velocity decay is slower, okay? Because the Slower, okay, because there is less, less, the growth is slower. And that growth change is due to the Reynolds shear stress change? Yeah, the Reynolds shear stress also tends to be the turbulence which is reduced. So this is why the spreading is slower. Next question was going to come from Martin. Sorry, can I make a comment to my question? So, do you expect that by keeping increasing the Weisenberg number, are you going to Weisenberg number, are you going to have a sort of a collapse of all the lines? Because it seems that the distancing between the lines are yeah, well, okay, we are not showing this here, but at very high Weisenberg numbers in the Tublin kinetic energy balance, we essentially have an equilibrium between production. Between production and the viscoelastic stress work. So the mechanism of the dissipation is going to be associated with the polymer. And then if you do an adequate, if you do an adequate normalization, you have, like in this plot, I mean, this is only for the maximum polymer shear stress, but you can also see similar plots in the GFM paper we published last year. Last year. But this only holds at large feisif numbers. Okay. So there will be a collapse provided you normalize it in a certain way. Okay. Thanks, Fernando. Great talk. Very nice. Before we go to Mike Fernando, I'll just add a question about the Weisenberg number. So I can't remember how it was defined, but it seems quite small as an elasticity number. These seem, you know, it's not significantly elastic. This is defined based on mean flow properties. Based on the mean flow properties. I check here. Yes, it's here. Well, yeah, it's based on the inlet velocity and on the nozzle width. Width, okay, rather than the kind of maximum shear rate in there or something. Yes, exactly. So in fact, because the problem is that as we go downstream, the elasticity becomes weaker. Okay. So we could define things like. So, we could define things like Homogarv scales or large-scale quantities, like a large-scale time scale, in order to define the Weisenberg number. But then for a given flow, you would have a Weisenberg number that decreases as you move downstream. And in fact, we have been investigating this, and we know that even if you have a very high Weisenberg number flow, if you manage to do a comp. If you manage to do a computation in a very long domain, as you continue going in the far field further downstream, you move from a viscoelastic jet into a Newtonian jet. It's just a matter of having a very long domain to be able to do these computations. So we need to define the flow condition based on inlet conditions. Okay? Makes sense. Mike Graham's got a quick question which we could just try and answer in one minute before we move to Sujit. Yeah, so Fernando. Yeah, so Fernando, this is very interesting. I was curious about structures, you know, how the structures in the LES compared to the DNS. There's been interesting work from Gareth on jets and viscoelastic fluids where you see different structures. And then that's related. Relatedly, how much of the transport is due to the polymer? Is it mostly random stress? I mean, as I said, the The when you have very high elasticity and in the beginning of the far field, viscoelasticity will tend to dominate. But then as you progressively go downstream, the impact of the polymer will slowly go down and you tend to be Newtonian, to have a Newtonian process. And then you will have the normal, I mean, as you progress towards the Newtonian behavior, means that the non-linear. Newtonian behavior means that the nonlinear cascade becomes more important, whereas in the beginning you'll have this like polymer-induced cascade that we studied in homogeneous turbulence. So the structures are similar, but you need to be in the initial regions, initial regions of the fire field, while the viscobasticity is still very high. Okay, thanks, Fanda. I think we'd better leave it there. So thanks for a lovely talk. People want to put their appreciation. Talk. People want to put their appreciation in the chat. I'm sure Fernando would appreciate that. Thank you very much. We're going to now move to Sujit Data from Princeton. Sujit, are you ready to share and start? Over to you then, Sujit.
