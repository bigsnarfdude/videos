So thanks, Clifton, for the introduction. It's a great pleasure to speak at the conference in honor of Bill Castlemans. So I will speak about ongoing joint work with Rafael Bazar Pissy. So let me begin with some notations. With some notations. So E over F will denote a quadratic extension of number fields. N will be a positive integer. And for I will fix a non-degenerate remission space H over E of rank n and to such a Hermitian space I will attach several unitary groups. The first one, denoted by U', is a unitary group attached to H. And the second one, denoted by UH, is a product of the unitary group attached to the emission space H times the unitary groups attached to uh the rank n plus one emission space obtained by summing H with a non degenerate rank one emission space. Generate a round-built emission space. And we have a diagonal embedding of the small groups inside the product of two unitary groups, so given matricially in this way. I will denote A the ring of adults of F and by absolute sub L as a product of normalized local absolute values. And I will fix the minimal parallel. And I will fix the minimal parabolic subgroup of UH, so the product of unitary groups. So it is denoted by P naught. It is a product of minimal parabolic subgroups, P0 and P0 double prime. And we fix accordingly, we fix a maximal compact subgroup, a good maximal compact subgroup inside the group. The group of adders of UH. And let me denote by P a standard parabolic subgroup for UH. So I can write it as P prime times P double prime. So to P, I attach the space of real unramified characters, AP star. It has a dual denoted by AP, and we can consider the space of complex. A space of complex unranified characters denoted by AP sub C. So we have a homomorphism from the space, from the group of idyllic points of P to the dual space of unmodified characters. So I can attach to any element in P of A, any pin in P of A, the logarithm. The logarithm of the absolute value of the character of P for each character of P. So this gives the morphism from PA to AP and by USAWACON decomposition I can extend it to a map denoted by HP to the UA to AP. And for the component P prime, we have also the same constructions. We have a map H. constructions, we have a map HP prime to a vector space AP prime. So from the smaller group U prime to AP prime. And I will denote by tour at P prime the characteristic function of the open up to chamber defined by the set of weights attached to P prime. So I will consider the Ichinoyamana truncation operator. Truncation operator. So, this operator depends on the choice of a truncation parameter denoted by T. And the truncation parameter is a point in the space A P node prime. So, P node prime, I recall that it is a minimal parabolic inside my small user group, U prime. And the point is it's positive in the same. Is positive in the sense that it is in the positive high chamber and it is far away from the walls. So, the main properties of the Ichino-Yamana truncation operator, lambda t, denoted by lambda t, is that it transforms a smooth function phi on the automorphic quotient of the big unitary group UH. So, this is the coefficient of the ideal point of UH by the sub-configuration. By the subgroup of rational points, is that it transforms a smoosh function on this quotient with all its derivatives of uniform moderate growth into a rapidly decreasing one on the small unitary group U prime. So, explicitly, we have this formula to define this truncation operator. Truncation operator. So this is close to the usual Arthur truncation operator. It takes a sum over a standard parabolic subgroup of UH prime. You have a sign. This is an alkarmite sum. We sum over this concentration, which is infinite a priori, but here we introduce this function. We introduce this function at two p prime. So this is a characteristic function of the optus weight chamber evaluated at hp star of delta x minus tp prime, which is a projection of the parameter t onto the quotient ap prime. So this sum is in fact finite times what I denote by What I denote by phi set P prime. So in the usual Arthur truncation operator, phi set P prime is in fact the constant term of phi along the unipotent radical of P prime. So if we consider phi as a function on U prime. But here, this is not exactly the this is not the constant term. This is not a constant term along this group. In fact, it is the constant term along the parabolic subgroup of the second factor, so the unitary group attached to H plus the one-dimensional Hermes space we consider. And it is the parabolic subgroup that stabilizes the same isotropic flag in H. flag in H has the parabolic group P prime. So this defines the function phi P prime. So this is a variant of the Arthur truncation parameter and it is in fact more convenient for explicit computation of periods. Okay, so let me now consider an automorphic forms on the quotient associated to the big unitary group. So I can apply the truncation operator on it. So I get a rapidly decreasing function on the small unitary group, and I can integrate this rapidly decreasing function on u prime. Right. So we get what I call a period. In fact, a truncated period. It depends on the choice of the parameter T. But then we can study the behavior of the periods in terms of the parameter. And in fact, it coincides with a polynomial exponential, that is the sum of exponential of linear forms on the the space where the parameter lives. Where the parameter lives times polynomials on the same space. So we have a finite sum of polynomial times exponential. And if we restrict to automorphic forms with some mild restrictions on the exponents, what we get is that the polynomial attached to the zero linear. Polynomial attached to the zero linear form, that is a polynomial part of the truncated period, is in fact constant. And we define, following Ichino and Yamana, the regular race period as this constant. This defined regular race period. So this construction by Ichino Anyamana is inspired by the construction. By the construction of regularized priors of Jacques, Lapid, and Rogeski, in the case of Flicker Raleigh spires. And this construction of regularized integral is also inspired by the works of Zaguier and Castlemann. I can quote the paper of Castleman: Extending Automorphic Forms on the Upper Half Brain, where such. Upper half plane where such a procedure of regularization is explained. Okay. So now let me give some properties of the regularized pairs. So I assume that the exponent of the automorphic form phi satisfies the condition I want. Then we get a linear form which is invariant by the small By the small unitary group. And moreover, if the integral does converge, then it is equal to the regular spiot. But I am interested in the case of Caspidal Isenson series. So I take phi Caspidal automorphic form on the automorphic quotient associated to parabolic p of the big unitary group. So by caspidal, I mean that the constant term of phi vanishes for Vanishes for all the proper parabolic subgroup of P. And then I can define, I can associate to it by the usual procedure we saw in Bernstein's talk. We can associate a nasal sense series attached to ramified characters of p and then what happened is that for almost all character characters lambda Lambda, the Eisen ten series satisfies the condition and the exponent. So we can define the regularized period of the Isenten series and we get a map. So in terms of the character lambda, we get a map that is well defined, at least outside some hyperplanes. And now I want to formulate some problems. So the first one So, the first one is the GAN gross percent problem, GGP problem. So, starting from a parabolic subgroup of the product of unitary group U, and starting from the caspital representation of a levy factor of P and the unitary character lambda, find the condition under which the linear form on the Linear form on the induce space, the automorphic induced space of sigma, the linear form defined by the regularized period of the essential series does not vanish identically, does not vanish identically on this space. And the second problem is a refinement in some sense of the first one. This is the Ichimo Ikela problem. The problem is to factorize, to find the Eulerian factorization of the square modulus of the periods or regularized period of the essence series in terms of natural analogues of the periods. And we shall give a solution to these two problems for representation sigma whose base. Whose base change to linear groups satisfies some specific conditions. And this will give us an extension of the original GGP and each genomic data conjecture. So the original conjectures are about the case where the parabolic subgroup is equal to. So in this case, the async there is nothing else but a caspidoutomorphic forms on the product of unitary group. On the product of unitary groups. So, I want to explain the condition I impose on the representation I consider, and from this I will consider a specific set of answer parameters. So, first let me consider the case of parameters living in one linear groups, linear groups. So, the linear groups are GLN. Linear groups are G Ln over E, so denoted by G N, it is viewed as a group over F. And by other parameters, I mean, say, the tensor product or formal sum, the tensor product, say, of caspetal representation of smaller linear group groups, such that the product of the linear groups. product of the linear groups can be identified through a levy of OGA. So we have this condition on the dimension of the rank. So first one, so we have a collection of customer representations. Second one, the representations, I call them the components of the parameters. The representation are two by two distinct. There is no multiplicity. Multiplicity and the first condition is that if the component is a self-conjugate dual, then we know that in this case we can attach to such a representation pi k two Azile function attached to some sign and among this these two Azile functions These two Azile functions there is one and only one that has the pole at s equals one. So this condition specifies which Azile function should have a pole at s equals one if the representation is a self-conjugate dual. And the fourth condition is that if the representation, if the component is not self-conjugate dual, then the representation which is the conjugate dual Which is a conjugate dual to the first one should be also a component of the parameter. So the representation pi is in some sense a self-conjugate dual. So we shall say that the parameter pi is discrete if all the components are a self-conjugate dual. So in this case, the case 4 does not appear. So we are not really interested in one group, but we are interested In one group, but we are interested in the product g n cross g n plus one, which denoted by g and the parameters, the assembarameters we are interested in are product of parameters of g n, so pi n times pi n plus one, so product of parameter of g n and parameter of g n plus one. And we need another property, we need that the parameter We need that the parameter is regular. So, what does it mean? It means that there is no component of pi n plus 1, which is a control gradient of a component of pi n. So, if the parameter pi is discrete, in the sense that pi n and pi n plus 1 are discrete, then it is automatically regular. then it is automatically regular while this is because of the the dichotomy of a function you cannot you cannot have a a pole for the two for a serial function of different size so so a discrete parameter is automatically readable so moreover we identified so pi n and pi n plus one to a representation automorphic cosplay Automorphic cospital automorphic presentation of some levy subgroup of G, so fixing a parabolic subgroup of having this levy as a factor, we can induce the presentation and we find an automorphic presentation and the parameter, the RSR parameter, will simply be identified to an automorphic, to this automorphic presentation pi obtained by induction. So let me fix capital Pi, a regular answer parameter in the sense defined above. So I want to twist my parameters by some characters, but I just consider characters which are anti-invariant under the V group, which act by permutation that changes the component which are The component which are not self-conjugate dual, that exchange the component and its conjugate dual. So, in particular, if pi is discrete, the space of character is trivial. This is just attached to the non-discrete part of the parameter. So, when I have such a character, I can twist the small pi and induce, and I get a parameter denoted by. Parameter denoted by pi sub lambda. So let me consider a caspetal representation of a levy factor of some parabolic subgroup of the unitary group. And we shall say that capital Pi is a weak base change of the induced representation from sigma if it is the split base change for almost places of F that are splittiny. That are splitting. So, this is a convenient definition. And if it exists, the weak base change is in fact unique by the result of Ramachin. And moreover, if pi is a weak base change of sigma, then we can twist sigma by the character of p, and the space of character of p is identified with the space of characters a sub pi i am d. A sub pi I am defined. So I will not distinguish between the two spaces in the following. So let me state our first theorem. So let me fix capital Pi a regular RSO parameter and let me fix a unitary unrefy characters attached to my parameter. Then we have Then we have the following assertion which are equivalent. So let me start from the second assertion. If I start from a parabolic subgroup of my product of immaterial group and a caspital representation of a Levy factor such that the weak based change of the induced presentation is capital Pi, and assume that the linear form on the induced presentation given by the regular response. Given by the regular spirit of Heisenzen series and the character lambda does not vanish identically, then the Rankin-Salberg L-function attached to a pi sub lambda, so the twist of a pi by a lambda, does not vanish at one half. And conversely, the converse is almost true, that is, there exists at least one emission space. One Hermitian space and the parabolic subgroup of it, a cusp representation of Levy, this, such that we have this non-vanishing property. So the converse holds, at least when we consider together all the emission space of the wrong A. So just let me remark, let me give a remark. Is that a four That for unitary characters and for regular Hauser parameter pi, then we have a simpler definition of our regularized period of Heyzen center. In this case, the period is simply the truncated period for some enough parameter P. It does not depend on on T, in fact, because of the the regularity of our parameter. Of our parameters. And in particular, we see that this period is in fact holomorphic on unitary character. So it is well-defined particle. So this work, this result is an extension of previous works, and the previous works concern the case where the parameter pi is discrete. So in this case, Is discrete. So in this case, the parabolic is the unitary group itself. So these series are in fact cuspidal automorphic forms. So two implies one has been obtained in the work of Ginsburg Junk-Ralis or Ichino Yamana, Jung, Lake Junk, by different methods that we use. Here, our proof is based on the comparison of relative tree. Comparison of relative trace formula. That is, we follow a strategy introduced by Jacquet and Ralis. And important works in the similar vein first prove the CRM, so for P is for the parameter, for a discrete parameter, but under a local hypothesis on the parameter that implies that the parameter pi is in fact caspital. So it has one only essentially one. One only essentially one component. It is really a caspid automorphic force. So, this is due to Wei Zhang and completed by Ang Shui and the work of Buzzard Plissy. And then Bozarplessy, Liu, Zhang, and Chu removed this local hypothesis and they proved the theorem, so with no local hypothesis, but assuming that the parameter passes. Assuming that the parameter pi is caspidal. And then by and then with Buzzard Plessy and Zidor, we get the non-caspital case pi, but discrete. So the so-called endoscopic case. So we could we get this case. But okay. So now So now I want to formulate the refinement and Ichinoi Keda we get. So the notation are as before. So P is a parabolic subgroup, sigma is an automorphic form of a levy of P. And still we assume that the weak back change associated to sigma is a regular answer parameter. But we also assume that the local component of sigma are all tampered. So we need to fix some choice of measure, which is Tamagawa measures, which use factorization and with natural normalization at almost all places. Okay, so we denote by, so we twist. So we twist. So I recall that we identified the character of the parabolic P with some characters by which we can twist the urban parameter. So we can twist the potential sigma and induce it. So we get capital sigma lambda and we get also the parameter capital PI sub lambda. Blender. So I have to define to introduce local analogs of the periods of Isens and Series. So for this, we fix an invariant inner product of the local component of sigma. And this gives an invariant inner product on the induced representation, which is a component of Of our reduced pondation sigma. So, to get to get, so we want to consider say Hermitian forms on the induced presentation sigma V. And for this, an element of our smaller group U prime acts on acts on an element phi of sigma v. We can consider the inner product with phi and we can integrate it over H prime. So formally we get something that is invariant under U prime and we add some normalization. So this is a pairing of 5b with itself and we add a local factor. So the local factor Factor. So, the local factor is a product of some elementary abelian L-function attached to the quadratic character of the quadratic extension E over F times the ratio of two L functions. The first one is a Ronkin-Solberg L-function attached to the parameter pi sub lambda. And on the denominator, we have some as I L function attached to the parameter or if you prefer. This is the L function attached to the induced presentation capital sigma lambda with the adjoint representation. So to normalize the period, I divide by this L factor at S equals one half. One half. So for lambda unitary, the L factor in fact has neither zero nor pole at s equals one half. So we can divide by it. And moreover, the integral, and by our temperature assumption, the integral is convergent. So this is well defined. And it is normalized in the sense that for almost That for almost all places and non-zero unramified vectors φ, the period is 1. So I can state the refinement. So I consider an automorphic form in the induced presentation of SIMA. presentation of sigma i can write it abstractly as a i assume that it is abstractly a tensor product of local vectors and so the the statement is that for all the unitary characters of p we have an equality between the square modulus of the regular spirit of the essence series normalized by the peterson norm of phi norm of phi and so the angular product of the local periods so almost all factors are one here so the product makes sense it has to be it has to be multiplied by a special value of an l function the l function is a product of the local l functions and And we take the value at one half, but in fact, I have to put a star here. Why? This is because this alpha function has some trivial zeros. So I have to divide it by some power of s minus minus half before evaluating at s equals one half. And here we have the inverse. The inverse of the order of an elementary two groups, which is associated to the RSR parameters, which is more precisely, which is associated to the discrete part of the RSR parameters. So in the case P equals UH, this is the original Ichino-Ikeda conjecture in this version for unitary groups, and it has been proved. And it has been proved so far by Caspidal with some local hypothesis by Zhang and Béjar Plessy, and then by Béjarplessy, Lu, Zhang, and Zhu with no local hypothesis, but the hypothesis that pi is cospidal, and for discrete by non-cuspidal case, we get the theorem with Bosar Plissy and Zidon. Okay, so now I want. So now I want to give some application of our study of regular risk periods of Isencensalis. And this application is about Bessel periods. So I want to recall you what the Bessel periods are. So I fixed two integers, n and r. So n is positive and so And so n is non-negative and r is positive. So H is as before non-degenerate Hermitian space of rank N. And HR is a Hermitian space of rank 2R plus 1. And it is, so it comes with hyperbolic decomposition. It is a sum of two maximal isotropic Subspace of dimension n, which are in duality, plus one-dimensional emission space. So, this space comes with an ordered basis. So, to this basis, I can attach a flag, a complete flag of this vector space. Vector space and I will consider B the parabolic subgroup which is defined as a stabilizer of this flag inside the unitary group of the Hermitian space obtained by the orthogonal sum of H and H R. So we have still our small unitary groups, but now it is embedded in the product of the unitary group of H. product of the unital group of H and the unital group of H plus HR. So this is a bigger, bigger than before material groups group. Okay, so NB will be the unipotent radical of B and the small group UH prime normalizes the product of the trigger group and the unipotent. And the unipotent radical of B. And we define the Bessel subgroups as the semi-direct product of this group by UH prime. So this group, the trivial groups times the munipotent radical of B. So to define basic periods, now I need to define characters of the Of the group, the Bessel subgroup SH. So, for this, I fix a character of the ideal of E, trivial on E, a non-trivial character. And it is possible to define by this formula a character of the unipotent radical of B, which is invariant under a conjugation by the small uh unitary group. Unitary group. So we can extend this character to a character of the Bessel subgroup, which is trivial on the small unitary group. And we denote it still by psi. So let me consider a caspetal representation of the product of unitary group, UH, and I consider And I consider an automorphic form in the space of sigma. I multiply phi, so I restrict phi to the Bessel subgroup. I multiply it by the character psi, and I integrate the product over the automorphic coefficient associated to the Bessel subgroup. So we get a linear form, what we call the Bessel period. So if So if n equals one, so it may happen, it is allowed, then the small unitary group is trivial and the big unitary group is in fact a quasi-speed unitary group of other rank. Then in this case, the Bessel subgroup is a maximal unipotent subgroup, and the Bessel period is a four-year-witted current coefficient of phi. So now there is also a GGP problem for Bessel periods. That is, find a condition on sigma under which the Bessel period does not vanish in the space of sigma. And as before, we will give an answer to this problem, but for An answer to this problem, but for representations whose weak base change satisfies some condition, namely that it is a discrete answer parameter. So now the parameters are parameters for the product of linear groups GLN, so for the first factor, and GLN plus 2R plus 1 for the second factor. Second for the second factor. So, by a discrete answer parameter, so we mean a discrete parameter for the first factor and a discrete parameter for the second factor. So, the theorem is stated as follows. So, starting from a dispute answer parameter for the Parameter for the product of g n and g n plus 2r plus 1. So, first, if we find the Nermission form of rank n, such that there exists a caspital representation of UH, such that its weak base change to G is capital Pi. And if the Bessel period And if the Bessel period does not vanish identically, then the Ronkin-Selbergel function of the parameter does not vanish at one half. And conversely, if we have this non-vanishing, then we can find the Hermitian form and the casped representation, blah, blah, blah, such that the Bessel period does not vanish identically. So if n is zero, then we is zero then we we saw that in this case the small group u prime is trivial and so the the big group is just the quasi-split unitary groups of rank 2r plus 1. So then in this case the L function is trivial so the assumption one assertion one is automatic and this non-vanishing statement This non-vanishing statement is proved by Ginsburg, Ralis, and Souje. So, let me also mention that 2 implies 1 is proved by Duai Jang and Leng John. But here, our approach to the theorem 3 is to deduce it for theorem 1 for some Eisenhower series associated to some maximal parabolic subject. To some maximal parabolic, we do not need the maximal generality of our first one to deduce this for this electron. So also our method should also give the refinement, refinement a la ichinuikeda, which was conjectured by Paibi. So we can also By Paylee. So we can also, in principle, decompose the square modulus of the Bessel periods in terms of local analogs. So to finish, just let me mention some ingredients, just one ingredient in our proof, our theorem one. So as I said, our proof is based as a so as a pre So, the previous works on the Ichino Geda conjecture are based on a comparison of a relative trace formula for unitary groups and a relative trace formula for linear groups. So, we are in the case where the unitary groups is a product of unitary groups of emission forms times the unitary groups of emission forms. So we are in the case UN cross UN plus one. So the relative trace formula in this case consists in integrating the automorphic kernels of the B group, not along the diagonal, as in the usual trace formula, but along the subgroup U prime cross U prime. So I put quotation mark because this integral does not make sense in general. Does not make sense in general, but there is a truncation procedure introduced by Zidor, so which makes sense to the left-hand side. And what Zidor gets is a spectral expansion of the trees formula in terms of caspidal data chi. So f is a test function, and the j chi of f is an invariant, so bi-invariant. So, bi-invariant, so invariant on the left and on the right by the subgroup U prime. So, this is a distribution on UH, bi-invariant. Okay. So, one ingredient. So, this distribution are given by a rather involved procedure which is well suited for the geometric analysis of the trace formula. Analysis of the trace formula, but not so well studied, well suited for the spectral analysis. So, one ingredient in our work is to find a more suitable expression for this distribution. And this is given by theorem four, so by light theorem. So, if chi is a class, is a caspindal datum attached to a pair p. attached to a pair P sigma where sigma is a caspetal representation of a lady of P such that the induced representation capital sigma has a weak base change to GLN cross GLN plus one which is a regular author parameter then in this case with this restriction I do not claim that the I do not claim that the term holds for any caspidal datum, but for this specific datum which are interested in, then the spectral distribution has a simple expression. It is an integral over unitary characters of P of relative characters, which is built upon the regular. Uh the regular race periods of eyes and ten celeries. So these regular raised periods we we see they they appear they appear naturally in the relative choice formula for for unitary group. Okay, thank you.
