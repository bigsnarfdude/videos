Okay. So, what else should we say here? What's the confusion with this definition? That suppose you have a Vanache space V with unit ball K and then you have an affine map from B to V. From B to V. So you are tempted to say that F of K is an ellipsoid in B. But this will, this, this, if we think it that way, it will be, it will, it will, it is different than this notion. This is not going to be an ellipsoid. K is not to be an ellipsoid. K is not a B an ellipsoid. So if K is a subset of a linear space, of a linear, a complex linear space, K is an ellipsoid. If there's a map from Cn to V, which is affine and which sends the ball to K okay. Okay, so once we have this, let's see, what was the first time I arrived to the notion of complex cellist soil? Well, I was working in the Banach conjecture. And the Banach conjecture is really a characterization of the ellipsoid. But since the Banach conjecture has meaning in the forecast. Has meaning for complex vector spaces. The Vanach conjecture is also a characterization of the complex ellipsoid. Let me write it here. The Vanach conjecture claims that if every two ends of a spaces Of beneficiary space are equal. Equal means that there is a linear map that preserves the norm. Then this A Hivert space. And this has sense when B is a banached space over the real numbers or when B is a Vanache space over the complex numbers. So this problem can be easily translated to a geometric problem, which is a characterization of the ellipsoid, which claims that if Which claims that if every two n sections of a convex body of a symmetric convex body are linear. Are linearly independent, a small effect oh yes, linearly equivalent. Every two n sections of a convex body are linearly equivalent, then Then okay is an ellipsoid. But if we speak about the complex Vanach conjecture, what we have here is that if we have two complex and N sections, the intersection of a complex n-dimensional space. And here, if the body is complex symmetric and they are complex linearly equivalent, then k is a complex ellipse. Okay. So I was, I begin to think in this, and then I began naturally to be interested in what's a complex ellipsoid, what is really a complex ellipsoid. So the first result about complex ellipsoid that I was Or complex elements that I was aware. I asked Martin, I sent him an email, and he told me, Well, it's lemma one of Gromov's proofs of the complex planet conjecture. So this conjecture was proved when n is even for Gromo in a very what would be the adjective in an The adjective in an in a paper. And level one of this, this paper was really for me the first result about complex ellipsoids. And Martin just told me, no, this is lemma one. And then I read lemma one and it was completely under Completely under and I was not able to understand any word. But then, but then later, I learned that this lemma one claims the following thing that if you take a complex symmetric Body, then there is a unique complex ellipsoid of minimal volume. Volume by the way, what's complex symmetric? Let's be clear about this. So what is complex symmetric in the real case? Complex real symmetric means that k and minus k that k and minus k is the same or not and now this is a scalar this is the this is a scalar one and minus one are the scalar is compact right oh yes body body means body means compact you know body containing right containing field And then let's see what for real. If you are, if we are working in Rn, symmetric means this. If we are working in Cn, our scatters are not the real numbers, but the complex numbers. And then symmetric means that k is equal to CK. To CK for all complex numbers with absolute value one. So this geometrically means that every line section, one-dimensional section through the origin through the origin is a disk center at the region. Yes, this is will be every one-dimensional section through the region is a disk. It's a disk center at the region. This makes that every rotation, which this rotation. Which these are rotations this makes exactly this. This is equivalent. And now, in other words, this is also, in other words, centrally symmetric or symmetric, complex symmetric sets are exactly. Are exactly unit balls of Banach spaces. It's exactly the same notion because this property is the ones that makes the property the metric a metric. This is exactly the property that makes that c times x is equals to c the absolute value of c with x with the norm of x. So unit volts of Banach spaces ah well convex complex symmetric Complex symmetric convex bodies are unit balls of Anachi spaces. And here, here he proves that if k is a complex symmetric, not what he just said, there is a unique complex ellipsoid of minimum volume containing k. Minimum volume containing k. And why is it this was important? It was important for the following thing. If you take take X in Cn, which is and then if you Did you look at the symmetries of X, which are all the linear maps that the linear maps, which are an isomorphism between X and X, or the linear maps from X to X, or the isomorphism, linear isomorphism from X to X, then essentially this group. Essentially, this group, this is a group, essentially, this group is a conjugate of SUN, the collection of complex isometries. And the proof is very easy from here. And he needed to prove the Vanach conjecture in even dimensions. So, Gromov, I'm not going to enter in details of the proof of Gromov of the Vanach conjecture, but finally, the second step is that somehow he used topology and he was able to prove that if every two complex n-sections of a complex symmetric complex body are complex linearly equivalent, then Then the say all the sections of Kwere complex ellipsoids We end up using topology and proving that actually And prove it that actually the sections were complex ellipsoids. And from here, he concluded that K was a complex ellipsoid. No, it's the just immediately. And this is by no means clear, at least not clear for me. Perhaps Morgromo was quite clear. It is not immediately that all n sections of curved complex ellipsoid implies k is a complex ellipsoid. In fact, this result is equivalent to the following one, which for me starting illuminating what's a complex ellipsoid. A complex ellipsoid is precisely an ellipsoid plus the condition that it's complex symmetric. Complex symmetric. These two things together give complex ellipsoid. By ellipsoid, you mean ellipsoid in R to D. By ellipsoid, I mean silipsoid in R to D. And if this is also, if for the origin, also For the origin, all the sections are disks, then this is a complex ellipsoid. And this claim is equivalent to this. And this is very easy to prove. If you know a little bit about ellipsoid, this is not so difficult to see because a typical complex ellipsoid is not so difficult. It is the collection of endpoints. of endpoints such that c n c one square over r one square plus c n square over r n square is equals to one like the ellipsoid but here is absolute value of the complex numbers and then complex Then complex isometry of this, the solution of this is exactly a complex ellipsoid. But then this is the point of this talk. Is this really a complex ellipsoid, something more sophisticated than an ellipsoid? How can it be that there are some results? Some results about complex ellipsoids that are not straightforward copies of results for ellipsoids. And the purpose of this talk is to convince you that there are. So, but anyway, this is a simple theorem which needs to be used to prove this. And at the same time, since I was working in the banished conjecture for me, it was important to deeply understand complex ellipsoids. So let me go and tell you what we did. We say, well, let's try, let's see if we can prove. Can prove, let's start trying to prove a straightforward. Let's try to copy what we know about real ellipsoids and see if this is true for complex ellipsoids. And then we start with the idea of flat, the Blasch K notion of shadow boundaries, flat shadow boundaries, and try it to apply to complex ellisodes. It to apply to complex ellisode, and we were not able because somehow something happens. Somehow our sets, the convex sets were not suitable for the complex. Somehow they were not suitable. Then our idea was, well, let us define complex convexity. And once we have a good notion of complex convexity, we will use this as a base for our definitions and for our theorems. And then what could it be complex convexity? Well, convexity is that you have a set, and every time that you have a line, the intersection is an closed interval. So complex, complex. Complex convexity will be: you have a set in Cn, and every time you have a complex line, the intersection is a disk. By disk, you mean ellipsoid or complex domain in a disk, a disk because in the complex language has the structure of the it has the structure of the complex number of the complex this is a complex line then a disk and so we say okay every time that we have a complex this intersection is a disk this will be complex convexity so and we start working with this and everything was very nice we proved that if the the complex asset As said, was complex convexity. If it was complex convexity, it was strictly convex, it was smooth. And moreover, every time that we want to prove a theorem about ellipsoid, everything was very nice. We were able to prove that the classic theorems in ellipsoid. Exactly, we copy the theorems in ellipsoid and we just And we just instead of convexity, put complex ellipsoid, and we proved that this was an ellipsoid, a complex ellipsoid. And we say everything is so straightforward. And then we say, if I we put complex convexity. Plus any product property, whatever you need, give you any one imply complex. And then we just, well, why don't we we know that complex ellipsoids are complex convex. So it's our complex convexity. At least we have not an empty family. Give me an example of a complex convexity set, which is not a complex ellipsoid. And a little, there were many discussions. I was the one who did not believe this could be true. But what happened was that the That term if K is now convex in the usual sense in CN, in R2N, let's say, and every line complex line intersects. Intersects K in a line, then K is a complex ellipsoid. And the proof of this you will not even need that key is real combat. Real combat. It's real complex. It's enough to just say that every combat. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Because with Yes. And the proof, the nice thing about the proof is completely far away.   Well, we were able to recover the Blaschke theorem of flat shadow boundaries, but also theorems like this one, which is very nice that if you have now K, a convex body, in the real sense, in CN, and every section. And every section, every complex section is complex symmetric. Then this means that K is a complex selling solid. And who else was for who else was using this? Well, using these ideas, we were able to prove not exactly this, but this help us the intuition and whatever to prove the Banach conjecture in four dimensions for k. Plus one. And let me say a couple of two interesting things. What about John's theorem with complex ellipsoid? If you have K a centrally symmetric set, a complex symmetric set complex symmetric body. Let's say K is a banish ball. And then John's theorem is true. It is very easy to stifle, give the definition of what Johnster initially should be, and the proof is more or less natural, no big problems. But this was well known for some other people, but they. Some other people, but anyway, you can do it because this is terrible. But if you erase this, this is just a compact set. I don't know what's John's theorem. It's clear what's John's theorem, but I don't know if it's true. Well, you're saying it's complex, but you're looking for the biggest ellipse. Biggest ellipsoid inside or the smallest containing the smallest container. Ah, this is a very, very nice. It's very good to remember me. I'm going to say, once we are here, for complex ellipsoids, the minimal complex ellipsoid containing the minimal in ellipsoid containing a compact set is unique. Is unique, but the maximal one contained in the set is not unique. It's clearly not unique. If you have a convex set, a real convex set in Cn, and you consider the maximal ellipsoid, complex ellipsoid in. Inside, it is not unique, but it is not very difficult to prove that one can be any two of these maximal one are translated of one each other. Well, then you see it. Well, and then I think that we were not able to prove the John's theorem in the setting of K. In the setting of K, just a compact set or a convex set. Only when it's like in the real world, John's theorem is very, well, it's somehow easier to prove when it's symmetric. But it is not symmetric, you don't need much work. And in fact, it's a little bit technical. And then the same maybe happens here. And then the same maybe happens here that when the body is symmetric, is centrally symmetric, then John's theorem is true. But if you erase this, it will be true, but I don't know how to do it. It should be true. I agree with you, but I don't know. I don't have any idea how because the tip that you use is in the real The real cannot be used here for containing containing it. Yes, well, the second thing that I was going to say finally to end my talk is about one of the most beautiful theorems I like, one of my favorite theorems, which is Davoresky theorem. And for Davoresky theorem, And for Davoresky theorem, of course, for those who don't know how beautiful this is, consider a convex set K in Rn for N big enough. So this set contains low-dimensional sections that are as close to an ellipsoid as you wish. To an ellipsoid as you wish. Symmetric. K has to be symmetric. Important hypothesis. And for the complex case, if K is complex symmetric, the same is true. If K is complex symmetric, Is complex symmetric and k is a subset of Cn and N is big enough, then K has a complex section which is epsilon close to a complex ellipsoid. And this is a theorem of Vitaly Millman, which is the Davoresky theorem for all this can be stated not for in the words of. In the words of convexity, but in the words of Blanach spaces. And this is the Vitaly-Millman theorem, who Tim Bowers claims that the proof of the Vitaly-Millman of the Davoresky theorem in the complex setting is perhaps one of the most beautiful proofs of all mathematics. I don't know if you have heard about this. Tim Bowers. In the context, specifically in the context, I think. Yes. And that it is the starting, the origin of a theory which is a synthetic geometric analysis. I think that no, this is not quite. No, no, so if I understand correctly, Milma's proof, which she did as a PhD student of the Torres. Student of the Dworetsky theorem in the real case. He did two things. One is that Dworecky had a quantitatively weaker bound, which was like he had roughly root log n, and then Nielman said it's of dimensional log n, the good section. And yeah, and the complex case? No, the real, the real case. I think it was the his proof in the real case. Then later on, maybe he did the Real case, and later on, maybe he did the context case as well. But in the real case, that's the start of escalating. It was representing Tim Bowers claims that the proof of Vitaly Milman of the complex, the Borensky theorem, is very important. It's very one of the it has very high words for this. This he wrote Tim Bowers, do you know? He wrote a book or he claimed many things. One of them is this. And then I was thinking, well, maybe complex cells were sufficiently interesting. My idea is that perhaps there are nice results about complex cell soils that we can even imagine. We can even imagine because they cannot even stated in the real case, and in which perhaps new techniques and ideas arrive. Well, and this is all. Thank you very much for your attention. There is never a lot of Never thought about it. Yes, give me one second. So these complex ellipsoids are just real ellipsoids, but with this complex, right? But this complex symmetry can have some relaxations that instead of asking. That instead of asking for the whole unit complexes to preserve the body, maybe just ask for a subgroup unit circle to preserve the body. And then you can have sort of a relaxed version of symmetry. If you relax this, are you really relaxing? For example, if you only ask, say, Z3 symmetry that is there in the group, is it the same thing? Is it the same thing? It is possible to do that. But I think you break everything, you break the whole complex world. But in other words, if you if you if you come I don't know if you have a real if you have a real ellipsoid and you take a complex line Line. The intersection is an ellipse. And there are not too many symmetries that can be relaxed. There are non-beddies that solve the public. I have the following question. So, what Following question. So, what can we say of possible diagonal elements of a matrix that corresponds to ellipsoid with a fixed semi-axis? The linear algebra involved in all these complex ellipsoids looks very works very much the same as the linear algebra, right? At least in my experience. I mean, because in real case, it's quite kind of obvious that it's the vector of egg and y was majority, it's a diagonal. But here, you kind of have a difference. So, what kind of elementary steps that you can like, I know, like not orthogonal, like dimensions in two-dimensional rotation. Dimensional rotations, let's say, yes, that you can move from one ellipsoid to another. But what you say is very interesting because it's not trivial. See, this see this problem is very interesting. See, this problem is very interesting. It is related with what you are telling me. See, if you take two real convex sets containing the origin, and all the sections, the volume of the corresponding The volume of the corresponding sections are the same. If the bodies are symmetric, then they are the same. And the proof is integration, spherical integration, harmonics. But what about the complex? What if you take two complex symmetric bodies? Symmetric bodies and you take the corresponding complex sections and they have the same volume. The first thing that I have to say is that it is not, it is impossible to use for the complex work. It is not clear how to use a spherical harmonics or harmonic integrator. All these tools. But at least what happens is you take two complex ellipsoids. And you take the volume and you ask for the hypothesis that the volume of one is the volume of one section is the volume of the corresponding section. Are the ellipsoids, are the two complex ellipsoids the same? Any more questions? No? Yes, I would like to ask. Sorry. Sure. Go ahead. When you speak about John ellipsoid, what version of John's theorem do you use? I mean, when you say that John's theorem works, you mean distance or you mean identity, decomposition of identity? What exactly? It's here. What exactly I use? No, this is the most straightforward one you take. Yes, uniqueness. Yes, just this part. No, not only uniqueness. No, no, no, all the all the other. If you take two complex n tuples, C and W, you can define the usual problem. Define the usual product, which is the product of CI with UI conjugate. And then, and this allows you to reformulate the John's conditions that there are if the unit ball is a unique complex ellipsoid containing a set, then there are real numbers here. Real number CI and a point such that the product of the points Xi with the square. Here you have to use not only this, but the modulus of this, because this is going to be a complex number. The same, the style for relation. To decomposition of identity stems. Yeah. And just another remark that for Dwarvesky's theorem in RN, in real case, you don't need really symmetry. It works for non-symmetric. I did not know. And we've assumed the same proof. I did not know. Thank you very much. Okay, any more questions from the participants online? Online, okay. Well, let's thank Luis once again.
