Thank you all for organizers, inviting me. Really nice to be here. Thanks also for all organizational work. Okay, so if you want random number And in this top, actually will be a fourth range in the back end. So uh So, uh so for such a group, a discrete invariant which is called credit was introduced in 2007 by Eichenhauser and Sein William. And so I'm willing. Some discrete invariant with some matrix nature actually for P So it encodes information about the material decomposition of the variety model P of the variety of varieties of the G. Okay, so what I will do in this talk, so first I will explain what it is general for generic. Uh, general for generic groups, and in the second part, you consider this case, it responds to groups of type DN. And next talk, very recently it was defined only for control dinner time. And in the next talk, it houses that we'll introduce this invariant for. Use this variant for the culture of output. Okay, let me also mention OK6 was defined by 2007 for algebraic rules, but previously it was already defined for quadratic forms by Alexander Misch. Okay, so let me start with explaining the matrix nature of this invariant. So I before proceeded to. Okay, so I I forgot to say that it is discrete invariant. There are just some integer components non-zero, non-negative point remaining. And let's discuss mativity interpretation. All this invariant. So, I need to say what the motive is in this talk. So, for X smooth objective write an X lambda automotive. Almost X and which is lambda, which will be mainly either Z or Z mod P and yeah, if it's clear what lambda is, we just write next. Okay. Okay, now I would like to give two examples from the 90s when people started intensely studying what you thought projective functionous varieties. Yesterday, Star mentioned the hematomic decomposition of isotropic quadric taught by Marcus Raus, and there is another famous result by Marcus Raust, namely the material decomposition of a piece certain quadrant. And is that all piece of whatever? So we have piece of form, and is that all big and the projective order associated to Q Then charm motif of X, well at the time it was with integral coefficients and decomposed as follows. So it's a direct sum of so-called indecomposable sound rostomotive and And there are only twisted copies, twists of the same if it's composable not to scope. These are from Euro to R is indicable and it's called Rosmoz. And moreover, we know how it looks like when we split the quadric, so some splitting field of our quadratic form decomposes as sum of two k motives. This is a state model. Okay, so another example of the same nature is my Nikita Karabyanka. For the motive of single-brail variety of central simple algebra simple algebra or whatever. Divided algebra T raw equivalent to A Let us fix index index A to the raw variety of A then what if X Of x of x. Also, the composers is a direct sum of three trees, so it's the same one in the composer of summons, which is multiple cylindrical D. So here we have catch two for this and if we split it it will be date motives from number 0, 1, 2, till degree of t minus 1, k minus 1. Okay, so Two examples, and these two examples are progressive homogeneous varieties. And the multi-class is the same pattern, but there is one direct summons, decomposable direct summons with different twists. And the corresponding goo actually in both cases splits over the function field of x. So this is the property. Property is a very important thing. Market relation. V of function v splint in example one and two. And uh this this kind of material decomposition was generalized by um uh get Auser. Get other petrol and xylogen in the following way. So now imagine, so we have just a variety with this key variety with this property projective homogeneous key variety. So, such varieties are called generic and split. Then we have basically the same type of material decomposition for S. So, this was proven in this paper. But now, But now we need a prime number and we consider our model these coefficients model B once again it is direct sum of one decomposable module which is denoted like this. Which has been denoted like this, and with this one is the component. Okay, so it depends only on the group. Group G. So take any other project homogenous G variety speed, we will have the same possible motif. Okay, and where this gene variant appears, it appears in the one correct polymorph of this summit. So we have the full equum for the contract polynomial that I summoned. Well, it looks like product. Product of polynomials of the following time and in this formula something is known and something is not known. Is known and something is not known, namely R and some number of probable factors. And the I's are known, they depend only on the type of one and what they are. Okay, let's put this in. And what is not known is this G dice well, and this error. So our couple of integers we can see is all the joint way with some up to permutation. In some cases like this Or the two interpretations of gene variants will be heard. Such a definition. But yeah, if we have cold degrees, so these di's are called degrees, then it's defined up to the rotation. And let's see a second definition where we will think if we compare this uh R in degrees. R and degrees um so let's take X variety of variety some rules and can see the child Can see the child, and we can see the child model. Consider this is also precisely fixed prime B and matrix positions model of B also depends on P. And in interesting primes are, of course, torsion primes of G. Of course, torsion primes of G, otherwise just state motifs and everywhere. Okay, so we have a child of X, then we can go to some split and field of G. So here O G. Uh OG split. So this is this is what B for some projection and here we go Chao G power. So this group is split and Chao Wing is well known and namely here. And namely, here we see all this all these known numbers with some polynomial ring our variables, the model of Of this ideal, and okay, r is just a number of variables here, and well, the dimensions of this di's are exactly di's. And so the gene variants of here will not be very check the paper of the petrol and the new and so but idea is something like this. So JI is equal let's progress minimum minimal numbers like that. Numbers is that element PI to the power PI well plus something looks like some monomials additional monomials are allowed, but they are not precise exactly what is. Precise exactly what does it mean then the cycle of element of such form lies in the image of the composition? Do you really need these additional monomers? That's a question to you because in the paper of it how the numeral is needed. But Mikita told me that you somehow told that probably it's not needed in some cases. For the small need. Yeah. For a device, it's probably, I think it's needed. So. So originally it was formulated like this. Maybe I can avoid this addition of tens, but okay, so this is about cognition, but before I go to this special case, let me mention nice applications of the G-invariant. Yeah, so just First of all, it's famous for some Alexander LiÄ‡. There is a field where this chain variant was used, that there is a field such that this u invariant equal to u to the power k. equal to q to the power k plus one where k is for the big progress in so-called kapansky problem to describe all possible values of the universe before it was known for even numbers by sandwich and for nine by isbolt By this bottle. And another application is by Nikita Fosen. So he constructed a comological, also a gene variant was used, and he constructed a comological invariant of degree 5 for groups of type E8. Okay, so um yes, just kind of introduction. Now um let's consider most uh particular uh question, namely approach multiplication. African versions, although the non-politics and some elevated equations. Okay, so with A sigma B such algebra sector, algebra and uh okay so uh let's uh go to the safe side and set on the safe side and set characteristic visa of two and sigma orthogonal evolution V of A with trivial disagreement And p will be two. So gene invariant of such algebraic convolution is defined as gene invariant algebraic group, namely P, which is PGO. This PGO plus A C model of the morphism group of A C1 take density component adjoint loop type dns. Of inner type because discriminant is trivial. And let's write this data R and D I's R is this. So roughly half components and degrees will be are the following. So one Add the folding. So one one, and then all numbers till we are less than f. Last one will be well, and what we know here in the paper. Here, in the paper of Anki Nair, Author and Zein Muhlen, it was precise how to choose operators in the case of information too. And actually, but what we will need is that if lower A is split, one is trivial if A You maybe this is great. Okay, and now also in this paper power, Nikita and Miker Zanio was the point Andric  Kilosine mullen says the following. So if we have our G invariant of A sigma, so if we split our algebra, so go to some field dimension which splits algebra, we know that here we will have zero and here something. And here something and Andrew want to say that you can speed algebra by not losing information about the remaining component except the one which is always goes to zero. And okay, for splitting the field, of course, then we should take a generic splitting field of A. Let A be function field considerable variety of A and conjecture says that at the same components because these components starting from degree two does Starting from degree two does not change, do not change this and say then, yes. And um here, well, we don't have algebra anymore so. Don't have algebra anymore, so it's weak algebra. So our this is a conjecture, just is there an obvious inequality yeah yeah so they can only decrease they can only decrease because motive just yeah rationality of cycles can obtain new rational cycles And append new rational cycle, but both remain so. Um so i in this case when algebra is split, so then our evolution is adjoined to some related form, let's say, and this is exactly. And this is exactly a gene invariant of Q in terms of Alexander B. So basically, yeah, and here, for example, there are results relating gene variants that you form to high beat indices. Say something. Probably more. Um okay, so let me announce here ingredients of food ingredients. And so audience idea was cool. Well first even not necessary for this group or Not necessary for this group in this case, but in general we have the following equivalence to know G-invariant of G, same equivalent as to no rational cycles on any nearly split G variety. Oh, the dimensions of Russians are concerned denoted like this. Okay, X is generically split and we do not suffering breaking sectors. Cycles of the splitting. Well, more precisely, we need just dimensions. So we need to know such kind of characteristic polynomial dimensions of uh rational uh cycles of Cycles on X bar defined over there. Well, so basically, to see how invariant can change after some of algebra, one can analyze how many new algebraic cycles we get if we extend our base. And yeah, I'm gonna try to do it for generically split. For generically split, but actually, it is more convenient to do it for the product x times simple power of a and y is still okay because motif of such protocol has the same mativity decomposition. Protocol has the same material decomposition. Basically, the nature is the same, basically, it's the same. There are only the same sum, until some twists. So, same as for x. Does upper motive coincide, or projection to the first factor is actually Ah and okay, so uh and then it's it's easier to establish some relation between rational cycles here and rational cycles on X defined over F A. Between well, so uh there is a for usual child books, there is a sur surjective pool level. So basically Projective pullback. So basically, everything. Yeah. And then there is some technical lemma to base this rational segments here in terms of cycles here. And then actually it allows already to prove a injection for all components of degree greater than one, which are actually all. Which are actually all starting from three. So degree one and then three, five, etc. So yeah, we by the rational cycles we can prove that components three and the last one do not change. Well for to show that the second component does not change, it's more complicated. More complicated. So it basically only material interpretation was used. And for this component, one need to go to the next one. So texture, texture. Or this All this is how the idea how it can be proved. And next question which I would like to discuss is. Question: Which I would like to discuss is nice that we preserve information about all components except the first one, but we, however, lose the information about G1, so it goes to 0. And actually, it appears that one can cover this information, namely to find an explicit formula. And actually, it is. And actually, it is just a minimum of all known upper bounds for G. From what was known about G1 several upper bounds were known. So, first of all, it's what's equal to K1, which is the definition 2, portion of this primary nominal ring. And this is static valuation of degree A divided by 2. Also, it is known that. Also, it is known that G1 is less recall than IA. We do not like this trading correlation. This was proven in the article where the conjecture was stated. And also not hard to see that That better call the minimum A plus A minus where these are true this trade equal relation of index of different components of algebra with emergence because of fundamental relation but no hard But no part of this statement. Well, and if we combine all these upper bounds, of course, minimum of all of them is also an upper bound. And actually, this is the exact way. V1 is actually equal to minimum. To min come. Sorry, it's the spectrum. Yeah, min max. So G1 is equal to minimum for all these volumes. Yeah. Yeah. So it's such a explicit formula. Well, once again, idea how to prove. Okay, so first one can show that this G1 is is minimum minimum j such that with cycle is a ratio where um H is a H is a people point class in the Chao bounce projective class. And what is this X? So one cannot only take some generically split variety, but actually any X object homogeneous, such that the motif of this variety also has a nature. Nature composes like this well this is the one which is for grouping for our launch. And so here the the the the the main thing is The thing is take something which is not which does not split everything. So this is part two. Well, so and for x, one can take a variety of totally isotropic ideal of reduced dimension. So it's a form of Grasmanian auto is a torque subspace. And so there are two components corresponding to three for algebras. And so for x, take each of them. X plus, x minus themselves, they are not generically split, but with this seller browser, they are generically split, and there is such properties. And then we go to the function field called artifacts. And using and then we use action form and yeah, then we get exactly a minimum of lower bound, which is minimum of upper bonds. Um okay so maybe Um okay, so maybe uh a thing to mention R there is also a formula for G2 which is also a component of degree one but is it is um responsible for Clifford invariant and one can compute it but not unfortunately. But not unfortunately, always, but if such condition falls. So basically if uh one of uh one of the cliffer components has index. If our components has index kind of less than index of output, then two is minimum physical processes. Other market. Well, similar statements of conjecture for algebraic or inventions holds also for a group of inner type. Instead of, so for A, we take the tz algebra and Then all components then components change the variant of the V, C is in the one of change. Well generic 3D of culture. Um is Is there nothing to say about the case where P is not equal to 2? Is it not interesting? Yeah, so it's yeah, for orthogonal evolution, it's not a too discrete. What space? Well, over some extension, co-prime to 2. So it will be trivial invariant. Is there any other multi-pretation of the J like the Is there another interpretation of this J invariant? Like if I know the J invariant of the group, can I say something in terms about the variety groups? Yeah, so for example, for quadratic forms, there are some nodes of Alexander Bishop, which are not. Of Alexander Bishop, which are not available. But so it measures, for example, some distances to fundamental ideals. But that's from my conversation. And so for the J1, it was zero if the calculus split, but it's not if and only if. Actually, if index of k is 2, then it's. Two other questions? Uh now we have a break. Uh right. And so, what if we have to use algebra?
