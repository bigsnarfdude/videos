Okay, so thanks very much for Christoph for the introduction. And thanks for inviting me to give talking in this wonderful event. And so basically I will be talking about triangular basis, certain basis for structure of algebraic groups. And this conference is about basis on class squareds and this perfect suits the theme of this conference. Of this conference, and I want to take this chance to say happy birthday to Vietnam Leglag. All right, so the overall plan is the following. We start with the overall, with a toy model, what we're talking about, and the main result. And then I will give you a detailed definition of the basis. I will introduce some important operations in class theory that allow us to manipulate these basis. And finally, how do we use this kind of operation to obtain our This kind of operation to obtain our main result. So, the last part is a bit technical. So, to start with, let us work with the base field K, which is a complex field or complex field together with a quantum number. So, this is for quantization. So, unless otherwise specified that this talk is the statement here, they always work with the classical level or the quantum level. And let us look at the following toy model that G to denote. That G to denote the group SL2, which is the collection of all the matrices such that the determinant is one. So this is the largest minor of size two. So you have row one two and column one two, right? And now the coordinate ring of this group G, this is a polynomial ring generated by four size one minors, minus one, one, minus one, two, and so on. And modulo, the determinant must be one. So this is a following relation. And this coordinate ring has a basis. The basis consists of class monomials in the size 1 minus 11, 1, 2, and 2, 1. Or class monomials or minors, monomials of minors in 1, 2, 2, 1, and 2, 2. So basically, we group the minors into two clusters, therefore the name class monomials and class algebra. And on this group, And on this group G, there was an open dense subset called double BSL. And the double Boucher CL consists of a matrix such that its off-diagonal entries are non-zero. This is open dense subset. Now, in this toy model, the upper class algebra or class algebra for simplicity, this is defined as the following. So it is an intersection of two Laurent polynomial rings. So for each cluster, for each class of generators, you take the For each class of generators, you take the corresponding Laurent polynomial ring. You have two and you intersect them. And it turns out that this algebra is nothing but the coordinate ring of the open dense subset of the double passenger. And in class theory, we can remember the setting, the two clusters in the following set. We can draw a quiver. So the three generators correspond to three vertices, are noted on three vertices of this quiver. So we have Of this quiver. So we have one generator that will change in different clusters. So it is unfrozen, and we use a Luan's node. And the two vertices, delta 1, 2, and delta 2, 1, these two off-diagonal minors, they never change. So they are called coefficients or flow. And we also have the following notion. So because this part, they never change, when we often consider the compactified version. So we do not allow data one. So we do not allow delta one, two, and delta two one to have inverse in our construction. And we still take the intersection of these two rings. And this gives you nothing but the coordinate ring of the group G. So this is our toy model. We have seen that the coordinate ring of a group G, this is a cluster algebra, upper class algebra whose floating versus are inverted. And the open dense subset, the double has. Open dense subset, the double has the coding ring has its flow dense inverted. And the group G has its coding ring whose flow density vertices are not inverted. So basically the background of class theory is the following. So I think many people in this conference know that. So Fomi and Saminsky, they invented class the algebra to study photopositivity and declinical basis. And they have the following expectation for many varieties from Lee theory like Varieties from Lie theory, like many things like Rustmania, for example, the coordinate ring or context coordinate ring is a cluster, is a cluster algebra. So we can take either version. Sometimes they have localized flown variables, sometimes they are not. But anyway, we expect that they have a good basis, which is an analog of the dual clinical basis, such that the basis contain all class monomies. And we have the following conjecture. If we return to the original dual clinical basis, To the original dual quantity of basis, and then the quantum class monomials they contain in the dual quantity of basis. I want to say that it takes some time to formulate this conjecture. So previously, we don't have a quantum class structure, and it was due to the work of Kimara and the important work by guys, LaClade, and Schwer. We know that the context coordinate ring Kn and more generally for the context coordinate ring of Nw, the unipotent cell, this is a cluster. And the symmetry doesn't symmetry. And the symmetric symmetrizable case was due to Boudiod and Yet. But anyway, so the proof of this theorem, this result can be the following. So in my recent work, I showed that the Deukenko basis is something called a common triangular basis. I will define that later. And this will immediately imply this conjecture. And some historic notes. Partial result, for example, the symmetric ID type was due to myself, and also symmetric casmuli type was due to Kashiwala, Khan, Kashiwala, Kim. Kachiwala, Kan, Kachiwala, Kimano. And after I solved this in all cases, there was a later work by McNabla who showed that the result also works if you replace the dual connector basis by the peak due of the peak negative basis in some sense. And the main result of this talk is the following. We consider any group G. So let me remember that. So here you see that this result concerns the coordinate ring over the upper triangle matrix, I would say. The upper channel matrix, I would say, the unipotent radical. And in gravitation theory, like the catalogation, it's natural by the non-trivial task to extend the result from upper triangular matrix to the entire group G, right? You want to have both the upper triangular and the lower triangular at the same time. And in Rundo-Ho algebra, this was, for example, due to Bridgeland's work. He considered a two-periodic complex. And well, so we try to extend the result from N to G. From n to g. So now let g denote any connected, simply connected linear algebraic group, and g uv is double Hessel, whatever it is. So it is an intersection of two since depends on the wire group and u and v and its coordinate ring and its context coordinate ring is a class algebra. We already know that. And recently, due to the work of Shen Ying Hui and Weng, we know that the double bosom both semi-cell both some both sum and cell is bordering is also a classical well here we only know the we only have the classical version of the definition and this is something i don't define it it is kind of a generalization of the double pipe sound and also we know that the coordinate ring of the entire group sl n this is the upper class right so the first result if you take the context coordinate ring or the classical coordinate ring of double class l or if you take the Or, if you take the coin ring of the double boss summer sensor, this kind of class algebra they always possess the common triangular basis. And moreover, the basis has positive structure constants when the Garden datum is metric. So, we have already seen that the result has been sended from the upper triangular matrix to the double parcel. What about the entire matrix? So, remember that G is the closure of the largest double pass cell. So, we take the closure, we are talking about compactification. We are talking about compactification. And the second result is: if we work at a classical level, then the coordinate ring of G is a classic algebra, the compactified version, and the above statement is still true. That means it still has the triangular basis, and the basis is positive when the Garden data is symmetric. Well, here, as I said, we have to restrict to a semi-simple case. Because in Casimudi case, this ISBO is too large to be. This is too large to be a classical number. And given this result, because it is a natural question to ask for the context version of this result, we already have a definition of a context boundary over this G. And I want to say that these two results will appear in my paper in preparation. And later I realized that context version is too complicated to treat in one paper. So, well, this is left for future work. This is much more complicated than the class version. Complicated than the classical version. And the more interesting question is: on this context called ruin, we know there are the favorite basis called the global crystal basis invented by Cashwalla. And it is due to the canonical basis of the modified, or what's that, and a temporal tentative form of the context enveloping algebra. And that is a crystal structure. And we hope that the triangular basis you obtain using class theory is the same as the global crystal basis obtained by Pashuana. Basis obtained by Cashwalla using gravitational theory and abstract crystals. This is something we hope to be true. And this second aim is much more difficult. All right, so next let me introduce what is a triangular basis. We have the following convention. So a seed here denoted by T consists of matrix B. And we have lots of vertices which are either unfloated or floated. And matrix B is a skew symmetrizable integer matrix. Is a skew symmetrizable integer matrix, and when it is skewed symmetric, you can associate the equivalent to it, such that bij is the number of errors from i to j minus those from j to i. And we have generators xi for each vertex, and we have monomials of x, and we also have y k the y variables, so these are class boson variables, and they are defined as a monomials of the x. These are just some notations, while different literature sometimes we use. Well, different literature sometimes we use A and X in a literature which focuses on geometry. And for any amplitude vertex, we can use a mutation to generate a new seed. And if we iterate mutations, we get more seeds, class variables, and we get both versions of class as well. So you have the localized version and you have the compactified version, where the frozen are not inverted here. And in this talk, And in this talk, we always assume that the C can be quantized, which means that the submatrix on the M-flow columns is of full rank. So this equality equivalence was due to the work of JSV. And in this case, we have Q-twisted product denoted by star. So this means that this is a non-commutative product. This is our standard convention. And now we have the following observation. So we choose NACT. So, we choose any CT. We compare the class monomials with characters of modules. So, by the series of work, basically the classical shapes map, we know that the class monomials always take this form. So, you have x of g, this is the leading factor, and followed by polynomials in the y's, such that the constant term is one. And polynomials, or say, a Laurent series of this time is called g-pointed. And remember, And remember that if you take the highest weight module of a quantum of final growth and many other things from E-theory, you take the highest module S of highest weight W. And if you take its character, so it takes the form Y to the power of W, followed by polynomial or formal series in other variables A to the minus V. Well, this W and V remember the L dominant weight of these modules. And in particular, the constant term is one and other terms, these are dimension of eigen space. Dimension of eigen space. So you compare these two formula, you think that they are very similar. So in class theory, maybe there is a reputation theory behind. So you want to use this kind of polynomials. You want to treat them as if they are characters of simple modules and you want to study them. So first, we have to make sense of the highest weight vectors because, in general, if you have two vectors, you cannot say which vectors is bigger than the other one. Now introduce a dominance order, which is a partial. Introduce a dominance order, which is a partial order such that this vector G is the highest vector, highest degree in this expression. This partial order, which can be defined. And for expert, I want to say that in geometric grammar theory, this dominance order on curvarieties can be understood as a partial order of strata. And in monoidal category, it can be interpreted using degrees of the R matrices. So now we see that. So now we see that we are interested in this kind of row down theories and they have they are treated them as if they are high simple modules. But in general, we don't have a PBW basis like in quantum groups or we don't have a standard basis like in the height health groups. So we want an analog of this construction for any vertex i. Remember that the class variables xi, this is a lower monomial, so it has a degree given by fi. Degree given by Fi, Fi is a F unit vector. And for experts, in class category, this guy can be understand as a class character of a rigid module, rigid object. And in a monoidal category, these variables can be understood as the isotherclass of a simple module if you have a title. And PVW basis in general is the ordered product of lots of things, and we need more factors. Now, for any amplitude vertex, we define the pointed function, which is Pointed function, which is the ik such that we want it has a degree minus the unit vector, minus fk, but the modulus and frozen part, we don't care. So the natural definition is we take ik to be the quantum class variables whose leading degree is minus ik and modular sum frozen part. And this can be done for almost all well-known class algebra. Or more precisely, this can be done when there is a red green to red sequence in the sense of unhappy. And in general, you can define And in general, you can define it as a quantum theta functions. And for experts in categorization, this is a quantum class L variable corresponding to the shift of this TK, T as the same as a bar, so shift of complex. And in monoidal category, this is the u of the simple modules as a bar. If we have some kind of patient, and now we can try to control something which is analogous to the standard basis or TLA basis. Bases or key basis. I call them distinguished functions, and maybe you can also call them standard monomials, but they might not be so standard because the definition might not be unique. So whatever. So we define i m and prime. So m and m prime are multiplicity vectors. So these are certain pointed functions defined as follows. So you take the ordered product of x flow dens, and then ordered product of x unfrodeness, and then the ordered product of ik. So here. Product of IK. So here, the new generators, which are order fluids, you put an order product. And notice that you have the leading term. So the degree of X contribute to the unit vector. And the degree of IK contribute to the negative of the unit vector. So put them together, you can generate any vectors g that you want as a leading degree. And you need some Q power to make sure that the leading coefficient is one. This is a normalization. Normalization. And this kind of conjunction is redundant. Whenever you have XK and IK simultaneously, this means that you have contribution to FK and contribution to minus FK. So they inhibit with each other when you compute a leading degree. So we say that this kind of point function is reduced if xk and ak do not appear simultaneously. And in that case, we simply denote it by ig. And I want to say. And I want to emphasize that every conjunction here depends on your choice of the C. I want to say that by choosing a C, you choose a C, this is like choosing a word for a while group element, right? It's like in PMW basis, you can choose different reduced words, and this will give you different PW basis. And here we choose different seed will obtain. Seed will obtain different distinguished functions. And now the triangular basis in general is contracted as a custom Lucy type basis. So it is defined the triangular functions of leading degree G. This is defined as a unique Laurent series such that it is invariant under the bi-involution, and it has a triangular decomposition into the distinguished functions, or say standard monomials. So you have the same leading term, Lg and Ig have the same leading term, but in order to have bar involution. But in order to have variant evolution, you have to correct it by some lower terms. You have corrected by Ig'. G prime has a lower degree than G. And the coefficient are required to have negative power in the cubes. So in this sense, that class analystic algorithm, you apply it infinitely many steps. This will give you Laurent series and which are unique. This is a general definition. And now, if the class algebra has a basis, such that any choice of C. That any choice of seed, the basis is a collection of the triangular functions for that seed. And moreover, any distinguished functions, reduced or not, is a triangular decomposition in your basis. You have some triangularity. It's like you decompose PVW basis in the conical basis. If this holds for any choice of seed, and we call it the common triangle basis, or maybe for simplicity, the triangular basis. And then a convention, if you... And then a convention: if you class algebra has any sub-algebra, then this and the intersection of it with this sub-algebra is still a basis, the intersection is still called a triangular basis. So in this sense, we can talk about the triangular basis for the compactified version of class algebra. And the historic remark is that Bernstein-Zarwinski, they invented triangular basis for acyclic seed using a very different definition because they start with very different standard monomials. Start with very different standard monomials, the ordered product of simple modules. And later we can show that now triangular functions are the same as the triangular functions here for ACPC. So now there's only one triangular basis. And some properties. So triangular basis has joined properties. It contains all class monomials. And it generalizes the dual clinical basis. So remember that this was a motivation of class theory. And it is naturally parametrized by the chartical points of the Lagrange due. The choctape points of the Lagrange Q class varieties. And in terms of classification, by the inspiring work, Echendez and Leclerc, they propose the monoidal classification of class algebra. I will not skip the details. And I want to just say that for all known monoidal classifications using either quantum affine algebra, quibble heck algebra, or a fine graph maintenance, the collection of simple modules actually give you the triangular basis. Actually, give you the triangular basis. So, this is a categorical meaning of triangular basis. And moreover, so in this point of view, the triangular basis in our limited experience, it is always related to catabrication or geometric orientation theory, like previous customers type basis. And in our limited experience, this triangle basis, it has positive structure constants whenever the dotted matrix or say the matrix B is squeezy metric. Matrix B is Guys matrix. So these are good properties that we can expect from a basis. And to end this introduction to triangular basis, I want to say something, a possible open direction. So the triangularity of this triangular basis can be characterized as the following. So you choose any C T, and if you left multiply the class variable in that C, this gives you a triangular demosition. So you have the lead term, which has a term which has a which has expected degree g plus the degree of xi and you have lower terms and the lower terms has coefficient q whose degree is inferior than the degree of the leading term right and we have a similar statement if you do not work with the leading degree but if you work with the lowest degree i call it a co-degree so so basically if you consider this kind of deposition you have the leading term you have the last term you have some terms in the middle this is very You have some terms in the middle. This is very similar to what Tam Neiser talked about the biperfact basis. Hi, Fan. I had a question. Can you hear me? Yeah, sure. So I had a question. I added it in chat, but I have a microphone now. I was just curious, this characterization is very interesting. Does it hold in the unquantum, the classical case as well, of Q is equal to one? I mean, you can always specialize Q equal to one. But the problem, and you can talk about that perfect basis. And you can talk about that perfect basis there. But the problem is that this kind of algorithm, if you want to compute the basis from the standard monomials, you have to work with Q. Otherwise, you do not have an algorithm for the computation. So you can always specialize Q21. Okay, I want to say that this is the end of Leclerc's conjecture for deuconical basis. So in a very early paper by Leclerc, he conjecture this kind of properties for the deuconic basis. Of properties for the department basis, well, xi is something called a real basis element, and that was proved by Kashwala and his collaborators. And in the sense of Leclerc, we would say that this left multiplied by Xi acts like a crystal operator. And of course, you can multiply Xi on the right. So you have EI and EI star, whatever. So there are some similarities, but the big problem for class theory is that we don't have Chevrolet generators. So this is something we have to, we don't have Chevrolet generators. We don't have Chevrolet generators. So, we do not really have a definition, a correct replacement of the crystal operators, but still we have some combinatorial similarity. And maybe in future, maybe someone can make sense of this. All right, so let me introduce somehow the main content of this talk. First, the general method for treating these spaces, we have operations in class theory. So, I want to introduce the freezing operations. So I want to introduce the three thing operators. We choose any c t, and we take any Lorentz series of this form. So xi, x to the power of m, the lean term, followed by a series in the y's. So I want to say that so the degree here, in some sense, so the degree is bounded by m. So this is the meaning of this Laurent series. And I want to notice that I do not require the constant term to be non-zero. So if the constant term is So if the constant term is zero, so we have degree strictly smaller than n. So this is a respect to the dominance order, of course. And now, given any collection of n-flow, the vertex, we can always freeze this vertex. And this gives you a new seed called T prime. So basically, you are not allowed to mutate at this subset F. Now we define the freezing operators, which send yk for k in this subset to zero for this kind of Laurent series. For this kind of Laurent series. So it means that we send Z using this regional object Fm. It depends on your choice of a linear degree. If sent to Xm to the power of to a formal series of Y such that Cn, only those Cn who has a vanishing coordinate on K are preserved and other things are killed. And in particular, in general, if Z has a leading degree, M, sorry, I should put an underline here, has a leading degree. Should put an underline here as a leading degree m then we can abbreviate fm to simply denote it by f because we underscore the we take the we take the freezing from the leading degree of the degree of z. This is just abbreviation. So this is some easy operation. We just send some value variables in this definition to zero. And it has following properties which can be checked directly. The first property is easy. So you can check that if you take a product of two point elements. The product of two point elements, then it is the same as you first free them and then you take the product, right? And for the addition, it is a bit more tricky if you take the sum of two pointed series and assume one series has a degree bigger than the other one. And you take the freeze starting from the bigger degrees, and then you can decompose it. So you have some a bit annoying, you have to always remember which degree you start from by working with this. Start from by working with this. And now there's a one non-trivial statement result that this F reading, it will send the localized class monomials of the class algebra to the localized class monomials of the class algebra for the fluency. And as Greg Mueller is here, I want to say this is similar. This is something observed. Basically, this is something observed by the work of Mueller. So it is like the existence of green to. Existence of green to red sequence is preserved by freezing. You can, if you are interested, you can look at his paper. So, he explained that how do you use a scattering diagram to show this kind of property? So, you remove some words and you get the same thing. And similarly, one can show that the theta functions are fluid with theta functions, right? For experts, if you know what are theta functions. So, now remember. So now remember that the triangular basis are uniquely defined using the algebraic relation with the class monomials, the product of class monomials. And now we can show that if the class algebra has a triangular basis, then after freezing, it still has a triangular basis. Because the algebraic relations are preserved under the freezing. So this is our first operator. Our second operator is something called coefficient change. is something called coefficient change and here in the following i will allow relabeling vertices and rescaling q to q alpha in the following so two c's t and t prime are called similar if they share the same amfroden submatrix or say amphoros quiver right and in this case we denote t tilde t prime and we can always make sense of similarity between quantum seats i will omit so basically we are talking about the compatible pairs how do we treat it and now if you take And now, if you take any point in the Laurent series for the first seed, which has a leading degree n with f polynomial, so this is polynomial in the y's. And you take the Laurent series for the second seed with a leading term n prime and polynomials fz prime. And they are quite similar if the leading degrees are the same and the unfrozen vertices. So, fluid part, we don't care. And if the f part are the same, right? So, in some sense, if Right, so in some sense, if they are modules, you can imagine that if they are simple modules, this means that the epochs are the same. So, roughly speaking, these are isomorphic simple modules, right? You might have different heights degrees and the fluid part, but the epoch basically tells you about the dimension of its eigenspaces. So, now if you have two similar C's, the good thing is that the class algebras actually share similar structures. For example, localized class monomials, they are similar, and this was. They are similar, and this was not known due to the work of Formi and Zalvinsky in their class algebra IV paper, right? You have this separation formula tell you how to compute class monomies independent of your choice of C's. And we, if the more important thing for us is that if the class algebra Ut has a well-behaved basis, S, and the similar elements form a basis for Ut prime. So basically, the linear structure are preserved. So basically the linear structure are preserved. And it is easy to check that if two C's are similar and so do their mutated C. This is easy to check. So well here it looks very algebraic. What about the geometric picture? So kind of I enjoy this geometric picture. We use a coefficient ring RT to denote the Lawrence Laurent polynomial ring in the floor the matrices. Remember that these are the things that are nano are the things that are never mutated in our class algebra and this is obviously a sub-ring of the upper class algebra and we also have the seed called the seed of principal coefficient to a given seed so basically you change the coefficient part you put for any amphibian vertex you put a framing vertex which is fluid such that matrix is of the following form you have identity matrix from the fluid part to the amphora part and now assume that this principle And now assume that this principal coefficient classy algebra has an R basis. R is our coefficient ring. And the basis take this form. These are pointed elements. So for each leading degree G, which has an amension vector, amphibian degree vector, you have some leading degrees and some F in. Assuming it has this kind of basis, then the claim is that we have the following Cartesian products. So T spectrum of U T, this is a Cartesian product of this spectrum, U. Of this spectrum u over this coefficient ring. And similar thing happens for the ut prime. And here the map pi, we have already defined that these are just a natural inclusion map of the sub-ary, the coefficients into the entire algebra. And the f star is also nothing new. So this is, you send the amphibian vertex xk to xk. And for frozen guys, you send the flow mean vertex to the monomial in the frozen. To the monomial in the frozen vertex of t. So, in this case, so this definition will guarantee that f star it sent y variables of the principal part to y variables of this general thing. This is the definition. And then, why it is a Cartesian product? Because actually the algebra over here, it is a tensor of this algebra with this Rt. So, if more precisely, if the more precisely if you apply this map f to your seed s sorry to your basis s you obtain a basis for ut over the new coefficient ring so as i want to say that everything here they hold up to relabeling vertices and rescaling the q power to q to the power of alpha which often appear in class theory yeah so to end this part i want to give you an easy example so I want to give you an easy example. So, in this example, I learned this quiver. I learned this relation between this quiver from Bernhard Teller 10 years ago. He told me about the communatorial similarity between this quiver. So the first quiver, actually this is a C for the coordinate ring of a uniform cell, where the Y group element is C to the power of 3. C is a cox element, 1, 2, 3. So actually, this is. Right, so actually, this is a fine-type quantum group. You take a unit of self, and this was uh Geisler Plan Schwarz have made lots of works on this direction. And we also have a different seed that this is for study the quantum of fine algebra representations. And you have a certain level two subcategory, and this coordinate ring is a percentage ring, it's a classic algebra. And the quiver is given by this. You see that if you delete the last slice, you obtain. Delete the last slice, you obtain the quiver on the right. And now, what can we do? What can we do about this class algebra on this quiver? So, you take any class variables, for example, you take Z. This is a class variable I computed using Keller's mutation program. So, it has a leading term x4 inverse x7. And followed by polynomials inner y's. This is a long polynomial. So, basically, this is like the projecting modules from position 4. So, it is like the So, it is like the root vector, the fourth root vector in the quantum group. So, this is something you can compute. This is a class monomial. Now, if you freeze three and six, what you get, you remove, you remove all the y three here because they are sent to zero. And then you obtain a low-long polynomial of this type. After freeze, you get a new C. So, after you freeze, this becomes fluids. This is our. Frozen. This is our frozen seed. And finally, you delete the last slice. All the slides here, these are frozen. So we can change the coefficient to obtain the cuba on the right. And this guy is similar to that trine. Well, actually, they are the same in this situation. And you see that Z trine is nothing but the fundamental modules for this one. So this is nothing but the fundamental modules. I don't know how to run. I don't know how to run Python, for example. Fundamental modules for this quantum file. And here, this is in some sense, this is corresponding to how to write maybe the B. Can you hear me now? Yeah, no problem. Okay, sorry, sorry. I just think that my computer was my internet was. Computer was my internet was interrupted for a few seconds. Okay, so this is like the geocodical basis element corresponding to this. I forgot the maybe the notation is like this. FR notation of camera is beta four. So this is beta four. You see beta four and pi four, they are related in this way. So we do not have a we do not have the problem with my sound. Is a problem with my sound? I hear some echoes. Okay, here. Okay, so we do not have a functors related to them. Well, there was a close related work by Kachiwana and his collaborators called Shorewire Duality. And for finite type, I think one can kind of construct a function. But in general, I think it would be. Of construct a function, but in general, I think we don't have a function. But anyway, the application is that if you take the because we already know that the left-hand side has a triangular basis. Now we have applied the frozen freezing operator and we change the coefficient. We know that the triangular basis are still kept. So this guy has triangular basis. And this recovers the previous result of myself, which was proved differently. All right. So finally, all right so finally let us proceed to the main result so proof of the main result so first the double both some both summons we let a to denote any symmetrizable generalized gala matrix and we have generalized braid group and which has some subject to some relations whatever and for any word j we have a word s j this is a element in a grade group defined as a composition of the simple reflections these are standard The simple reflections, these are standard notations, and by the work of Sheng and Wong, they prove that for any double both semen cell, whatever it is, so it's calling ring is a class diaspora. So this is important for our talk. Well, the precise definition does not concern us. And I will explain the seed here immediately. And before that, I just want to say here the seed depends on your choice of word J and word K and certain triangulation. And if you change your choice of the words for the sake of Your choice of the words for the same grade group element, and if you change your choice of the triangulation, you obtain these two C's are related by mutations. So you obtain the same class as well. Example of the C. It's a bit complicated, but once you understand it, it is nice. So in this example, we look at type A2 and we take this word: J is one and K is 2, 1. Now we draw. one now we draw this trapezoid this trapezoid has a has a top j and here i denote the letters of j by a negative sign and it has a bottom has a base k and you have two and one and we divide it into translation so this is something you have a word above word below and you can and you can divide into translations and i call this a translation minus plus because if Of minus plus because if you come from left to right, the base of triangle starts from the negative letters and then continues by the positive letters. So the first triangle has minus one, the second triangle have have two other bases like this. And now we draw two lines because we have two vertices for this part matrix. We draw two lines, line one and line two. And for each triangle, because it has a base letter one, we insert a vertex. A vertex in this line one. And for this second triangle, because the base is two, we insert a letter in this line two. And the inserted letters divide the lines into intervals, right? You have a bounded intervals, which are denote by red, and you have blue intervals, which are unbounded ones. And now we have this understand this conjunction. So now for each triangle in a triangulation here. In a triangulation here, I replace it, I put a small oriented cycle around these inserted letters, right? Like this. So you have horizontal arrows and you have these vertical arrows like this. And the arrows has weight, Aij divided by two. And when now finally you sum up all the arrows. So basically you have three triangles. If the triangles is has netting letters, this is. Has negative letters, this is a clockwise. If the triangle has a positive letters, this is counterclockwise. And you sum them up and you forget all the arrows between the flow dens, you get this quiver. So this is what you get by this conjunction. And it works very nice for every triangulation and for every choice of words. You see that here we have from interval two and three, you have a two cycle, so they are killed in your final conjunction. So so the So the claim is that the double both summer cell, dial coordinate ring is the same as the class dialogue, upper class algebra for DC. And what about the unipotent cells? We have talked about the quantum groups and deconditing basis. So now if you take the while group W, while group element, while group W, so this is the quotient of real group by this relation, and we take any reduced word for the Y group element W. The Y group L and W, then its unipon cell is a class algebra of certain seed T plus delta W, which I will show you in the plane. And this can be a plane as the following. So you will repeat the same conjunction as in the convention in the previous slide. So now we have a word one, two, one. Here I take the longest word in A2 in the previous conjunction. I take the longest word W0. So this is W0 is S1, S2, S1. 0 is s1 s2 s1 and we repeat the same construction so now because every letter is a positive so you all you all only have counterclockwise arrows uh cycles and you put them together sum them up you get this quiver and you remove the left open strings you get this quiver so this quiver is the seed over here is the seed to define the class structure on this unique cell and at the quantum version this is the And as a quantum version, this is the quantized coin ring, which contains the quantum dual quantal basis. So everything can be, the seed can be constructed in this way. And what about the relation between double-boha cell and the unimpassed cell? So this is an interesting observation. So we apply our operations of class theory here. So assume that we have two words, J and K, they are reduced words for the two Y group elements. Now the double Pohasl is a special case. Double port cell is a special case of the double both semi-cell. We are using J and K, J above, and K below. So in our toy model, our J and K are nothing but one in our toy mode in the beginning slide. And here, we can choose any translation. For example, in our toy model, we have this quiver. So this corresponds to translation plus and minus. You start with the plus letter and you end up with the negative letter. And you do a mutation at two. This gives you the second query in our toy model. In our toy model. And in triangulation, it means that you change the triangulation from minus to plus. So it starts from minus on the left, and you have plus on the right. And you see that the small oriented cycles, they change the directions because the letters change. And then you can do something called reflection. So reflection. So basically, you reflect this part upside down. So you get this. Upside down, so you get this one: this different tripe load with different triangulation, and after reflection, you get a new quiver. And you see that these two seeds, they only differ at the coefficient part. So these two seeds are similar in our previous notation. So this is very close. But the drawback is that this seed, because you now you put a union of two seeds, these are not reduced. This cannot be reduced in a while group. In a while group, and in order to make a useful word, you can insert more letters. So, here you enlarge. So, previously, the garden datum here is two, and extended the garden datum here is two, two, minus one, minus one. So, you enlarge your garden datum to a higher rank. You invert a vertex two here. So, basically, you invert a new slice and you invert a letter two here to make it a reduced word. This is something you can do. And the result. Can do. And the result is that you end up with a quiver which has a new horizontal line here. And I want to say that this is an oversimplified example because, on the first hand, we only have to do reflection once, but in general, we have to do reflections many times to make all letters from top to bottom. And second, here we only insert one letter to make it a reduced word. If J and K are not... If J and K are not reduced words, we have to insert many letters, and the result is that there might be unfolding vertex above. Whatever. So here you have a new line of new slice of vertices. And to get back, how do you do? You freeze every vertexes, every vertex on this new slice, and you delete them. So this is single and freeze. So these are the relation. And its connection we have seen before. So here, this reduced word is a connect to the usual content. Either connect to the usual quantum group setting by removing photometers. So now everything is related by similarity and by mutations. And the existence of bases we have explained is operations, they are always preserved and all this process. So the general conjunction is we take the double semi-cells from unipotent cells as follows. We take any words J and K, this is a general conjunction. You extend the size R matrix A. extend the size R matrix A, Gadda matrix to a size R plus one Gadda matrix. And you can insert more letters to make this make this union of words a reduced word W. So J of means that you take the opposite of J and then this original seed for this double board semicelles it can be computed from the new seed which is for content groups by mutations, freezing and coefficient change as before. So you can always do As before, so you can always do reflections which are coefficient change. So each time you, if you choose a translation NECI plus, and each time you can reflect one letter below. So you can move one letter J1 below. And now you end up with some new translations, and then you can use mutations to change the translation, make it still negative, positive. And now you can reflect it again, and then you move one more letter below. And you repeat this evidence. And you repeat this algorithm until you obtain a seed which is only has letters below. So this is J of K data. And finally, insert many, many letters R plus, R plus Y into this once. And you see that this new seed can be obtained from a seed for quantum groups by freezing and then deleting the vertices on the line r plus one. And in general, because we have already known that the quantum groups or the context coordinating of any. Groups or the context coordinate ring of nw it has the triangular basis, therefore, this original double bought semi-cells itself has the triangular basis. And because if this basis is positive on the left, this basis is positive on the right. This is kept the structure constants kind of kept by this process. So this is a general, how we prove the general theorem. And in the end, I want to mention about the extension to the entire attribute group, which might be very interesting for the reason of orientation theory. Reason of orientation theory. So remember that you take the largest double Bruhan cells, and this coordinating is a class algebra denoted by U. And now if you take the closure of this one, this is G. And now we can first show that the coordinate of G is actually contained in the compactified classial. Why? Because if you take any rational functions from the localized Rational functions from the localized version, it is well defined on the entire group G, means that it is regular on the divisors. And regular on the divisors means that its Lohron expansions has no Xj in the denominator. So nothing that it is contained is compactified upperclass LG. And then we show that these two guys actually are the same. So this is based on a comparison of relational functions up to co-dimension 2 on G. We already know that by this first equality, this But by this first equality, these two things they are the same on the open dense subset. So it's sufficient to work on co-dimensional one. For any floating vertex, there exists a double Bochesl Vj, which is open dense in the divisor, Fj. And now it is known by, well known that the coordinate ring of the double Bohr cell Vj is the localization of the quotient of the coding ring of G modulus XJ. And we already know that this coding ring of double Bochesl. Know that this coding ring of double passes is a class delta, which I denote by u prime. And now in class algebra side, we can show that u prime is nothing but the localization of this u bar, this compactified version, modulo the xj. So it takes some time, but one can do this. So we see that these two constructions, C V J and U prime, they're constructed in the same way. And kind of you put all these things together, you can obtain these two rings, actually. Two rings at C. And finally, in terms of the basis on CG, I want to say that if you take the triangular basis on this upperclass algebras, and you restrict it on the sub-algebra, CG, and this is the basis for CG. Why? Because the floor vertex is for expert, the fluid vertex, for any fluid vertex, there's an optimized C such that there's only arrows from J to K. And based on this, you can always restrict spaces. Like the theta basis version was true. The theta basis version was treated in the work of GHKK, and here we can do the same for the triangle basis. So we get the basis for this coordinating of G. All right, all right, so this is the end of my talk, and thanks for your attention. And again, I want to say happy birthday to Benna. Okay, so again, so are there questions from the online participants? May I ask question? Sure. Okay. So in the last result, so can we also prove that CZ coincides with the compactified version of ordinary crust algebra? Yeah, this. Yeah, this is a good point. This is a very good point. So, I recently was thinking about this problem: A and U A equals U plus. So, basically, this or the A by equal to U bar problem. Well, for me, because now I have been mostly working with the basis and from the geometric point of view and from the basis point of view, plus algebra A, this is very difficult to work with. The definition is very difficult to work with A. And yes, I expect this to hold, but for the moment, I don't have a proof. Yeah, it will maybe in the future I will think about this problem. I expect this to hold true. Yeah, I don't have proof at the moment. Okay, thank you. Are there further questions from any participants? If not, then maybe we can ask the in-person participants there. Hello, this is David. Hello. About common basis, you mentioned at some point that it is known that for arbitrary monoidal categorification, they correspond to simple modules. So I was thinking, do you include non-representation of non-ADE quantum affine algebras in your statement? Well, it should be true. I mean, it's like whenever there's a monoidal calculation of classical. So for the moment, most monoidal calculations, they have the good property in terms of R matrix, right? In terms of the analog of Laplace conjecture. So as far as I understand, So, as far as I understand, in the proof of the non-ID type, Cachuada and his collaborators, they have constructed functors from the pupil hypersports, monoidal category to the customer file as well, right? And this means that the triangular properties, they are kept. So you have the utensil with a real simple module, so you should have a living term and other terms. And then this means that it is still the triangular basis. Basically, what you need is. Yeah, basically, what you need is a triangularity. Yes, but you mentioned a stronger statement, isn't it? Related to the cache dynastic construction. If I understood correctly. Well, anyway, my short answer is yes, I think so. But I haven't gone into details, but the idea is that if you start from any analog of the KKKO's approach, if any analog of that approach exists, then it is the same. Approach exists, then it is the same as triangular basis. So, what you need is just the tangularity in their approach. Okay, thank you. Hey, fan, it's Greg. So, you have some great results about how these bases behave under freezing. Can you say anything about how they behave under unfreezing? Like, if I make some frozen variables. You know, make some frozen variables mutable. Do you know basis elements won't change? Yes, thanks very much for the question. So, well, and freeing, yeah, this is we can work in two ways. So, so basically, the general idea, I mean, I didn't go into details, but general idea is that if you have a Q, for example, this is something like this, and you have Q prime is something which is frozen, right? And then the track. And then the triangular basis L here, the F polynomials, they have support in one, two, three, in one and two. So kind of this give you the basis element here. But here you have more complicated versions. LG, L prime. So here, so the short answer is. So, the short answer is like maybe up to some conditions. I have to check details. But the short answer is that the subquiver, the triangular assume that both guys exist, the triangular basis for both guys exists. So, we have to assume that they exist. We have to assume that this guy already has a chunk of. I don't know in general if it has or not. It's not like a theta basis. So, assume that both guys have a chunk of basis. Then, the chung basis for the subquiver, this is a chungle basis element for the This is a triangle basis element for the bigger query. But in general, how to compute all the triangular basis of the big query from the subquil is unknown. And I'm very interested in knowing how to compute. I don't know. Yeah, I know that you have some joints with John W. Travis also working on this similar problem for CITAB. And also this kind of maybe because you're expert, I want to say that this was due to the result of KRB Primondon that if we work with a generic class or generic basis, so generic basis of Q crime. So, genetic basis of q' the leaves to genetic basis elements of q. So, but in general, how do you compute all genetic basis elements from the q prime? This is still open question. Interesting. All right. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for your question. May I ask question? So, Michelle Geckman showed me an example that if you have a quiver, which upper cluster. Which upper cluster algebra coincide with cluster algebra, and then you freeze some of variables, then this property is not herited. So that means that you can lose this. Yes, maybe. Yes. Yeah, and so how it is, but with basis, you still okay? With basis, so so general in general, this guy, this is a very difficult question because this guy really depends on depends. Depends on depends on the frozen part, depends on the coefficient. But for basis, the basis, what we have been working about, so whatever this triangle basis or the theta basis or generic basis, all these kinds of good basis, they are R basis. They are not just the linear basis, they are basis. R is the coordinate and fluids. So, in this sense, that you do not lose anything. So, the action of fluids is kind of interesting in some sense. Interesting in some sense. So, we are talking about a localized version of the upper class algebra. So, in this sense, that you always work with R basis. And in my first slide, it's like your different C's, they are just kind of related by Cartesian products in some sense. Yeah, it's here. So, different basis they are related by Cartesian product. So, once you have a basis for this upper class, you also. Basis for this upper class else you add principle coefficient and then you get basis for the other other classes. You always work with a localized version, right? And I also want to say that the effect of the frozen part, they come into play when you look at the compactified version. So this guy has basis or not. This depends on this might depend. I don't know. This might depends on the frozen part or coefficient. The frozen part or coefficient this is a this is in general this point in general we i don't know if you take the restriction of the of this guy the basis here to the sub algebra it is still a basis or not we don't know in special case we can show it but in general we don't know so this is a this is a bad this is a difficult algebra where the basis the frozen part come into play but if you work with this localized version it's fine it's fine thank you Thank you. Any further questions? Well, then if this is not the case, then let's think again, France.
