I am you well, it's okay. Yes, we can hear you. Cool. Okay, so thank you Alina for the introduction. So, I apologize for not being there. And me, I don't have a good excuses for flight because actually, Arizona is quite close to where you are, but I have to take care of my two kids. So, that's my excuse. Anyhow, so here I'm going to talk about kinetic theory for econophysics. So, it's going to be a relatively simple talk. I know it's the last talk of the day. So, we're going to see like a couple of So we're gonna see like a couple of examples of how basically an interacting particle, but instead of like velocity exchanging velocity, like alignment we've seen this morning is just about money. And before starting, let me just mention that that's it's a joint work by a former student, Feikao, that did most of the work. Okay, so let me just give you like a quick outline of my talk. So basically I'm gonna have like five parts, but this is gonna be rather quick. So first I introduce the main model, very basic idea about how we Model, very basic idea about how we exchange money. And then we're going to see the usual flow. So we're going to see how we can pass to the limit as the number of agents goes to infinity, then how we can pass the limit when t goes to infinity, etc. Okay, so let's start with some motivations. So econophysics, the way to kind of motivate the study here, let me just show you a graph about the income distribution in the US. And what's interesting here is, of course, like this is the distribution, how it decays over, like How it decays over when you have a lot of income or you have less people earning that much. I apologize here for this kind of weird behavior here, this bunk, just because it changes here in this figure. Anyhow, so we have like a kind of like exponential decay, more or less. And what I'm interested in here when you do econophysics is mostly here the so-called Pareto index, how the distribution actually decay at infinity. The other thing that's interesting is that how much inequality. How much inequality do you have in the distribution? So, a perfect, I mean, perfect. In a sense, no inequalities that will be here, they all have just the same amount, okay? So, that will be this green distribution, and of course, you never like this, it's spread out. So, the so-called Gini index that measures this difference. So, two main, I would say, two main questions here. So, how much inequality do we have and what's the parallel index? And of course, the two are linked. Okay, so before starting, let me just mention also some words. Mention also some work that will be influential for us. So let's start with a kind of Kinetico equation to describe econophysics. So actually, there is two of the authors of the paper I mentioned later are here this week. So Bertrand During and Lorenzo Pareschi. So here we start with directly a kinetic description. So you have a density of distribution of the wells and you see how things exchange, usually like collision interaction. Collision interaction. And what we're going to do, we're going to go there, but we're going to start more by a particle system, so more like a discrete exchange. So we have like end particles and they exchange money. And so you have many, many papers starting to study that more like from experimentals. So to do some numerical simulation and see how it goes. So we're going to try to go from discrete, let's say, to continuous. Okay, so without further ado, let's introduce one model. Let's introduce one model I'm gonna start talking a lot about, and I'll call it this one the one-dollar model. Very basic, and people, and you pick two guys in a room, and one has to give one dollar to the next. As simple as that. So, here I illustrate that. So, we take I and J, and I has to give $1 to J. And of course, if he has a dollar, if he doesn't have a dollar, then okay, that's it. He cannot do much. And so, the question here with very basic dynamics is to see. Dynamics is to see what's happening in the long run. It's quite nice because that's for once it's a mathematical model that's easy to explain to if you go to, I don't know, a party, etc. It's very easy to expand that. There's no need to write down PD or anything like that. And the funny thing that many people thought like is kind of like very fair or dynamic. So you expect that it's going to be more or less like not so much inequality. And of course, it doesn't work this way. So let me just do a simulation. Whoops. Way, so let me just do a simulation. Whoops, sorry, let's start back. So, let me show you the simulation of this dynamic. So, I'm going to start with 1,000 agents, all have $5. So, in terms of on the right side, you see the distribution, it's no inequality whatsoever, everybody have $5. And the minute you start playing this game, one give a dollar to another one, okay? Immediately, what you see is that some are lucky, they get money, some are not, so less money, and you have more or less kind of a diffusion. Have more or less kind of a diffusive type behavior, kind of expect. But the other thing that changed in dynamics is that, of course, you cannot go have negative dollars here. And so quickly you're going to see that many are going to go bankrupt, basically. So many people are going to, I just going to have zero dollars. And instead of have like a kind of a diffusive behavior, like a Gaussian distribution for the distribution, it's more like exponential decay. I mean, here is discrete, so it's a geometric decay. Here is discrete, so it's a geometric decay. And so that's what we try to understand. Can we see here this division? How do we explain how this distribution appears? Okay, so let me just mention that this is just one dynamics we're going to really, because I don't have that much time to work on, but we can do of course some extension. So this is I call it end bias. So we take two guys and one gives to the other one. So that is the distribution we get. So that is a distribution we get, and we're going to see later on that's actually a geometry distribution. But then we can play. So, for instance, you can say, yeah, but let's make it more fair. If you have more money than you have to give more, you're more likely to give. So, it's more like a tax system if you want. The more money you have, the less likely that you pick to give. And in that case, instead of exponential geometry here, it's more like a Gaussian if you want. Again, it's discrete, so that's actually a possible. That actually was. Finally, if I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to say a few words about this, Fair actually had an interesting idea. Let's actually go the reverse. So more like tax evasion, if you want. So the more money you have, the less likely you actually pick to give a dollar. So instead of like, yeah, I'm rich, more likely to give, I managed to hide my wealth, whatever. And so I'm less likely to give. In that case, it's kind of reverse. Instead of like decreasing the inequality, Decreasing the inequality, you kind of increase, and this is a behavior you have at a given time. So, barely, I mean, most of them are going to be like bankrupt, and few of them are going to be very rich. Okay, so that's kind of the motivation, the kind of basic model, and what we're going to study is to see can we do math with that? Can we prove some result, etc. Okay, so um here's where when we started I started this, um my colleague actually at ASU Nicola Richer showed me some work. Show me some work. And he's a probabilistic guy, so what he has done is study one dollar model. So this is n-bias exchange. And what he did actually is start to study what's happening in the long run first. So t goes to infinity, n is fixed, and then let n goes to infinity. And he managed to prove some interesting results. So he managed to actually, I was very surprised, n is fixed, he managed to pass the limit t goes to infinity. And there is some reason for that because it's actually That because it's actually if you look on the long run, if you look at the whole process or the end particle process, is actually the total amount of money is conserved. So whatever you do here, you have to move in a simplex. And basically, all the states are uniformly there is no preference for one state or the other. So you can do some combinatory and end up with an explicit formula. End up with an explicit formula for the equilibrium. Anyhow, so that's what he did. Very nice. But of course, I mean, using kinetic theory, we're more used to kind of use the other way around. So instead of going t goes to infinity and then n goes to infinity, we're going to do the reverse. So first we let we fix t and we let the number of particles or h n goes to infinity and try to see what's happening afterwards. So he doesn't like it. I prefer that. He's fine, it's too difficult. I find his approach too difficult. Is too difficult, Afani's approach is too difficult. My only, uh, I mean, my only thing that I think made better this approach is that this is more robust in some sense. We can do like many type of dynamics. We don't need to have this simplex strategy. Anyhow, you hear him, you have a different take. So, that's what we're going to do. So, we go first, take n goes to infinity and then let time goes to infinity. So, the first part here, so it's called propagation of girls. You fix again at time t and we let the number of At time t, and we let the number of players go to infinity. So let's see how it goes here. So propagation of chaos. And it works like this. So let's first start a little bit more mathematically. So all I need to describe my model like I give to J, I just need actually to have clocks. So all of this here have n square clocks. And every time I have a clock that ring, let's take this one here in purple. Here that just means that one, I have to give one dollar to two. And so of course they have n square clock and each of them are independent. Square clock, and each of them are independent, and every time one ring, you have to give it up. So, if I look at just one particle, one agent, let's say number one, what matters for him is actually the red clock, meaning here that's all the clock when I have to give, and the green clock, this is all the clock when I receive. So, if you combine them together at the end, here you have like giving a giving rate, and here that's a receiving date rate. Okay, so let's recombine. Great. Okay, so let's recombine that so we can. Okay, sorry for the presentation, it's a little bit heavy, but at the end of the day, it's not too complicated. If you look at one process, he's going to give with given rate. If you have a dollar, he gives. And this one here, that's the amount he's going to receive. And the amount he's going to receive is always one, but it matters how many people are rich. I mean, rich here is not just having one dollar. If you have one dollar in this model, you consider rich because you can give. Rich because you can give. So the amount, the rate I'm going to receive a dollar is how many people are rich, okay? And that's the rate. So if everybody is bankrupt, basically I don't receive a dollar. So that's another way to write the particle system here. And it's relatively easy to see what would be formally the limit equation when you pass to the limit and goes to infinity. All I have to do here and replace here, so this is a coin, like This is a coin, like how many people are rich. I'm going to replace R here by like the law. So, what's the probability that S1 is a dollar? So, this is formally the limit, so it's quite similar. I just replace here instead of looking at all the other particles, how many are rich, one dollar, I just look at my own low, if you want, and I just look at what's the how likely I have one dollar. One dollar. So instead of having like all the interactions together, you can smash them just in one term here, but that makes this equation non-linear. So basically you interact with others yourself. I'm going to receive a dollar if this probability here is high. Okay, so propagation of chaos is what? It's just how to go from one to three. How do I pass not just formally now, but really kind of prove some convergence for this. Form this particle system here to the limit equation. And so that we can do. So let me just mention the results. So it usually goes like this: propagation of chaos. So you fix time. So that's your horizon. And what you look at is you take not just one, but K process. And what you need, you need to show that this K process basically become independent. So that's what this result means. And the convergence is always a weak convergence. It's a little bit technical. Usually, propagation of chaos, people just avoid that. You assume some independence and it works. So, I'm just mentioning the key idea. So, the key idea, going back there, we kind of do a coupling technique. So, we show that the particle system and the limit system, we basically use kind of the same clock. So, whenever something changes for the particle system, similar things happen for the limit equation, limit system. Equation, the immune system, and we'd have to do a trick just to say that maybe it's not exactly the same because the amount of rich people are not the same in the particle and for the remote system. But if they're not too far off, then the probability that are received and the other one not receiving is very low. So basically, if you start with the same amount of rich people for the particle system and the limit equation, then at least for a fixed time is testable. Time is test more. Anyhow, so that's a complicated argument. I don't want to go into more details into that. Again, I will put the paper at the end if you're interested. Just to mention is that there is another way to do, that I did not know, there is another way, a very nice way to prove this projection of chaos using a completely different strategy. For those who like more functional analysis, there is a way actually to write directly an equation for the so-called empirical distribution. Empirical distribution and there is kind of a flavor somehow of like a stochastic PD. You can write some explicit expression for how the empirical distribution evolved. And there is basically a deterministic term and some martingale, think about like some white noise. And so when n goes to infinity, this so-called white noise here disappears and you have convergence as well. So it's very nice. If you look at the paper, it's a little bit dense. Okay, it's just one-page proof. Bit dense, okay, it's just one-page proof, and you really have to kind of like look at all many references to kind of understand how it works, but it's quite nice. Okay, but let's skip that for now. Propagation of chaos, so we can do it, it's fine. Let's look at the other problem. So, suppose now, okay, I converge and goes to infinity, instead of having like n particle, I just basically have one, but it's interacting with itself, so it's non-linear. So, let's see how I can go from a See how I can go from this stochastic process to convergence to some equilibrium. Okay, so let's move on to the second step now. I'll start with my non-linear stochastic process and immediately forget about probability. Let's just write that down as something that we're more familiar with, writing that down as a kind of a PD style. It's discrete, but kind of PD if you want, where I have like evolution of a law, even Like evolution of a law given by some operator here. And this equation is very simple here, just to say that you have some rate to give, sorry, to give that's one, and some rate to receive. And this rate here depends on how many rich people there are. Very simple, just what makes this problem not so trivial is that this rate here, the amount of rich I receive, it's actually non-linear, because that depends on how many people are. How many people are rich, basically? So it's a non-linear dynamics because this rate here or bar is depends on rho zero. Okay, so now we want to see what's happened when t goes to infinity. And the strategy for that, when you see it, it's quite nice, it's quite easy. The equilibrium immediate, so you see that it's a geometric distribution, that's not complicated. But the trick to show convergence here is just to see that we can rewrite the whole system. We can rewrite the whole system as a so-called like Foucault-Planck formulation. So I can see my system here, kind of like a diffusion. I can rewrite that in this kind of strange format. First, that makes things way more complicated. Well, actually, if you think about here as discrete space derivative, this is really like a Fokker Planck. So here I have a derivative of my log divided by the equilibrium. Divide by the equilibrium. And so this is really the same shape, if you want, as something we're more familiar in kinetic theory, something of this form. And in particular, we deduce that actual dynamics is just a gradient flow. So here we can deduce, use our usual strategy, integration by part. We multiply again some equilibrium, do it's not integration by part, it's summation by part, but same idea. And so we find that we have some entropies, entropy dec and Some entropy, the entropy decays, and we have convergence to the equilibrium. So, this is what I have there. So, we introduce the entropy, and the entropy is actually decaying. I must say we don't have an explicit rate, unfortunately, we know it's decaying, but we don't have a rate. And so, at the end, nonetheless, we can prove we have convergence to the equilibrium. So, Radley V sample, again, a little bit frustrating, we didn't manage to get the rate. Okay, so that was for the end bias dynamics. Was for the and bias dynamics. Let me show you: like, we can do kind of similar things for the two others: so, a poor bias and rich bias. And let me remind you the dynamics. So, it's exactly the same. If I want to write what's happening, I gives to J. The only thing that changes is the rate. So, again, so if you're poor bias, more likely to give if you're rich. A rich bias is reverse. Same thing for operation of chaos. We can do a similar strategy, complete. We can do a similar strategy, coupling, etc., with the clock. So we have propagation of chaos for all the three. For the limit dynamics, it's a little bit different. So let's first identify what's the operator. So this Q, if passed to the limit in N goes to infinity. So unbiased, as before, rate of giving is 1, rate of receiving, sorry, is R bar. And that's changed with per bias. The more money I have, the more likely I give. So this rate increase with N, more likely. Increase with n, more likely to give. And rich bias is reverse. More money you have, the less likely you have to give. And so let's start with the poor bias. What's happening here, what's interesting, is that although it sounds more complicated, because the rate here is depending on n, it's actually much simpler because this is a linear equation. So if you look at the PD, if you want, the limit equation, it's actually become a linear equation. So we can have Equation so we can have actually an explicit rate for the convergence of the equilibrium, and instead of being a geometric distribution, in that case, it's a Poisson distribution. Same thing, we can have explicit coefficient for the distribution, etc. So, everything is explicit. And using back primary, we have explicit rate as well. Okay, now more challenging, what's happening when you have rich bias? So, in that case, what's happening? We don't converge to some equilibrium. Equilibrium. Instead of, so here I just run some simulation. So you see that in purple here that's almost the initial configuration. So like all the words is at five. And initially it's spread. But quickly what's going to happen here is that instead of just spreading and as before you start to have like a lot of people with zero bankrupt basically, there is also here a kind of a wave of people that actually move in right. Moving right. So, kind of like a dispersive way. So, you have some people here get super lucky and they all get all the money. If I zoom in here, so what I put in green here, that's exactly the same as the one green I put here on the right-hand side. It's the same distribution, I just changed the scale here. What's gonna happen here, we still gonna have the same effect, so it's still gonna move to the right, but it's also dispersive, so it's actually decayed, so in the amount of people. Decay also in the amount of people, basically the amount of very rich people actually decay. And so, what we expect to have at the end, so we could not prove that, is that actually all the money is going to be gone. Why is that? Because as we have more and more wealth in this part of the curve, well, the total money in all those dynamics, I should have mentioned that from the start, it's conserved. I don't create wells or decay wells. So, if something moves So, if something moves to the right, since the money is conserved, it needs also to have less people, otherwise, I will create wealth. It's not going to happen. So, if I move to the right, the amount also needs to be reduced. So, this part here, part of my wave, if you want, so move to the right, you can see that it's actually, we should do like a fit is kind of like a linear growth, linear speed, if you want, moving to the right. But the amount here. The right, but the amount here, so the here, the height, it's also decaying in early. So, what we expect is that actually at the end, if you take t goes to infinity, money is gone. So, basically, all the words goes to infinity, and that's it. Unfortunately, it was not so easy to... I mean, we try analytically to prove it, and we were unsuccessful. Numerically, it's kind of like, I mean, capture this wave, and so maybe it's actually harder than... And so, maybe it's actually harder than we thought to prove it. Anyhow, so that's it for my poor, I mean, simple dynamics where we exchange just $1. Maybe to conclude, because I think I have maybe like three minutes, let me extend a little bit for other types of dynamics. Even we start with the same like a particle system and goes to and goes to infinity. So, first extension, right? So, first extension, relatively simple, it's so-called the repeated average. Two particles, so two guys interact, and what they do instead of exchanging one dollar, we just like share, we put in common the wealth, and that's it. Our new update is actually in the middle. So, very equalitarian society here. If I have like, no, no, like 10, you get 20, we both get 15 afterwards. So, that's a repeat average. We can study to similar problems. Similar problem, n goes to infinity, t goes to infinity. And other kind of behavior that we study is this time, so this is completely deterministic, we can put some randomness, meaning that, so we put money in common, SI s plus j, and then we just pick randomly how much you're gonna get. So we take uniform here, so I'm starting there. Maybe I'm lucky I get all the wealth. Lucky, I get all the wealth, meaning that J is going to get zero because at the end you still want to conserve the money, or vice versa. So, that we call like uniform reshuffling at length. Finally, kind of in between, you can do not averaging not uniform in between. It's something like that. I score like Fay call it the binomial reshuffling. So, I don't know if that's clear here and stuff, like the distribution, where you're gonna get your money. The distribution where you're gonna get your money instead of it uniform. It's more likely you get in the middle, but you can also get with high lower probability a zero as well. So it's not uniform as like binomial. I don't put the results. I'll leave it as an open question. What do you think would be here for all those dynamics, the limit distribution? So for repeat average, it's kind of easy. I mean, if everybody goes to the average, at the end, everything... To the average, at the end, everything concentrates, and it's really easy to see that you're gonna get everybody a direct distribution, everybody gets the same layers. For uniform and binomial, it's a little more difficult to see what would happen. Anyhow, I'll put the reference if you're interested to see what could happen in this two case. Finally, and that's my last figure, we also study what's happening when we had a bank. So, it's kind of a funny behavior here. Funny behavior here. Remember, like when we exchange one dollar, if I doesn't have a dollar, then he cannot give, which is normal. But now, if you play another player, like a bank, you can borrow some money, give, and therefore get some debt. And what's funny here is that if you do this dynamics, it's not that easy to, more delicate to study. But what we're going to have here, we're going to have so-called like center Balaplacian, so basically two exponential. So you cannot, at one point, the money is going to run out after. At one point, the money is gonna run out after money, so you cannot always have depth, debt, more and more depth. So at one point, you're gonna stop. And so the limits distribution is something like that. It's kind of funny. This is too exponential. And same thing here, we can also study, we can prove convergence, same idea with entropy meta. And that's about it for me. So just a quick summary. So most of the work I've presented here is two parts. So for the propagation of chaos. So how do we prove a So, how do we prove the limit when n goes to infinity with some coupling technique? And we can use, if it works, we can use some Foucault Prank formulation at the end to show convergence as T goes to infinity through some distribution. And so, here is a reference. On the left, that's the reference we have been influenced from for this work. And on the right, that's the work that's been publishing. And as you can see, it's mostly a face that did most of the work. That did most of the work. And so here are some very recent paper. And with it, I think I'm on time. I stop there. Thank you. Thank you very much. Questions? Yeah, it's in the audience. Wait a minute. Hi, and thank you for your talk. So Your talk. So, what about polynomial decays? I mean, you mentioned at the beginning the Pareto tails. Have you found something, some rules between rich and poor agents to exchange wealth in order to achieve this kind of tale? This kind of tail? That's an excellent question. So, I guess for this one, no. For this one, what we typically have is either exponential or Poisson. Steve, I mentioned the first reference, for instance, here, if you look during pariskital scanning, they have some example where you can look at collision interaction where you do have other types of DK with parisotors. In this one here, you write, no. Here, you're right. No, it's everything is exponential. A geometry of Poisson. You're right. Yeah. Thank you. Other questions online? No? If there's no question, I have a question. When you pass to the limit, you usually need to make some independence assumptions, right, on the stochastic process. So oh did you make those here and what happens if the process is not independent? The process is not independent. Okay, that's the whole idea that we don't. I mean, we don't. So let me just go back here. Let me just give you the media. So, no, if you look at the process, the K process, when you look at pressure of chaos, they're never independent. They're only independent at the limit. So those here are not independent, the the K process, but if you look at the correlation, basically it's like one of the n. Basically, it's like one of n. So there's a dependency, but it's very mild. So it's kind of approximately independent. So, but you still, when you pass to the limit, you assume that, say, expected value of the product is the product approximately, right? So we don't assume, we prove it. That's the whole point. So this is a rigorous proof. Most of the time, yeah, when you do kinetic fig theory, we suppose that, yeah, let's suppose the law of the two particles is a product. But here, that's what we prove. Yeah, but you mean in the linear? Yeah, but you mean in the limit when n goes to infinity, it will be true. The larger n it is, the more close it to the independence. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, I got it. I got it. Okay. It's similar to the assumption you do in the pedestrian flows, right? When you develop macroscopic equations for pedestrian flow, it's kind of similar because there you also have two-way movement of pedestrians, right? Yeah, sometimes they call it like a BBJKY hierarchy. BBJKY hierarchy. So it's kind of the same as this result, but using density instead of looking at stochastic processes. But most of the time people say, yeah, let's assume we have this because we don't want to do this messy computation. Here we can prove it. Okay, that sounds great. Any other questions?
