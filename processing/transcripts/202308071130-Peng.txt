So today I will talk about So today I will talk about how to learn in colour source system. This is the outline of the talk, however, for the talk about how to return full class of product also system, work to rate the product also system, and full screen. system and work with the polar tool system. So let me start with the work with the solar tool system. So this is a model for plasma or for semi-matter. So this is the advanced equation and this is the moment equation. It is important that this time is very important if we consider blows. we consider a global small surface. And as you notice, in the left hand in the density, P is the velocity and P is the area, so we always suppose that P is the structure structure inconvenient function. And P is the electrical potential. And B here is the analytical equation. Certainly this is the maximum molecule. Laxima knows what correlation. So for example, we can take B equals 1 for Samples to simplify the orientation. The model is defined by NB. So in this model there is a scale parameter, lambda, called line x. So when this model goes to yellow, we call this Together, uh, we call this many funny funny. So, we can find this model in this uh in this box. Okay. So, the point you can means that uh the electrical density equals angle density for almost zero. Messaging for all equals. So in our case, this means that L equals 1 because B equals 1. So this is more for the realized from the Pausing equation in the magnetic model. So we can see that this composition and lambda goes to L. So therefore this is confounding functionality. And our problem is to study the limit behavior of a small solution and this kind of exposure to them. Why is a small solution? Because in CRL space dimension, in general, a CRL will make so much. So we see that the polar economy is in the polar equation that tackle is the solution. So we can write the solution equation here and just solve the equations. But we need to review the left state equation, this is the left state equation and which builds are left field and are left for data. Then Then, from this equation, we can write the equation in this form. And we can check that this is the left of this language and this estimate. And this is a mobile data. So the the hyperbolic or say hyperbolic uh Or say how the body the future is determined by first or the derivative of the equation. So we can introduce academic. This we can introduce academic as a also called patient infuriation with a three-dimensional. And we can find that this action satisfies this uh possibility. So this is that the result will have a high level Q, both ID. Then integrating this solution, they have a pretty good product. So this is important in the L2 for the L2 Electric group if you want to study global small subjects. And we can check this is uh short wave short wave quantities. This means that this matrix is uh is um uh symmetrical you can define the identity in a short wave symmetric. From our results of the not uh we know that uh the system is symmetrical type of symmetric. So we we can obtain 10 years to make for higher order edges to make. Now we know that for the symmetric hyperbolic semi-linear symmetric hybrid, we have a lot of distance of small solutions. So this can be determined by the initial initial data. So it is different in nice situation. Okay, initially it will take a T is therefore so we obtain a additional function for T. Then we have another small solution in this uh standard space. But for the low indistance of solution, we have to consider small initial data along the constant equilibrium state. So, this model has been considered by an English world researcher. So we have a row slow solution, which means that oh this uh a constant positive constant in our case this constant depends on lambda. So if this constant be small then the local solution will define all time. So this is the start point to consider the local values uh of the point each. Of the 20 children. So now we'll consider how to justify this limit. So let's denote by n lambda, p lambda, t lambda, a small solution of the river system. And we have a initial solution, the changing of the normal lambda. So hopefully and lambda goes together, we have a link. Okay? Then we see that as lambda goes to yellow, this quantity goes to 1. We all have the minute containing in the 1. And from this first equation, the second equation, we see that we have equation has a limit equation. And from the move equation, this is one. So we have we have So we have all that. So we obtain a collection flexible, overflowing with everything. So the value is important to obtain this as well for structure. So the problem is to justify this thing in the local test or in the whole type. So the law we can learn is to prove that initially the solution of the linear system and of the solution of the linear system is sufficiently small of all the lambda, then we can prove that there is a logic height and a consequence we have a estimate. Estimate of order, of order lambda. So for the list of we use energy estimate for the difference of two solutions, of two solutions by using a semi-hyperbolic model with energy. We can consider a problem study by Kongier Dunier. In this form the the password equation is replaced by a quasi linear uh semilinear, semi-linear control equation. Here the pier mass rate is replaced by the so-called bulk value ratio. Yeah, this is a semi-mini action. So, this is lambda goes to zero, formally we obtain this direction, n equals equal. n equals EFE. If you import this expression into the last uh the overday equation and we find that this is almost the same curve as this one, then we obtain the uh compressible migration in one in one function. So uh in general uh if this is a given function we obtain incompatible, incompressible So in serial space dimension, this uh this uh method has been proven by uh by SUO and also me in serial space dimension was very good for consider uh analytic which is uh which is a function independent uh of each in t and also like jobs of m. Now, the global dynamics with small initial data, so uh the the problem is different because uh uh then we don't assume that initially the two solutions uh is sufficiently close. So we use the ABS-made system for the solution of the initial original system. Uh we uh we will We will pass to the limiting system. We establish a uniform estimate for the system of ordinary system and with the uniform bounds we usually pass to the limit in our learning system. So the results uh is uh is uh is as follows. So there is a first of uh there are three independent of every of them now. If the ratio delta is sufficiently small, but not of order of organa, then the small solution is defined as all time. This is a very own small, small condition of the initial data. And we have a stability condition on the solution. This is a stability condition on the solution. This estimated gives also the ball. gives also the bounds of solution. And consequently, we have this because from the Poisson equation and this estimate for t and we can obtain this estimate. So we have a strong convergence on the velocity. And after some sequence, we have a weak convergence on the velocity. And on the velocity and has four collaborators on the rotation. This estimator and collaborators are sufficient to ask for limits in the system to obtain the formal limit with electric velocity. So now let me show you the quality training in two or three lamp processes. So the movie is the So the more we use it, the more complicated. We have two states. And here E means electron. I means I. We have a plasma model for electron and i. So this is the last day question, this is the most data question because we have two space with space all control. And the initial data depends on our entire. So the puzzle equation, the penal equation here. So we define the initial lambda for P by this equation. Of course for P, 0 lambda will be fine later in the summary structure of the initial data of n 0 i and n 0 z. And we can check the formula. As lambda goes to zero, we formulate, we have the first equation, here, and the second equation, so this is here to see. And the same for I. But so this equation is here. We have only we have only the limit, so So this is L V is replaced by L. Here. We have the same density, but the different velocity. The velocity are different. We have two velocities. Okay? This is a D. This is a closed system. We have two equations and two unknowns. A, B, B, I, and T. Okay. But the investment of solution for this system is we don't know the investment of solution from the system we don't know the existential solution for this system. And nevertheless, we can check that if initially we have the same velocity that we have moved. then we can do this we have the same velocity for for local time. We are using local time. So in this case we obtain we have obtained the same energy equation and two different two different moment equation. The difference appears only on the side here. This is positive and this is negative and we have a different third. And we can eliminate the data feed by adding this to equation, mobile equations. And we find the compressible equation with the identity here. So the project here is well defined. I told eye towards the project for the natural eye. And we can also eliminate this term by subtracting all the functions. So we come by a relation value given by function of function of the density. So this is a formal, this is a formal limit. So the problem is to justify this limit. Of course, here we include the Of course, here we improve that initially we have the same density. And implicitly we have al uh same velocity. But implicitly we have also we have already the same density. So in the problem we should assume that initially we have the same at least the two density are small and the velocity also small. So now uh the just the application of the Uh the just identification of a lot of uh convenience means that if you initiate uh the the solution of the language system, the solution of the maintenance system are small of all the lambda than there is a positive time such that we have a bit of order of all the lambda. So now we consider the global communities. So let's develop the solution of the original system. Near it first one. This one means the density. So the density is not long, but all of a density is small. So we need to show that the two densities go together. Two densities go to zero and lambda goes to zero. And also the difference of velocity goes to zero. Because we have a formal limit which possesses the same density and the same velocity. And this limit is easier to see from the current equation. So this is in any estimate we can actually obtain this estimate. And obtain this estimate immediately. And for the second limit, for the velocity, for the velocity, we denote mu minus the difference of velocity and we denote the potential like this one. Then uh we see that in order to system in which some chart And when we subtract it removed the equation, uh we have uh we have this uh relation. So this means that if you want that this is small and this continuation is small. So initially if you suppose that this is small and you should use you should also suppose that this constant is small. And similarly we can write the same equation in two. Recognize the solutions into a into a into a free developmental system in this way. And then you obtain that this equation if you uh apply the apply the partial delivery of T to this equation. And this term, of course, depends And this term of course depends on many positive. But this term can be can be controlled. And this term is positive. So this term, this side is positive. So this is important to obtain an error estimate because there is a lambda minus uh two. It says the order of the uh support and lambda minus two. So this gives that So this gives that um n tail of the operator G of I to mu by y minus and so forth but another equation is an easy solution of inner inner strong physical and then you obtain the inner state of human and finally if you suppose this was the solution you suppose this quantity is sufficiently small, but not of order o lambda. And also you should suppose that this pattern is of order o lambda square. Then you can prove that the solution is defined remotely time. And you have a only distance. So this is a sufficiently small. Okay? It is controlled by the combination of these two controls. My rich or just to complicate. And I make a possible that this term is more or older than that. So this error errors to pass to limit the original system for obtaining the formal system of the mm-hmm.
