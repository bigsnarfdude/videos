I'm happy to be invited to participate in this wonderful workshop on branching problems from various aspects. I'd like to thank the organizers very much, Professor Bartik Speg, Professor Perezna, and Professor Kobayanshi for the Roman hospitality. Let us begin with some geometrics, some geometric setting of this tool. Let's see if we can be the deepest Q-dimensional complex vector space and with the standard and tapering function for. Of Simi Trapi Kira. Simi Chaki Kila. So I definitely need to interview over Somato Yes. Are you going to please that on your computer? I can hear it. Maybe if you do on your computer, you're going to start on your own computer. On your own computer, it looks like they are. How about a volume of a laptop that is removed as well? So, can you make the computer make? Is there a button so that this makes sense? There are a button so that this makes it sorry? Yeah, it is really okay. Can we try again? Is it working out? In the future, entire group UPQ is defined to be the group of isometries of this form. Suppose V is a complex gatelink. We restrict the standard in GitHub Hermitian form on the subspace V. It may be degenerate or non-degenerate. We say the subspace B is non-degenerate when the restricted form is non-degenerate. In this case, a Hermitian form is indefinite to the subsidies to the subspace rate. to the subspace ring and there are several possibilities of its signature p prime q prime as follows we say v is maximally positive if v is non-degenerate and p prime is minimum or equivalently q prime is maximum. For an integer k between 0 and p plus q, we consider the Brassmannian manifold consisting of k planes. We also define its subset consisting of maximally positive k planes because the maximal positivity is an open condition and therefore this subset is open. Therefore, this subset is open in the Glassmannian manifold. So we have defined a complex manifold as an open subset of the Glass Manuel to be denoted by G L K plus 3 P Q. If P and Q are positive and if K is not equal to zero or P plus Q, this complex manifold is non-compact. In general, the indefinitely die group UPQ acts transitively and homologically on this non-compact complex manifold. As a homogeneous manifold of the regular gene, the indefinite Gracemania manifold is expressed. Is expressed as follows. In the critical case, we have k equals p. The orphan set consisting of maximally positive p plane. It is nothing but the Hermitian space UPQ over UP times UQ. And for the other case, For the other case, the left-hand side is not a Hermitian symmetric space, but still is a reductive symmetric space, which carries indefinite metric. For one integer k between zero and p plus q, and for one integer lambda, we define a g equals. We define a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle over indefinite Grassmannia malic as follows. First, we write LK in all the following subgroup. Then the indefinite Graceman manifolds are given as a homogeneous space G over L K for all K. We recall the sub. We recall the subgroup. Subgroup Lk is direct product group for an integer lambda. We write C lambda for a one-dimensional representation of the subgroup LK by letting the second factor act trivial. This family of homogeneous line bundle, Lambda Line bundle, L lambda, are the geometric setting in which we shall discuss infinite-dimensional representation of the Lie group UPQ. Now we take K to be an integer and does not exceed P and Q. exceed P and Q. Consider the indefinite Brassmania manifold, two indefinite Brassmania manifolds. One is consisting of maximally positive K planes and the other is consisting of maximally positive P plus Q minus K planes. These two manifolds have the same dimension, but as complex manifold, but as complex but as complex manifolds they are not bihomorphic to each other in fact the left one is homotopic to the complex sub compact sub-variety namely a smaller grace manual consisting of k planes in the subspace CP and like one is homotopic to Is homotopic to another compact manifold, namely a smaller glass mania consisting of Q minus K planes in another subspace CQ. Since these compact Grace Mania are not homotopic to each other, if P not equal to Q, the original two indefinite Grace Mania manifold indefinite Grace Manny manifolds are not homotopic to each other. In particular, these two non-compact complex manifolds are not bihomorphic to each other if P is not equal to Q and the case P equal Q case is more important but we shall see But we shall see these two complex manifolds are not isomorphic to each other as a G manifold. We keep our previous notation and compare the cohomology of the holomorphic line bundle on the two different indefinite Glassmannian manifolds. For simplicity, we write X. Simplicity, we write X and Y for these indefinite Grassmannian manifolds. We have mentioned the base space X and Y are not biholomorphic to each other if T is not equal to Q. Correspondingly, the natural representation of the Doorbo homology are not isomorphic to each other as far as nine boundary parameters are sufficient. Boundary parameter are sufficiently regular. To be precise, the following proposition holds: The first two statements are vanishing, non-vanishing, and irreducibility of the natural representation of the global cosmologies. The first statement concerns the left-hand side. Concern the left-hand side. We consider the lobby homology over the indefinite Basmannian manifold X, consisting of maximally positive K-grains. The important degree of the cohomology is equal to K times P minus K, which is a complex dimension of the maximal compact subvariety. Subvariety. We use the lowercase letter x for this degree. Similarly, the second statement deals with the local cohomology group over different non-compact complex method in the right-hand side. The third one is actually the main point of this proposition, namely, this module. These modules are pairwise inequivalent. If lambda and mu are sufficiently regular in the sense the lambda and mu large enough, this assertion still holds even when p is equal to q. Since we have assumed the line-bounded parameter are sufficiently regular, we may give a Figure, we may give a proof of this proposition by using the Bernstein buildings on Bernstein theory on D modules, or we may use Spear-Bogan's theory on the command-derived functor modules. And we detain the data location and the fitting. and the setting. The previous proposition G modules are pairwise in equivalent as far as parameters are sufficiently labeled. We have seen the previous proposition the 2G The 2G complex markers X and Y produce different families of infinite-dimensional representation if the land boundary parameter are sufficiently regular. In contrast, this theorem asserts the natural representation in the cohomologies on the two different manifolds happen to be isomorphic to each other. Isomorphic to each other. For this, the line boundary parameters are chosen to be very special. Namely, they are associated to the one-dimensional representation of the isotopy subgroup by the pth power of the determiner in the left-hand side. In the left-hand side, and the use power of the determinant in the right-hand side. Is this isomorphism established by specific kind of, you know, like something like a random transform? Okay. In other words, the two different Two different families of representations and pathologies are isomorphic to each other to a very special point. In general, such a geisomorphism between cohomologies may occur when both X and Y are compact. Complex manifold, for example, X manifold, for example, the example the trivial one-dimensional representation can be realized on any partial varieties. More generally, such a G-isomorphism between cohomologies may hold when there exists a complex G-manifold G and G vibration X to Z. vibration x to z and y to z with compact fibers both with compact fibers in such a case we may find a g-isomorphism for appropriate line bundle parameter by using spectral sequence and by reducing it to isomorphism arising from compact fibers. We refer to such as isomorphism of representation as elementary case. However, this is not our case, where X is indefinite Grassmannian and Y is the other Glassmannian and G is indefinite intelligence. Before giving a profound theorem to, we give some comments on our theorem from the viewpoint of the OBIT philosophy. Let G-hat be the set of equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representation. If dual as a unitary dual, G-star be the dual of the G study the dual of the d algebra of G and we consider the set of cojoint orbits. The orbit philosophy initiated by Kirirov in 1960, it proposes an intimate connection between the unitary dual and the set of quadrant orbits. In fact, there is a natural projection between these two sets. There are these two sets for simply connected middle-potent regroups, or more generally for exponential solvable groups. But we are now working on reductive groups. Returning to the general setting, we recall any quasi-dorbit over any group G as a canonical. As a canonical symplectic form, sometimes referred to as Kilo Costant Solio form. One expects the resulting representation will be reducible when the geometric action of G on the symplectic manifold transit. If it works, one expects One expect whether the orbit method can be realized through the geometric quantization. Our indefinite Grassmannier manifold may be identified with quadrant orbit of the indefinite unitary group UPQ. To see this, To see this, we take an element with k to be the diagonal matrix of the following form. Then the adjoint orbit through lambda ek is isomorphic to indefinite Grassmannian manifold. Identifying the Lie algebra with G algebra. with the its dual register by the Keeling form, we may regard O lambda as a quadjoint orbit. Using the general terminology, the quadjoint orbit is called elliptic. In the sense the adjoint action of VK is diagonalizable and all the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. For elliptic quasi-time orbits for real deductibility group, we define their geometric quantization if lambda satisfies certain integral conditions as follows. Suppose O lambda is an elliptic quadrant of F. Then O lambda has a gene. then O lambda has a gene variant complex structure because it can be realized as an open set of a complex plug varieties. Moreover, under certain integral conditions of lambda, the linear form lambda defines homogeneous holomorphic grind bundle over O lambda, which we denote Lambda. Then we can linearize. then we can linearize this action by considering which are natural basic topologies. Therefore, we have recent presentations. Moreover, by algebraic technique, once there exists a dense ribbon The dense Hilbert space in the cohomologies of an appropriate degree on which G acts as a unitary representation pi ramba of G. We may think of pi rambda as a geometric quantization of elliptic quadjoint orbit or lambda and we write pi lambda or q or ramba. Or Q or lambda. For example, if lambda is regular and is strongly elected, namely if the isotropic subgroup is compact torus, then the representation by lambda is a Harry-Charger discrete phase representation. We shall treat the case where lambda is singular and g lambda is no compound. We may ask if the quantization map is injective for elliptic quadrant orbits. Of course, we have to take Olympic elementary case into account in order case into account in order to avoid easy isomorphisms. Theorem 2 tells us that natural quantization map Q is not injected even if we get rid of all elementary case. Namely, there exists a non-trivial isomorphism between quantization of two different cojunct orbits, namely two different limiter representations. two different metal representations Q or lambda and Q or mu are isomorphic to each other. However, two cojoint orbits are not biomorphic to each other and moreover, there is no G-complex vibration with compact fibers or lambda to Z or min to Z. Such in the equivalence never happened for regular elliptic coadjoint orbit before by the theory of arrangement on discrete phase representations. But our theorem that it may happen for singular elliptic orbit. To explain the idea of the flu for theorem 2, we recall the statement in the sective. The construction of the isomorphism ψ is not so obvious because X and Y are not biholomorphic to each other. And because there is no vibration of G complex manifold X to Z. manifold X to Z, Y to Z with compact fibers. Instead, our strategy is to make use of a different fibrillation as we shall see in the next slide. How is a diagram that we shall use three complex G manifold X prime g manifold x prime and y prime and omega. We know the fibers alpha and beta are non-compact, but the fibers U and V are compact. We then use the cohomological integral geometry that traces back to the work of Pendles in mathematical physics. Mathematical physics, which is now referred to as the Pendloos transform. The key manifold is omega. We shall explain it in the next slide. Let MQPC denotes a space of Q times P complex matrices and we define a bounded symmetry. define a bounded symmetric domain omega. In the case T equal to Q equals 1, this is the form keratis. Fun group theoretic viewpoint omega is the Hermitian symmetric space of SUPQ. For integer k, we denote by L K. We consider the system of holomorphic differential equations. Differential equation with the dominant type. Here, I and J runs over the index set respectively. This is a minor determinant of size k plus 1 and the equations are homogeneous degree k plus 1. We write solo omega and k for the space of global holomorphic solution. Holomorphic solutions to the system engage of differential equations. Let us examine the case P equals 4 and 2 equals 3. We write the matrix of partial differential. matrix or partial differential operator in matrix form. We call the system Mk consisting of differential equations or minor determinant of K plus 1 times K plus 1 matrices. Then, for K equals 1, the differential equation and K are of second order, K plus 1 order, and define purely harmonic. And define purely harmonic functions. This system has been studied classically by many experts, such as Kashiwara-Bevi. And for K equal to, the differential equation N2 are of third order and amount to the following system of partial differential equations. And OK equals 3 or larger than 3, the system NK is just empty. In theorem 2 and next serum, we wanted to compare two dual vocal cohort immunologies on two different manifolds X and Y. The light review. The light degree of cohomologies for X is different from that for Y. In the proof, the chord proof vibrations that connect X and Y are given geometrically as follows. Here, we introduce three manifolds, X, Y prime, and omega. We have already explained what omega is. It is a Hermitian symmetric space G over K, or equivalently, the set of maximally positive fields. The definition of X prime and Y prime are given as incidence relations. We call our notation for indefinite Gracemanian manpower. Then, isomorphism of two cohomologies in theorem 2 can be proved by the following theory. That is, there are topological geo isomorphism Rk and Rp plus Q minus K between two. Between two spaces. The image is exactly the space of global solutions to the system in K of partial differential equations on omega generators of order k plus 1. See remote horizontal isomorphism. Once These statements are proved then in the vertical isomorphism cycle, namely the twisted transform between cohomologies on X and Y for different degrees. Let me talk a few words, few words about the program. about the proof. The intertwining operator Rk and Rp plus Q minus K can be constructed by cohomology and integral geometry, namely a higher dimensional penboss transform. For this, we use a previous quadrature relations. The main technical difficulties, COM3, are nine boundary parameters as Inventory parameter as outside good range in the sense of over. For such parameters, the existing general theory, such as Berlin-Bernstein's theory on D-module or Spear-Bogan's theory on Darker-Montitler Functal modules, do not work well. Actually, we need manual processing, and each time And each time we cross the wall, nice property will be lost substantially. To overcome these difficulties, we use some of Kobayashi's work on singular unitary representations beyond the canonical positive channels. This is a sketch of a proof of COM3. Consequently, we We also scroll theory too. Yes, I would just like to know whether this representation of R, whether it has scalar keta. Does it have a scalar keta? Yes. Okay. Thank you. By the way, I think it is true that. I think it is true that for classical group, if we two representations with the same infinitesimal character is completely determined by infinitesimal character in one particular scale k taught if the representation is scalar kettle since this conference focuses on branching programs i'd like to discuss some application of pandos transform Of Pendos transform to branching province. As we have seen in the previous slide, the generalized Pendos transform argues gives a topological isomorphism between the Robo Commonwealth space and the space of solutions to the system of differential equations of order k plus 1 that are minor determinants. We would like to utilize. We would like to utilize the target space. Then the branching problem is closely related to a boundary by robot of the solutions with respect to a certain sub-manifold defined by the subgroup that we consider the branching. To be precise, at P equals Q, which is denoted by N, we consider a subgroup G prime equals star to N in G equal to uranium. N equals 3 K in previous talk Nakahama discussed prefix K and define a levy subgroup L K randomly. group LK prime of G prime as we then we obtain a complex submanifold X prime of the indefinite Plasmanian manifold X as a cross G prime orbit through the origin in X to each reducible representation With the highest weight mu We extend it to a representation vertical by writing the second factor review, second factor trivia and form a g prime equivariant vector value over x prime. Then we have the following branching theory. We have correlated the distribution. The disk this theorem on the level of GK modules. As a unitarization, we obtain a Hilbert direct sum decomposition of irreducible unitary presentation of the subgroup G plus G plus. Meso start doing. The left-hand side is an irreducible representation of G on the Dolbook homology. The right hand side The right hand side describe how it decomposes with respect to the subgroup G, that is the branching law of the distribution. A remarkable feature is that there is no continuous spectrum in this decomposition and each direct summon is irreducible and pairwise in And pairwise in vigorous. So, this decomposition is multiplicity free and discrete. Here are some remarks of theory. Yeah, some demand of sale. The general sale of Kobayashi. The general theorem of cobiasi applied to this very special case implies a restriction of discretory decomposer and multiplicity free. This is considered as a priori estimate. The multiplicity free is proved by visible action, which Yotanaka explains its cohomological version of The cohomological version of Monday. And the modules in the left-hand side and the right-hand side can be described also by means of the commands-derived functor modules. And so, it is also related to the lecture by Lushiki Oshima on Tuesday. Our approach is Is somewhat different, and the idea is to utilize a system of differential operator and k. The solution may not be unique determined by the boundary value, nearly by its restriction to the sub-manifold x-fline. So we need to So we need to consider normal derivatives. To analyze this, we introduce yet another symmetric pair, G2 prime. G2 prime is a symmetric group. This pair is sometimes referred to as associate symmetric pair. This pair is associated symmetric pair to G and G prime, G and G prime UNM and the source directory. Then the control, then the normal derivatives are under control by the new subgroup G2 prime SPNR by using the generalized Pendleton transform of Pendulous transform for both G and subgroup G2 prime. This is the sketch of the proof of the rainfall. Now, my time is over and I'd like to thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much. So, Christian? So, when you prove the isomorphisms of the comology, then when the paradigm, your money both are not by a remote. So, that's amazing. So, you did use a dynamic vibration to show the homology, the initial technology is a general persistent equations. Yes. Yes. Thank you. So, Andemia, you use some examples for Ayashi to prove that the map is subjective. Is that correct? No. How did you prove subjectivity? So you proved that your line bundle is not a nice one, true. It's singular. So it's not clear that your commodity is... That your Como machine using isomorphic to a solution space of a differential equation. That the cabinet and the parameters are very nice, correct? But it still happens in your case, too. So I understand that the double hydration might help you show that you have a map into the solution space. But your theorem is stronger. You say is that it's a... You say it's the isomorphic to the solution space. Am I correct? Yes. So, how do you use to what do you use to prove that the convergence equals the solution space of this differential equation on G1K? Can you come here? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. She uses the functions for pre-punjab case acted by server. And then find very nice decomposition of some radio part of system. No, notice a very new idea of how to use it. Because you mentioned your work, but so maybe you say non-vanishing results or something, yeah, no vanishing as a total. Yeah, but then you can only small buttons. Show me the W vibration simulations. The vector is homotopy equivalent so homotopy equivalent alpha alpha beta alpha and beta so I know five or alpha is a big task frame and ah and you said uh no new and the new uh New and the new fiber. Okay, thank you very much.
