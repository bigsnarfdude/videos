It's my pleasure to introduce Ita Siebler, who will be speaking about extensions to random polygon generation in spherical confinement. Well, thank you for coming in here the second time to listen to me. This is a workshop about some randomness and experimental, so consider your part of that, somewhat involuntarily, my part as well. So, my talk will be to a large extent extensions of some of the stuff. Klaus already presented. Klaus already presented earlier today. I will go over a few things so you can kind of see them again because I will pick them up in my talk. But a lot of stuff Klaus talked about, which I will not pick up. And I hope you remember some of it. So in terms of the outline, I'll first have a short summary. And then I'll talk about both extensions. The first one is that what happens if we are going to find languages with a radius less than one? And the second question is. And the second question is: what happens if you try to bias the polygons and confinement towards thickness? And in both cases, I will talk about the model. I will ask, okay, so now we'll be looking at data that actually look like radius smaller than one, or does it look like thicker polygons? And the second question would be, is that data we see still in line with the data we have before from spherical confinement? Because we would like it to be in line, not completely different. And the third question then is: is there some way for us to quantify and add some number to what we get us? So a short summary from the prior talk. So one of the things I would like you to take away from here, from what I would like you to take away from here, is that for the confinement radius, this is the countdown of 10,000. And you see the unknown. See in the unknots, the count of the unknots, and these account of the carefuls. The thing to take away here is that decreasing the confinement radius increases the confinement pressure. And so with increasing confinement pressure, for example, if we take this blue line here, which is 10, 20, 30, 40 radius length 50, you kind of see for a confinement radius of 4.5, it has a lot of unnauts. And then as you make. And then, as you make confinement, maybe a smaller and smaller, the number of R naughts decreases because the R naughts are crowded out by knots, which have a higher competence. If we're looking just at the length for a fixed radius, we'll basically see the same thing for length 10 going down to length 90. You basically realize the number of unknots decreases again because with longer polygons, we can make a lot of other unsettled. And then over here, we see the trifold picture, and basically, what we see for the trefoil, depending on what the length is, there is a different peak. Those peaks are somewhat similar, but they are different radia of confinement. And basically, again, on this part, the trefoils are crowded out. Over here, it's mostly trephoes and unnots, and then slowly some other knots creep into the higher complexity. But the peak of the treasure is here. So, you saw this before, this will show up again. So, this is basically since we saw these nice peaks here overall, we decided to look at them as a 3D model. And so, this is kind of the curve we think about if you're looking at the radius over here. And we have a function for that. So, we can create this, the surface not just for the spherical knots. Just for the spherical knots as Glaus described them, but for some other knots as well. Sorry, spherical polygons as Glaus described it, but for some polygons as well. This is a picture of the average crossing number. Think about looking at the sphere from all sides and just looking at how many crossings you see and then averaging over all directions. And again, the thing to realize here: increased length increases the count of the crossings because it's a higher. The crossings because it's a higher complexity. And decreasing the confinement radius increases the confinement pressure, and again, we get more complex knots, more complex polygons, and therefore a higher average crossing number. And based on all the data we have, not just the one I see here, but for all the different radii on the length, which I was mentioned earlier, we basically created a model and fit that, which is fit pretty well to all the data we have. All the data we have. So it's also a 3D kind of thing. Lastly, here's a picture just to show you also looked at individual NOT types. So this is a right squared, length on the x-axis, and the right squared on the y-axis. I think Charles had the same picture up here. And then this, you might remember, was the image which was kind of weird. There was this ordered regimen. Basically, usually. Measurement. Basically, usually, if you increase the length, the knot complexity goes up. What we're looking at here is the delta curvature. So, we're looking at the difference between the curvature of the polygon. We're looking at subtracting the phantom, the average, over all the polygons for that length and for that radius, and dividing it by the length to get a per-segment formation, so we can compare that across different lengths. Across different lengths. And so, what we had expected that these lines kind of go below the x-axis and then keep on going, but we realized for knots with small crossing numbers, they seem, they're hard to create. There are fewer and fewer of them, but we notice that their curvature actually ends up being above the background noise, so to speak, of the average. And so, I want to bring this up because we see that again right now. So, first extension. So, first extension. Call it extreme confinement. And so, here we are. Okay, the outline is similar to what I said before. Talk about the model, the data collected. Is it actually looking like small radius? So, as hopefully it's clear, since our polygons are rooted in the sphere, In the sphere, our first data point is basically the length of a segment, which is one away from that origin. And so, in order for this to be in the confinement sphere, the radius cannot be smaller than one. The question is still what happens, because all our pictures stop here. So, together with Eric Bredon, we came up with the idea of saying, well, you know, let's see where we can create something which does not follow the exact probabilities. Follow exact probabilities, it's not even necessarily always the same length. But if we think about having a sphere, it's a quite finite sphere close to radius one half, then if we have a polygon there, then you have a vertex up here, and the next vertex has to be pretty much on the other side, because otherwise it wouldn't fit in. And the next work is up again. And so we basically have vertex vi and vertex vi plus 2 kind of on the top here, rotated whatever. Top here, rotated, whatever, and the other ones on the bottom. So kind of go up and down, up and down. And the vertices on the top are all kind of close together, and the vertices on the bottom are all close together. And the polygons would have even length. So we said, okay, let's just simplify this into a model. We kind of put all those polygons into the cylinder. We have a disc on the top, we have a disc on the bottom. We randomly pick points on the top, we randomly pick points on the bottom, and we kind of connect them. We select them based on area, not just on radiance. But you uniformly collect them. Select the points on the top and some points on the bottom. And then we connect the beginning point and the ending point, and there we have a polygon. Okay? So then, okay, what do we get if we actually do that? The first thing to realize, what happens when we do that, is if we extend our cylinder and then basically collect polygons with. Polygons with a cylinder of a higher height, we get the same polygon, same knot distribution, because it doesn't actually change the knots. If we, however, do that, we do get different geometric values. So the data we collected for this was one million data points, polygons for every radius from every length from length. So every length from length six to length 30 steps of two. We then computed geometric data, curvature, ACN, right, and portion for each of the polygons. And yes, we collect, determine the not ID of each of the polygons. Thanks, Eric, for that. And then we kind of looked at the data we have. So this is a picture. This is a picture, the number of edges here on the x-axis, the mean crossing number, topological crossing number on the y-axis. And what we show here is a mix of spherical data and the new data, which I'll call cylindrical data, because we put it in soon. And so I hope by just looking at this image, you kind of see that this curve is kind of consistent with these other curves. Is kind of consistent with these other curves we have. And if you look carefully at the legend, you will see this is radius 2, and then this is radius 1.9, 1.8, and all the way down to 1. So these are the less confined, more and more and more confined. And so this one then is above all of those, which would argue for a radius of confinement similar to a radius of confinement less than one, which is what we wanted. So we're happy about this, but we decided to look at some other stuff. But we decided to look at some other stuff as well. So here we have a figure which shows the edges here again on the x-axis, and then the probability of having an R-naught on the y-axis, and over here the probability of having a traffic. And so again, we're going from right to left, from the larger radius of confinement to the smaller radius of confinement with radius of confinement one, and so this is the new cylindrical data. And so, this is the new cylindrical data. So, similar shape, and clearly, it seems to be on the right side. For trifolds, we don't have a line, we have these curves. And so this curve here is for 1.8 radius of confinement, and again, the blue one is for 1.0 radius of confinement, and the new cylindrical one is further to the left. So we looked at geometric data. So this is torsion information, this is the mean ACN, this is the squared right. And all the pictures are the same. We have the lines from 1.8 down to 1. And then we have the dots for the cylindrical data. In all the cases, you kind of see that the cylindrical data information follows the same outline effect. The same outline, the same shapes, but seems to be in an area which would indicate smaller areas of confinement. Second question: then are the features of the cylindrical polygon consistent with the features of the spherical polygons? Well, in the speakers I just showed you, it clearly was the case, but I wanted to look at a few others. So here we look at torsion, and so this is delta torsion. And so Klaus pointed out last time that not only so that these lines here are kind of sorted. Lines here are kind of sorted by crossing number, where the largest crossing number basically we show here has the smallest torsion. And if I basically plot the same thing with the cylindrical data, you see that it even nicer and how the different crossing numbers line up from crossing number 10 all the way up to 0. There's nothing fancy happening here with a legend. It just happens to be put in the bad spot. The data is just nice and consistent over there. Just nice and consistent over there. So, this again lines up nicely with what we've seen in spherical data. Y squared, you saw that image before. We don't really seem to believe in sticking with the same color scheme. So it looks a little bit different. This is the squared wife of these different knots, and the dotted lines is for the spherical data. And these data points here are for the new cylindrical data. New cylindrical data. So again, it looks like close to a straight line, but of course we stop at 30. And the slope is higher. Okay, this one is similar to the picture I pulled up and Klaus pulled up. Now we show it for radius 1.2. This is again the thing about the ordered regimen: that if we go into larger lengths, that the curvature, the delta curvature, is basically larger for knots with a small crossing. Four knots with a small crossing number and that over there. They are sorted by crossing number. And it's nice to kind of see the same behavior again in cylindrical data because we were wondering for a while what it has to do with that we have polygons rooted at the origin are spherical. Skip this, skip this, skip this. Next question is then, can we somehow say, can we somehow quantify Can you somehow quantify what this cylindrical data is equivalent in in terms of radius of confinement, if you kind of think about this? We're not claiming, just to make sure, we're not claiming that our cylindrical model is equivalent to the sphere confinement model. Well, we say it is consistent with it, and so we assume that some of the data or some of the information we get from it is at least in line with what it would be if somehow or another. Would be if somehow or another we could generate these polygons in confined radius less than one. So looking at this picture again we saw before for length 30 we have 100,000 polygons for the cylindrical polygons for the spherical polygons and we have a million data points for the cylindrical polygons. And so we decided to just look at these varieties If we decided to just look at these for right now and kind of plot them. So, here now is the radius of confinement. And we showed two lines here: the blue one is the mean topological crossing number where the unknots are not included, and the red one is the mean topological crossing number where the unknots are included. And so we kind of fit that with a line, and then we said, okay, so we have these functions, so now let's compute what. So now let's compute what our strategical data point is for length 30 for the topological crossing number. Where would this be on that line? Okay, and the answer is it would be at radius 6 point 0 point sorry, 62. And so that basically is roughly up here. So we said, hey, 0.62 is less than one. This is good. And then we said, but but does it hold for other stuff too? Does it hold for other stuff too? And so we looked at the geometric data. And so here we looked at the curvature. And we kind of did the same thing. We took the data at 30. Here is the radius of confinement. The blue data points are the data points from sphere to confinement. The dashed line is the function we fit to all the R. We fit to all the R's and the L's we had in our first spherical data. And so we just took the slice for L being 30. So we didn't do a separate fit, we just took the slice for L being 30. And then we basically asked the same question, where is the spherical point for the curvature? Sorry, the circ cylindrical data point for the curvature. And so it's up here, we solve that equation, line outcomes, it is also at 0.62. It is also at 0.62. By that point, we threw an inch, so we try to do it again. So now, this is the ACN. We do the same thing again. Again, we use the ACN we have published, which is based on the many data points we had before. And now, when we basically do this, we have an ACN value for the cylindrical polygons at 0.7. So it's no longer 6.2. And so that's okay with us because. And so that's okay with us because we're not claiming it is exactly the same, right? What we're saying is we are less than one and we're somehow between 6.2 and 7.2, and the data we have is kind of, the information we can share with you is kind of related to that. Okay, now let's assume this is true. How do some of those figures you saw before? Look, again, nicely different color schemes. So this is the unnauts. Now it's a probability rather than the Probability rather than the count, but other than that, the line should look familiar. And so at 0.62, I just basically added the data spot for the symmetric polygons. And what you can see, so these are just straight line connections. What you can see is, yeah, it's not perfect, but it looks like a reasonable continuation. Similar over here for the trefoil. And And we also looked at some other figure you saw earlier today. This is the squared right. Again, the radius confinement is on the x-axis. And we showed the squared right of various NOT types. And again, 0.62 basically show what the cylindrical data point is. So that 0.62 doesn't seem to only fit for the philological crossing number and the phantom data. It means for. Phantome data, that means for all the polygons at the given length and radius, but also seems to be working well that you're looking at particular crossing numbers or types. So next question then is what's the asymptotic behavior of random polygons of length 30 if we're going towards one-half? And so we plotted this and we looked at the picture and we weren't particularly happy with that picture because we can see a lot of. With that picture, because you can see a lot of big gaps there, right? And if you look a little bit more at that picture, you realize it's giving me really bad because this is the number of unclassified knots in our cylindrical data. This is the number of unclassified knots in our spherical data. So what we ended up doing is we said, let's go and adjust these values we have. And what we ended up doing, we looked at the 16 crossing dots, and we said, let's just adjust the unknown. And we said, let's just adjust the unknots we have based on the information we have for 16 crossing nuts. For example, for radius 1.1, we have 3.67% knots which are unclassified. And for radius 1.1, we have no unnots. We have 0.6% alternating knots, 95.18% non-alternating knots, and 4.2% composite knots. And so we just basically took 0.6% of this and added it, 95.18% of this and added this. And so we basically did this for radius 1.1. We did it for all the spherical radius, 1.5 to 1, and then also for the cylindrical data. And then the data, what we get, looks a little bit like this. It looks a lot better. And again, we see these cylindrical data points are in line with the spherical data points. The spherical data points. If you want to make any conjectures here, we would say that the unknots tend to zero with for length 30, right? For length 30, unknot tends to zero. The non-alternating knots, there's a cubic spline fit, the non-alternating knots, we think tend to something around 80% there. The alternating knots, there again seems to be looking at the curvature line. To be, if you're looking at the curvy climb, there seems to be an inflection point. They tend to be something around maybe 12%, and the composite nodes to somewhere around 6.5%. Now, those of you who are arithmetically inclined, realize that doesn't add up to 100%. And that's perfectly fine with us because we are not claiming that that adjustment we just did is completely, I just explained, is completely right. For example, we know that the number of non- For example, we know that the number of non-alternating knots continues to increase from 14 to 15 to 60 knots. We know that the number of alternating knots starts slightly declining from 14 to 50 through 15 to 60 knots. And the same thing for the composites. So we might actually have not increased this enough and might have increased these a little bit too much. But that's at this point our best bet. Okay, so how much? Okay, so how much time do I have? I should know that. 45 minutes, never mind. Okay, so at this point, I'm done with talking about this model, and we're going to go switch to something very different. So I want to see whether there are any questions I can entertain at this point. Is it known that the anodes go to zero with where the lengths go to infinity? Yes. If if you basically make it longer and longer and longer, they will definitely go to zero. Is it known? Sorry? Is it non-sorry? Uh no, I think it's still the conjecture by the cases. Okay thank you. Any other questions? Okay now the next extension. Now, the next extension, I'll talk about motivation. So, we talk about biasing a polygon towards thickness. Talk about the motivation, what that model is, and the data we collected, and then the questions. Before I want to continue talking here, so this is some work which was based on some work a graduate student of mine, Cindo Vera Manchali, did a while back. And so, when I saw this experimental in the title of this workshop, I thought this would be great. I thought this would be a great place to talk about this because you'll see there's a lot of experimental idea. As before, I'll talk about all the generated polygons kind of actually thicker in some way, shape, or form. Are the generated polygons in line with the spherical polygons? And can we somehow quantify the effect of that thickness we generate? Generally. So, the motivation. Well, the random polygons we have been creating so far are basically volumeless. They have no volume. That's not very realistic. It would be really nice to see what happens if you add volume. We have no idea how to generate polygons in confinement, which have a fixed thickness. And so, our next best bet was to just say instead of forcing a particular thickness, what we do is we buy. Thickness, what we do is we bias the generation process towards generating polygons with thicker segments. So we basically are kind of nudging them in the direction we would like them to go. So we generate rooted random polygons in sphere confinement. So we generate them one vertex at a time. Every vertex which is generated Time every vertex which is generated is basically generated subject to the close-up conditions that we basically close the polygon in the required number of steps as well as that this vertex in fact is inside the confining sphere. And then we bias each segment towards thickness right after it's generated. And in order to do that, we use some kind of accept-reject mechanism. And then the other thing I Then the other thing you have to say is, of course, consecutive segments are not subaway. So, how do you define thickness? Well, we think of thickness as take your segment, put a cylinder around it with a certain radius, and put half spheres at the end with the same kind of radius. And when they say the thickness of this set, the thickness of this thick segment is that radius. I put it right. That radius, I put it right. And then the maximal thickness of a thick segment is if we basically take the segment and we basically look at, we put a cylinder around it and then caps. And then we do that with all the other segments, the same radius around all the other segments. And then we basically ask, is there an intersection of any of these cylinders Of these cylinders and end caps from that segment we're just looking at to any of the other existing segments. And if there is, we say, okay, that doesn't work. And so we find the largest radius we can kind of put around the segment in question and all the other segments such that there's no intersection between the segment in question and any of the elements. Except the two which are mixture. And then the max. And then the maximal thickness of a polygon is the minimum over all those maximal thickness values for the segments. Okay, so the algorithm is quite straightforward, or it hides a lot of details. So we start with the first vertex at the origin, the next vertex is randomly. Vertex is randomly selected on these units here around the origin, and then for all the other ones, we basically determine what that next vertex is in some kind of complicated way, which is not important. And then we decide whether or not we accept that segment. And if it's not accepted, then we just create another one. And if it's not accepted, we create another one accepted on. And so on. And once we finally have an accepted one, then we go to the next vertex. And the very last vertex is basically. And the very last vertex is basically the closing up. So the segment xi minus 1 and xi, so the new point generator is xi, is accepted if its maximal segment thickness is larger than a thickness value is chosen at rample thickness value chosen at random from a bias function. And the bias function in our case is just simple. Our thicknesses are between 0 and 0.5. Are between 0 and 0.5. We didn't really want the segments to be wider than long. And so we basically just picked randomly a value between 0 and 0.5 and then compared the maximal thickness of that segment with that value we've chosen. And if the maximum value of that segment was larger than the value we randomly chosen, we said we accept it. And if not, then we said, but try again. Somebody can come up with something which is more acceptable. So we generated random polygons for radius one to three, where between one and one and two, then an increment of 0.1. And then for 2.5 and 3.0, and we generate 50,000 polygons for like 30 and 10,000 polygons for And 10,000 polygons for length 10, 20, 40, and 50. We generated biased polygons, as I just explained, and we also generated unbiased polygons. But the only difference between the two is that for the unbiased polygons, once we got to accept or reject, they should accept. So we used exactly the same algorithm. And then we determined the NUT type for each of the polygons up to 16 crossings. We also computed some. Things. We also computed some geometric data, but this will not play a role here. A big shout-out here to Rob Sharine and Eric Raden, because late last year they published a paper called Using the Home Fleet Polynomial to Compute Knot Types. And so it's a nice paper because it explains the whole thing, but then on top of it, Rob Geraine on his knot plot page has a knotting tool set. Page has a nutting tool section, which basically explains all the freely available software which is used, samples, and stuff like that. So that was really helpful for us, and so that's what we use to identify the non-types. Okay, question one. Are the generate polygons thicker on average? That means do they have a larger maximal thickness? And the answer is: okay, yes, they do, though, they're still pretty. Though they're still pretty thin, right? And so, what I'm showing you here is a graph where on the x-axis I have the radius of confinement, and on the y-axis, I have a ratio. And it's the ratio of the average thickness of the biased polygons divided by the average thickness of the non-biased polygons with the same radius of confinement and the same length. So, this is a length 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. And 50. And what you basically can see that on average at length 50 for radius of foot 5 and 1, the bias polygons are 7 times as thick as the non-biased polygons. Okay, so what does it mean, right? So I kind of picked a biased polygon and a non-biased polygon very close to that average thickness. Average thickness and just created here using Mathematica. And I'm not sure whether you can see anything in here. If you have it on a computer screen, you actually can see very fine. So what I, and I basically then repeated this, so this is for length 50, radius 1. This is for length 50, radius 2. This is for length 20, radius 1.1, 1.2, 1.4. 1.4, and so I repeated this several times. And so, what I hope is to get across it, if you're looking at the average thickness for each of those radius and length pairs, you can start seeing these biased polygons easily, and you have a hard time seeing these non-biased polygons. So, they were generated with that thickness, right? And so, what exactly is that thickness? I also put down what the thickness is. Down what the thickness is. So this thickness, the average thickness here is 0.0051 for this unknown, for the polygon with the unknown. And so this one is 0.000072. And you can kind of see these other ones as well. So what I hope you take away from this is, yes, they do look thicker on average. I'm not saying that they always are thicker. This is a little different from all the other ones. Here I actually looked at. The other ones here, I actually looked at the 97.7 percentile. So I took the polygon basically, which was a 97.7 percent of all the ones I had in length 30 and radius 2. And so I basically, this is the thick one, and this is the corresponding thin one at the same spot. And just for the heck of it, these are the thickest one. This is, I think, the thickest one I found in that batch, and I don't know why I showed that. And after I've And after I've created this, I realized that all these polygons are unknots. Or unknowns. Oh, not quite. There's one which is not. There were, of course, a bunch of knots we found, and I didn't feel bad, like going back to 60 image. So here's another image of the thickness. So it is generated. So this is length 30, base confinement 1, 1.5. 1.5 and 2.0. And so this is a histogram of the thicknesses of the individual polygons. And so the reddish thing, and I asked Mathematica to kind of show it to us like in a PDF type thing. And so the red one is the non-biased, and the beige one is the biased thickness distribution. Thickness histogram. Thickness histogram. And again, what hopefully you see there is: yeah, these are kind of thicker. They are basically polygons which have a thickness here which doesn't exist for the non-biased polygons. This is the same thing for basically both the nearly this is length 10, greatest confinement one, and length 50, greatest confinement one. So the longer ones you So the longer ones you have basically more width, more thick than that. So hopefully I convinced you that, yeah, these things were at least on average thicker. I'm not claiming that every polygon created with the bias was thicker than every polygon created without the bias. Next question is, are the features of the biased polygons in line with the features of the unbiased polygons? And so I'm going to start out with the mean topological cross. The mean topological crossing number, and we have radius confinement on the x-axis, and we have the topological crossing number, mean topological crossing number on the x-axis, and this does not include the R-naughts. And so this one is the unbiased topological crossing number for length 30. And this one is the biased topological crossing number. And so that shouldn't be that, I mean, so. Shouldn't be that, I mean, so thicker polygons usually have less complex knots in them. They basically have also less curvature, and so the average topological crossing number is less. Okay, so I would say these got up in line with each other in a way. Set up in line with each other in the way they are expected. This is an image where you have the unbiased data here. So now we're looking at knots, polygons with a certain crossing number. So this is kind of the percentage which is showing up in, let's say, 8%, 6%, 4%. And so this is crossing number 4, crossing number. This is crossing number four, crossing number five, crossing number six. I just left little gaps so it's easy to see, and then you kind of see how they nicely line up. This over here is then the same data for polygons biased torts thickness. And so what you can see again that things are lining up nicely. But what we also can see, it looks kind of like as if you have the picture here just starting over there. It looks a little bit like this thing is. It looks a little bit like this thing is starting at, not at radius 1.0, but at radius maybe 1.4, something like this. Though the peak is still the same height. The peak doesn't get forward. Okay, so I would say, yes, it's in line. Okay, this is supposed to come next. So, this one is a contervation of what we just saw now with a bit larger crossing numbers, larger knots. And so, this is the unbiased kind of tail we get. And again, we see the same thing. It's kind of starting about here. That's what we kind of seem to be getting here. So, yes, it looks like the thicker, the biased polygons behave somewhat like polygons. Like polygons under less confinement pressure than the unbiased ones. You might remember this kind of diagram. This is a diagram where we're asking among the six crossing knots, we basically all add up to 100%, how many of them are six twos percentage-wise, how many of them are six threes, six ones, and how many of them are composite knots. And so what Klaus showed you earlier is that it's a confinement. Is that if the confinement pressure increases, that means with smaller radii, the number of composite knots basically decreases. And so we see that here for the biased data. And we see that with a little bit of imagination for the non-biased data, and you see that with a little bit of imagination for the non-biased data, there weren't that many of these. It was harder to find this expressing number. To find the six-crossing Nazi, so there's more noise in that data. But it looks like, at least in this part of the picture, the percentage of the composite nut does go down with stronger and stronger confinement. Then I think I just skipped one. Okay. This is the unbiased information for 314151152, and this again. And this again is the bias, and we see something similar for the larger ones. It looks like this is this information starting over here. We're looking at the three ones here, thus here is basically a slice through this surface, which we kind of saw earlier, where you have this function which says now for particular knot 3.1. Particular knot, 3.1, given the length and the radius, this is the function, and so we can model this as a 3D thing. And then here we basically replace L with 30 to kind of get this function for the biased one, and then repeat the same thing for the unbiased one. Now, what I've shown you so far is that if I look at all the knots for particular, all polygons. For particular, all polygons for particular radius and length, then they seem to be having as they are thicker. What I have not shown you is that they actually, even within themselves, they're consistent. We saw that they're different thicknesses, and over all those thicknesses together, they behave right. But we really would like to know that for any kind of group of thicknesses, they seem to be behaving in line with the data we have before, or at least. Or at least 10. And so, what this here shows, what I ended up doing is I took basic thickness spectrum, I took the first 98.5 percentile, divided that into 11 bins that are distributing thickness, and I show you the first 10, the data for the first 10. And so on the x-axis, what you see is the midpoint of the bin, and so the blue line here is the topology of the bias polygons. Polygons for radius 1.3. And what we're showing here is the topological crossing number for those. And then the next one, this is for bias, topological crossing number for radius 1.5. And the reason that we see more here is because the overall thickness is larger there. The range of the thickness is larger here. So by midpoints of the centers are basically spreading. Are basically spreading. But what I hope you see, first of all, that the lines themselves kind of make sense. They don't kind of go all up and down. So it's not just that over all the knots for a radius and a length, it seems to be consisting from length to length to length and radius to radius to radius, but even within one radius and length, it seems to be consistent. And then if they ask the question, is well, how come the topological crossing number Come the topological crossing number declines is well, we now can look here again the binge data. We look at that's 30 radius 1.3, you're basically looking at what happens with the knots, and we see the number of unknots increases. Okay, that doesn't matter because they're not part of the topological crossing number, but we also see the number of trepholds reduced, get smaller, number of six crossing knots get smaller, the number of ten crossing knots. I'm not sure if it gets smaller once zero to begin with here, right? And so that's a very good explanation for why the topological crossing number decreases because we have fewer and fewer large crossing nodes. And so if you're looking at even larger crossings, 7 from 10 directly, you see how they decrease fast. If we're looking just as a consistency check, if we're kind of looking at how does that look if we're not looking at radius 1.3, but radius 1.0. 1.3, but weight was 1.0. You kind of see that the unknots do increase. The treadfall still increased slightly here, but the six and the ten Gaussian nuts decrease there as well. And the other figure I didn't put there. So I would claim that, yes, the data I have is somewhat consistent with the spherical data I have. It seems to be consistent among radius length pairs and it's also consistent among individual thicknesses. So at this point, we are ready to ask the question. So, at this point, we are ready to ask the question: can the effect of the thickness be quantified somehow? And so, as a first step, we basically looked at this function, that's why you saw it, travel, times this P, basically, where's this curve here for the treffold given the L and R. So basically what we're asking, giving the same L and giving the same R, how does the thickness of the polygons change what we're getting? And in order to answer that, In order to answer that, we basically looked at one of the histograms and we picked values for, we say, okay, we select all the polygons with an epsilon value of these markers. And then from all those polygons, we select the ones which have a trefoil in them. And then we basically get a data 21. And we did this for a whole bunch of them, but it turns out that the data back here is too noisy. So we basically get the first three. And so we did this then for. And so we did this then for all radius. You basically have data for radius, for all the radius for thickness band one, two, and three. We assumed that the thickness doesn't change this formula, but basically changes the parameters in the formula. When we looked at this war, basically what we realized is that it seems that these sticker polygons can be modeled as a As a fit to that plan here to that three-dimensional shape at a shorter length. So I basically take this area, which is between length 19 and length 23, this thing here is basically this one spread out, and I now put the information for my thickness band, one, two, and three, which is black, red, and blue on here for all the radians that I have. For all the radius that it has. And so they basically line up with the thickest band at 22, the red band at radius at length 21, and the blue radius at length 20. And if I basically put it back on, you can see that in the same thing. So some of the dots are above, and some of them are slightly below. To look at the individual fits, basically this is a fits of this function we have just for length 30. We have just for length 30. The yellow one is the original model, which we basically had basically overall radius and length. And this is the fit then for the first band: black one, the red one, and the blue one. Okay, in summary, I showed you two models and try to answer questions in terms of does it make sense. So the first one seemed to be having radius of confinement less than 0.6, and we did some conjectures for what the Some conjectures for what the asymptotic behavior is for length 30, if the radius confinement would go towards one-half, and the second one, we asked what happens if we bias polygons towards thickness. And we saw that at least for that data we looked at, and that's the only thing we looked at so far, is it seems to be having as a polygon, which is maybe shorter, which is consistent with some of the figures I showed you before, which says there's less conflict. Which there's less confinement pressure on most power points. Just for references, thank you all. Questions? Jason, I've always wondered if the um maybe can find the thing that kind of critiques like a billiards knot is not Like the billiards knot in the sphere. I see, you know, I like your cylindrical model, but I wonder how it compares to like a billiards knot. Because if you're not sure what the billiards knot is, can you just pick points on the sphere and connect them? Okay. Anything you'd like. I well, in order. But I would have I guess I would have thought that, like, I would have I guess I would have thought that like the radius is really close. Go back and forth, but you could also kind of gradually like work your way around the sphere and get some 3D thing. That's right. So the cylindrical model only works for a certain length where you cannot kind of walk out of the cylinder. If you basically have too many, then you can keep on walking, you can get any brands. Yeah, that's fine. So I would have thought that if you take something like that where it's kind of walked around and you don't cry. They all cross sort of near the origin. If you put a little sphere near the origin, it's almost like they're puncturing with walking around like from point to point equilaterally. On that sphere on the origin? Yeah, they're just going from place to place on this out and back a lot, but we have not we have not looked into that, but I think it's an interesting idea. But I think it's an interesting idea. Okay. Thank you. The solar model, it didn't depend on the height or I guess. For the topological, for the knots, we basically get. For the radius on the outside, right, right. What happens if you let the radius go to infinity? So you have like the radius go to infinity. The radius go to infinity. I like if you stretch it more and more and more. So talk about the height. The radius, so you have like between the plane and height. It seems like it had sort of a certain type of confinement. That confinement like in a flat kind of thing? It's in a flat instead of in a, yeah, so it's partially confined. You could do one or two-dimensional components. You have not thought about that. Any other great ideas? Or any other questions? Well, if not, let's make the new speaker again. I think we have short thoughts. Next. Oh, we need to turn to the last one.
