So, I'm going to speak about my recent work with Ricardo Molle and Giuseppe Perrier about Gross-Pitovsky-Poisson equation. And I will first give a little bit of a little bit of introduction about the background for this. Background for this problem, and the background goes back to classical by now work and very short work by Eliot Lipp in 1977, who introduced the Chacar equation. Chakar was a physicist who presented a talk in 76 at one of the physical congresses attended by Lieb. And what he was physically doing boiled down to this equation, which we can see and how physicists seen it. See, and how physicists seen it originally. So, on the left, we have a Laplacian plus potential. In this simple case, the potential is just positive constant one. On the right-hand side, we have a non-local interaction. We have a non-linear term, which involves a non-local convolution and which represents non-local interaction. So, u or rather u square is the density of the particles in a certain system. Everything happens in R3. The problem is very. The problem is variational. You can write the energy. And in his work in 77, Lieb proved the existence of a ground state. So, this energy, as it's easy to see, is not bounded below. So, you don't have a natural minimizers here. Don't expect minimizers here. However, there is a ground state which is a non-trivial critical point with a minimal energy, and it is a positive ground state. So, it corresponds to a positive radial monotone decreasing function. Monotone decreasing function which has exponential decay. All this was proved by Lieb, and at that time it was quite novel and innovative techniques. Additionally, Lieb also proved uniqueness of the ground state. So this positive ground state, in the sense of this definition, non-trivial critical point with a minimal energy, is unique. So I will come back to this uniqueness statement a bit later. Later, this work mechanism. Later, this work we can say was to some extent forgotten. This setup appears in the classical Pierre-Louis Lyon's memoirs on concentration compactness, but there wasn't much work after that. And in the 90s and around 2000, the work reappeared and the equation reappeared under the name of Schrodinger-Newton equation. Or this is also falls into the class of attractive or focusing Hartree type equations. Equations. And in general, so they give a little bit more general framework. We can think of a Chakara equation as one particular species in a class of non-linear Schrödinger equations with non-local interactions. So the key part here is to have this non-local convolution term, which comes with a strong physical motivation. And one can replace, so what we had in the league case, this is Newtonian potential in R3. Newtonian potential in R3, but it makes sense to replace it by more general risk potential, which can be seen as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian. And this is well posted at least when alpha is between zero and the dimension. So alpha equal two corresponds to the Newtonian potential to the classical Leap case. The square here is significant, and this is typical in physical models. You have square here under the convolution. But you can add Volution. But you can add or subtract also another short-range interaction. So this interaction is non-local, so it is a long-range. This term kind of sense the interaction of particles with each other at large distances. This is a short-range interaction typically caused by some different type of physical phenomenon present in the model. So we see standard Schrodinger linear Schrodinger equation part minus Laplacian plus a potential V, but you V, but U is represent multi-particle phenomena. So the non-local and non-linear terms absorb interaction between many particles and the system. So the u squared, absolute value of u squared, is a density in multi-particle system, and L2 norm or rather square of L2 norm of U is interpreted as a mass or number of particles. When we have plus here, this corresponds to attractive. Here, this corresponds to attractive interaction between particles. When we have minus interaction is repulsive, the same on other terms, and you can have many terms. So, when we have repulsive non-local interaction, sine minus, this is known as Schrödinger-Poisson, or models of density functional theory. When we have attractive sine in the non-local term, this appears in various gravitational models. And Shakara is one of those models, and later I will speak. Those models, and later I will speak about the Gross-Pitovsky-Poisson model, which is a modified Chakar equation. They're very different and different methods are used because the sign of non-local term somehow determines massively the properties of the whole model and of the whole problem. So, a little bit of history or small part of the history. So, coming back to Chakar equation, about 10 years ago, jointly with Jean-Van Schafing and we did. Go jointly with Jean van Schafing, and we decided to look to go a little bit to revisit Leap's paper and to go a little bit to a little bit more general framework. So, we introduced risk potential with alpha between zero and n into the model. And we introduced, instead of square here, we introduced more general power p. When alpha goes to zero, the risk potential goes to a delta function, so non-locality disappears. So, in the local prototype case alpha equals zero, we can think. case alpha equals zero, we can think just about standard semilinear equation or standard NLS. This equation was studied in many, many works and non-linear elliptic PDs and NLS theory. So we can see now this non-local part as a non-local nonlinearity. And we prove a range of results. So we proved with Jean-Louisville's theorems and decay of solutions existence and properties of ground states. We even considered general nonlinearities f of u. General nonlinearities f of u instead of u to the p. But today I want to maybe give one typical result from 10 years ago. So this is generalized Chapar equation and I will look only at the special case dimension equals 3 and p equals 2. So this is almost slightly modified leap case. We have just alpha as a parameter. And what we proved with Jean is that this equation admits a radial decreasing positive ground state solution, which is a Ground state solution, which is a regular C2 function and it's in H1, finite energy, of course. And it has this complicated looking asymptotics. So we have exponential decay, polynomial correction, and here rho depends on the norm, L2 norm of solution itself. So this asymptotic term can be deciphered in a more clear, for instance, in some special cases, can have nicer representation, for instance, when algorithms are. Representation, for instance, when alpha equals two, we have this explicit asymptotic expression. So everyone will recognize that this is a standard decay of green function to minus la plus and plus one. However, since we are talking about non-local and non-linear problem, it is modified by this polynomial correction. And the strength of polynomial correction depends on the L2 normal solution itself. This is very important in non-local models. In local elliptic PDEs, we are used to Elliptic PDEs, we are used to the universal decay estimates. When what happens at infinity, okay, up to a constant, there is some universal estimate. This is no longer true for non-local equations, and this is not so surprising. So, since the problem is non-local, somehow decay at infinity can screen and see what happens near zero. So, if solution, let's say, concentrated near zero and has a very large L2 norm near zero. Large L2 norm near zero. This will be visible at infinity in the case of Chakar in this particular form, in the form of this modification of the standard green function decay, which one would expect. Excuse me, U is V? Ah, U is V here. Yeah, sorry, this is a typo. U is V is a solution. So this is asymptotic for a given solution. Once you have a solution V, it will have a symptotic which It will have a symptotic which depends on its own L2 norm. And this is sharp. So you have a limit with a constant C. We cannot control the constant, but this goes to a limit C. So another aspect, I go back to a remarkable paper of Lipp. So LIP proved uniqueness when alpha equal 2. However, beyond this proof, uniqueness is still an open problem. Uniqueness was Problem. Uniqueness was proved by Korean mathematician Siok for alpha going to zero and alpha going to the dimension, which is three in this case. And this is a symptotic proof, because when alpha goes to zero and alpha goes to the dimension, the formal limit equation becomes local. And for local equation, uniqueness is known. And you can exploit this to prove uniqueness for small perturbation in terms of alpha. However, intermediate range, so However, intermediate range, so endpoints and alpha equal to uniqueness, intermediate range, as far as I know, remains open. There are works on this, but there is no universal result. There are only partial results in this direction. So, this is Shakar ground state. And now I will move to the main, almost move to the main topic of my talk. So, about four or five years ago, we sent Leo, who is in South. Within Liu, who is in Suzhou, not far from Hangzhou, we studied ground states of Chakar equation with local repulsion. So, this is standard Chakar nonlinear part, and we added local nonlinear term. This is the power q where q is bigger than 2. And you see that there is a competition between two nonlinearities, local and non-local. They have opposite sign. So, with Zenk, we looked at the case q bigger than 2 in Rn and even more. Bigger than two in RNA, an even more general problem. Today, I want to concentrate on a specific case q equals 4, which when alpha equals 2, so Newtonian potential is known and well known in cosmology in the models of cold dark matter, so-called self-gravitating Bose enstain condensate. So, there is a long list. There are several initial works around 2007, but there are maybe up to 100 experimental work. Hundred experimental works in cosmologies when people trying to show that this equation allows to describe some observations of dark which related to the study of dark matter around galaxies. So this is very popular topic in cosmology. As far as we know, there wasn't that many mathematical studies of this object. And what we see, so Gross-Pitevsky Poisson, this part of the equation. Poisson. This part of the equation looks exactly like Gross-Pitaevsky, local Gross-Pitaevsky equation. But then on the right, we have a Chakar part which represents self-gravitation between particles and which we will see the principal part in this object. And with that, we were also particularly interested in the behavior with respect to parameter. So there is a parameter lambda here, which can be small or large. So, what we proved, so result for the Gross-Pitevsky-Poisson case. First, so for dimension equals 3 in this setting, alpha between 0 and 3, any potential. And then we proved that for any positive lambda, there exists a positive radially decreasing ground state, which is regular, C2 function. It has precisely the same asymptotic as in the case of standard channel. Of standard Shakar. So, asymptotic is governed by Chakar equation. If lambda is zero or negative, there is no solution, at least there is no finite energy solutions with a little bit of regularity. This follows from Pakazhaev. So, we need a little bit of extra regularity to apply Pakajaev. Existence for all lambda is not obvious here, not given. In some equations of a similar structure, you don't have existence for arbitrary lambda. Have existence for arbitrary lambda. However, in this case, we do. And in generally, when you first start looking at this, you are a bit puzzled because you have local nonlinearity of order 3 here. So the total power is 3. And you have non-local nonlinearity of the same order 3. Of course, there is a risk potential here. And they have opposite signs, so they compete with each other. And which nonlinearity win is not so clear, and the behavior is. The behavior is a bit puzzling. So, existence for any lambda positive. Uniqueness is absolutely open. We don't know any uniqueness result for this type of equation with additional local perturbation. We would probably have a mild expectation of uniqueness because, for similar type of local equations with double power, there are uniqueness results. But this is, I would leave it completely open. Completely open. So the techniques, the tools are standard. You look at the energy and unimize the energy and Pakazhaev manifold. And after a bit of work, you find critical points on Pakazhaev manifold. Pakhazhaev manifold is a natural constraint, which means you pick up Lagrangian multiplier equals zero. So Pakazhaev constraint doesn't introduce additional terms in the equation and you solve forigen. Terms in the equation, and you solve the original problem. So, this is standard and not that difficult. More interesting part was to understand asymptotic behavior as lambda goes to zero to infinity. So, here we are not looking at one problem. Of course, we can introduce the standard scaling. So, we can introduce lambda into these three powers s and t. And then our equation transforms into the family of equivalent equations with these parameters and three. With these parameters and three powers. And then you realize easily, this is what physicists would do in the first instance when they start looking at these equations. You can balance the powers. For instance, you can find S and T, which balances three powers here. And then for some lambda going to zero or infinity, there will be a regime when this t this lambda parameter becomes this this t parameter becomes small and this term formally disappears. And this term formally disappears, and you get this equation without the right-hand side, which is standard local Gross-Pitayevsky. You also realize that this Gross-Pitayevsky plus plus plus, this is just convex energy, you have no non-trivial solution, and you rule this out as a limit equation because it doesn't contain any non-trivial information. You want a limit problem, limit equation, which has non-trivial solutions. You can quickly realize that there are four possibilities to balance the powers here. To balance the powers here. Another possibility which is not useful is this when you eliminate this linear local term, eliminate the potential, we can say. This equation in this particular regime happens to have no solution. This has to be proved and this falls from Pahajaev identity. This is due to a combination of powers here. For some other powers, it may have a solution, but in this case, May have a solution, but in this particular case, no solution. So you rule this out. So we are left with two limit regimes. This is Shakar, when you eliminate the local perturbation which we introduced, and Shakar has a non-trivial ground state, as I explained before. Or you are left with another and a bit exotic regime, which we call Thomas-Fermi regime when Laplace interm disappears. So the limit equation is no longer elliptic equation, doesn't have Laplace and term, but rather integral. Laplacian term, but rather integral equation with non-local term. Let me mention that in both non-trivial regimes, non-local terms survive, so you cannot get rid of non-locality in this problem. Non-locality always is significant effect. It's not a smaller order effect. So a few words about Thomas-Fermi equation. Thomas-Fermi equation is well studied. It was studied originally by Pierre Louis-Leonzen and even before him for alpha equal to. Before him for alpha equal to 2, and more recently, ground states were studied by Hasekarillo and his group for general alpha between zero and the dimension in the context of Keller-Sigal model. So here's Thomas-Fermi equation reappears, and it does have a unique positive rather than negative compactly supported ground state. So the ground state of this solution is a compactly supported function supported on a ball. It is a radial. And this will be. It is radio. And this will be important a little later. It is important in astrophysics because the radius of the support of this Thomas-Fermi solution is precisely the radius of astrophysical object physicists try to study. So this is estimating this radius gives them the tool to fit these results to the astrophysical measurements. But this is a toy model, and when we start. This is a toy model, and when we started this with Zenk, we were realizing that this is a toy model, because the real model which you want to study is normalized solution. Normalized solution is when you don't prescribe the lambda, which is a parameter here, do not prescribe Lagrange multiplier, but you prescribe the mass. This is the mass of a star-physical object. So you prescribe the L2 norm to a given positive quantity. You look at this free energy. You look at this free energy, which doesn't contain L2 term anymore. So, this is standard kinetic energy, local power 4 term, and non-local term. And if you find minimizers or critical points on this constraint, you will obtain Gross-Pitevsky-Poisson equation. However, lambda now appears as a priori unknown Lagrange multiplier. And this thing you will realize the behavior of this Lagrange multiplier. Behavior of this Lagrange multiplier with respect to the mass could be non-trivial, and we will see that it could be unexpected. But you can prove quickly in the beginning, you can rule out non-negative Lagrange multipliers, as we've seen already for lambda negative in the result. Okay, I'll mention this already in our previous result with Zenc negative or zero, lambda doesn't allow finite energy solutions. So, what do we get if? So, what do we get if we start looking at minimizers or more generally critical points for mass constraint? So, I will present our results in a term of diagram, which again astrophysicists would like to look at. So, this is a mass row. So, this is small versus large mass. This is the energy of the ground state, or rather, in this case, of the minimizer. So, there are three cases to consider when alpha is. Cases to consider when alpha is bigger than one, the energy is bounded below on for each particular mass rho. Remember, then constraint energy is not bounded below, it's never bounded below, it's easy to see by scalings. Constraint energy is bounded below, and it's not difficult to see that there is a minimizer, so the minimum is achieved. So, for every positive row, there is a global normalized minimizer, and what you want to understand then. What you want to understand then, what we want to understand then, how this minimizer behaves when mass goes to infinity or mass goes to zero. And the way to do this is to recover the asymptotic of lambda of Lagrange multiplier, which is a difficult and challenging task, but this eventually can be done. And the technique, you basically use what is known in the area as ABC systems. So you write Bahajaev identity, you write Nihari identity, you write the energy. You write the energy and you play, you have three systems, three quantities in the systems, and you try to express one in terms of another. You will use Deliardo-Nierenberg inequality, you will do some estimates, and eventually you will manage to capture the symptotics of lambdas. So, when lambda goes, when rho goes to zero, when mass is small, in some scaling, these normalized minimizers converge to ground state of a sharp. Converge to the ground state of a Shakar equation. When lambda goes, when mass goes to infinity, large mass, this normalized minimizers, they converge to compactly supported ground states of the Thomas Fermi model. And this is perfectly consistent with the physical expectation. Of course, astrophysical object will have a very large mass. And so those ground states for the gross pitaisky pulaisson. The Gross-Pitevsky Pohasson, they will be almost compactly supported. They will be approximated by compactly supported Thomas-Fermi minimizer, which was actually used by astrophysicists in the 30s. The Thomas-Fermi equation was used in astrophysical context since the 30s. But for the accurate model, the full Gross-Pitevsky-Poisson correction is needed. And this is, to be honest, quite expected. There is nothing too unexpected here. unexpected here. More unexpected picture, I'm conscious of time that I have just a couple of minutes left, is when you look at the case alpha less than one. So when alpha less than one, the picture becomes much more complex. So first you realize after a bit of analysis that for small masses there are no minimizers, so there are in fact no finite energy critical points for the constraint problem. So we can prove it up to a certain small mass rho bar. Mass rho bar. Then you will realize that starting from another, maybe larger, possibly larger mass rho double star, the model is actually bounded below. Then you realize that for rho even larger, the infimum in the model is negative and you have global minimizers. So this is a global minimum branch of global minimizers. When rho is less than this critical mass rho star, the infimum. Mass rho star, the infimum in the model is actually zero, infimum of the energy is zero, and this infimum is not attained. However, what you can recover, you can recover a local minimizer at positive energy. This part of the branch are local minimizers. Now, what you can do as a next step, you can also try to apply mountain pass argument. So, you have starting from this. So you have starting from this row double star for any large row, you have a local minimizer, you have a global minimizer, but then you realize that you also can recover a mountain pass structure. You have another branch of minimizers, which are mountain pass solutions. Technically, I don't have time to talk about it. You use two different arguments here. When masses are small, you use one mountain pass argument. When masses are large, you use another mountain pass argument. You use another mountain pass argument to recover the asymptotic. And then you recover the same asymptotic as before of the Lagrange multiplier, but now you realize that this power is negative. So Lagrange multiplier blows up as rho goes to zero. And this is what prevents the existence. You don't have any existence for small masses rho. So this is a branch. We can see this is a unique branch when lambda rho here is very large. Lambda rho here is very large, and in the limit you have Thomas Fermi, and then lambda rho, the Lagrange multiplier, decreases. And then here you can control Lagrange multiplier goes to zero on this particular branch. Okay, so in the remaining maybe one minute, intermediate borderline case when alpha equals one, you have a transitional picture. You have non-existent. Picture. You have non-existence up to a certain mass raw star, and this raw star we can estimate very carefully. And then you can have global minimizers on the branch. The limit for large masses is Thomas compactly supported Thomas Fermi ground state. The limit when mass goes to the critical value raw star is the ground state of the Chacar equation in a certain scaling. And this scaling we cannot characterize explicitly, but we can give. but we can give some estimates on the rates of the scaling. So the scaling in this case is implicit. So I probably finish here. Just at the end I will show some numerical pictures how the Thomas Fermi minimizers look like. This is the work with Yan Hong Huang, who is a numerical analyst and who did this very useful numerics for us. So this is a shape of actual Thomas Fermi minimizer, which is a linear Which is a limit for our problem when masses are large. And as you see, this is in this case, it is a Lipschitz, but non-smooth function. So you have a sharp corner here. And side support, the function is smooth. So I probably stop here. Thank you very much. And I will be happy to answer questions if there are any.
