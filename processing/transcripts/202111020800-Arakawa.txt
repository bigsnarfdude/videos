42 digitality and VOE theory. And so let me start with Yunchan Zhu's theory. So I think all people in VUA Theory agree that we owe a lot to Yon Chanzu. Yung Chanzhu, he discovered, he invented many nice things. One of his discovery is the discovery of Zeus algebra, where so you can associate to any vertex operator algebra and an algebra. So A stands for algebra called a Zoo's algebra. And you can use this. And you can use this user algebra to classify all positively related single representation of VUI. And he also defined so-called Jude Sitz algebra. So which is a certain So which is a certain Poisson algebra. And so the relation between this Zeus algebra and Poisson algebra is the following. So this is not always the case, but in nice cases, so this Jus algebra is naturally filtered, filtered by a conformal grading here, and then you can take corresponding And then you can take corresponding associate grade and then you get this Poisson algebra. But this definition of those algebra, those Poisson algebra, is a bit mysterious. But then Haishandi explained the construction of this algebra. Of this algebra quite nicely. So his explanation was the following. So you can, so vertex operator algebra is spanned by normally ordered product of descendants of a generating field like this. And then you can define filtration by counting number of derivations. Number of derivation. So is spanned by elements which contains at least p derivations. And then this defines decreasing filteration, which is compatible with a structure of a vertex operator. So if you take associate graded, then this has a structure of so-called Poisson. Structure of so-called Poisson vertex algebra. So this is a vertex algebra of a Poisson algebra or a Poisson algebra by in terms of Benison Adrini field. So anyway, so this Poisson algebra sits inside this Poisson vertex algebra. So this is just the first part of this. First part of this field duration and a Poisson structure is just a restriction of this Poisson vertex algebra structure. So the multiplication is just the normally ordered product and Poisson bracket is just the first part in the OPE. So this is a So, this is a finitely generated Poisson algebra. So, it's natural to define corresponding spectrum. And this is called associated variety of vertex algebra. And so, this is finite dimensional Poisson variety. And the one of conjecture of Yong Chan Zhu is that if Vu is rational, so if is rational so if we has only semi-simple representation of v is completely reducible then this associated variety has to be a point and so this means so in this case called least over c is equal finite and so if you you believe this conjecture then if associated variety has positive dimensions Has positive dimension, then this implies that the vertex operator algebra has a non-same simple representation. So now, as everyone knows, vertex operator algebra corresponds to two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory. But the recent discovery is that the VOA appears appears also in higher dimensional quantum field theories, which was nicely explained in Silky's talk yesterday. And so it's not only one way, but in multiple ways. And the fact is that the many of vertex operator algebra that appear in higher dimensional quantum field theory have non-trivial associated varieties. Set of RITs. So this means that the corresponding VOA has non-semi-simple representation. And in my talk, I focus on the 4D-2D correspondence, which is one of examples of vertex operators appearing in In higher dimensional quantum field theory. So being lemos, Liendo, Pilars, Rastri, and Varis discover the following thing. So they so they constructed a map from a category of four-dimensional n equals to super. General any constituents per conformity with the series to the category of vertex operate algebra by a certain dimensional reduction. And so this map satisfy the following property. So if you the SUVA index of the Foudy theory, which is a Q-series, can be obtained as Can be obtained as a normalized character of the corresponding vertex operative algebra. So this is very nice. And the fact is, so not only this, but this map chi has several properties, and one of the property is that the center. One of the property is that the central charge of VOA is minus 12 of central charge of 4D. And because of this minus sign here, if you start with a unitary theory, you end up with a non-unitary theory. So this means that the image, the VUA, appears The Voyua appears as an image of 4D theory, can be never in Italy. So this chi is not subjective. On the other hand, if I understand correctly, this chi is expected to be injective. So this is surprising because chi is Because chi is defined by dimensional reduction. But it's true in all examples. And so in other words, this chi T is a complete invariant of a 4D server. So this is a very surprising, happy news for us because this 4D server is extremely rich theory. Theory. So, if you believe this VOA is a complete invariant, so this has a big full subcategory which contains all the information of this four-dimensional cycle. So, would you like to study this vertex operator algebra? And so, there is another. And so there's another striking conjecture of B. Manuber's theory, which says the Hicks branch of the Fordy theory, which is a vertex operator algebra for any for the assembly. So this is a very surprising conjecture because the sixth branch is a very geometric object and vertex of the algebra is purely algebraic object. So we have this nice, so if you believe the Ebim Russi conjecture, we have this nice commutative diagram. Nice commutative diagram. So this VOA knows not only a SUI indicator, but also a Higgs branch. But this in particular implies that the corresponding vertex operator. Corresponding vertex operate algebra is not rational, if you believe this conjecture, unless a Higgs branch is a point. And so it's natural to ask what can we say about this vertex operator algorithms. And the beam rust three conjecture says. The beam rastery conjecture says associated variety of way that comes from Flodis area has to have associated variety which is isomorphic to the Higgs branch. And the Higgs branch is expected to have finitely many sympathetic leaves. So the corresponding associated variety should have finitely many Variety should have finitely many simpler griefs as well. And it's natural to define the following notion. So we call vertex operator algebra quasi-lis if its associative variety has finitely many sympathetic leaves. And this is a certain finiteness condition. And this finiteness Under this finiteness condition, we can show that the normalized character of the VOA satisfies a modular linear differential equation. I forgot to write a differential equation. And so modular linear differential equation, a solution of a modular linear differential equation is a certain equation is a certain differential equation Mozilla form satisfy and the solutions of modular linear differential equation solution space is invariant under the action of ISL2g so this theorem implies the certain modularity of the normalized character Character of the VOA, which should be the same as the SUA index of the 4D theory if V comes from a 4D theory. So this implies certain modularity of SU index. And proof of this theorem actually the same as a proof of ZU. As a proof of Zhu, who proved modularity of character for rational VOAs, thanks to a result of writing of Anshedra. So this is a nice, I think this is a nice application of Voyo theory. And let me explain some examples of Some examples of quasi-lis vertex operator algebra. So let LKG be a simple affine vertex operator algebra associated with Z at level K. So this is a vacuum representation of the affine Katzumati algebra. And then can I ask a quick question? Yes. On the previous page. So So you get this modularity for these characters. So now on the VOA side, it has a natural interpretation from modular transformation of the TOR parameter. But what on the quantum field, see the 4D side, does it have an interpretation? Maybe the audience can answer. So, modularity, as far as I understand, this modularity can be proved only in this way. So, if I understand correctly, there is no direct interpretation in 4D theory. For the assembly. Okay, very good. Thank you. Right. So I consider admissible representation that was explained in David's talk yesterday. David's talk yesterday, so which is a sort of nice representation of a fine katsumodi defined by Kats and Wakimoto. And so this has to have a fractional level, where so shifted level has to be a positive rational number whose numerator is not so small. It's not so small. Then one can show that this associated variety is contained in the nilpotent cone, which was a conjecture of Fege and Franklin. And you can also, in fact, you can also describe this variety explicitly. Here, so theta is the highest short root, and this I consider a representation of G with highest weight, theta s. And so from this description, it's obvious that this is contained in the nilipotent cone, and the sympletic leaf of a nilipotent cone is a quadrant orbit. This has a finitely many sympletic leaves. Many simpletic leaves. And in fact, if this VOA comes from 4D theory, from certain August Douglas, forgot to put this Douglas theory, if the level is boundary. So boundary means that the P is smallest as possible, like here. And And there's one interesting connection of this variety with a small quantum group as well. So this variety has a description in terms of a small quantum group as following. So we have, we can have we can con if we consider a small quantum group at q's root of unity where q is a denominator of this level k and left hand side if you look at this only depends this variety only depends on the denominator and then if you consider this small quantum group and correspond quantum group and corresponding cohomology and and the spectrum of of this is exactly this variety provided that the q satisfies certain conditions so this was proved by ginzburg and kumar when q is equal greater than cost number which is a case this value This variety is an important token. And this Bendel, Natkano, Parsher, and Pilene extended their result for small Q. And so their description is slightly a bit different, but you can show that they indeed coincide. Now, so if you look at, see this kind of state to me, Statement, you attempted to relate this voucher with small quantum group in more direct way. And in fact, this is possible, at least for SL2 case. So this is a joint, recent joint work with Thomas and Kazuya. So let G be SL2 and LKG be other. And LKG be a domestic representation which is not integrable. Then we consider the category of weight module of this VOA. So this is exactly the category David talked yesterday. So this is a category of weight module which contains all the relaxed highest weight modules and Modules and the aspect of flows. And this zero means principal block. So it's a block of the block containing this vacuum module. And then a statement is that this category is equivalent to the category of unruled small quantum group where we want, of course. Of course, we consider a corresponding principal block. So, this kind of equivalence was expected in Trazen's talk for this special value of k, but we can show for all atomic variables. And you can also further identify this category with so-called restricted category O. Restricted category O as a critical level for SL2 hat. So, anyway, so this state theorem completely determines the structure of this category. And so, this theorem in particular implies that the implies that this category has enough projectives, which was stated as a conjecture by David yesterday. And in fact, one can show that the whole category has enough projectives. And so this is rather surprising statement because the category of weighter module of SL2, that's the symbol. Of SL2, that's the simplest example of realism, does not have enough projectives. So, this kind of statement only holds if we consider a representation, a category as a vertex-operator algebra modules. And we believe that this that this is a general phenomena. So our conjecture is that if denominator is, so if associated varieties is isomorphic to the nilpotent to come. So this means so this means that the q So this means that Q here is sufficiently large. So then this means just the add X, X is an important element. Then the conjecture is that the category of weight module for higher rank G should be equivalent to the category of a low quantum group, but G is replaced. But G is replaced by its Langlands duo. And let me make some comment. So as David explained yesterday, so this category should be equipped with the structure of a certain modular tensor category. Tensor category and so we can consider so this is already explained in the work of Thomas and Deby. We can consider quotient category by quotient out by negligible modules. So we So we co-sent out by module which have a quantum dimension and zero. So this gives some simplification of the category, modular tensor category. And then this category is expected to be equivalent to the category obtained from a coulomb branch of the corresponding. Of the corresponding Avras Douglas theory. And I think Du is going to talk about this. So it would be very interesting to know how deep Francesco's talk is related with these things. Okay, so let me explain more example, so which I'm like to talk about the theory of class S now. So this is a, so S stands for six, and this is a theory, a 4D theory obtained by compactifying six dimensional theory on a punctured rim. On a punctured Riemann surface. And the corresponding theory has this Riemann surface sigma as a parameter. And also group, gauge group or Flavor symmetry group, which is a complex semi simple group. And for this theory of class S, Hicks Branch. Hicks branch is nicely described mathematically, and this was done by Moan Tachkawa up to a conjecture. And this conjecture has been proved by Ginsburg and Kazan and Braverman, Nafinkelberg, and Nakajima. So we have a nice discussion. A nice description of Higgs branches for the theory of classes. And so this is described as 2D TQFT whose values are holomorphic sympathetic varieties. And corresponding VOA are called chiral Arzeborov or classes. Neighbor of classes. And so this is also described similarly that now sympathetic varieties are replaced by VOAs. And this was conjectured by Beam, Peelers, Rusty, and Vanris and proved by Massif. And moreover, one can show that the that the beam rustling conjecture which says the associated variety of this is the same as this so so that the yeah so this conjecture one can prove rigorously that beam rasily conjecture is for class s therapy so now uh when we talk about a beam raster conjecture there's one Conjecture: there's one subtle subtlety here. Um, so this algebra in general not reduced, almost never reduced, while the Hicks branch chiral ring is supposed to be reduced. So the isomorphism only The isomorphism only holds after we take a reduced scheme of the spectrum of the Zudusitz algebra. To remedy this, Beam Rastri gave the following construction. So let V be a vertex operator algebra coming from 4D theory. From a 4D survey. Then this admits double grading where delta is a conformal weight. So this is, we all know what it is. But also it has a grading by R charge. This is defining 4D 7. And this R, if I And this R, if I understand correctly, this is smaller or equal to this conformal weight. And so using this R charge, you can define a filtration of VOA in the following way. So if you consider a subspace spanned by this subspace. Subspaces, then this gives a decreasing filteration of vertex operate algebra, which is separated, obviously. And the statement is that the associate graded is again a Poisson vertex algebra and each piece. And each piece contains a filtration defined by Hai Shandi. So this is a span of elements which contains at least p derivations. So this means that there's a natural map from Gul of V, which is Fp V over F P plus plus 1 V, to this new Poisson value. To this new Poisson vertex algebra. And if you read this is a homomorphism of a Poisson vertex operator algebra, and you can restrict this Poisson vertex algebra homomorphism and obtain a Poisson algebra homomorphism from R void to this quotient. And the statement is that the kernel of this subjection is the nil radical of ROV. So this is a reduced ring of this due to situation algebra. So this means that this is a Higgs branch Keyler ring. So this is a very nice construction. Construction, but the problem for us is that we cannot see this R charge without the knowledge of the FODIC. So we'd like to reproduce this alpha tradition somehow only looking at vertex operators. And so we propose the Exposed the following method. So let us consider the smooth part of this spectrum of the Jules algebra. Then I assume some assumption which is true, which you can show true for genus classes theory. So the assumption is that So, the assumption is that X of the T is very simple. So, this is very natural. And so, this U is sympathetic. So, this is a smooth sympathetic variety, which is not a fine. And this has codimension at least two. Then because this is open, this is a closed sub-space. A closed subspace, so you can choose, you can find this corresponding defining idea. And I lift this element of R V to element of V. So this, if I are a symbol of this element, then we can consider a following filtration. I forgot to put normal password, normal over the product here. Anyway, so if we define gamma p of v is a span of element such that if we apply at least n elements from these elements which correspond to the defining ideal of the scroll set. Defining ideal of the scroll set, then this sits inside if p of v. So this obviously contains if p of v because if p of v is defined as a span of elements which contains at least p derivations. So this one also has at least p derivations if phi contains File contains already p derivations. And one can show that this defines a filteration of which is compatible with the structure of a vertex operator algebra. So that the associated grade is a Poisson vertex algebra. And because each pieces contains Fp of V, Fp of V, we again have a Poisson vertex algebra homomorphism. And also this first piece is a reduction of the sites algebra. So which is supposed to be the, so this supposed to be, should be isomorphic to the Higgs branch chiraling of the 4D theory, if we come from 4D theory. For this. So it's natural to conjecture that this filtration coincides with our filtration defined by Beeman Ross theory. And so let me make some remarks. So this filtration was used by Vogan in the finite dimension setting. In this paper, so this just a straightforward analog of the Vogan, what Vogan did in 90. So this is something quite a natural thing to do. So let me explain an example. Um I think I finish early. So let me explain the most simplest example, which is a Birazzo PQ minimal model. So this algebra is this is a quotient of a polynomial ring of one variable by ring of one variable by this wherein it's some some integer and this x is the image of the stress tensor of the virus or element and then so associated variety is a point but as a scheme this is a fat point so and then so you So and then so u is if n equals to one, this open set is a point. And if n is greater than one, this is an empty set. Then for n equals to one, the filtration, because this is a point, we don't, there's no nothing to do. So gamma p is just the same as. So, gamma p is just the same as fp v, but this is a natural because r of v is already reduced. And if n is strictly greater than one, then the stress tensor is contained in gamma one v because this nth power of stress tensor is contained in fm of v. the a fam of v so and this defines uh uh u so this means that the uh this quotient is is she again which which is a reduced in of the uh c to obzego and uh for genus zero class For genus zero class S3, it's possible to give more a concrete description of this virtualization using my construction, but maybe I will not explain. So I'm sorry, but I finished early. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Professor. Well, thank you for a very beautiful talk. Are there questions? I was wondering about your relationship between the unruled quantum group and Fi and SL2 at admissible level. Would you say you have some natural correspondence, or do you just have? Correspondence, or do you just have it just happens that you get the same kinds of objects in the yeah? It's a good question. We don't have natural correspondence at the moment. As you say, we just determine all projectives and compare home between them. So, I guess in both categories, you also have all those simple currents coming from the spectral flow, I guess, for. So the object looks very different. So this is this is a um so if you this is also sorry maybe I should go so this well this is a user high-state category. So you have a standard object like a VAMA module, but the VAMA module corresponds to here a spectral full of caspidary induced modules. So the object looks very different. However, a homospace of projective are the same. Yeah, for the projective cover of the vacuum for LKSL2, is it so it should have two composition factors or the vacuum itself and then are the other two high. Are the other two highest weight modules are a highest weight and the lowest weight modules? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that. Yeah. So David explained in the Dryamon diagram. Yes. Yes, I'm very familiar with that. It seems like these diamond diagrams always show up when you're doing SL2-related things. I don't know if there's some natural correspondence. So, on that very same slide, is that something you expect in general that this associated variety is the spectrum of some cohorts? Variety is the spectrum of some cohomology ring of something. I mean, it looks like a so is that what expectation is? Yes. So there's a conjecture of Costello Thomas and Guyot, which says that you can recover. says that you can recover, you can state the sympletic duality in terms of vertex operator as you know. And so one one you one simple simple duality is a duality between simplicity varieties. And one one duality, one variety is described. Is described by as an associative writing in the conjecture, and another is described by spectrum of X algebra. And cohomology, a ring is kind of a spec X algebra. So in this case, in this sense, this kind of structure is somewhat expected. So in this case, So, in this case, the duality goes between G and the Langelts dual G? Right, yeah, that's what we expect. Any other questions? Oh, I have a hand. Let's see. Sorry, that was me. Okay, go ahead, Peter. That was me. Okay, go ahead, Peter. Thank you. Hi, no, I just wanted to ask one other thing about this relation. So is it obvious that the associated variety should be related to cell texts of the vacuum module? It seems to be what you were implying in the response to the last question. No, it's not obvious. It's not obvious. Yeah, this but this is something what conjecture says okay thanks other questions I have one so in the Muotachika sorry or moduli. More touching theory or more general quasi-list vertex algebras. What do you expect for a representation theory? It's a very difficult question. So, as I commented on the colours, the majority of the colours are The Coulomb branch is somehow related with the representation of the corresponding vertex of Elliott algebra. So in particular, this should be a general picture that you should be able to define, give some kind of Some kind of structure of modulator category of the on the category of a module over the corresponding vertex of later algebra. And if you consider some kind of simplification, it should contains information of curon and branching as well. But I don't, I cannot really. But I don't, I cannot really state precise statement. But for the agras-daggress theory, this kind of statement is expected in general, and this is, I think, explaining the base of any other questions. Any other questions? Well, I think let's thank Professor Aquaba again. And thank you very much for a nice talk. And we can talk more about these things in the following discussion. So we'll. Things in the following discussion. So we'll start again in about 12 minutes.
