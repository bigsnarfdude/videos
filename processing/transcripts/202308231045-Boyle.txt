Am I uh Eleda? Do you mind if you are recorded? No, no, I don't. Thank you. Okay, great, great. Okay, please go ahead. Okay, well, thank you very much to the organizers for the invitation to speak. And I'm sorry to not be there in person. I just moved with my family from Toronto to Edinburgh. We just arrived, so it was too soon to come back across the ocean to Oaxaca. We have to first get our. To Oaxaca, we have to first get our gas operating and stuff like that. Okay, so I wanted to tell you about, I'll be talking about work with mainly with my collaborator Neil Turek, and then also some of these papers are also with my former student, Karen Finn, that we've been working on over the past few years and have gotten very excited about a new theory of the early universe. So, I want to sort of give you a whirlwind tour of some of the reasons that we've gotten more and more excited about this idea. You know, very briefly, the spirit of it is that we want to see, we want to sort of take very seriously the standard model of particle physics and Einstein gravity, and in particular, you know, the maximal analytic extensions of the solutions of Einstein gravity and any notable symmetries or meromorphic structure that they might. Or meromorphic structure that they might have. And we've been surprised to find how many kind of elegant and rigid explanations one arrives at in that way of observed properties of the universe and predictions for upcoming observations. You know, very, the cartoon picture in short. The cartoon picture, in short, is that one is led to, we've been led to a picture where the Big Bang is like a kind of mirror, but you know, unlike an ordinary mirror whose normal direction is space-like, the bang is like a co-dimension one surface whose normal vector is time-like, so that makes it a different. But in many other respects, the idea is that it's very much like a mirror, and that turns out to lead to a lot of interesting things. Turns out to lead to a lot of interesting things. So let me just dive in and tell you what the idea is. Okay, so this is supposed to be a cartoon picture of the expanding universe. So here, this is the conformal time running up the page. And then this is supposed to show the universe expanding as it gets older. And we live up here at the top of this sort of inverted lampshade. And we look back toward the Big Bang, but of course, we can't see all the way. Big Bang, but of course, we can't see all the way back. But as far back as we can see, there's a very striking pattern, which is that the further back you look toward the Big Bang, the simpler things get. And so in particular, a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, we know that the universe, the main lesson from observational cosmology is that a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the universe seems to be basically as simple as you could possibly. Basically, as simple as you could possibly imagine it to be, you know, to a very good approximation, the geometry is max at some time slice, a snapshot a moment after the Big Bang, the geometry is maximally symmetric. It's basically a copy of three-dimensional Euclidean space. And then there are tiny order 10 to the minus five perturbations about that Euclidean geometry. But they're also as simple as. But they're also as simple as can be. First of all, they seem to be completely random, and they're random in sort of the simplest sense. They seem to be perfectly Gaussian. They seem to be drawn from a statistical distribution that shares the maximal symmetry of the background. There don't seem to be any tensor or vector perturbations. They're purely scalar or density type perturbations. They're what cosmologists call adiabatic. And then And then so since they're Gaussian, they're completely characterized by their two-point correlation function, these perturbations. And that also is as simple as can be. It seems to be a perfect power law as far as observations can tell, and a nearly scale-invariant power law to moreover. And furthermore, all the perturbations seem to be temporally synchronized in the sense that if you follow them back toward the Big Bang, it's The Big Bang, it's as if they satisfy a Neumann boundary condition, basically a reflecting boundary condition at the Big Bang. And in our model, that will be explained by the fact that the Big Bang actually is a site where they satisfy a reflecting boundary condition. Okay, so as I say, the summary of all that is that things are really dramatically Things are really dramatically simple and get simpler and simpler as you follow the as you get closer to the bang. And that's clearly the sort of key hint that we have in early universe cosmology. And the name of the game is to try to figure out what that hint is trying to tell us about the early universe. So the conventional interpretation is that that hint is Is that that observed trend is sort of a mirage? That, okay, so as far back as we can see, things seem to get simpler and simpler as you look further back. But if you could see even further back, according to the conventional picture, it would get messy again. The idea is there's a big mess in the past, and that the job of a theory of the early universe is to insert a It is to insert a hypothetical epoch here of cosmological evolution that sort of cleans up the mess and turns it into the simple initial state that we actually see. And so in inflation, the idea is that during this period, the universe exponentially expands and stretches out the mess, roughly speaking, and produces the sort of simplicity that we see by zooming in to a sufficiently small patch of the hypothetical early mess. Of the hypothetical early mass. But you know, it's important to emphasize that there's no observational or theoretical reason to believe that this early period of mess was actually there. And so what I want to try to do is think about a different perspective. Just take the observations more at face value. As far back as we can see, as I say, the overwhelming hint that we get from observations is that the closer you get to the bank. Observations is that the closer you get to the bang, the simpler things get. And so maybe that is just what the universe is trying to tell us: that for whatever reason, as you follow things back to the bang, the bang was an extremely simple surface in space-time. So let's try to take that hypothesis and see where it leads us. Okay, so as the first step, it'll be helpful to use Penrose's trick where we can formally stretch. This trick where we conformally stretch the space-time to sort of make the causal structure of the boundaries and singularities more manifest. So, here I've just taken the previous lampshade and stretched it out to this straight cylinder. But it's the same picture, just drawn differently. Okay, so if the early universe down here really is as simple as it seems to be, then we know what the metric is. The metric is just basically. The metric is just basically a flat metric, the Minkowski metric, times an overall conformal factor, the scale factor. And if we continue to follow the scale factor back a little bit further than what we'd see, we do hit a singularity, the scale factor passed, but that singularity is of a very special character. It's just a conformal singularity. The conformal factor out front, this part of the metric stays completely regular, but the conformal factor out front passes through zero. Passes through zero, but it does so in the simplest way. It just has a simple analytic zero as tau passes through zero. So unlike an ordinary singularity in GR, where there's no unambiguous way to analytically extend through it, here there is an unambiguous analytic extension. We just let how extend to negative values. And when we do that, we get this sort of extended doubled version of the previous cylinder we were looking at. Version of the previous cylinder we were looking at, where now this is the surface, the bang, the surface where A passes through zero, and then the scale factor is negative down here and positive up here. And the first thing that we notice when we look at this extended solution is that it has an extra symmetry that we didn't see before. It has a new isometry under tau goes to minus tau, basically under flipping over the hourglass here. And so that's interesting for a number of reasons. So that's interesting for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that, you know, as is famously the case, in Minkowski space, there's so much symmetry that there's a unique vacuum that respects all of that, all of the symmetry of Minkowski space. So all inertial observers agree on the vacuum state. They all agree on what the state of zero particles is. But famously, in curved spacetime, that's not the case. In general, different observers. Not the case. In general, different observers, for example, living in different parts of the space-time will disagree on that point. And in particular, in a normal FRW cosmological space-time, observers, for example, at early times and late times will disagree. Because an FRW spacetime doesn't have enough symmetry to completely specify the vacuum, but it almost does. So it turns out FRW plus this extra time reversal symmetry. Symmetry is enough to pick out a preferred vacuum. There is a preferred CPT symmetric vacuum state that respects all the symmetry of the space-time. And so we want to take that seriously and imagine that maybe that's the state that the fields in our universe are in. Maybe the universe does not. CPT, this is thought to be this very fundamental symmetry of nature, of the laws of physics themselves, but not. Of the laws of physics themselves, but naively, when you're just looking at the portion of space-time after the bang, it looks like that symmetry is spontaneously broken by the state of the universe. But when you look at this extended picture, you notice, oh, maybe, maybe not, actually. So let's try to follow this hypothesis that it's later. I'm sorry, can I interrupt for a second? Yes, yes. So then you referred to this old proposal by. To this old proposal by Gasperini and Veneziano, the pre-big bank model, where they took this kind of, you know, the symmetry, write down the question between time and minus time. So this you're aware. Yeah, well, that's interesting. Yeah, the Gasperini model was this T duality-based model where they took A to go goes to one over A. So I mean, the equations remain symmetric if T goes to minus T and A goes. If t goes to minus t and a goes to 1 over a? I don't know exactly what the relationship is between that and this. That's a good question. Theirs has this A goes to 1 over A symmetry, which ours doesn't have. On the other hand, theirs was a kind of stringy extension, was based on a kind of hypothetical stringy extension of gravity beyond GR, which had this extra T-duality symmetry. Which had this extra T-duality symmetry, which of course GR does not. We are just looking at the solutions of GR with just an ordinary radiation-dominated era at the bang. So just ordinary GR plus radiation domination, and then just analytically extending the solution. So I see what you mean, that there's some relation in spirit, but I think. But my question is that if you put T to minus T in order for the equations to remain. In order for the equations to remain valid, A has to go to one over A, otherwise, no, uh, no, it goes has to go to minus A in our case. I don't, yeah, I don't understand that, but anyway, okay. So the reason that is, is because if you just think in an ordinary radiation-dominated universe, A of tau, A of the conformal time, is just proportional to tau. So just analytically extending that solution, since it's linear in tau, it's an Since it's linear in tau, it's an odd function of tau. So that's all I mean: that that it that under tau goes to minus tau, the solution is a goes to minus a, not one over a. If you see what I mean. Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. Okay, but probably it's interesting to see the connection with that model. So sorry, yeah, maybe so, maybe so. Yeah, okay. Please go ahead. Oops. Oh, sorry, sorry. I think my. Oh, no. Sorry, sir, I think my. Oh, now I'm back in. Okay. Okay, so just to, thanks for the question. So just to briefly explain a bit more what I mean by this CPT symmetric state. So here I've taken as an example, imagine we consider a Dirac field living on space-time. And a standard approach to quantum field theory and curved space-time is, you know, you decompose this field into a basis of solutions of the Dirac equation, and you split those solutions into positive frequency solutions, which I've called. Positive frequency solutions, which I've called psi here, and then the charge conjugate for negative frequency solutions, psi c. And you promote the coefficients, the Fourier coefficients in front of the positive frequency solutions to annihilation operators for the particles of that field, and the coefficients in front of the corresponding negative frequency solutions to the creation operators for the corresponding antiparticles. And then, you know, the vacuum state is the state annihilated by all of those A's and B's. Those A's and B's. And again, the issue is that in Minkowski space, all inertial observers agree about how you decompose solutions into positive frequency and negative frequency, but in curved space, they don't. And so, for example, in an FRW universe at late times, the positive frequency solutions, according to a late time observer, let's say are some solutions to psi plus. And so they would define some basis and their coefficients A plus and D plus. And their coefficients A plus and B plus would annihilate a certain state, which is what they would call the vacuum, the state zero plus here, the late time vacuum. But observers at an early time, long before the bang, would have a different set of an equivalent set of solutions that they would call positive frequency in their region of space-time. And so their corresponding coefficients would pick out a different vacuum state. But the point that I'm trying to make is that if the solution Is that if the solution has this extra isometry, if the space-time has this extra isometry, then there's another set of solutions you can pick out that satisfy an extra condition, which relates the solution at time tau after the bang to its charged conjugate solution at time minus tau before the bang. And in that basis, the coefficients in that basis pick out a vacuum state, the CPT symmetric vacuum, which The CPT symmetric vacuum, which is invariant not only under the rest of the FRW symmetries, but under CPT as well. So let's try to briefly see what happens as a first application when we apply this idea to the standard model of particle physics. So here's a very brief review of what's in the standard model. We have the three-gauge bosons in the Higgs field. Those are the bosonic fields. And then there's all the fermions. Here's one generation of fermions. Fermions. Here's one generation of fermions. There's three different colors of quark fields. And then there are the leptons. Now, in the traditional standard model, which only includes where every particle has, every left-handed particle, like the left-handed down quark, has a right-handed partner, except for the neutrino. The neutrino only has a left-handed, there's only a left-handed neutrino, no right-handed neutrino. A left-handed neutrino, no right-handed neutrino. If you take that theory, then there's just no dark matter candidate left in this theory. There's no particles left in the theory that haven't been directly observed, but are stable. Those are two basic requirements that you need to be the dark matters. It can't have been detected yet non-gravitationally, but it has to also live for as long as the age of the universe. And so, this standard model is just doesn't have any particles like that. But famously, that ever since the discovery of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations, it has seemed more likely than not the simplest normalizable explanation for that is that actually the left-handed neutrino does have a right-handed partner that sort of completes the natural patterns of particles in the standard model in a number of ways. And so every And so, every there are these three generations of fermions, and instead of 15 of them, there's actually the full complement of 16, including a right-handed neutrino. And so let's imagine that that is the case. So now, if you ask again, is there a dark matter candidate in this theory? Yes, one of these, it turns out that there's exactly one. One of the three right-handed neutrinos can be the dark matter because it can be. matter because it can be uh uh you know if uh if the one one of the it's perfectly compatible with everything we know that one of those three right-handed neutrinos is perfectly stable and uh um uh in which case uh it's it there's a Z2 symmetry that stabilizes it and then if it's stable it turns out to be actually a great dark matter candidate because if that Z2 symmetry is is present in the Lagrangian then it's also the And then it's also the same symmetry turns off its interactions with everything except gravity. So it's also the same symmetry that ensures its stability also ensures its darkness. So then the only puzzle you're left with is how to make that dark matter candidate. If it's completely cut off from the rest of the standard model and only talks to gravity, how do you produce enough of it to explain the observed dark matter abundance we see in the universe today? And so that, oh, sorry. And so, oh, sorry. So, that's where this CPT idea turns out to come to the rescue. It turns out that because there is, because if the right-handed neutrino, it's a standard model field, and in particular, the right-handed neutrino are really in the CPT symmetric state, that because that CPT symmetric state, as described on the previous page, is inequivalent to the late time vacuum, then according to Then, according to us, with our late time definition of particle number, it will seem like there are these right-handed neutrinos being radiated from the early universe. It's exactly analogous to Hawking radiation. In Hawking radiation, the black hole is really in one state, but an observer far from the black hole, because space-time is curved, defines a different vacuum state. And so, according to the distant observer, it looks like the black hole is radiating photons. And so, similarly, by And so, similarly, by exactly analogous effect, if this CPT hypothesis is true, the early universe will radiate these right-handed neutrinos in an abundance you can calculate, that we calculate in our 2018 PRL on this topic, where we show that if those right-handed neutrinos are 4.8 times 10 to the ATeV, if that's their mass, then they perfectly account for the observed dark matter abundance and phenomenology. Phenomenology. And so, in other words, we interpret in this approach that the measurement of the dark matter abundance is just a measurement of one of the remaining undetermined parameters in the standard model Lagrangian. And then this idea leads to several testable predictions, one of which is that it turns out to imply this approach that, okay, there's, you know, when you include right-handed neutrinos in the standard model, there are. Include right-handed neutrinos in the standard model, there are six mass eigenstates: three, which are usually thought of as heavy, one of which is now this dark matter, but three that are light, which we directly have observed already. But we've only measured the differences between the masses of those three light neutrinos, not their absolute masses. But if this theory is true, one of those three light neutrinos has to be exactly massless. And so that's something that'll be tested in the coming few years. That'll be tested in the coming few years because, in the coming few years, cosmology experiments like Euclid and DESI will measure the sum of the three light neutrino masses. And so, if the lightest one is massless, you can determine that the sum of the three neutrino masses should either be this 0.06 EV or 0.12 EV, depending on whether the neutrinos are in the normal or inverted hierarchy. So, that's our prediction. If in the coming few years, Euclid and DESI determine that. Euclid and DESI determined that the sum is not equal to one of these two values, that will rule out this model. A little bit more in the future is the neutrinoless double beta decay prediction that also follows from this theory, where again, you get a definite prediction for what the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay should be. And if experiments will eventually measure that rate, and if it doesn't agree with those predictions, then we're ruled out. Out. We also predict that the dark matter should be ultra-cold. So there's, as you may know, there are a lot of other theories of dark matter like axions or which have a fuzzy dark matter character. They have a very long Compton wavelength or warm dark matter. Anyway, so if dark matter turns out to be any of these other things, fuzzy or axion-like or warm, then again, that will rule us out. And finally, And finally, it turns out that the same calculation that allows you to predict the abundance of these right-handed neutrinos also predicts that there should be zero primordial gravitational waves. So primordial gravitational waves haven't been detected yet. Famously in 2014, the BICEP experiment claimed to have detected them, but then that detection went away. But experiments continue to look for primordial gravitational waves in various ways, including through the polarization of the cosmic micro. Through the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. So, if any of those experiments detect primordial gravitational waves, that would rule out this theory. Okay, very good. So to mention another consequence of this idea of this sort of two-sheetedness of space-time, here I've taken this, the previous double cylinder I drew, and I've taken the bottom sheet and sort of folded it around inside the top sheet. Inside the top sheet. So now there are just two adjacent cylinders inside and outside. So now we want to imagine again, we want to take seriously the idea is the idea is to take seriously the symmetry of the universe under reflection through the bang and see where that leads. And so let's imagine that the fields living on this space Imagine that the fields living on this space-time respect that symmetry. So, well, the first thing is that to notice that if you have a field living on the space-time, if you follow its solution back to the bang, you find it's completely analytic at the bang. And so you can analytically extend it around past the bang and onto the inner pre-bang sheet. And then you can relate the analytic extension to. You can relate the analytic extension to the hypothesis that it's related by asymmetry, jumping from the outer sheet to the inner sheet could alternatively be achieved by asymmetry. So compatibility between those two answers forces these fields to obey reflecting boundary conditions down here at the bang. So that turns out to be good. That turns out to agree with observations because it turns out to rule out vector primordial vector perturbations, which we don't observe. Which we don't observe. And it turns out to force the primordial scalar perturbations to be synchronized in exactly the way they're observed to be synchronized. As I mentioned on an earlier slide, the observations are that primordial perturbations are synchronized exactly like they obey a reflecting boundary condition of the bang. And that's responsible for this famous ringing pattern in the cosmic microwave background observations. So here we see. So here we see that that boundary condition follows from the assumed, from taking seriously the symmetry and analyticity of the field equations on this doubled space zone. It's also interesting. It also explains another observed fact about the universe, which is that the observed thermodynamic arrow of time. The observed thermodynamic error of time, the second law of thermodynamics. The observed fact is that entropy seems to have started low at the Big Bang and have been growing ever since as you get further and further from the bang. So why is that? Well, in this approach, we just saw that symmetry plus analyticity imply that the fields obey a reflecting boundary condition down at this boundary. So in other words, they're in a very non-generic state. They're in a very non-generic state. They're forced into a very special region of phase space at the initial Big Bang side of boundary of space-time. On the other hand, if you try to think about how they behave up at the future boundary, the de Sitter boundary, there's no analogous argument. Up here, they have a essential singularity. You can't follow them over. You can't analytically extend around the de Sitter boundary. So there's no corresponding boundary condition at the top. At the top, and so we say it's that difference, that fundamental distinction, which again just follows from symmetry and analyticity, seems to provide a very neat explanation for the observed fact that the entropy increases from bottom to top in this diagram. I've just added a note here for this audience that this two-sheetedness, the fact that we're led to a picture of the universe where there's sort of Led to a picture of the universe where there's sort of two sheets of space-time right next to each other. Sounds an awful lot like the picture in the non-commutative geometry approach to the standard model where space-time may be regarded as having kind of two sheets and the Higgs and the masses of fermions are related to jumping across back and forth between those two sheets. So, yeah, I think it would be very interesting if one could make more of that. One could make more of that. Okay, but moving right along. So, so much for talking about analytically extending along the real-time axis and talking about the entropy of the matter in the space-time. Last fall, we also had a result about, which came from thinking about what happens when you analytically extend the solutions in the imaginary time direction. Extend the solutions in the imaginary time direction or in the complex time plane. And it leads to a new calculation for the, or the first calculation of what the general formula is for the gravitational entropy of a FRW universe. So I just want to briefly describe that result here. So in three steps. So step one in that paper, this was on the archive in October 2022. I forgot to write the reference here, but it's by myself. Forgot to write the reference here, but it's by myself and Neil, and it's from October 2022. So, first in that paper, we just, if you look at the general Friedman equation for a general relative, a realistic universe like the one we know we live in, with just the components that we know are there. So there's radiation density, non-relativistic matter density, a cosmological constant, and then there could have been, given the symmetries of the space-time, there could have also been a spatial curvature component. Been a spatial curvature component. So, this is we obtained the general solution of this equation. We think for the first time, if anyone is aware of an earlier reference, I'd love to hear about it. But in any case, we found the exact solution of this equation. It's given in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Elliptic functions are these beautiful special functions that have the property that when you plot them in the complex plane, they're doubly periodic. So, here I've plotted the real part of this. So here I've plotted the real part of the solution for A of tau and the imaginary part. And what you can see is that it forms a kind of tiling of the complex plane. It's periodic both in the real time direction and in the imaginary time direction. And so if you just look at the solution on a certain square here and just repeat that square like a tiling, you get the full solution on the complex plane. Or in other words, you can just think of the solution as living over the torus obtained. Obtained by identifying the top and bottom and the left and right boundaries of that square with one another. And then the striking thing is that once you notice that, you realize, oh, well, this fact that it's periodic in the imaginary time direction means that it's crying out to have its entropy calculated. This is exactly how Gibbons and Hawking, famously in the 1970s, calculated the entropy of black holes, all the black hole spacetimes, and of Des Hitter space-time. Spacetimes and of desitter spacetime by noticing that the solution to the Einstein equations was periodic in imaginary time. So now we've pointing out that that exact same thing is true now for all realistic FRW cosmologies. And so in exact analogy, by computing the action around one period in the imaginary time direction, you get the semi-classical answer for the entropy of that space-time. And so we get an explicit We get an explicit formula for the gravitational entropy of an FRW universe. Again, it's given in terms of elliptic functions. I refer you to the paper for the actual formula. But so now that you have this formula, you can ask, okay, as I change the cosmological parameters, which universes have the highest entropy according to this formula? And the first striking thing is that it's universes that are spatially flat, i.e. where the spatial curvature is never significant throughout cosmological Significant throughout cosmological history, never contributes significantly to the right-hand side of the Friedman equation, which is like the universe we live in, and where the cosmological constant is tiny and positive. And then we also point out that if you add cosmological perturbations, so far I've just been talking about the FRW calculation, but if you add tiny cosmological perturbations, in general, Perturbations, in general, they can make the entropy go up or go down. But if you say, Oh, no, I'm only going to look at cosmological perturbations that satisfy this mirror-like boundary condition, a reflecting boundary condition at the Big Bang, if the Big Bang is a mirror, then you find, oh, those perturbations only reduce the entropy. So they only, they cost entropy. So, in other words, the small inhomogeneities and anisotropies are Atrophies are suppressed, they cost entropy if the Big Bang is a mirror. So, in short, one gets this formula for the gravitational entropy. And then, interestingly, the entropy that you get is largest for universes like ours that are homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat with a tiny positive cosmological constant. So, we think this is a very promising measure on the space of universes, which leads me. Space of universes, which leads me to another comment for the non-commutative geometers or quantum gravity folks of all stripes, which is just that, you know, so what I've described is a semi-classical calculation that ascribes a finite gravitational entropy to every FRW universe. It would be wonderful to have a microscopic way of counting that entropy, maybe from maybe from non-commutative geometry, maybe. And maybe from non-commutative geometry, maybe non-commutative geometry is the explanation for why that entropy turns out to be finite in the same way that quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle explains why, you know, regulates classical phase space and gives finite entropy to ordinary systems. Anyway, if anybody has an idea about how to derive these, give a more microscopic derivation of this entropy formula, this semi-classical entropy formula, I think that would be really exciting. So finally, So, finally, let me now discuss our approach to explaining the primordial perturbations. So, to explain that, I want to back up for a moment and think about the vial local scale invariance. So, we think of systems as having two different types of symmetries. They could either have global symmetries or local or gauge symmetries. Or local or gauge symmetries, in other words. And those symmetries could either just be classical symmetries or they could be quantum symmetries. But if a classical symmetry might fail to be a symmetry at the quantum level, it could have an anomaly. Normally, we think if you're a global symmetry, no problem. If you have an anomaly, that's fine. We know physically there are examples in nature of global symmetries like that. Nature of global symmetries like that. But for a gauge symmetry, it's normally thought that in order for the theory to make sense, the gauge symmetry has to be anomaly-free. And so here I've stolen a page from Feskin and Schroeder where they show all the different 12 different anomalies that have to independently cancel in the standard model in order for the gauge symmetries to all be anomaly free and in order for the standard model to make. In order for the standard model to make sense, and they do all cancel in the standard model, and some of the cancellations are quite miraculous, as you know, if you've ever done the exercise of calculating any of these diagrams. Okay, so what about vial invariance or local scale invariance? So it's long been emphasized since right after the discovery of GR. It's been emphasized by various people, famously Weil and Dirac. People, famously Weil and Dirac, Dickey in the 1960s, more recently Atuft, many people over the years have emphasized this point or intuition that if general covariance is really a local symmetry of nature, it seems like it's very natural to think that local scale invariance should be two. I mean, after all, local general covariance is basically the statement. General covariance is basically the statement that choice of reference frame is just a choice of how to describe the physics, not anything about the physics per se, and that choice of how to describe the physics, choice of reference frame, is a free local choice. Vial invariance, local scale invariance, is something analogous, but with choice of units. It's just the freedom to describe, use a different meter stick. meter stick with which to measure things. And that seems very analogously like a choice about how to describe the physics, not about physics itself. So what about the standard model? Well, if you ignore the Higgs field, interestingly, the standard model is classically bile invariant, classically locally. Vile invariant, classically locally scale invariant. But famously, that symmetry, that vial symmetry is anomalous. There's this famous formula that was calculated in the 1970s describing this anomaly. So, you know, the trace of the stress-energy tensor should vanish if the symmetry is anomaly-free, but instead it doesn't vanish. It has these two terms, one per Doesn't vanish. It has these two terms: one proportional to the square of the Weyl tensor, one proportional to the Gauss-Bonnet curvature. And the coefficients A and C are these dimensionless coefficients, which depend on the number of ordinary scalar fields, number of spin one half fermions, and number of spin one vector fields. And the coefficients in front, one and eleven halves, and 62 and one and three and twelve, the point is they're all positive. And so, in the standard model, you know, you just, in an ordinary gauge, You just, in an ordinary gauge theory, you just get positive contributions from all these terms. There's no cancellation. So the A and C coefficients are both non-zero, and you get the symmetry is anomalous. Here, I've also just, for use in a moment, mentioned the corresponding formula for the vacuum energy per mode, which also depends on the number of scalar fields, fermion fields, and vector fields. Okay, but now it turns out. But now it turns out that in four dimensions, there's actually two different natural scalar fields you can couple to space-time. There's two different conformally coupled scalar fields. There's the usual Klein-Gordon scalar, but then there's this second possibility, which, to my knowledge, was first studied by Fredkin and Cythan. Or, well, no, actually, it has a longer, it's been studied by many people. But what I really want to say is that the anomaly. Is that the anomaly due to this contributed, the contribution to the anomaly of fields like this, dimensionless scalar fields, was first calculated by Fradkin and Seitland. And they give this extra contribution. So the N0 prime is the number of these new dimension zero scalar fields, dimensionless scalar fields. And what you can see is they contribute now to both anomalies with a minus sign. And you can ask, is Minus sign. And you can ask, is there a number of such scalar fields that I could add that would cancel the conformal anomalies in the standard model? And it turns out that the answer is yes, that if you add 36 of these scalar fields, that, well, at first glance, it seems like the answer is no. At first glance, there's no integer number you can add here that. Can add here to add to the standard model contributions that make A cancel. But if for a moment you get rid of the Higgs field, you imagine the Higgs field is not a fundamental field, but is some sort of composite or emergent field, then you find, oh yes, actually 36 of these scalar fields will exactly cancel the standard model anomaly. But then you're surprised to notice that, wait a minute, the same 36 will also cancel the C anomaly. And wait a minute, the same 36 will also cancel. And wait a minute, the same 36 will also cancel the vacuum energy per mode in the standard model. So there's this very interesting numerological coincidence that if the Higgs field is not really a fundamental field, then 36 of these dimension zero scalar fields will simultaneously exactly cancel the A and C anomalies and the vacuum energy. This turns out to only be possible because the number of fermions in the standard model. Of fermions in the standard model is exactly four times the number of gauge bosons. So the number of fermions is three generations times 16 fermions per generation. And the number of gauge fields is 12 in the standard model. SU3 times SU2 times U1 has 12 dimensions times 4. So such a cancellation would not work for an ordinary theory, but it does work for the standard model. But it does work for the standard model. And very briefly, because I know time is running short and I want to leave a couple of minutes for questions. So, in addition to this numerologically interesting point, a second interesting point is that these dimension zero scalars turn out to have, unlike Klein-Gordon fields, which have a spectrum that's way too blue to explain the perturbations in the early universe. That's why you normally need inflation to stretch them outside the horizon and distort their spectrum. Horizon and distort their spectrum outside the horizon to the observed scale-invariant spectrum. But these dimension zero scalar fields are just automatically scale-invariant. They're scale-invariant in flat space, in the room you're sitting in there, and they're scale-invariant in any FRW background. Moreover, it turns out that they don't introduce any new local degrees of freedom or mediate any new forces. This is very nicely explained in the book on axiomatic QFT, which. The book on axiomatic QFT, which treats this example by Boglyubov and Todorov. And then it was shown in different using BRST analysis by Ravel. And very briefly, so what we think is happening is that these new fields are just basically fixing the vacuum state of the standard model, the coupling of the vacuum and the standard model. They're sort of an extra accounting. They're like fixing an accounting error that was previously being made. Counting error that was previously being made when coupling the standard model vacuum to gravity. So they simultaneously cancel the A and C anomalies, the vacuum energy. They give a vacuum spectrum of vacuum correlations, which agree now with what you see in the early universe. And in this paper from February, we work this out in more detail. And we claim to, although the argument is rough in the paper, I encourage you to look at it, but if you're To look at it, but if you're interested. But what we claim is that we can calculate the primordial curvature perturbations induced by these primordial vacuum correlations, just like you do for inflation, basically, but now with these dimension zero scalar fields. And we claim that if you look back at the Planck time, just outside the horizon at the Planck time, you get this primordial scalar amplitude and tilt. Tilt, these expressions are purely expressed in terms of numbers in the standard model. These are just measured standard model parameters. So there's no free parameters in these or fudge factors in these formulas. So in particular, this is the SU3 gauge coupling. If you plug in the observed SU3 gauge coupling, this value for Ns minus 1 becomes 0.958, which is very close to the value observed by the Planck satellite for the primordial value. Satellite for the primordial value of NS. And if you then use this amplitude, which again is our prediction for the value right outside the horizon at the Planck scale, and you use this slope, this tilt to extrapolate that 30 orders of magnitude, you have to extrapolate a very long way to get to the much larger scale where we actually, where the Planck satellite actually observes the primordial scalar perturbations. perturbations when you do that we get we we get this value 13 plus or minus 4.5 times 10 to the minus 10 which is within two sigma of the of the uh of the observed Planck value so we we we we think it's very striking that we get that close given given what a given what a given what a big extrapolation is being is being made so we we find this very exciting we we increase We increasingly feel that it may be a step in the right direction. And with that, I will stop. Maybe since I think I might be a couple of minutes over. I don't know. Am I a couple minutes over or did I start late? No, you are well into the discussion kind of part of your. Okay, okay. So then I'll just show my summary slide and thank you. Thank you for thank you again. And thank you. Thank you for thank you again. And yeah, there's time for any questions. Thank you, Leiden. Thanks a lot. Okay, questions. Let's start with the questions from the room and then we'll see. Yeah, thanks for a very nice talk. I'm interested to understand a little bit better the neutrino sector. If I understood correctly, you want a right-hand. You want a right-handed neutrino for every generation. Is that strictly necessary? In our approach, it is. So that's the, so that the, so, so indeed, you could have people have, I mean, so if you have two or fewer neutrinos, then you. You then none of them can be stable because that's not compatible with the observed fact about the light neutrino oscillations. But it's completely compatible with everything we know that if there's three, which is kind of the natural expectation, if the neutrinos respect the sort of pattern, the three generation pattern in the standard model. So if there's three, then exactly. three, then exactly one of them can be light. And that then we like that to be the dark matter. But then also, you also need exactly 48 neutrino, you need exactly 48 fermions for this numerological coincidence to happen that I mentioned before, that this simultaneous cancellation of the A and C anomalies in the vacuum energy only happens again because. Energy only happens again because that definitely will not happen for a generic field theory. So it's a striking numerological point that it works for the standard model, but it only works for the standard model with a neutrino in each generation. So that the three generation patterns. And these are sterile neutrinos. They're all sterile in the sense that they follow the pattern in the standard model that the right-handed partner of the Model that the right-handed partner of the left-handed neutrino should be an S should be a singlet under all three gauge groups. Okay, let's continue with another question from the room. Hi, Letam Fawad here. Hi, Fawad. Thanks a lot for the talk. That was a very great talk. So, as you mentioned, under tau going to minus tau, A goes to minus A. Which presumably means that the space-time orientation. Presumably means that the space-time orientation changes. So is that a positive or negative or immaterial? It's actually very, it's a little bit subtle because actually, yeah, what we think really happens is that the tetrad goes to minus itself as you go across. So that, you know, the metric is symmetric under going across, because the metric just depends on A squared. The tetrad flips sign as you go across the bang. Sign as you go across the bang, which is what you might expect would be from CPT because, well, anyway, so so, but but so actually, you know, if you flip all four directions, the four-dimensional space-time orientation doesn't reverse, you know. So the three orientation does, but not the four form. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. But Flawada, I do think there's something very interesting topologically that's going on at the bank. So just to quickly say, I am very struck by the fact that when you couple fermions to gravity, you need to switch from sort of a Riemannian approach to geometry to sort of Cartan's approach. To geometry, to sort of Cartan's approach, where you have, in addition to the ordinary tangent bundle, you have this auxiliary bundle that the tetrad lives in, or that sorry, and really the tetrad is some map between those two bundles. You have these two different vector bundles over space-time. And I think what's going on is something like that they're just wrapped, they have distinct topologically distinct wrappings over space-time. Distinct wrappings over space-time. And so the tetrad E, which maps between them, just cannot be non-singular everywhere because as a consequence of topology. And so I do think there's some very interesting thing to be sorted out about that, but I don't fully understand that yet myself. Okay. Charles, Aden, this is Fedele. Hi, Fedele. I will make two quick comments, then perhaps you and I should have a Perhaps you and I should have a long conversation in the coming weeks. The two comments is the first one about the two-sheeted question you asked. So I feel confessed. Now, really, the two-sheeted structure is the fact that you have the chiral degrees of freedom of the fermions living in one way and one in the other sheet. And one in the other sheet, if you want, and then the connects them. Now, what you're saying is quite fascinating because your behavior is different. The two sheets have two different behavior, and the entropy is sort of the important difference in the two. So, this probably is one should investigate this in terms of violation of CPT or the two chiralities. You know, that the two chiralities they behave in different ways. And this might have also something to do with the big difference in chirality with the neutrinos that are the one that really have different things. So it's probably something rather promising in looking in this direction, but we are not going to do it in with the child. I cannot do it with the chair here. And the second quick comment is the anomalies and Is the anomalies and the vile anomaly and non-competitive geometry? If you start with a theory with fermions in a background and you see you have the while anomaly, then you want to cancel this in the measure in the path integral, then you naturally generate the spectral action with a dilaton. And so this is another thing. And so, this is another thing. I remember that you got, I remember that point. This was work with Andrea, and I, but so, this is another thing that can be an interesting take. But of course, we are not going to do it with the merry looming of me. It's not my fault if you don't have coffee, lunch, and excursion. Then, okay, there is a question from John. So, John, please. Well, thank you, Fideli, for the comment. I mean, I have some things to say, but I, but yeah, let's. I have some things to say, but I, but yeah, let's talk later. I kind of withdrew my question, but I could ask it if you want me to. I'm sorry, I thought that you had a question. I saw that you raised your well, okay. Well, back to the neutrinos, Latham. And by the way, it's nice to see you again. Yes, hi, hi again. Are you saying that one of the right-handed neutrinos doesn't have any, there's a three by three mass mixing matrix in the neutrinos, but you're saying Mixing matrix and the neutrinos, but you're saying one of them doesn't have any mixing coefficients with the other two. Is that what you're saying? So, so you know, the right-handed neutrino appears in two places in the Lagrangian. There's the kind of coupling of left-handed neutrino, right-handed neutrino, left-handed lepton doublet to Higgs and right-handed neutrino. And there's a three by three ukala that appears there. And then there's this other, you can add this Maierana mass term just involving two copies of. Just involving two copies of the truth. So, what I'm saying is that if the Lagrangian is invariant under new right goes to minus new right for just one of the three right-handed neutrinos, if you look at the effect that has on the Lagrangian, it just sets a whole column. It sets the whole column corresponding to that in the dimensionless 3x3 Yukawa matrix, coupling it to the Higgs coupling. It sets one of the columns to zero. Oh, I see. That symmetry simultaneously makes one of the Makes one of the light neutrino states massless and cuts off any coupling between the corresponding heavy neutrino and the Higgs. I see, but there could still be a right-handed Majorana mass mixing matrix, is that right? Exactly. So the three, it's still the case that there's three heavy guys and three light guys. It's just that it's just that this setting that coupling to zero turns out to have the effect of the other. You've got the other power terms for that one neutrino. Exactly. I see. And actually, there's an interesting paper by Astrid Ikorn and Aaron Held about how asymptotic safety might explain why those Yukawas would be, why one of the, well, that is a separate story about why the neutrino Yukawas might be. UCAW is might might be might be driven to zero. Great. That's more. Can I ask a question still? If you do it fast, yes. Yes. So hi, Leighton. Yeah, so this is about the last comment about superconnections. I remember a long time ago, so when this was this double-sheeted model was proposed by Adam, and then there was some work of Steernberg and Niemann. Of Steenberg and Neiman, they use superconnections. So, is that along the same lines? You're thinking exactly. I don't even know what the order was, but I know that Quillen's paper led to these other thoughts about how the superconnection could, you know, the Higgs could just be the off-diagonal part of the superconnection. Yes. Just seems like it would be a kind of nice thing if this sushi. Nice thing if this two-sheeted aspect of the space-time could also then explain. Exactly. Another very naive, sorry, very naive question, perhaps a stupid question, but I ask, as this scale invariance, local scale invariance was proposed by Weil, it was immediately rejected by Einstein, as you know. Yeah. So, but do people take it seriously still? I mean, so that's a very long and interesting story, but yeah. Interesting story, but yeah. So Weil had two different proposals which he made. One was Weyl gravity, which is where you replace the Einstein-Hilbert action by the Weyl tensor squared. That theory has been of continuing interest, but it's definitely ruled, naively ruled out in the sense that classically, the classical equations of motion, every solution of Einstein is a solution of Bayes. Einstein is a solution of Bile, but Bile gravity, the Bach equations, which are the analog of the Einstein equations, include extra solutions, which are not solutions of Einstein and which we don't see any evidence for in the universe. So, but that may be too hasty ruling out of that theory, because then there was a paper by Mel DeSena from about 10 years ago showing that if space-time has a boundary where there's a reflecting boundary. Where there's reflecting boundary conditions, that actually cuts out the unphysical solutions of Weil and only leaves the Einstein solutions. So he was thinking of spatial boundary like an ADS, but I'm interested in whether having this boundary at the bang would play the same role and resurrect it that way. Feil had this other paper, which is the one Einstein wrote the retort or the retort to, which was where you introduce. Retort to which was where you introduce an extra gauge field for scale invariance, just like analogous to the photon. And Einstein pointed out that if that gauge field had a non-zero curvature, then as you carried an atom around a closed loop in space-time, it would come back and its spectrum would appear to have been dilated by an amount given by the enclosed curvature of the vial gauge field. And he said, we don't observe any evidence. And he said, we don't observe any evidence for different hydrogen atoms with different spectra. Now, they didn't know about the Higgs mechanism back then. So, again, that theory has been possibly resurrected, you know, has people have more recently pointed out that if that gauge field is Higgs, then you would not observe the effect that Einstein pointed out. At low energies, it would look like biosymmetry was broken spontaneously. So, but anyway, it's a whole long, interesting story. Yeah, well, thank you very much. Thanks. Yes, thanks for the question. Thank you, Leiden. By the way, if at some point you want to explore or discuss more this relation with the model I told you of Venetian and that model had failed because it was given isocurvator perturbation. So if you want to discuss at some point, I would be glad. Yeah, thank you very much for this interesting talk. Thank you, everybody. For this interesting talk, thank you everybody for the discussion. We have a coffee break. We're back in, let's say, 20 minutes.
