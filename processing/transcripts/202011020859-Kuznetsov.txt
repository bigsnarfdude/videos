It's also a great pleasure to open the Russian day of the conference. So you know that Rina, who is speaking after me, is also from Moscow. And some people think that Lyudmil Katsarkov is also from Russia. And they are almost right. Okay, let me start with my talk. So I will speak about rationality and derived categories of some final three. Derived categories of some final three fields over non-closed fields. Derived categories, or rather, semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories seem to be a useful tool to predict rationality properties and birational properties of algebraic varieties. So far, we cannot really use them for proving. For proving rationality of properties. But I hope we will be able to do this at some moment. So, and anyway, it's still interesting to test this approach in interesting situations. An example of a prediction of this sort is a conjecture about rationality of cubic forfolds. So, if you have a smooth cubic forfold, Smooth cubic forfold, a hypersurface of degree 3 and P5. Then it's a bounded-derived category of coherent shifts, which I will denote by D. It has a simple semi-arthogonal decomposition with three exceptional line bundles and the orthogonal category AX, which is a K three category, which means that its surf antar is the shift by two. So it behaves as the derived category of a K three surface. Of a K3 surface. And the conjecture is saying that a cubic fourfold is rational if and only if this category is equivalent to the derived category of a usual K3 surface, which means that this interesting part of D of X does not only behave like D of S, but really is equivalent to D of S for some S. D of S for some S. Okay, and there is a more general version of this conjecture, which is saying that which can be used for any smooth projective variety, say of dimension n, and it says that if you have a semi-orthogonal decomposition of x. In some sort, a maximum semi-orthogonal decomposition, which means that every component has no further decomposition, so every component is indecomposable. Then the conjecture is saying that x is rational if and only if each component is a semi can be also represented as a semi-orthogonal component of another algebraic variety which has dimension at least by two less than the least by two less than the dimension of x. And of course the reason for this conjecture is, I mean the main reason is the blow-up formula, which tells you that when you blow up a sub-variety, then you have a semi-artogonal decomposition where new components come from the center of the blow up, which definitely has dimension at least by two less than the dimension of the ambient variety. So if you start with a projective space which has a semi-project. The projective space, which has a semi-orthogonal decomposition into several derived categories of a point, and then use, say, weak factorization for your birational isomorphism of your presumably rational variety with this projective space, then the categories that appear during blow-ups all will have this property. Yeah, and components which do not have these properties, the components of the semi-orthogonal decomposition of D of X, which do not have this property, which cannot be embedded into direct categories of varieties of these dimensions, they are called Griffiths components of D of X and one can think of them as of analogs of the Griffiths component of the intermediate Jacobian. Of the intermediate Jacobian of a three-dimensional variety. This is just a categorical version of this Griffiths component. And it is expected that Griffiths components give you a birational invariant of X, but the problem in proving this is the failure of Jordan-Hülder property for semi-artogonal decompositions. So since in the weak factorization, you have also not only blow-ups, but also Blow-ups, but also blowdowns. If you want to prove something of this sort, you need to relate two semi-orthogonal decompositions coming from two blow-up representations of your variety. And if one would have Jordan-Hölder property for semi-orthogonal decompositions, that would be easier. But this property is known to be not to hold for semi-orthogonal decompositions. So it's unclear how. It's unclear how this expectation could be proved in general. But still, it's interesting to look at Griffith's components of interesting algebraic varieties and to see how their appearance is related to rationality properties. So, today I will discuss this question in the situation. This question in the situation when the base field is not algebraically closed. So the main setup is what I will call the Galois setup, which means that the variety I will be interested in will be a final threefold over a field K, which is not algebraically closed but of characteristic zero. Characteristic zero, and I will assume two properties. So, first of all, I will assume that over the algebraic closure k bar, this variety is rational. So, of course, if it is not rational over k bar, it has no chance to be rational over k. So in this case, the question of rationality is not interesting. So, I will assume that xk bar is rational. And also, I will assume that the Picard number. Assume that the Picard number of this variety over the field K is equal to 1. Of course, the Picard number over K bar over the algebraic closure may be higher than 1. And just the two properties, I mean, the rank of the Picard group of X and the rank of the Picard group of XK bar are related by the operation of taking invariant. Operation of taking invariance with respect to the Galois group. And so, if the only invariant element of the Picard group of X K bar is the canonical class, then the Picard rank over K will be 1. And this is the situation which I am interested in. And the second remark that, of course, one could avoid this assumption, this picker-rank assumption, but if Rank assumption, but if you use a minimal model program, then in some sense you can reduce the case of PICR rank greater than 1 to the case of PICR rank 1 or to lower dimensions. You can just run MMP, and at the end, you will either obtain a fun variety of Picar Renk1 or some modifiable space. Of course, there is a grain of salt here because, in general, during MMP, you can arrive at a variety with similarities, but I will ignore this for today. And the question I will be interested in is to find the relation between rationality of such variety and Griffith's components of its generality. Of its gerad category. Can you say maybe one more word about this MMP comment? Like, if I have a Del Pezzo surface with lots of lines on it, somehow I don't have to worry. The question is whether these lines are defined over the base field or not. Yeah, so if, yeah. But you'll ask later. Or, I mean, you'll ask later. Uh, I mean, anyway, this is a general thing, right? If you if you have, um, uh, I mean, you can run an MMP more or less on any variety, right? And in the end of MMP, you will always obtain a Modifiber space, at least if your variety is, say, geometrically rationally connected. Right? So, you will arrive at Mori fiber space, which At modifierspace, which might be a funny variety when the base is just a point, right? Or it is a modifier space, a real modifier space, which means that it is a vibration with fibers, funny varieties of smaller dimension. So in some sense, you can reduce either to lower dimensions or to Picard number one. I mean, the the the the the situation with Tilpets' surfaces um With Tir Petsy surfaces, I don't think it has something special about it. All right, thank you. Okay, and there is another story which is quite similar to the Galois story, which I will also want to discuss. And I call this equivariant setup. When instead of a variety over a non-closed field, you can consider a variety over Consider a variety of an algebraically closed field, but with a finite group action. So X is called a G final variety if X is a final variety and G is a finite group which acts on X faithfully. So that means that if you forget the group action, this is just a final variety. And yeah. But you can also consider a group action. And we will. And we will say that such a variety is g-rational if there is a g-equivariant by rational isomorphism between x and the projective space for some faithful action of g on this projective space. So you don't specify the action in advance. I mean, for any such action, if you have a birational isomorphism, we will say. Isomorphism, we will say that x is a G-rational variety. And the equivariant setup is when X is a G-fana threefold over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. And there are two properties which are analogous to the two properties from the previous slide. So first of all, x should be rational. So if we f um forget the group action, the variety should be rational. Action: The variety should be rational. This is analogous to being rational over the algebraic closure of your field. And the second property is that the equivariant Picard rank of the G Picard rank of X, which means that is one, which means that the rank of G invariants in the Picard group is one. And clearly, the G action in this setup is analogous to the Galois group action. The Galova group action Galova setup. And the question in this setup I am interested in is to find a relation between G rationality of X and Griffith's components of the equivalent derived category of X, which is the same as the derived category of the quotient stack of X by this group G. And there is yet another setup which is. Yet, another setup which is more general than the two previous setups, which I would also like to discuss. So, in this general setup, X is not a variety over a field, but this is a smooth family of funeral varieties over some connected base. And the two assumptions from the previous slides in this case say that first. Say that first for any geometric point of the base, the corresponding geometric fiber of x is rational, and the relative Picard number for this family of one varieties is one. And the question in this setup is to find the relation between rationality of x over s and relative graphics components of s linear semi-artogonal decompositions of d of x. D of X. And clearly, if you consider this general setup for S being the spectrum of a non-closed field, this is equivalent to the Galois setup, just because in this case, S has essentially a unique geometric point, which is just a spec of K bar, and the corresponding geometric fiber is just X K bar, and so the first condition becomes. The first condition becomes the condition of rationality of xk bar, and the second condition becomes the condition of the Picard number over K being 1. And similarly, if you take S to be the quotient stack of the point by the group G, the stack BG, then in this case, the situation reduces to the equivariant setting. Again, in this case, there is essentially. There is essentially a unique geometric point, which is just the point, and the corresponding geometric fiber is just the same variety x with the when you forget the G action and the relative Picard number becomes the equivalent Picard number of X. So the situation is precisely the same as in the equivariant setting. and setting. So in some sense, this question in the general setup generalizes both situations from previous slides. And of course it is natural to discuss this general setting. Okay, so let me go to the Go to the rationality results which we know. So I will for this rationality results, I will restrict to the Galois setting when I mean these results are best known. So if you remember in the Galois setup, we assumed that the Picar. Galoiseth, we assume that the Picard number of X over K is one, but its Picard number over K bar can be higher than one. But of course, the situation when the Picard number over K bar is also one is also important and rationality criteria for final three fields with this additional property were discussed and established. Uh, discussed and uh established uh in my paper with uh Europrokharov, and uh here is a link. Um, so it was uh it appeared in the archive a year ago. Okay, so there are eight deformation types of Fana three fields over an algebraically closed field with geometric Picard number one. These eight types are the following. So A types are the following. So the first is the projective space, of course. Then the next one is the quadric. And I mean most of the varieties that will appear in this list are complete intersections in some homogeneous varieties. So I will use this notation as for the quadratic. So first I will write down the homogeneous. Write down the homogeneous variety P form in the case of a quadric and then the equivariant vector bundle whose zero locus gives you the variety you are interested in. So in the case of quadric, of a quadric, it can be represented as the zero locus of a section of the line bundle O of 2, 1P4. So this is the So, this is the second Pana threefold. The next one is usually called V4. So, it's P5 with the vector bundle O of 2 plus O of 2, which means that we consider a complete intersection of two quadratics in V5. So, this is also known as a quartic Del Petsa threefold. The next one is V5, which is a linear section of Grassmannian two five of podimension three. Of podimension 3. The next one is X12, which is defined as a linear section of podimension 7 in the connected component of the orthogonal Grassmanian of five-dimensional subspaces in a 10-dimensional vector space endowed with a non-degenerate quadratic form. So this isotropic Rasmanian has two kinds. Isotropic Rasmanian has two connected components which are abstractly isomorphic. So, we can take one of them and take a linear section of codimension 7 with respect to the spinner embedding. So, this will be fina threefold, prime final threefold of degree 12. So, I will use notation x12 for it. The next one, you take Lagrangian-Grassmanian 3.6 and the linear section of codimension 3. Of codimension 3. So this time we consider this Lagrangian-Grasmanian with respect to a symplectic form in a six-dimensional vector space. The next one is called X18. So you take what is called the adjoint Rasmanian of algebraic group of type G2. It can be realized as a certain sub-variety. As a certain sub-variety of Grasmanian 2.7, so this is the reason for the annotation G2 Grassmannian 2.7. This is a nice five-dimensional homogeneous variety, and then you take a linear section of codimension 2. And the last one is X22. So here, instead of direct sums of line bundles, as in all the previous examples, you consider a more complicated vector bundle. Complicated vector bundle. So you start with Grassmannian 3.7. U denotes the tautological rank 3 vector bundle on this Grassmanian. So U check is its dual vector bundle. You take its second fetch power and take the direct sum of three copies of this. This is a vector bundle of rank 9 and you take the zero locus of a general section of this vector bundle. Section of this vector bundle, and this is X22. Okay, so these are eight types of Fanner threefolds such that their geometric Picard number is one. I mean, these are threefolds over K bar, their Picard number is one, and all of them are rational, are known to be rational. And so, if X is a finite threefold such that X K bar is rational, and its become K-bar is rational and its picker number over K-bar is one, then X is a k form of one of these final threefolds. Are there any questions so far? So you said that these are the eight types up to deformation. So but you're in these families. I mean, you're just saying deforming in these families? Yeah. Besides the infection. Precisely. In fact, in these eight types, three varieties are rigid. So P3, Q3, and V5 do not deform over K bar, but all other families have non-trivial deformation families. Yeah, but you can take any variety in this deformation family and take its K-form. Okay, now. Uh okay. Now uh uh what is uh what are the rationality criteria for these varieties that we established uh with Prokhorov. So the first case is the case of V5 that was the linear section of Grassmannian 25 of codimension three and in this case the result is very nice so it tells you that if if you consider a k form of V5 Consider a k form of v5, then it is always rational. You don't need to impose any kind of conditions. So, for instance, any variety of this type has a k point. On the one hand, this result may seem surprising because that's quite rare when you consider a variety and it is rational, it is always rational. But on the other hand, in fact, this result. Hand, in fact, this result is just the analog of the Enrique's theorem, which tells you that a Del Pets surface of degree 5 is rational by any field. This is just the higher dimensional analog of this theorem. And the connection between these two is just if you consider a hyperplane section of V5, this is a Del Petsa surface of degree φ. And in fact, this is how you prove this. So that's the first situation, which is nice. Situation which is nicest of all eight types. The next best situation happens for the four varieties from the list, which are P3, Q3, X12 and X22. And in these four cases, you can check that such a form of one of these varieties is rational over K if and only if the corresponding And don't leave, the corresponding variety has a K-point. Of course, this is very classical for the projective space and for the quadric. And in fact, it is not very hard for the other two varieties. But yeah, in some sense, to prove this, you need to consider some birational transformations. And the most important here is the Is the Sarkisov link that starts with the blow up of a K-point. If the point is general enough, it takes you to the variety V5 in the case of X12 or to the projective space P3 in the case of X22 with a rational K-point, with a K-point. So if your original K-point on X is general enough, this gives you a proof of rationality. Enough, this gives you a proof of rationality. And if the point is not general, then you first need to do something similar to prove unirationality of this variety over k. And then as soon as you have a proof that this variety is unirational, then you can apply this trick to a general point on X. So this is what happens for these four types of variables. For these four types of variety of these funna three fields. But the most interesting is the situation with the last three types. So if you have a variety which is either V4, an intersection of two quadrics, or X18 or X16, so in one of these three types, the rationality criterion is the following. So first of all, if you want your variety to be rational, of course, you need to have a Of course, you need to have a k-point on this variety. But this turns out not to be enough. And to ensure that the variety is rational, you need to impose one more condition, which is one of the following three conditions, depending on the case. So, in the case of V4, you need to consider the Hilbert scheme of lines. F1 of X is the Hilbert scheme of lines on X. Hilbert scheme of lines on X, and you need to assume that this scheme has a K-point, or equivalently, that X, your funny variety of type before, has a line defined over the base field. So if this holds, then the variety is rational. And this is if and only if condition. Similarly, for the variety of type X18, 18 The condition of the existence of a line is replaced by the condition of the existence of a conic. f2 of x is the Hilbert scheme of conics on x. And the criterion for rationality becomes the existence of a point and a conic on x. And finally, in the case of x16, you just need to assume the existence of a cubic curve on x. So F3 of X is the Hilbert scheme of rational cubic curves. Hilbert scheme of rational qubit curves on X. So it doesn't have to have points. Sorry? The conic doesn't have to be a P1. No, no, no. No, no, no. It doesn't matter. You just need a conic defined over the base field. It also doesn't matter whether this conic is smooth or it is a union of two lines or even if it is a double line, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The only important thing is that this Hilbert scheme has a K-point. In fact, in this statement, this is kind of hidden, but in fact, what you can check is that over the algebraic closure of your field over K-bar, these Hilbert schemes are isomorphic to the intermediate Jacobians of these varieties. And the existence of a point over K means that the corresponding torsors over the intermediate Jacobian are trivial. And I mean, the geometry of the corresponding curve is completely irrelevant here. I mean, of course, when you prove that the existence of a curve implies rationality, when you prove that the curve is curve, implies rationality when you prove this direction of the theorem you will have to consider different cases but if you want to prove that this condition is necessary for rationality you just prove that the corresponding torsor is trivial yeah and one more point of this theorem is that in all these cases you see that they exist You see that the existence of a point is one of necessary conditions of rationality. In fact, in all these cases, it implies unirationality of this variety. This is not directly related to the questions that I am discussing, but this is useful observation. Okay, so this is what is known about the case when the geometric Picard number is one. Picard number is one. Yeah, so Fd of X is the notation for the Gilbert scheme. Okay, what about a higher Picard number, higher geometric Picard number? So in this case, there are six types of Fana three fields which are rational over K bar and which have Picard number over K equal to one and geometric Picard number greater than one. Greater than one. These three faults are the following. So again, I am writing what happens over K bar. So one possibility is just P1 times P1 times P1. Also, you can take P2 times P2 and a divisor of by degree 1, 1 inside. So this is also known as the flag variety of a three-dimensional vector space. The next one. The next one, you take the product of four copies of P1 and a divisor of multi-degree 1111. The next one is more complicated. You take P2 times P2 times P2 and take intersection of three divisors of multi-degree 110, 101, and 011. Also, you can take P3 times P3 and P1. P3 times P3 and a linear section of codimension 3 with respect to the Sigray embedding. And finally, the last variety, it's a bit more complicated to describe. So you take a three-dimensional quadric, Q1, you take a degree 4 rational curve inside Q1, and you take its blow-up. And then you can notice that this. And then you can notice that this blow up can be also realized as the blow up of another three-dimensional quadric in another rational quartic curve. Basically, to transfer from one decomposition to another, you just need to apply the quadratic Cremona transformation with respect to the curve C1. So if you take the rational map from the blow-up of C1, From the blow-up of C1 inside Q1, given by quadrics passing through C1, this will give you a morphism to another P4, and this morphism will be the second blow-up representation of this variety. So, yeah, and another way to represent this variety is the following. So, instead of a rational quartet curve in P4, you can consider the You can consider the Veronese surface in P5. Then, there is also a Fimona transformation which identifies the blow-up of P5 with center at this Veranese surface with the blow-up of the dual P5 with center in the dual Veranese. And then if you take a linear section of this five-dimensional variety with respect to the direct sum of The direct sum of line bundles O 01 and O10, this will be precisely this threefold. So there are six types and I will use notation x111, x22, x11111, and so on for these varieties. So the subscripts correspond to the dimension. To the dimensions of the projective spaces in the ambient variety. For instance, X1111 sits inside the product of four copies of P1, and X44 sits in the product of two copies of P4. Is that clear? Hello. Hello. Yeah. Ah, good. Thanks. Okay. And we also have some rationality criteria for these three faults. I mean, this part of the story is not yet published. We are writing this down and it is a bit incomplete, but let me tell you what we. Me tell you what we already know. So, first of all, four out of six types that I listed have the same more or less standard rationality criterion. So, in the four cases, to ensure that the variety is rational, the only thing you need to impose is the existence of a k-point. Okay, so this is pretty analogous to the case of. Analogous to the case of P3, Q3, X12, and X22. But in another case, the situation is completely different from what we considered before. So what we can prove is that the variety of type X33 is never rational. So let me remind that this variety is just a linear section of codimension 3 of P3 type. dimension 3 of p3 times p3. I mean this is how it looks over k bar. And when I say that it is never rational, it means that as soon as the picar number over k of this variety is 1, it is not rational. So this is a new feature of the story. You can ask what happens for the remaining variety. Here we don't have a complete result. We expect that this Result. We expect that this variety is also never rational, similarly to the case of X33, but we cannot prove this in a complete generality, but we have some partial results about this variety. So to explain these results, I will need to introduce this notation. So we can consider the Golo group action on the Picard lattice of XK bar. XK bar. So this action definitely permutes the standard generators of this PCR group, which correspond to pullbacks of point classes from the P1 factors of the ambient variety. So that means that the action factors through the permutation group S4 and I will denote by Gx. And I will denote by gx the image of the Golova group in S4. And then the condition that the Picard number over K of this variety is equal to 1 means that this is a transitive subgroup of S4. And it is well known that there are precisely five types of transitive subgroups of S4, and these groups are S4, the symmetric group. Then if Symmetric group, then A for the alternating group, then D for the dihedral group, D for the Klein group, and C for the cytric group of order form. And the first thing that we can prove is the following. So, first of all, in four out of five cases, if the group GX is one of these four groups, so then a very general variety. Then, a very general variety of this type with a k-point is not stably rational. And to prove this, we use a degeneration technique. In fact, you can consider a toric degeneration of this variety, and even this toric variety is not stably rational. This is an old result, which was known already to Known already to Chevalier. Okay, so this is the first thing, and similarly, as I explained, you can also consider the equivariant situation. And in the equivalent situation, there is an analog of all these results. And in the equivalent situation, we can prove that if the group G is S4 or Group G is S4 or A4, then any G-fana variety of this type is not girational. And these two results, of course, they don't prove the conjecture, but they provide some evidence that the conjecture might be true. And also, we will see other evidence from the description of the derived categories from further slides. Okay, before going to direct categories, let me tell you what Griffiths components over a base. So recall from the definition of a Griffiths component in the relative situation that this is just an S-linear admissible subcategory in D, and it is not a Griffiths component if it can be represented as an admissible subcategory. As an admissible subcategory, as an S-linear admissible subcategory of some d of y, where y is another variety over s. And in the threefold case, when x is a threefold, then y should be a curve or a zero-dimensional scheme over s. So to make this more explicit, let me assume that y is connected. Recall that the base scheme S is also assumed to be connected. I will also assume that Y is flat over S. Assume that y is flat over s and then in two situations when the dimension of y over s is zero or one and so when it is zero dimensional or a curve and when this is a curve I will also assume that its genus is positive. In these cases one can check that d of y has no s linear semi-orthogonal decompositions and therefore s linear admissible subcategories of linear admissible subcategories of such, d of y will be just d of y itself. And in the last case, when the dimension, the relative dimension is one and the genus is zero, we can consider the stein factorization for the morphism from y to s. It will be a composition of a p1 vibration with a finite morphism. And in this case, there is more or less unique semi-orthogonal decomposition for g of y, which has two components. Which has two components, one is d of t and another is d of t, beta, where beta is the corresponding flutors power class. This semi-orthogonal decomposition was proved by Marcello Bernardara. Okay, so altogether this means that non-Griefitz components in the relative setting that there are three types of non-Griefitz components. First of all, these are categories of the Categories of the form D of T, where T is a finite scheme over S. The second type is D of T, beta, where beta is a two torsion plus. And let me stress that you don't consider arbitrary Brouwer class, but only two torsion Brouwer class here. And the last type is the derived category of some smooth curve of positive genus. Okay. Okay, so let me explain the description of the derived categories. Can I just ask? S allowed to be BG, for example, here? Yes, yes, it doesn't matter. So S can be any stack or any volume of it stack. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So let X be a f. So let X be a family of smooth one and three fields such that the geometric fibers are rational and the Picard number of geometric fibers equals one, which means these relative versions of the first eight types of finite trifles that I discussed. Then the derived categories have the following S-linear semi-orthogonal decomposition. S-linear semi-artogonal decompositions. So, in the first case, in the easiest case of V5, there is a semi-artogonal decomposition with four components equivalent to D. Next come the next four varieties, P3, Q3, X12, and X22, and they have the following semartogonal decompositions. So, for the case of P3, there is again a semartogonal decomposition. Constructed by Marcello. Here, a four-torsion power class appears that corresponds to this P3 vibration over S. And the components are just twisted derived categories of S by the powers of this power class. And the underlying components are Griffiths components for this semantogenal decomposition. So when B4 is four torsion but not two torsion, then this is a Griffiths component. While B4 squared is a two torsion class, so it is not a Griffiths component. For the quadric, again, there are three copies of D of S and one copy of a twisted direct category. And again, the corresponding power class is. The corresponding power class is a photorshound class and it gives you a green component. In the case of X12, there are two components equivalent to D and one component equivalent to the derived category of a genus 7 curve over S. And for X22, there are three components equivalent to D of S and one to the twisted derived category of S by a two torsion power class. And in the last And in the last three, sorry, can I interrupt you? Can you remind us what S is? Is it a non-algebraically closed field, or it can be something else of positive dimension? For this theorem, this is just arbitrary. S is arbitrary. This is an arbitrary connected scheme. Yes, yes. I mean, maybe you need to impose some finiteness conditions. Conditions. I mean, maybe I would prefer it to be Newtarian and probably always, but I mean, essentially, it doesn't matter because as you see, all these semi-orthogonal decompositions are S-linear, so you can always base change from one scheme to another. So, I mean, also, I should say that this is not yet written down. Not yet written down, so maybe when I will write this down, I will have to impose some restrictions, but morally this should hold true for any base TMS. Okay, and in the last three cases, in the most interesting three cases, the semartogonal decompositions are as follows. Again, there is D of S, maybe D of S, B to 2. Maybe D of S, D 2. But there is also a new type of components which are derived categories of some curves over S with power classes on these curves. So which are four torsion, three torsion, and two torsion power classes in the three cases. So these are the descriptions of the derived categories in this case, and one can also And one can also consider the other six types of varieties. So, here the relative Picard number is one, but the Picard number of the geometric fibers is higher than one, and I will denote it by R. And there is a monotromy representation of the fundamental group of the base in the automorphisms of the Picard group of geometric fiber. Of a geometric fiber, which again factors through permutation groups, and the corresponding morphism from pi zero of s to this permutation group gives you an etal cover of your base scheme of degree r, which I will denote by s r and it will appear in semarthogonal decompositions. So, and the semarthogonal decompositions are the following. So, in the first case, you have a semarthological A semi-orthogonal decomposition where two components are twisted derived categories of S and two components are twisted derived categories of the corresponding degree 3 covering of X11. In the next case, two three torsion power classes appear. In the next case, In the next case, there is one two torsion power class, in the next case, again. But in the last two cases, X33 and X1111, again a new type of semorthogonal component appears. So in the first case, it is an interesting category, which over an algebraically closed field looks like a semi-orthogonal. Looks like a semi-orthogonal gluing of the derived category of a genus 3 curve and derived category of a field. But over S or over non-algebraically closed field, this category does not have a decomposition of this sort. The exceptional object which corresponds to the second component of this decomposition is not invariant under the Galois group action. So the Galois group So the Galois group takes it to a completely different exceptional object, and so which is not semi-orthogonal to it, so you cannot split it off. And similarly, for the second case, you have the general category of a genus 1 curve and 3 exceptional objects. Okay, I guess I have just one. I guess I have just one minute left, so let me rush through the rest of my slides. So, what I want to explain next is what happens when you also assume that there is a rational section for your family of smooth one-three fields. So, in this case, this assumption, the assumption of the existence of a rational section, allows you to kill most of the Brower classes appearing. So, for instance, for the Is appearing. So, for instance, for the P3 case, the four torsion plus becomes one, for the quadric, the four torsion plus becomes two torsion. And so this is how derived categories, how semi-togenyal decompositions simplify. And for V4 case, the four-torsion class on the curve becomes a two-torsion class. Plus, while for the cases x18 and x16, in fact, nothing changes. But if you also assume that the corresponding Hilbert schemes of lines, conics, and cubics, these relative Hilbert schemes have a rational section, then these extra Brauer classes also disappear. And with them, all the Griffiths components in this semi-orthogonal decompositions disappear. These same orthogonal decompositions disappear. And also, you can ask what happens when a rational section exists for the other cases. And again, you can see that in two cases, the power classes disappear, but these final categories don't change actually. And so the conjecture that one can make Can make on the base of all these observations is the following. And here I will restrict to the Golova setup to the case of a smooth projective threefold over a non-closed field of characteristic zero. So assume that xk bar is rational and x has a k point. So in some sense, the point of all my talk is that when you don't impose the existence of a point, the simortopinal decompositions Decompositions behave quite chaologically. But if you impose the existence of a point, then they simplify significantly and you see better behavior. So under this assumption, the conjecture is that X is rational if and only if it has non-crefix components, which means that there is a semi-orthogonal decomposition in which every component has one. Which every component has one of three types. Either this is a derived category of an extension, of a finite extension of your base field, or it is a twisted category of such an extension with a two-torsion power class, or it is a derived category of a smooth curve of positive gigmas. That's it. Thanks for attention, and sorry for being for you. For us is more time than expected. So maybe we can write thank you to Sasha in chat. Do we have any questions? Sasha, in your family results just now, there were no singular fibers, right? It was all smooth fibers. Fibers, right? It was all smooth fibers, yeah. Yeah, all fibers were assumed to be smooth, yeah. I mean, in some of the cases, sometimes you can, I mean, for some degenerations, in fact, the same can be proved, just for some degenerations, these etal covers will become ramified covers, but the semarthogonal decomposition will be just the same. Just the same, but you need to, you know, I mean, I'm not sure I know how to define intrinsically the corresponding each example would be a new paper, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, Sasha, you were asked, can you go back a slide, please? Um, yeah, just one slide or more? I believe so. Yeah, one more. One more slide? This was asked by Hasset. So all I know is that he wants you to go back a slide from the chat. It would be great if you could let us linger over your conjecture for a moment. Thanks. That's it. Yeah. Actually, I can send my slides to anyone interested. If you want, you can send them to me, and I can also post them on Zulup if you're okay with. them on Zulu if you're okay with that or or yeah sure I will I will do it right after the talk yeah maybe I should say here about this conjecture that a similar result was proved by Matt Ballard and collaborators for Tauric varieties but with a strong assumption so they considered So they considered only semi-orthogonal decompositions where every component is equivalent to d of k, no field extensions, nothing of a more complicated sort. And in this case, in arbitrary dimension, they prove that the variety, the corresponding toric variety is rational. Sasha, can I ask you something? Maybe I missed the punchline, but do you have a proof of that? Line, but so do you have a proof of that for you know for funo three faults of Picard number one? Or uh, sorry, do you have a proof of that for funo three faults of Picard number one? Like we pro the proof of what of this conjecture, yeah, like from the classification that you showed on the Yes, I think in this case, yeah, for the eight types of pan and threefolds of geometric Picard number one, yes. But this is not a conceptual proof, this is just a case-by-case analysis. You just compare the semi-orthogonal decompositions that you know to rationality criteria that we proved with Procrov. Yeah. Yes, I thought but just to kind of thanks for asking. Other questions? Okay, well, let's so, Sasha, there's many, many. I encourage you to read the chat. There's many, many, many thank yous in there. And also, thank you. Thank you. So, okay, but maybe we should take a few minutes' break and then just a couple minutes and then we'll continue. Okay, thanks.
