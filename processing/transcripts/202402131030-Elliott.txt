I slightly more than 10 minutes to change in the program, so I thought I would start with some pictures here of the Rocky Mountains. As Daya mentioned, I'm from Simon Fraser University, which is in Burnaby, the other side of the Rocky Mountains. And here are photos of the Rocky Mountains, although some of them have been generated by the articles. By the artificial intelligence. So, we have this activity find the fakes. So, I'm going to go through each of these images, and you all are going to vote. And you can vote more than once. So, each time we get to an image, put up your hand if you think it's fake. And again, you can put up your hand multiple times for multiple images. And hopefully, we'll get the fake ones with most votes, but let's see. And also, we could check on. Also, we could check on the Zoom chat. So, people on Zoom, when I get to the number, you can just type the number in chat. Okay, so can you ask how many fake pictures? So, some of these pictures are that's part of the challenge, right? By fake, do you mean generated by fake? Generated by large language model style image generation AI service that has emerged over the past couple of years using deep. Can you move to some people? Give us a hint of what kind of model you use to generate that. So two things. Okay, so who thinks image number one is fake? So two votes. And who thinks image number two is fake? Probably it's fake. Yep. Well, folks, who thinks image number three is fake? Image number three is faith. Who thinks image number four is fake? Who thinks image number five is fake? One, two, three, four, five. Excellent six is fake. Thinks image number seven is fake. Is there anyone from in chat? Oh, tell us all I see, that's why you were saying to share the screen, but if they see by video, I'll technically use one of them. Oh, so they cannot currently see the video. Oh, so they cannot currently see the video. Oh, I regret that. I'm not sure if I can share this. Okay, so I guess we should go to reveal the first. I guess I'll rank these rank. Okay, so 25 12. So the first was from MidJourney. So I made this doing using a style transfer of a real aerial photo. The second The second is real. It's a photo from the Penn State Library Archive. The third is from ChatGPT, so ChatGPT's image GPT. So I sent ChatGPT many real photos and said, make a photo like this. And they all looked very fantastic and really smooth. And I kept on saying, make it more photorealistic. And then it would add like an Aurora Borealis in so eventually. So eventually I just said, make a photo using all the photos in this chat. And then it came out with this left out of button. This was made by Midjourney. So Midjourney has a gallery of what, I guess people can vote on images and then the best images appear in this gallery. So I searched the gallery for a grant and so saw them. This is from the Library of Congress. This is from the Library of Congress. And this is also from Mid Journey. So I iterated a bit on this, and adding the mist really made it look real. And then last one's from Henn State University Libraries Photography Archive. So I guess how did we do? So one was fake. Fake three three three or three seven. Yeah, I think I got GPT right. So GBT one two three three point five. So we so the first one we got. So we so the first one we got, like the chat GT was easy. Second one we didn't get, third one we didn't get. Fourth one we got. So, but like among the top three that we voted were fake, one was fake, the top one. So I guess this is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So one conclusion is mid-journey is better than Mid-Journey is better than ChatGPT, but another conclusion is it's actually very difficult. TBD and 4. TBD 3.5. Oh, yeah. So ChatGPT. So this was made with ChatGPT through a conversation. Chat GPT 3.5 does not allow image. So it must be 4.0. Yeah, yes. Well, I also believe the quality of the image depends on the input. You mentioned the first one is through the image editing, the input to the image. It wasn't an image. It wasn't an image. So, interestingly, it wasn't an image, it wasn't editing an image. So, South Hands for MidJourney, if you just put in a, if you put in this mountain and then ask for a prompt that has nothing to do with mountains, then you might get an aerial photo and things might be, like people might be wearing white clothes. So, the style transfer is not the same as actually editing the image. But I totally take your point. This one is. Is um different well three was a style three was closer to what you're speaking of with editing because I presented the image to chat GPT and pulled it to make something similar so so which is more intense than a solid transfer you can ask TPT to give you better quality imagery against that yeah with chat GPT if you do that like it tends to sort of emphasize the um The archetypal aspects. But so I think I might have gone over the amount of extra time I had a lot of critics. So I will go on to my talk. So the title of my talk is Teaching Machine Learning Using Data for Good. And I've organized a lot of hackathons in the past five years. I've organized two big hackathons with logistics and prizes, most recently in collaboration with United Way BC. But in addition to that, I've organized around 10 case studies for Case studies for an under fourth-year undergrad course that I teach. So I was glad to see that our previous speaker, Bing Yu, is also setting case studies for a class. I think it's an excellent opportunity for students. So when I set case studies, I try to do different topics each time and always trying to make something that's relevant and potentially. And potentially doing data science for good. And I think that's one of the draws of doing a hackathon. So hackathons have a benefit to students. They can get more training. They can get portfolio pieces. So there's benefit to the organizer. So there's often some sort of knowledge transfer. So the organizer can see a new method for doing something. A new method for redoing something. But there's also the opportunity to benefit the public comments, which I would define as the cultural and natural resources that we share as a nation or as a globe. And hackathons were popularized by the Netflix Challenge, which really exemplifies some of the benefits that hackathons have. Hacking of arms have, for example, this was the origin of collaborative filtering and also one of the first big applications of deep learning in the University of Toronto group led by Judge Hinton. And this research led to about 10 years of probabilistic matrix factorization. Dominating the recommendation in industry for e-commerce. Around this time, Kaggle started. So here's a Wayback Machine version of Kaggle from Parney 10. So here, interestingly, it says Kaggle is a platform. So how many of you know Kaggle? How many of you know Kagle? So, on Kaggle, you can post a hacking call. And here in 2010, Kagle says: Kagle is a platform for data prediction competition that allows organizers to post their data and have it scrutinized by the world's best data scientists. So, here on the landing page for Kagle, it's basically saying we can do something like consulting. So, as a company, you can come to us and we'll get the best data scientists to look at your data. So, this Your data. So, this leads to hackathons like this. So, this hackathon is from 2017, hosted on Kago. The Salt Identification Challenge. Several areas of Earth with large accumulations of oil and gas also have huge deposits of salt above them. So, in this hackathon, we examine sort of an imaging of the ground above an oil reserve. Of the ground above an oil reserve to determine if there's salt. The problem with salt is it makes it hard to drill. So, this hackathon is challenging because we can imagine there was a $100,000 prize for this hackathon. So, it's challenging because we can imagine if a group of trainees solves this, then what they produce is certainly worth a lot more than $100,000. And we might ask, why would they? Why would they give their code to this company, TGS, which is an oil consulting agency? Why should they give their code to them rather than just make this themselves? And furthermore, why make this when the result is further exploitation of fossil fuel resources? So, the question is: sometimes hackathons are exploitative and And we can view a hackathon as labor. In the previous case, it seemed to be labor that was not being compensated at its real value. So, is it fair to have training studio hackathons? Because from the description of this conference, in addition to being accurate, trustworthy machine learning must also be fair. So, are hackathons fair? This is my question. On the other hand, hackathons do provide value. Hackathons do provide valuable training and marketing opportunities. So, to sort of synthesize the potential exploitative nature of hackathons with the benefit to the student, I imagine a synthesis where we can promote these hackathons that benefit the public good. So, now my question is: to what extent are hackathons already benefiting the public good? So, I examined three years of cable competitions, and this, I only And this, I only looked at competitions with more than $5,000 prize. And of these, I had to drop 11. And this led me to a sample size of 114 hackathons. And I categorized them into three groups. Good benefits the commons. Neutral doesn't exactly benefit the commons, but there's not very obvious externality. For example, it's not like just benefiting an. It's not like just benefiting an oil company, and then the third goes other, just not fitting in those categories. So, examples, uh, good. So, we have a lot of health-related hackathons and sponsored TensorFlow to help detect the great area read. And for neutral, there was a lot of games, so people can set. So people can set a game as a hackathon and there, it seems sort of like a fun thing like, or I guess DEF CON, this hacking convention is now putting their events on Kaggle. So it was sort of unclear what, for some things, it's sort of unclear if it's good for other. Neutral was definitely a hard category to classify. So other, we have crypto. So, other we have crypto and identifying the position of a smartphone in a shopping mall. So, this is a hackathon trainees are invited to work on. So, I looked at motivation by prize. And we see, so here I have the log prize in USD. And for a million-dollar prize, at the time I did this work a month ago. At the time I did this work a month ago, this was the highest valued hackathon. This highest valued hackathon was to resurrect an ancient library from the ashes of a volcano, detect ink from X-ray scans in a Roman town close to Pompeii. So this is definitely supporting the public common slash public good. So it's interesting that was the highest paid one. And we do see a bit. Take one, and we do see a bit of a trend here. So, with a p-value of 0.03, we see a positive correlation between the number of participants in the hackathon and the prize. And I did this because in the future, I'll look at an adjust. So I wanted to adjust the involvement in hackathon by price to decorrelate the good, bad, or good, other neutral axis from the price. The price. But I'll just skip straight to the result. After doing some analysis, I found there was actually no difference in, no evidence of difference between participation in good versus neutral or others. So Chinese are participating in, are not preferentially looking at corporate hackathons that are not. That are not benefiting the commons and public good. And also, no evidence that good hackathons are happening at a lower or greater rate than neutral or other. So surprisingly, about half the hackathons in Kegel involve data for good, even when corporations were involved. So I was really surprised by this, and I thought this shows that the state of data for good is actually very good. We see, we also see like many, many programs. See, like many corporations. TextorPro, for example, is a product of DeepMind, which is a subsidiary of Google. So we essentially have a Google-funded hackathon on sort of a really specific climate change question. So at least on Kaggle, I'm seeing that an effort to bring trainees towards hack laws that promote the commons and the public good is. Promote the commons and the public good is indeed underway. So we can keep on doing that. So thank you so much.
