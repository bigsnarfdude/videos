Yes. So this work was motivated by this observation that certain types of genes seem to be overrepresented on plasmids. So here, for example, I'm showing you data on the percentage of DNA on the chromosome versus the plasmid that codes for antibiotic resistance. Of course, there's lots of caveats about how the plasmids and chromosomes that end up in these databases are. Chromosomes that end up in these databases are sampled. But it seems that there is this trend that certain types of genes are overrepresented on plasmids. So these include antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, heavy metal tolerance, and bacterios insistence. So there's been quite a bit of theoretical work on this question previously, and unlike the sort of two talks that we've heard previously, the focus really. Heard previously, the focus really has been on single or low copy number plasmids. So, kind of in this world of low copy number plasmids, the essential key difference between being on the plasmid and being on the chromosome is that if a gene is on the chromosome, it's more stably inherited because you might lose the plasmid during replication. But on the other hand, the plasmid is able to do, the plasmid is conjugative, so it's able to do this horizontal. So, it's able to do this horizontal gene transfer, so it can be regained. And so, a lot of the previous work on this subject has really focused on this sort of trade-off, like when is it beneficial? So, when does it matter for the gene to have sort of low segregation loss versus the ability to transfer horizontally? And so, sort of the summary of this bulk of previous theory. Theory has been that for genes that are essential, they tend to be on the chromosome because if you lose them, it's a catastrophe. Whereas genes where there seems to be a benefit to being horizontally transferred will be on the chromosome. So these include functions like public goods, the idea being that you can enforce cooperation if the gene is on the plasmid, so you don't get cheated. Traits which are Traits which are locally beneficial. The idea being that if there's a locally beneficial trait on a plasmid and you get immigrants into that population that don't have the trait, then the trait can be rapidly transferred to these incoming strands if it's on the plasmid. And also, through a similar logic for intermittently beneficial genes. So, if the selection for the trait is fluctuating, the idea is that it can. Fluctuating, the idea is that it can prologate faster in periods of positive selection if it's on the plasmid. But for historical reasons that I'll talk about in a bit, this bulk of theory has assumed that you only have one questionable copy of the plasmid. So you only see plasmids with the trait of interest. Whereas it's also perfectly possible. Whereas it's also perfectly possible to imagine a scenario where you have a version of the plasmid which has the same kind of backbone but that doesn't have the trait of interest. And that changes the dynamic because having this plasmid without the trait would then plug acquisition of the plasmid with the trait. And this is something that we call incompatibility. And so if we go back and And so, if we go back and think about these sort of explanations we had for why certain genes are on the plasmid, they kind of rely on this idea that if the gene is on the plasmid, then not having the plasmid and not having the gene means that you are susceptible to acquiring the gene. So for example, with the public goods explanation, the idea was that we're enforcing cooperation, we're stopping cheaters by having a trait. By having a trait on the plasmid, but if we're then now able to have a version of the plasmid without the trait, you can be a cheater by having this gene-free plasmid. And similarly for the locally beneficial explanation, well, if the incoming genes, incoming, sorry, strains, cells already carry a version of the plasmid without the trait, then they're not susceptible to receiving the trait on the plasmid. Receiving the trait on the plasmid. And so, this was what motivated the work that we did here. This need to sort of consider a competing version of the plasmid in thinking about which trait ends up on the plasmid versus the common zone. Oh, and so the reason why we think it's important to think about the existence of this trait-free plasmid was that, so historically, there was this idea that plasmids are two. That lasmids are too costly and not transmissible enough to exist without beneficial drugs. So then it makes sense to have this idea that, well, you don't need to consider the trait-free plasmid because it's just not going to exist. But then more recently, there's been a lot of experimental evidence suggesting that actually plasmids are transbiscal enough and not so costly that they can exist as your parasites. And then also, there's just a lot of genomic evidence. Also, there's just a lot of genomic evidence where we see the same plasmid backbone with lots of different gene content. So, there is clearly kind of the scenario where the competing gene-free plasmid exist is not implausible. So, now I'm going to switch into instead of talking about gene-free and gene-carrying, I'm going to be talking about antibiotic resistance specifically. But nothing about this wouldn't generalize. But nothing about this wouldn't generalize to genes with the same properties. So we're thinking of a model of six different cell types. So all the cells have a chromosome and the chromosome can either be resistant, here marked with an R, or sensitive if it doesn't have the resistance gene. And then the genes, all the cells can either have a resistant plasmid, no plasmid. Resistant plasmid, no plasmid, of course. And then we do a fairly standard model of plasmid transmission. So the cells replicate and die in a density-dependent manner. So it's a constrained population size. The plasmid is transmitted in a mass action-type kinetic, and it can be lost during. And it can be lost during replication through segregation loss. In addition, for the cells that have no copy of resistance, there's an additional death rate that comes from antibiotic exposure. In addition, we assume that carrying the plasmid, whether it has a resistance gene or not, has a cost that just comes from the plasmid backbone. Having the resistance gene on the chromosome has a cost, and having the resistance gene on the plasmid has a cost. And so here, for now, I'm going to be relaxing these assumptions later, but for now, we're assuming that both the cost and the effect of the gene is identical, whether it's on the plasmid or on the chromosome. And if you carry both copies of the perceived gene, you don't. Copies of the Penc Gene, you don't get any extra benefit, but you're having to pay the cost plus. In the results that I'm going to show you, the cost is modelled through a decrease in replication rate, but it doesn't matter how you do that. It's all robust. And so, what we're interested in is this question of which form of resistance is evolutionary stable. So, what I mean by that is if this form of resistance has a If this form of resistance has established in the population, can a competing form of resistance invade? So, for example, here, the green population is evolutionary stable, and here it's not evolutionary stable. So, here I'm showing a parameter sweep from this model, where on the x-axis, I'm looking at antibiotic pressure. I'm looking at antibiotic pressure. So, this is the antibiotic associated death rate of the sensitive cells. And on the y-axis, I'm looking at the cost of antibiotic resistance. So, you have this white space where the cost is too high compared to the sort of benefit from being resistance, so you don't get any resistance at all. And then, in this coloured space, we get resistance. So, in this tiny blue area, resistance is always plasmid born. Plasmid part, that's sensitive to like how I structured the model, and it's this tiny area, so I'm not going to be focusing on that. So, the bits that I'm going to be focusing on is this orange area, where only chromosomal resistance is evolutionary staple. So, chromosomal resistance can always invade plasma-important resistance. And then you have this pink area of bi-stability. Pink area of bicepility where you can get either chromosomal resistance or plasmid-borne resistance, but not both. And if we do this sort of parameter sweep for multiple parameters in the model, I'm not going to go into detail, but kind of as an overall summary, you get this effect where resistance is always chromosomal when Always chromosomal when the benefit of resistance is high, which is reminiscent of this idea that very beneficial genes are on the chromosome because losing them by segregation is very bad. And then when the plasmid fitness is high or the cell density is high, so you get a lot of plasmid transmission, then you end up in this area of bicepility. Chromosomal with the sensitive plasmid versus chromosomal with the plasma. Plasmid versus chromatol plasmid. Best carryosensitive plasmid versus no plasmid because to me into a plasma cell. Any kind of hood? Yes, for the cell. So then it just depends on the transmission rate of the plasmid. So yeah, so in the parameter space where you get the sensitive plasmid, the plasmid is parasitic because it has a high consistency rate, it's able to persist. So in this So, in this area of bicepility, where resistance can either be chromosomal or plasmid-work, sort of which of these two equilibria you end up at depends on where you're starting. So, looking into this in a bit more detail, here I'm taking one spot in this parameter space and looking at different starting conditions. So, I'm starting with a mix of plasmid-borne and Of plasmid-borne and chromosomal resistance. And so on the x-axis, I'm increasing the amount of the sensitive plasmid in the sensitivity population. And here on the y-axis, which is really what I'm going to be focusing on, I'm changing the ratio of chromosomal to plasmid-borne resistant in the resistant population. And so the thing that I want you to take from this is just that as I increase. Is just that as I increase the initial starting population of plasmid-borne resistance, I increase the range of certain conditions in which I end up with plasmid-borne resistance. So in other words, we have this positive frequency dependence on gene location. And so the intuition for why this happens. For why this happens comes from the fact that these dually resist, that the cells that have both forms of resistance have a lower fitness than the ones that have a single type of resistance. So if you think about it, if you have, say, a chromosomally resistant cell that is trying to invade a population where resistance is plasmid-poor, it's going to acquire this resistance plasmid, giving rise to this dually resistant. Resistant cell, which then has lower fitness. So that forms a barrier for this low-frequency form of resistance to increase in frequency. And you can make a similar argument the other way around as well. So in other words, the positive frequency dependence arises because any form of resistance in this scenario that This scenario that is going to increase in low frequency. Once you have the two types of resistance in your population, because there's this conjugative transmission process, you're going to end up generating these cells which both forms of resistance. And those cells will represent a larger proportion of the total population with the lower overall frequency. So these dually resistant forms are worse for the low frequency. Worse for the low frequency form, which is why you get this positive frequency dependence. And we find that this presence of positive frequency dependence is super robust. So it's robust to the kind of details of how specifically I choose to structure this model. It's robust to allowing transmission of the gene between the chromosome and the plasmid. Between the chromosome and the plasmid, and it's robust to having fluctuating selection instead of a constant antibiotic pressure. And then coming to the sort of stronger assumptions that we make, it's also robust largely to relaxing this assumption that the dually resistant cells get no extra benefit and have to pay the cost twice. So, as long as these dually resistant cells are not, As long as these dually resistant cells are less fit than the singly resistant cells, you get this positive frequency dependence. So it doesn't need to be that they pay twice the cost. And finally, it's also robust to some extent to relaxing this assumption that resistance on the plasmid is exactly the same as resistance on the chromosome. So you still, if you relax that effect, you still get positive frequency dependence selection, but if Frequency dependent selection, but if the fitness difference between the two forms of resistance is very high, then that's going to dominate. But if it's not too high, then you can end up in a situation where you end up with the less fit form of resistance if you start with it, even if you introduce the better form of resistance. So then going back to our initial question of like why are certain types of genes like resistance genes with plasmids? Like resistance genes on plasmids. This kind of raises the possible explanation of: well, they are on plasmids because they are more likely to arrive on plasmids. So if we look at the difference in horizontal transfer of chromosomal versus plasmid porn genes, these rates are difficult to estimate, but the estimates that I found tend to estimate that they are considerably higher for plasmid. Higher for plasmid-borne genes. So the idea is that, well, because of this positive frequency dependence, you kind of get stuck with whichever form you get first. There is a whiff of circularity around this argument because, like, okay, they get transferred faster, but also because it's a mass action kinetic, they're also more transferred if the population, if the plasmid-borne resistance population. If the plasmid-borne resistance population is high, they're also going to be transferred more on the plasmid than on the chromosome. So, to get around that certificate, we do another model. Now, I have learned from experience that if I try to introduce this model in detail, the audience loses the will to live at this point in the moment. But so, very briefly, this is a simulation where we're simulating the whole process of resistance acquisition. Of resistance acquisition in a set of populations. So each of these circles represents a species or a population where resistance can be either acquired de novo and it's acquired much faster de novo on the chromosome than on the plasmid, or it can be transferred between populations or species and that's happening faster on the plasmid. And then we go from this state of everything all populations being sensitive to all populations being resistant. Sensitive to all populations being resistant. And so the results from this model is indeed that the relative rate of acquisition determines the gene location. And then what was really interesting is that, to me, but in retrospects makes a lot of sense, the higher the number of species or populations, the higher the importance of the horizontal gene transfer rate compared. Gene transfer rate compared to the de novo rate because the more combinations you have, the more opportunities you have for transfer between them. So to summarize, in the case where having both forms, plasmid-borne and chromosomal form of a gene then is not beneficial, you get this positive frequency independence effect. Frequency independence effect. And for moderately beneficial genes, this means that gene location is determined by acquisition rate because you're in this bistable parameter space. And so the hypothesis that this leads us to is that resistance genes are on plasmids because they kind of fulfill this criteria of being moderately. Of being moderately beneficial. So the idea is that they're very beneficial while there's antibiotics around, but because they're not always exposed to antibiotics on average, they are moderately beneficial. They're rarely acquired de novo, and they're shared between multiple species, which does seem to be the case for resistance. So with that, I leave you with this graphical summary. With this graphical summary, and I would like to thank collaborators as well as the organizers of this workshop. Next question, that was a really lovely talk. Thanks. Can you speculate on the impact and the models of having multicopy plasmids as well? Because you mentioned that's something else that's being left out of the theory historically. Can you introduce to this? Can you introduce to the specific two types of classmates? What if you have one type of multiple copies that we've gone through? Yeah, so that's a great question. So there's been some really interesting work, I believe also by people in this room, on this question for multiple of the plasmids. And then, so there's multiple changes to this. One of them is that you get these kind of genetic dominance effects that then play a role, I think. Play a role. I think Rafael will be able to tell you more about that. But then, also, obviously, kind of in terms of the assumptions that we make in this model, like once you start thinking about multi-copyplasmids, then this assumption that the effect of the gene is relatively similar on the plasmid and the chromosome becomes a little bit more difficult, I think, to sort of justify for multicopene plasmids. Did you look at how like the, so you have this bio stability, did you look at how you, if you varied sort of the life history parameters, that it would change sort of the patient of attraction for each of the two outcomes and compare that to empirical results? By life history count as you've been sort of conjugation rate and yeah, so that's what we did in In here? Okay. So, yeah, like the essence of that was: yeah, like, so the more beneficial you are, the more you get this large space of chromosomal only. But then the thinner the plasmid is, the larger the biscuitable parameter space is. We didn't compare it to any empirical results. We are, well, Daniel Langst is in the process of developing. Is in the process of developing a system where we might be able to test some of this. So that would be great. But I wasn't aware of any data that exists that we could use to look at that. But if anyone knows, that would be interesting. There's one question online. If you'd like to just speak up. I have a question. Your face diagrams are just Phase diagrams and the status correctly show long-term outcomes, so long-term equilibria. But I'm wondering what your transients look like and especially what their time scales are, because there's also this idea that some genes on classmates are just still on their way to the chromosomes. And so, if I look at an actual natural system, how likely is it that I'm not actually? Is it that I'm not actually observing a steady state? I'm just looking at a long-lasting transient. You don't think about that based on the models? Yeah, that's a great question and not something that I thought about too much when I was doing this. So I can't give you a very good answer other than that it's a really interesting thing and we should look at that. And then, yeah, like I, the only thing that I remember is that the The only thing that I remember is that the time that it takes to get to this equilibrium is very variable. So, yeah, like it is true that in some species of this parameter space, we might well be kind of actually, like in nature, we wouldn't be going towards this equilibrium. But yeah, I think that's definitely would be an interesting thing to think about. Thanks. Thank you. And next for you organized, by the way, for giving you some class primal for discussions. Follow up on that, so did you consider a situation where you could fructuate pressure by the drug? Because then there will be an extra probability to have the data. Yes, yeah. So we're really interested in that and I did a little bit of that. So the broad answer is that, yeah, so having the fluctuation sort of introduces the space where Introduces the space where it's only plasmid-born. So it's clearly like fluctuating selection does introduce a benefit to being on the plasmid, but also that it's very complicated because it really depends on the amplitude, on the frequency, and even the phase of fluctuation. So it's a really difficult question to address. Maybe in the multi-species condo, it might be robust. If you say that there's intermittent If you say that there's intermittent selection on the species, then you basically dissolve eggs. Say that again? Maybe if you do intermittent selection in the multi-species version of the model and you say, you know, different species are occasionally exposed to the antibodies, then you kind of get a simulated immediately and they drives you from the one by stable. From the one by stable feet always to the highest one. Yeah, interesting. So, what I'm not quite getting the intuition of why that would drive you towards being on the plasmid in the multi-species model specifically? Oh, it just guarantees that you always have a higher rate of acquisition. Because if you get by stability, right, so some have the plasmid, some have the plasma, some don't, right? And now you're a new. Slum dog, right? And now you're a new species that gets exposed to the antibiotic. There's going to be some out there that have the plasmid, so you have a high rate of acquisition of the plasmid because there's some substantial effects that happen. So when we, you know, you always get the new ones requiring the plasmid. Yeah, yeah, okay, I see what you mean. Yeah. Yes, I think I agree, but I would want to like check. Yeah, but yeah. Time received. Time for team.
