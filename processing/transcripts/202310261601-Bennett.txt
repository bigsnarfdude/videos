Yes, so hello everyone. My name is Daniel Bennett. I'm a postdoc in the Caxiers group at Harvard University. And so Tim Caxiers was supposed to be here this week and was supposed to give a talk about our recent work. But he unfortunately became unwell right before the workshop. So I'm going to do my best to fill in. And I will just say that Tim did come up with this provocative title. So if you have any problems with that, you can direct them at him. Direct them at him. So, yeah, we've seen over the last week a lot of many interesting theories and learned a lot about the interesting properties of Moray materials. And as Alan said in the first talk, the BM model and related theoretical models get things 95% right. So our group is interested in looking at more A-materials from an Avenicio perspective to see if we can get that last 5%. To see if we can get that last five percent and you know understand whether or not it actually matters. So, before I get onto the main topic of this talk, I just want to give a quick overview on what our group is interested in. So, obviously, understanding the electronic structure properties of graphene and more materials has been a big theme of the group for the last few years, but we're also interested in response properties of more materials. Response properties are more immaterial, so like phonons, electron-phonon coupling. I'm interested in ferroelectricity and electromechanical properties of 2D systems, a little bit of topology as well. And lately we're also incorporating some machine learning methods into our work. So, you know, parametrizing some force fields for dynamics and trying to solve some Hubbard like models for with neural networks to see if we can avoid doing exact diagonalization. Doing exact diagonalization. So, yeah, the rest of this talk is going to be focused on graphene. And since it's the last talk, I don't need to give much of an introduction. You know, we've learned a lot about twisted bilayer graphene and more immaterials in general this week. So, you know, all of these interesting and exotic properties that you can engineer in stacks of layered materials just by taking a few layers and twisting them or straining them. And, you know, these interesting properties are manifested by this. Interesting properties are manifested by this more ais superlattice, so these beautiful interference patterns we see here. So, you know, like the catalyst for a lot of this, there was a big discovery in 2018 where if you take bilarographene and twist to this magic angle of 1.05 degrees, that you can see superconductivity near half filling. So, I'm not going to get into too much about this, but I do just want to make About this, but I do just want to make a few simple observations which will be relevant for the rest of the talk. So here we have the conductance as a function of filling or carrier density. And the first simple thing we can observe is that these low energy bands seem to be gapped from the neighbouring bands. Another thing that is quite clear initially is that this plot is not symmetric about charge neutrality. Symmetric about charge neutrality. So there doesn't seem to be some particle hole symmetry there. And the last thing that I want to point out is that: okay, down here we have the resistance as a function of carrier density and temperature. And here we have these superconducting domes at the magic angle of 1.05 degrees. But superconductivity was also observed in this sample here at 1.16 degrees. So, you know, this will become later in the talk when we'll discuss where the magic is. Discuss where the magic is. So, what's the starting point from the theoretical perspective? Okay, so we take two rigid layers of graphene and twist them, we get this beautiful Moray super lattice, and there are three distinct types of regions here, right? So, we have this AA stacking, which forms a triangular lattice, and we know that from Ab initio that this stacking is energetically unfavorable, but it's pinned in by the geometry, so it's stuck. So it's stuck. Then we have these AB and BA domains where the atoms in opposite sub-lattices are aligned and the other ones are aligned with the carbon rings. And we know that this is the energetically favorable stacking in graphite, and the two of these domains form a honeycomb lattice. And then lastly, we have these blue lines, these domain walls, which separate the AB and VA domains and connect the AA stacking sites. So the domain walls actually form a Kagome lattice, and they're also Form a Kagome lattice and they're also energetically unfavourable, but they're kind of stuck in there by the geometry. And these domain walls have an interesting symmetry property where if you mirror the bilayer and make a non-symorphic translation by half a unit cell diagonal, they get mapped into themselves. And that leads to some interesting real space topology when the sublattosymetry is broken. So, like in HVN and TMDs, but I don't know if it leads to anything interesting in graph. Anything interesting in graphene. Yeah. So, you know, if we look at a single layer of graphene from an avenuial perspective, we can get this well-known band structure. So here are the pi bands, which are coming from the PZ orbitals of the carbon atoms. So, you know, we have this linear dispersion about K, and we have these Dirac cones with the K and K prime points at charge neutrality. So then, you know, looking at the density of states, there's zero density of states at the Dirac cone. Zero density of states in the Dirac cone, and we have some neighboring van hove singularities where the bands become flat. And so, you know, moving on to twisted bilayer graphene, the simplest thing, or it's not very simple, but the simplest and most elegant description of twisted bilar graphene is coming from the BM model. So we have the two Dirac Hamiltonians on the diagonals, so the 4x4 Hamiltonian. Of a 4x4 Hamiltonian, one each for the two layers of graphene. And then we have some interlayer hopping between them, which is smooth and spatially modulated due to the local changes in the stacking in a more super lattice. And so, you know, there were some big implications from this model, namely the prediction of these magic angles where these bands near charge neutrality become flat and the Fermi velocity is going to zero. And this model predicts. And this model predicted the magic angle, amazingly close to what was seen in an experiment. And without being too pedantic now, I want to bring up the last 5%. So there are a few things we can notice about the ideal BM model that doesn't quite line up with experimental observations. So the first one is that the bands are very particle hole symmetric, which wasn't seen in this measurement of conductance with carrier density. Conductance with carrier density. Another thing is that these bands are not gapped from the neighbouring bands, and we saw in the experimental measurements that they were. So now the goal is to think about this last 5% and see if we can resolve these differences with ab initio methods. So I'm just going to quickly explain what I mean by ab initio and DFT in terms. And DFT, in case there are any mathematicians here who've heard that phrase a lot during the week and are too afraid to ask at this point. But usually, what most people mean when they say abenitio methods is that they use density functional theory to obtain the electronic structure of a crystal or a solid by using the electronic charge density rather than the ground state wave function. So DFD is an exact theory that says there's a mapping from the wave. That says there's a mapping from the wave function to the charge density for the ground state. So you go from 3n coordinates to 3-coordinates. And in theory, it's exact, but in practice, we have to make some approximations to deal with the exchange correlation energies. We have to introduce some pseudo-potentials to treat the nuclei and the electrons. And that can be a bit crude for some theorists, but usually it gives a good description of the low-energy properties of solids. Low energy properties of solids, and it could be a good starting point for going beyond single-particle physics. Now, the thing about density functional theory is it scales with the number of electronic orbitals cubed. So, you know, small systems like a few layers of commensor graphene are easy, but it quickly becomes very difficult to simulate large systems. Although, not impossible. So, here are some full DFT measurements of the bands in graphene at the well, 1.08 degrees. 1.08 degrees, so very close to the magic angle. And below here is the time that in core hours that this took, so over 3 million core hours. So this was done by a group in Italy, I think. Some very nice calculations, very expensive. So apparently it took over 5,000 cores running for 30 days to get these bands, and there were only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7k points or something like this. So very impressive, but not very. Impressive, but not very detailed, unfortunately. So I'm showing next to these bands the hierarchy of. Yeah? Because this is one supercell is about 10,000 pathways. Yeah, right. And they do a self-consistent calculation on how many unit cells, more than three unit cells. One. One. Just one. So just a thousand others. I think so. I think I'm not 100% sure. I need to read the paper in detail, but they may have done the relaxation, but I can't remember. But we did that in the summer. It's actually not that expensive. Each one, I mean, if you just 10,000 atoms or so, you should be able to finish with a couple of thousand cores. You should be able to finish within an hour or something. Yeah, if you just do that. And then the rest, of course, you need to do the non-self-consistent copy. Yeah, I'm not so sure. Yeah, I'm not so sure. I mean, so these calculations were done in a code called BASP, which uses a plane wave basis. And this scales cubically with the number of atoms. If you use something with a local basis, you can use linear scaling methods, and that will really let you easily get to 10,000 atoms. So I think they maybe did it in the most inefficient way possible. But this is like the first DFT calculation I know of TBG. It might have been done again. I know a group in. Have been done again. I know a group in Spain did it in the last few years and did relaxation and everything, but I'm not aware of the whole thing, you know, any others. But if you know of any other calculations, please do let me know. We did the CSTA. You did CST, yeah. I think that's the best way to do it. That's a whole thing of pops. I shouldn't be posting it. Yeah, so you're probably using linear scaling methods. Cubic scaling. This cubic. It's just a number of bases possible. Yeah. But the cubic scale. Yeah. But uh the it's still quicker with with uh with the local basis, yeah. Um it's still large, it's not that that crazy. Those do or do not include relaxation. Relaxation is a separate thing, right? Oh, yeah. So this is the thing I can't remember. So I was looking at the paper during the week. I can't remember whether or not they actually did the relaxation, but I mean if it apparently isn't that bad, then maybe they did do the relaxation and that's why it took 30 days with 5,000 cores. Days with 5,000 cores. I feel like they probably did just because there was a gap at gamma. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That would kind of like, if not, they would probably get something like this, right? That's what I was worried about. Yeah. So I don't know if they relaxed first and then did the DFT or they got it, you know, the relaxation with the DFT. Yeah, they might have done this or MD or something and then passed it to DFT. Anyway, it's not easy. It might not be as difficult as this nowadays if you know what. Be as difficult as this nowadays if you know what you're doing, but uh, this is kind of one of the first DFT calculations. But next to it, I'm showing some hierarchy of methods that you can also use to get the bands, you know, and they're becoming successively faster. But all of these are based on ab initio methods, which were done in the group. So I'll describe them one by one. But I just want to say first that the way we get around these very large calculations is using this really nice idea of configuration space. So if you look at a Moray superlattice like this, you can imagine it's divided up into a number of primitive cells of graphene. If you look in each primitive cell of graphene and look at the displacement between the top layer and the bottom layer in each cell, each one of those displacements is Each one of those displacements is bounded, but you know, it's contained within a primitive cell of graphene. And if you take all of those displacements, you can map them into a single space, which is the primitive cell of graphene. And this is what's known as configuration space. So every point in here will tell you how the layers are shifted at a point in real space. So, you know, for a commensurate twist angle, this space will be a set of points. But if you take an incommensurate twist angle, you have some continuum limit, and then this space becomes. Limit and then this space becomes connected. I don't know what the mathematical term for that would be, but connected is probably fine, right? So really nice. This was kind of, I guess, stumbled upon independently by a few in the community and then formulated mathematically by the group of Mitch as configuration space. So, the really nice thing about configuration space, and this is kind of what allows us to do ab initio methods, is we have a very nice Issio methods is we have a very nice approximation. So for small angles, we can approximate the local stacking in one cell as a commensurate bilayer plus the shift. So essentially what you do is you say, okay, if this twist angle is very small, I can neglect the local changes in the environment and then describe this, the local properties in that cell with this system here, which is periodic and only has four atoms instead of 10. Four atoms instead of 10,000 atoms. So basically, what that means is for small angles, you can take two layers of graphene aligned, slide one layer over the other, at every point, you know, calculate the local properties, and then use this inverse mapping to parametrize a model in real space. So this is what was done for this ab initio type binding model. So essentially, this was done by Shang, who was a PhD student, a former PhD student in the group. Student in the group. So, what he did was he took a commensurate bilayer of graphene and he calculated these localized Vannier functions. So, they're localized in real space, so it's perfectly suited to this method. So, he projects onto the Pz orbitals in graphene, which are giving you these Diracones, and he calculates the interlayer hoppings between them. And parameterizes these hoppings as a Those hoppings, these hoppings as a function of sliding one layer over the other, and then uses them to build a real space type binding model, but built up from many ab initial models. And it's not just the in-plane displacements that are taken into account here. Also, the out-of-plane displacements are taken into account for a small amount of displacement about some equilibrium value. So, in principle, you could take this tight binding model and put in a non-equilibrium structure and still get the bands. Structure and still get the band structure. And so this was the first blue bands next to the DFT bands, and they gave a great description of the bands, you know, in a fraction of the time. But it was still, you know, 70 core hours is probably a bit too much for most personal computers. I don't know, maybe these Apple M1 chips are a lot better, but I use Linux, so it's too much for me. So, you know, the goal from here is to, you know, go beyond this. You know, go beyond this and come up with an even quicker model which still exactly reproduces the results from the abenitiotype binding. So, you know, this is where the group developed this exact K dot P continuum model, and maybe that's a bit provocative as well. But it's exact in the sense that it reproduces the tight binding bands exactly. So this is an extension of the BM model. Extension of the BM model to account for, you know, which was designed to kind of reproduce the more realistic pipe binding bands. So we have these Dirac Hamiltonians for the two layers of graphene. This A is like a pseudo-gauge field which has all of the information about the relaxation. And then you can have this on-site potential here, which can be used to impose an external field or break the sub-lattosymmetry if you. Or break the sublattosymmetry if you want to do HVN instead of graphene. This T is the spatially modulated Hopling, which is calculated in configuration space. And then we have these extra terms here. So these are momentum-dependent interlayer terms. And these are required to capture the particle hole asymmetry. And I must confess, I don't know a whole lot about these terms, so they're described in this paper by So they're described in this paper by Shang and everyone else. So it was actually never published. I think they wrote the paper, it got caught by some reviewer and they just forgot about it. But they're described in this paper here. But I think it's the first correction to the hoppings being non-local. And yeah, I would also like to say that in the last year or so, this continuum model approach has been redone more elegantly by Oscar Wafek and some others. So yeah, this is maybe a little bit. So, yeah, this is maybe a little bit old machinery at this point. But you can see that the agreement with these tight binding bands is perfect across a range of twist angles and in only a fraction of the time. You still need around 500 bands or so to get this good description near the charge neutrality, which is a lot. So, you know, you can think again, okay, why don't I make a simpler model to reproduce these bands? So it's really like a kaleidoscope. These bands. So it's really like a kaleidoscope of going down and down and having fewer bands. So, you know, here's some results projecting onto just 10 bands near the Fermi level. They do an okay job, but not perfect of reproducing the bands, and it gets worse as a function of twist angle. So I just want to quickly talk about the lattice relaxation. So, you know, here's a subsection of A subsection of twisted graphene with two rigid layers. And you can see that these large AA domains and these small ABBA domains. Which is unusual because the AA domains are energetically unfavorable and the ABBA domains are energetically favorable. And we're changing kind of smoothly from one to the other, which is not really in line with the experimental observations of these very sharp domains. So, you know, we can account for the effects of lattice relaxation. If we allow all of the atoms to move a little bit, they will rearrange in order to maximize the area of these low energy domains and minimize the area of the higher energy domains. So, this was done here. It's been done by many, but this is just one example from Zhang and Tadmore, who did this with a multi-scale method. So, a little bit different. Multi-scale method, so a little bit different from the configuration space approach. But what they find, you know, what everyone finds is that for small angles, these ABBA domains become larger and the domain walls and AA sites become quite narrow, and we get this sharp triangular domain structure. And so, another thing they found in their simulations is that if you allow the atoms to relax further, there's an additional local further twisting of the AA sites and untwisting. Of the AA sites and untwisting of the AB domains to make them even more uniform. So, you know, practically how we do this with the configuration space method is you write down some total energy as a function of a displacement field, which allows the atoms to move around a little bit. So we have the interlayer energy, which is the van der Waals energy between the two layers, which is stacking dependent. We can measure it from DFT, and we have the intra-layer energy, which And we have the intralayer energy, which is like the elastic penalty of deforming the lattice. So the U displacement field, which minimizes this energy, tells you where the atoms want to go. So if you do this for a graphene, which was done by Stephen Carr and the group of Midge, you can see that in configuration space, the atoms want to move towards the AB and BA domains, because these are lowest in energy. So after relaxation, in real space, we see that these sharp. Space: We see that these sharp triangular domains form. And in MOS2, which is honeycomb lattice, we can see that for small angles, this sharp hexagonal domain structure forms. And these are much more in line with what's seen experimentally. So now we have a more realistic description of the bands. We can take a look at that 5% again, and we see that, okay, when we include this effect of relaxation. Relaxation, then this gap opens, and then we get these isolated flat bands, which is more in line with what we've seen experimentally. So, the whole point is that this lattice relaxation is really crucial for getting these isolated flat bands. It's a very important feature of magic angle graphing. We can also make a few other observations about what happens when you include the last 5%. So, one of the most striking things is that in the BM model, we have Is that, you know, in the BM model, we have all these magic angles. When you include lattice relaxation, all of them go away, except the first one, or the last one, whichever. The one that you see experimentally. This is the only one that remains after the relaxation is taken into account. And also, you know, the particle hole symmetry of the BM model also goes away. So, you know, the bands can become quite asymmetric. So they're actually very asymmetric. So, they're actually very asymmetric here. But one more thing that was noticed, so this was found in 2019, is that if you look at the Fermi velocity, after taking into account relaxation, it actually never goes to zero. So, it reaches a minimum. It's the dashed black line here. It reaches a minimum and then grows again. So, you know, in that case, if the Fermi velocity isn't zero, how do you define? The Fermi velocity isn't zero. How do you define the magic angle? I mean, okay, maybe the Fermi velocity is just a proxy for the bands being flat, and you can say, okay, the minimum Fermi velocity is the magic angle. It doesn't have to be zero. But, you know, we proposed that, or rather, Shang and Stephen proposed in 2019 that the magic angle is not a single angle, but actually a range. So it's a range of angles where, you know, three things happen. So the Fermi velocity. Things happen. So the Fermi velocity becomes minimized. The width of the flat bands, which is this blue curve, also becomes minimized. So they're becoming flat, but not perfectly flat. And the gap to the neighboring bands becomes maximized. So we don't have a magic angle. It's a magic range. And this is actually in line with the original experimental observations. So they saw superconductivity in two devices at two very slightly different twist angles. Two very slightly different twist angles. So I don't know if this is like widely known by the community or if it even matters, but yeah? By the range, you mean they don't coincide at one point. Yes, yeah. So you see this green box here? We're saying this is like this is where the magic happens, I guess, is the point. But you know, this was found in 2019. I don't know how many people knew about it, but I think we kind of like rediscovered it this year, and this motivated us. And you know, this motivated us to kind of understand what's really happening with the electronic bands near this magic range. So, we kind of came back to this problem of graphene and we took this continuum model and we looked at a very fine sampling in this magic range. So, here are some results. So, here I have an animation of the, these are the flat bands as a function of twist angle going down. So, we're going from 1.1 to 0.85 in steps of 0.8. In steps of 0.005. And we can see that here's the Fermi velocity. It really does not go to zero. It's changing continuously and goes through this minimum and increases again. And I should have put this as a fraction of the Fermi velocity in graphene. It's like a few percent of that. So it is very small, but it's definitely not zero. So the bands are also doing something very interesting. And I put a few of what I think are some interesting snapshots. Think are some interesting snapshots here. So the large and small angles would be outside what we call the magic range. And here, you know, they don't look, they look like the bands in graphene, although they're not very flat, you know, but they are on the MEV scale, so they are, you know, relatively flat. So the dashed and solid lines are the bands in the K and K prime valleys, and we only have a splitting along this gamma m path. So this is the only place where the bands are not forced to be a Where the bands are not forced to be degenerate due to some symmetry of TBG. And we can see that passing through the magic range, you'll notice that the order of this splitting along gamma m changes. So then, you know, another thing we notice is that the top band is like not really becoming flat, but the bottom band becomes very flat. So at these angles here, 1.04 and 0.91, the bands are very flat. Bands are very flat. And these angles are where the eigenvalues at gamma and m are equal. So we propose that these are where the lower band is as flat as possible. We propose that these are kind of the bounds of the magic range. So I have some of the eigenvalues here. These are gamma, and the triangles are M, and this is where they cross over. So we're saying this is the magic range. And inside the magic range, the curvature of the band about gamma is changing. Of the band about gamma is changing, and the band actually comes up to meet the upper band, like this, which is here. And at an angle in between here and here, the same happens at M. The M points touch here. Is the irreducible reprinted tension also switched? That's something we were looking into. Yeah, so it's an interesting question. Do the pat the bands pass through another and come through? And come through. The answer is: I don't know. We should probably check. But I've just colored the bands the same colour here. Because you could say, okay, does the Fermi velocity pass through here? I don't think the bands are passing through one another, but maybe through hybridization, the character could exchange. But that's something we're not sure about. But so this angle where the endpoints touch, which is between Where the endpoints touch, which is between here and here, is exactly the angle where the Fermi velocity is minimum. So there's, you know, a very dramatic change in the bands is happening in a very small range of twist angles. We also looked at the Fermi surfaces at half-filling, which are shown in these animations as a function of twist angle, and also very interesting behavior. So outside the magic range, the The magic range, the half-filling, the Fermi surface has this threefold shape with the trigonal warping. And something interesting: you can see when we pass through the magic range, the orientation of the surface rotates by pi. So what's happening here? The bands become very flat, and this threefold surface becomes connected. And we always have these pockets around k and k prime. Then the curvature at gamma changes. It moves up above the half-filling level. It moves up above the half-filling level, and a pocket opens at gamma. And then the surface breaks open again. So you'll see, yeah, it breaks open here, and then it rejoins, the pocket goes away, and the orientation changes. So the upper band does something similar, but it's not as interesting. So yeah, there's a lot of interesting behavior here as a function of twist angle. And when you look in really fine detail, there's actually a lot going on from an Avenicio perspective. From an ab initio perspective. So, you know, another thing we wanted to do was revisit this problem of making a minimal model. So, you know, the ones I showed before were like pretty good, but not perfect. And I'm not going to get into too many details here, but you can take the bands from the continuum K.P model and project onto a small number of more A scale effective Vannier. Scale effective Vannier orbitals like these ones and get a decent description of the band, the bands around here. So, here's one from this paper by Stephen and Shang, where they projected onto a 10-band model. So, this is three states for the AA sites on a triangular lattice, three states for the three-domain walls on a Kagame lattice, and two states each for the AB and BA domains on a honeycomb lattice. And we can see in this model that the flat. And we can see in this model that the flatbands are mainly described by these AA states here and the domain walls. So, ignoring these two, we have these kind of threefold lobes centered around the AA sites with different orientations on the different sublattices. And we have these ellipses on the domain walls. And if you, you know, decompose onto the sublattices, they're off-centered a bit and just kind of closer towards the lobes. And, you know, I just want to quickly mention the related. I just want to quickly mention the related work. So, you know, we saw these fidget spinner states earlier in the week. So it's a kind of a similar approach, but you just project into the two flat bands, or two flat bands for the K valley and two more for the K prime valley. And you get these quite delocalized fidget spinner states. And I think if you calculate the hoppings for these, they decay at like nine more A cells or something. So, you know, quite delocalized. So, you know. So, yeah, one of the subtle differences between these states and the previous ones is that these states are pointing towards the domain centers, and the other ones are pointing along the domain walls. So, maybe it's like the dual problem or something like where it's along the domain walls instead of the centers. But if you take the domain state, the Vannier effective orbitals from the ten-band model, this is kind of our cartoon of the electronic description of TBG. Know electronic description of TBG. So we have these AA like threefold lobes. You know, the orange one is the A sublattis, the blue one is the B sublattis. And if you use your imagination, maybe this is an F electron. And we have these purple domain wall states here. And we have these green blobs for the AB and BA, which we're going to neglect. Now the shortest hopping with these orbitals is between this orange. Is between this orange lobe and the domain wall. So if you want to see some hopping between the orange, like A sites and the blue, this is going to happen indirectly through this domain wall. So because of that, we think a natural interpretation of these states is not on a triangular lattice, but one orbital, you will borrow a lobe from each site like this, and they're centered here. And they're centered here, you know, at the domain center. And now, if you do that for both sub-lattices, the AA states now form a honeycomb lattice instead of triangular. And we think this is a reasonable description because, you know, the local density of states is showing that it's coming from the A sites, but the flatbands in TBG clearly look like they're coming from a honeycomb lattice. So we think this might be consistent with that. And then you do the same. Consistent with that. And then you do the same for the domain wall states. So you take a symmetric combination of domain wall states, resolved onto the sub-lattices. They're also centered on these, you know, the domain centers, and they form a honeycomb lattice too. So we propose a four-band model in this way, where we have a honeycomb lattice for the AA sites, which describe the flat bands, and a honeycomb model for the domain wall states, which are complementary bands. We take them to be the valence bands directly below. The valence bands directly below, and you need these extra bands to get the right symmetries of TBG. You can't get it with just two bands. So this is the form of our Hamiltonian. We have two blocks here, H star for the AA sites, H delta are for the domain wall sites. And so we have a honeycomb lattice with up to third nearest neighbor, hoppings, which we found we could describe the bands well with that many. And we have this interaction. And we have this interaction off-diagonal Hamiltonian, which is also honeycomb. So we have 13 free parameters in total going from on-site up to third nearest neighbors, and they're all real, except the third-nearest neighbor interaction in here. And that is needed to get this splitting along gamma m or the trigonal warping in the Fermi surfaces. So we fit this four-band model to the flat bands in the continuum model, and we found that the parameters change. And we found that the parameters changed more or less smoothly as a function of angle. The A8 hopping parameters were on the scale of MeV, which is sensible. The T delta were on the scale of EV, which is sensible because they're the dispersive valence bands. And then the interactions were somewhere in between. So yeah, we were able to go a little bit further and derive an effective two-band model. So if you write this Schrödinger equation in block form, where fire equation in block form where phi are the states for the flat bands, phi prime are the states for the auxiliary bands. You can sort of integrate out the auxiliary bands and write this effective equation just for the flat bands where you have this somewhat complicated effective Hamiltonian here. And it's dependent on energy, so you can get some sort of self-consistent equation, but this is MeV and this H delta for the domain wall sites is EV. So you can kind of just neglect this and get a very simple equation. Equation. And we managed to get really good fits to the, well, what I think are really good fits to these, you know, the continual model bands with just a two-band model. So here's a plot of like across the whole magic range. So the grey... Oh, did I put the grey bands in here? Yeah, I think the grey bands are in here, but they're just, they're very close to the red and blue bands, are coming from this two-band model. And the grey background means that we're in the magic range. So we think we have a very nice. Range. So we think we have a very nice two-band model that describes very well the bands that you get from the continuum, like the K.P model. So can I ask? This is really interesting. So if I go back, so I look at the 8-band model, then that's achieved by really going and doing, creating Reiner functions. And then we have the And then we have the heavy fermion model. I think you would sort of address that. Now, is the heavy fermion model sort of like the flat bands are kind of like your F electrons and the other includes a few other bands. Those are your C electrons. So basically, instead of actually doing going through the Warner basis functions, you guys just phenomenologically say, Guys, just phenomenologically say, hey, let's look at this model and parameterize it. We don't phenomenologically say that. That's the right word. No, no, no, no, you. But you still have parameters. I say you set the structure of what you want, and then you have parameters to fit. Yeah, yeah. But it's not achieved by going from atomistic all the way to this model. Way to this model. Yeah, I mean, we still have to miniarize the F modes, right? So that's like, you know, there's still some kind of numerical machinery involved. And if you do this with your hands off, does it come out to be one orbital on one sub lattice and another orbital on the other sub lattice? No, no, no, no. So the both f orbitals, like if you're away from the chiral thing, I mean, both. From the caroling, I think both both air orbitals are on both sublimates. Now, what you're doing here is somewhat, I would say, more is like the heavy fermion philosophy. I think it's the same in spirit, where we have something for the flat bands, and we have something for the auxiliary bands that we know we need them, but we don't really care what they look like. Right? Just, I guess the difference is we're just doing it in a very like. We're just doing it in a very by hand type binding way, and it seems like you're getting some really effective orbitals and maybe a bit more elegant, but we seem to get a decent fit with just two bands here. That's a difference, right? The flat bands in the heavy fermion model are not the same as the F modes. The F modes. They're 95% the F modes, and then the gamma points you have the C modes, right? Yeah, so they're 95%, they're basically 100% remotes that both. They're basically 100% remote to the brominosome, but they hit the gamma point completely. Yeah, that's why you need the CLI. That's not a defect, that's a feature. Yeah, but at the gamma point, it's like a 50-50 mixture between the flat bands and the remote bands. Is it 50-50? No, in the heavy-permean model, at the gamma point, the flat bands are strictly C electrons. So no F at all. So it's mixing the flat bands and remote bands, like if the spaces. On remote bands, like different spaces mixed and stuff. Yeah, I mean, there was a PRX from a few years ago, maybe it's outdated now, but they kind of proved that you'll never get the right symmetries in TBG with just two bands per spin and valley, right? There's, like, you know, for example, like this. If there are one here, then actually. Like, so this splitting here, if you have a two-band model, you will always get it wrong, which is, I guess, if you insist on preserving the symmetries of the system, like if you insist that your one-year function will preserve the symmetries of the system. Otherwise, you can still get the exponentially mobilized, but the symmetries will not be implemented locally. Anyway, I'll just wrap up and then we can continue. So, yeah, some take-home messages. We really think that this atomic relaxation, of course, it's well understood by now, but we think it's really, really crucial for the realistic description of the flat bands. And one of the consequences is that the magic angle is not really. That the magic angle is not really a magic angle, but a range of angles, a narrow range, but you know, it's not a singular thing. And we think this is consistent with the original experimental observations. Another feature is this particle, you know, this electron hole asymmetry. And then, yeah, there's very interesting behavior in the Fermi surfaces as well. And in the lower band, we always have these pockets around the K and K prime values, but a lot of interesting things happening. But a lot of interesting things happening along the gamma m direction. And then finally, we eventually managed to get this effective two-band model, which seems to reproduce quite well the bands in TBG. And then I just wanted to give, you know, here's a few things that I've been thinking about lately, and maybe it would be interesting to discuss. So, you know, where is the magic, right? Which one of these is the magic angle, right? These are all commands, right? Yeah. These are all commands, right? Yes. Uh yes, yeah. Okay. That might be what's producing the gap. At K, I mean. The gap at K? Yeah. Wait, you mean the gap here? Yeah, you said it never goes to zero, right? Oh, the Fermi velocity. It's never going to zero. Yes, yes, yes. So my whole point is that if the band is never flat and the Fermi velocity goes to zero, which one is the magic angle? Which one is the magic angle, right? Is it the one where the Fermi velocity is minimum, or is it the one where the bands are as flat as possible? So, in this model, they're no longer the same thing. And then, you know, follow-up question, does it matter? So, if you're going beyond single-particle physics, can you say, I don't care what the shape is or the details? These are very flat. I know the symmetries, and I'll build an interacting model based on that. And then, you know, something I've been thinking about this week is that, you know. This week is that, you know, these are very nice, realistic descriptions of the bands, but you know, they're not easy to get in a widely accessible way, right? So, you know, I was thinking, like, I think one thing that would be very nice for the community is if we had a very simple, accessible thing, like a Python package, where, you know, anybody could just, in a few minutes, you know, look at the bands in some more material. And, you know, I know it would take a lot of abinitio calculation. Lot of like ab initio calculations and some nice continual model and a bit of coding, but you know, maybe it's something worth doing with like a community effort. So, finally, I just want to acknowledge Tim and the rest of the CACSERIS group, which I'm very happy to be a part of. And I acknowledge all of these collaborators here as well. And thank you for listening.
