Our final speaker for Alberta Number Theories Days 2021 is Selchuk Ayhan. Selchuk was his PhD at Carleton University, followed by a postdoc at Nyanyan Technical University. Since then, become an adjunct professor at Carleton. I did a postdoc at Calgary and Lethbridge, completely during COVID times, I think. I also had another postdoctoral fellowship. I also had another postdoctoral fellowship at Nanyang Technological University before things got crazy. Oh, yeah. In Singapore. Okay. Excellent. Yeah. There's a long background. I was trying to get you right here. But yeah, so in Calgary, Selchek is working with Croix again. I'm not sure who you're working with in Lethbridge. I'm here. Excellent. Okay. And most recently, Selchek is now an instructor, quite recently, at Northern Lakes College, which I find very cool because this is yet to. Very cool because this is yet another Alberta institution that number theory has now infiltrated, and it greatly expands our collective geographical coverage of the province quite a bit. So very pleased to welcome Selchuk. Selchuk's research interests are all related to analytic number theory, including modular forms, MOS forms, problems related to elliptic curves, partitions, and last but not least, eta quotients, the subject of the last talk on eta quotients whose derivatives are also eta quotients. Are also eta quotients. Please take a nice way. Thank you very much for a very nice introduction. That was great. So, hello all, and welcome to the talk, and thank you for staying for the last talk. I would like to thank the organizers for putting this together. It's a very enjoyable conference. Thank you guys. And giving me a chance to present my research here today. And my research here today. So, today I'll be talking about the eta quotients whose derivatives are also eta quotients. If you are familiar about the eta quotients, they're infinite products, right? So, you have an infinite product, and then you take the derivative of that infinite product, and you get another infinite product. That's kind of like a very cool feature. Cool feature. It's kind of unexpected, actually. And so we will be like a few examples were known before our work. So first I'm going to talk about them. And then working on those known examples, we have realized that these kind of etoquotients and their matrix has a very nice interplay with Eisenstein. Nice interplay with Eisenstein series. And in the second part, I'm going to explain that interplay. And I categorize all eta quotients whose derivatives are also eta quotients. And after that categorization, I'm going to tell you how the, if an eta quotient satisfies those things, then how the derivative works. And then I'll describe some algorithms to spot those kind of eta quotients. Of etocautions. I'm going to be very brief in this part because it's too technical. And now, until here, everything is from work I have done in Nanyang Technological University with P. Chunto in Singapore. So around the same time, Choi, Kim, and Lim has come. And Lim has come up with a similar paper where they established the completeness of lists for square pre and prime squared levels. So I'm going to talk about it a bit. And then recently with Amir, we have came up with a new approach which will establish the completeness for prime power levels. And we have an idea to expand it to all levels, but it's too technical. Levels, but it's too technical, and we haven't been able to figure out some of the details yet. So, this is a work in progress with joint with Amirak Barryov University of Letbrech. Okay, so let's start with some definitions. Throughout the talk, we always let z to be a complex numbering opera plane and q to be e to the power 2 pi iz. Therefore, the absolute The absolute value of q. Q is always in a unit disk. As I mentioned, the Delekineta functions are infinite products, and they are these kind of infinite products, where you take the product of the numbers 1 minus q to the power n. This q to the power 1 over 4 is there for some technical reasons, but you don't have to worry about it for now, if you don't know why it's there. If you don't know why it's there, we define an etocotient of level n to be an finite product of these infinite products. So if you take the Rt power, where Rt is an integer, and multiply these etocotients with some scales, then these are called etocotients. And the study of etocotians is a very lively research area. It has many applications. It is very good to describe certain objects. So this is like. Certain objects. So, this is like this is a very well-known object in some circles of mathematics. So, the way attached to an eta quotient is sum of these exponents over 2. So, this comes from the transformation properties. Since writing this is This is hard when you are describing examples. We come up with this notation and we use this notation for an attack quotient. And it's also easy to copy and paste from computer results. So yeah, this is the shortened notation we use in this talk. If an ether quotient f of z is of level n, then f of z and f of dz will be at a quotient. And f of dz will be eta quotients of level d times n for each d. When counting the number of eta quotients in specific levels, we exclude these kind of like trivial scales of the previous eta quotients. So we are trying to establish a finiteness result. Therefore, we kind of exclude these things. I'm going to talk about this in detail soon. Soon. Now, before things get crazy, I'm going to start with an example. Now, this is a netaque, right? And the first Fourier coefficients of this guy is given here. If you take the derivative of this with respect to Q, then you see that this is like 1 plus 16Q plus 132Q squared and so on. For those who knows, like who does symbolic computation, it's kind of easy to write the Kind of easy to write this in terms of a product. And it seems like this is very similar to the zeta coefficient, like these first few coefficients. And usually if this happens, it's not a coincidence, right? And Jacobi actually came to help a few hundred years back. He has this formula for, this is the generating function for the number of representations by Of representations by four squares, right? And very well-known formulas exist for these guys. Now, if you look at the previous two eta quotients, the ratio will be this generating function given by Jacobi. And then if you work through this, you can realize that these guys are logarithmic derivatives of these kinds of products. And then when you look at this carefully, this Look at this carefully. This is this eta quotient, where these are the same eta quotients. Therefore, you kind of find that like the logarithmic derivative of this etaquoti is this etaquotient. Therefore, the derivative of fq is equal to this guy, right? Because these are multiplicated infinite products. The denominator will be the same. The denominator will go to the other side and the other side will still be an infinite product. Therefore, it will stay as a like the logarithmic derivative over there won't affect the being an attack. So this is one of the first known examples. This in alternative notation in our short-handed notation looks like this guy. And there are a few more examples. Two of them are presented in Nathan finds. Presented in Fine Nathan Fine's book. It's a classical book on Q series. So he gives these examples and he actually praises these examples as being quite beautiful. And sometime later, I think this is mid-90s, Borgine and Garvin symbolically computed that this should be the case and then they used some equations from identities from Equations from identities from Ramanujan's notebooks and proven this relation between these two eta quotients. So up until the point where we started working, these were the only few examples. Maybe there existed a few more, right? So we actually set out to find a few more examples, right? Just create some more examples. But luckily we came up with the whole Luckily we came up with the whole characterization thing and we were able to establish some finiteness results in certain levels. But like the complete finiteness, we haven't been able to do that. So now how did we do that? We did that because we discovered an interplay between Eisenstein series and logarithmic derivatives of And logarithmic derivatives of eta quotients. So, how does that work, and which kind of Eisenstein series are we talking about? In a few talks, we have seen a few different kinds of Eisenstein series. These are the most classical ones. So, this is the way to Eisenstein series. This is not a holomorphic Eisenstein series. In order to make it holomorphic, we multiply it with T. We multiply it with t, extend it with t, or scale it with t, and take the difference. And then if you do this, this is gonna be a holomorphic module for in gamma naught n of weight 2, where t is a positive divisive of n. So these are the objects that we are going to be focusing on. So now Recall that f of z etaqua are in this form, where the weight is defined to be the sum of exponents over 2. Applying the logarithmic differentiation on these products, we see that they are equal to these Eisenstein series plus this, we want to call it a tail term, a tail term here, which is non-holomorphic. term here, which is non-holomorphic. This part is holomorphic, this part is non-holomorphic. And we want this to be an eta quotient, right? And this non-holomorphic part has a weird transformation property, but eta quotients have nice transformation properties. Because of that, we need this k to be zero. Otherwise, it cannot be an etocotient. Therefore, we obtain this result. We obtain this result. If let this guy be an ether quotient of level n and weight k, then the derivative of an eta quotient is an eta quotient if and only if k is equal to zero, meaning this sum of exponents are zero, and this guy is an eta quotient. So this question reduces to find the etaquotians that are linear combinations of Eisenstein series which satisfy this Which satisfy this property. This k being zero is equivalent to this condition if you change the variable RT to RT over T. And so this question reduced to something else, finding eta quotients which are linear combinations of Eisenstein series, which I did in my thesis actually. So it was a great question for me. We didn't know this connection. Question for me, we didn't know this connection before. So, these kind of like my thesis results came into a context, part of my thesis context results. So, okay so, but like, okay, let's say f of z is a linear combination of these Eisenstein series. Then, how does the derivative work? If this has If this happens, then the derivative of this eta quotient will be equal to this eta quotient. So this classifies all the results, but like we still need to come up with some examples. To come up with some examples, we have written some algorithms. These algorithms depend on the relationship between the orders of eta quotients and like the orders of vanishing of eta quotients at certain counts. Vanishing of eta quotients at certain costs, their integrality, and the valence formula. Because of the valence formula and the fact that the eta quotients do not vanish in the upper half plane, all their zeros has to be on the cusps. Right? So the order of an eta quotient at cusp r, if you take this If you take this summation through all inequivalent cusps, you should get this guy because of the valence formula. And since these are holomorphic epipotians, their orders are always going to be bigger than or equal to zero. This effectively gives us a lower bound and upper bound for the orders. If there and we And we know that all orders has to be integers because these are Eisenstein series with trivial character. So we run through all integers that satisfy this one. And orders uniquely defined eta quotients. Therefore, we can find all eta quotients in a given level and uh given uh character actually. This is a more general uh how to say uh argument, but Argument, but today I'm gonna keep it with the identity character. So, using these kind of arguments and turning them into algorithms, we find three examples in level four. This is a complete result for level four. At level six, we find ten examples and so on. And it stops at level thirty-six. We went up to a hundred, we couldn't find anything else. We couldn't find anything else. So it's probably another coincidence. So this is probably a complete list, but we haven't been able to prove that this is a complete list as of yet. Here, I have to note that the results here at level 12, there are 100 here, 3 comes from here, but these are if f of z is in level 4, then f 3 z will be level 12, right? 3z will be level 12, right? Similarly, if f of z is in here, then f of 2z will be in f of 12. Therefore, here there are actually 126 octar. And those, in the context of Eisenstein series and eta quotients, were actually published, those results were published by Kenneth Williams in 2016 or 2015 work. work. So uh but he didn't make the connection with the the uh derivatives uh so some of these are known. That's the what we know in terms of the relationship between eta quotients and Eisenstein series. So uh yeah, so and around the same time uh 2019 another paper oh these are some results by the way if anyone is interested in looking at them. At them. Yeah. These are some bunch of numbers. It's like matrix. Explicit numbers. Isn't that good? Yeah, yeah. These are some, like I put here the ones who could fit into a page, right? So, yeah, anyways. So how did you compute the diff how did you do this? I write a computer program in Maple. In Maple, yeah, yeah. So the algorithms are explicit. I didn't go into the details, but I didn't go into the details, but yeah, it's like you just change it to any language you like, and yeah, it's quite doable. Around the same time, Choi, Kim, and Lim gave the complete list for square free and prime square levels. So if we go back to our list, prime squares are 4 and 9, and the square 3 level is only 6. So they give the results of completeness for the Of completeness for these kinds of numbers, right? And also, I think this is the most important result in their paper. If n is a level having a primitive etocotient whose derivative is also an etocotian, then n is a multiple of 2 to the power a, 3 to the power b, 5 to the power c, and 7 to the power d for some a, b, c, d. Right? But they didn't give an upper bound. But they didn't give an upper bound for A, B, C, D. And if you look at our list, right, these are, like, seven never appears, but the rest are the combinations of primes two, three, and five. So we are in the right direction. All the results kind of point to the same direction. This list is complete, hopefully. So our approach to Our approach to prove the completeness for prime powers is our next topic. Recall that we are trying to identify all eta quotients in this space, right? And we want to exclude repeated results. Therefore, we make this funny notation and we just remove those eto coefficients, those Those modular forms, let me say, coming from the previous levels. This kind of like this idea of removing old forms, some call these old forms, but the old forms are defined in the context of casp forms. So it's not like the old forms, but the idea is similar. So we are trying to remove the old forms from here. And we can't really call them new forms because they work differently here. Because we don't have this. Differently here because we don't have this Peterson inner product, it needs at least one cascade. All of them here are Eisenstein series. So we define these guys and if f of z is in this space, then we call it an E primitive modular form. This E doesn't refer to electronic, it refers to Eisenstein. So we are going to focus our So, we are going to focus our attention on finding an upper bound. Okay, maybe if I go to the next level, next slide, it will be better. Now, our goal is to find an upper bound for the sum of orders of vanishings of an element at E-primitive modular function. Now, if we can establish such an upper bound, Now if we can establish such an upper bound, then we can compare it with the valence formula. If that upper bound is less than valence formula, that's going to mean that there cannot be any eta quotient there. So once we establish a upper bound for E-primitive modular forms, we'll be done for the completeness of results. Remember that the valence formula was That the valence formula was this guy. So now let's try to find, let's try to approach our question. Now, what we are going to do is we are going to write the Fourier series expansion at each cusp for Eisenstein series. And then we will look at the linear combinations of those Eisenstein series. And if a cusp order exceeds certain numbers, Order exceeds a certain number, then some of those coefficients become zero. If those coefficients become zero, then you can't have an epsilon E-primitive modular form. Therefore, it will give an upper bound for that cusp's order. So, that's gonna be the idea. So, okay, this is known. Like, if M is in SL2Z, then we have this Then we have this transformation formula for Eisenstein series, where this is the non-holomorphic part, which makes a lot of trouble for many of the results. But it's cool, it actually kind of helps us. And we denote the T scale by this E to Tz. This gives some notational convenience. And we have to note that the width of a cusp A over C in gamma nutrients. A cusp A over C in gamma naught N is given by this guy. And this is very important for the purpose of this talk because remember, e to the power 2 pi Iz was Q, right? Here, the unit Q changes with the cusps. So each different cusp has different width. Because of that different width, we have to work with a different arithmetic progression, if you. Okay, so noting this, we kind of go through some painful calculations and find this Fourier series expansion for a scale of an Eisenstein series, where these wm t are roots of unity. If t divides c, then it's always going to be 1. If t doesn't divide c, If T doesn't divide C, then we will have a root of unity. And this is a complex root of unity. That's important. Now, assuming Rt over T are going to be all zeros, that tail part here, when we take a linear combination of these guys, are going to disappear. Therefore, assuming this, the linear combination of these The linear combination of these eta quotients, Eisenstein series, have this Fourier series expansion. So, this is the main tool that we are going to be using in our proofs. And we have that this is a rational number. This is also important. Now, prime power case. Uh is I lost What's happening? Yeah, prime power case. So in the prime power case, we let f of z to be in e to p m, right? Then for all c that divides p to the power f. That divides p to the power m. This is the level. We can rewrite the linear combination as this guy using the previous result. Now, n is a prime power. The divisors of prime powers are in the form of pi. And if you put everything together, we see these are like G C D's of some prime powers, right? Then it only depends on if i is bigger or j is bigger, right? If you do that analysis, we see that these This complicated value becomes these simple values, and this root of unity becomes this value here. And if we combine everything together, we get this Fourier series expansion for these guys. Now, let's say that the order of vanishing at the cost 1 over 1 is greater than 1, right? Which means that the coefficient of q 1 p to the power m is 0. Now, 0. Now i is equal to 0, which means that we are in this second case, because i is less than m over 2. If i is equal to 0, and if we are looking at the coefficient of q to the power q1 p m to the power 1, the only contribution will be coming from here when m is equal to j is equal to m. There is no contribution from here because this is always a positive number, therefore these are all gonna be divisible by p. Divisible by P, all these exponents. Therefore, the only contribution are actually coming from here when J is equal to M, which means that this expression here, this coefficient, is equal to 0. Now, this is a rational number, non-zero rational number. This is a root of unity, it's non-zero. Then, the only thing that can be zero is RPM. If RPM is equal to zero, so okay, I'm gonna go. So, okay, I'm gonna come to that. R to m is equal to 0, remember that. And by similar arguments, we obtain that if i is less than m over 2 and if the order is greater than 1, all these coefficients are going to be 0 in these cases. If Rpm is 0, then f of z cannot be an E-primitive element because it's a linear combination of Eisenstein series that are level p to the power of the electron. that are level p to the power m minus 1. And if r1 is equal to 0, then there exists another modular form coming from a lower space such that this happens. Therefore in either case F is not epyrimitive. This effectively establishes an upper bound for each cusp. So none of the cusps can exceed one. Can exceed 1. So all of the orders of the cusps are less than or equal to 1. And not all of them can be 1, because if that's the case, then these are going to be cusp forms, which is a contradiction, because these are Eisenhower series. So this establishes this bound, where RPM is the set of inequivalent cusps for level M. Cusps for level M, gamma naught P to the power M. So this is the number of inequalent cusps for that subgroup. And we have a formula for this guy. Now, and the valence formula for the prime cover case reduces to this guy. Now, if this guy exceeds this guy, then we can't have an eterportient, right? If you look at this guy right here, you see it's like p to the power m. And if you see this, this is either 2 or 1. No, 2 or what was this? Yeah, it's 2 or P plus 1. And you see that this is faster than this guy, right? And once this exceeds this, we can stop there. That's the highest level we can go. Level we can go. So, if we compare these guys, we see that only these powers can appear, and eventually we say that there are no eta quotients in this space, except possibly in the following case, which totally agrees with our previous results. And this completes my talk. This completes my talk. Any questions for Siakchuk? Is there any interesting reason going on why Slovenia is level 12? Yeah. You want to repeat the question? Because young people don't give it to you. Okay, so he's asking if there's an interesting reason why. He's asking if there's an interesting reason why level 12 has more examples than the rest. I mean, it depends on how you define interesting, right? But like if you are trying to ask why there are so many of them in level 12, it's because this here we have Q to the power 1 over 24, right? Therefore, in actually it's in 24 you have the most elements and yeah it's because of they are combinations of two and three. Combinations of 2 and 3. That's the short answer. But it's more technical than that. And it has something to do with q to the power 1 over 24. Excellent. Perhaps I missed something, but do you not now have a complete extensive list of the rest of the levels that you could possibly need to try? Or is your current... Yeah, like, so you showed right there the potential list of possible levels you would need to try. List of possible levels you would need to try. Does your method not necessarily guarantee completeness, or could you just check those and confirm that your list down there is complete? Yeah, for the prime powers, our list is complete. So this establishes for the prime powers. Oh, I see. These are the only possible levels for prime powers. So it's established for prime powers. But it's a good question for the usual map, like everything, right? Any other questions? Any other questions, Zoom or otherwise? Nothing from the Zoom. Anything from out here? All right. Well, let's thank Selcha Tibon for the presentation of the President.
