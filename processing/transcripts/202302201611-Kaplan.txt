I'm going to use the blackboard and I hope we work out. So, first I want to I want to define um I want I know everybody here knows about uh VC dimension and all that, but still I want to define it today. I've got uh I want to define it today. I'm not assuming that. Okay, anyway. So we have a set X, and F is a subset of family of subset of X, and A is A subset of X is shattered if If what? If for every S. Wait a lot. Oh, yeah. For every S containing A, there exists some, what do we call it? Little S containing F, such that S and then F is a VC class. If there exists some n such that for no a of size n a structure, this is the right number of teams and um There you are. And the VC, so in this case, the VC class, the VC dimension of F is the minimum n such that no subset of psi n plus 1 is. Yeah, it's like the maximum number which is shutter, okay? It's the same thing. But for me, it's easier with minimum because. And if it doesn't exist, then the dimension is existing. But yeah, okay, why am I giving you this definition which you already know? Because I want to also define the yeah, so suppose you have f, then you can define the dual of f, which is Of F, which is all the S's in F such that it's all the sets which correspond to elements from X. This is the tool of F, it's called F star. This subset of, okay, this is called. Okay, this is called the dual of f. And it's a fact that the VC dimension of the dual of f is, yeah, it's bounded by 2 to the VC dimension of f plus 1. So if f is a VC class, then also f star is a VC class. And I just want to explain what it means for the dual to show. For the tool to uh to shock you and for uh so explana explanation so um a set of subsets is shattered by f by the side. By f by the two, if every Boolean combination is not enough. Essentially, if you look at the definition, that's what you'll see, okay? So that's kind of an easy way to understand the dual. And let me give you one example of this. Give you one example of this. By the way, some people here already saw a version of this talk, so I apologize for them. But I don't think many of them. So one example is if you look at open arcs, sorry, so no, not the example I meant to say. I meant to say brace every woolly combination of. So a set of subsets is shuttered. So if you have like finitely many sets, that's one of the S, it's so you think of this as now the dual thing. So one example is of a family F is based on, let's say, on the line, on the real line. Let's say on the line, on the real line. So, what I mean by way is like this case of the case. But also, this is a very important. Okay, so you've raised it at plus infinity, and you have also raised at minus infinity, closed. No, not necessarily. Yeah, let's say open. Let's say open raised. Okay, let's say x bigger than something. Okay, let's say X bigger than something, okay. Open base. And then, okay, so what is the V C? What is, so let's say F is the base. What is the dual VC dimension? So the dual BC dimension is, I'm going to define it as. Okay, it's a dimension of F star, it's a dual PC dimension of F. So what is the two pieces dimension of the rates? What do you think? What do you think? If a lot of sorry, don't tell. It's the same as PC of race. Yeah. Give me a number. I'm just saying. Okay. I'm saying it's constantly the other thing. I'm saying it's one. Because take any two ways. If they intersect, they must. If they intersect, the union is a bit. Sorry, so if you have two rays, if they're in different directions, and what am I saying? Yeah, sorry. If you have two rays and you know that every Boolean combination is not empty, okay, if you're in the same direction, then one contains the other. Okay, and if they're in different directions, then the union is everything. Okay, so again, order determined. You can show all the joints. All empty. Empty or empty. Yeah, but. But we know that I said, assume the intersection is not empty. Because every Boolean combination is non-empty. So this is why it's a very easy calculation. So the VC dimensions too. Yeah, I think checkpoint. You can shatter the points, I think. Yeah, yeah, right. DC dimensions too. Yeah, yeah, BC dimensions too. So it's not it. So Ludemir, you were wrong. Because the VC dimensional F is two, but the VC domain dimension is two. Why? Because you can shatter F. It's two. Wait, how do you shatter two points? What? How do you shatter two points? Well, I'll think so. Take one, take another, or both. Take another race. Wait, but you can't. You can't direct the direction. No, but you can't direct in both directions. Yeah, yeah, but both directions. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, great. Yes. Okay, great. That's cool. So this is not different than different than because you cannot, if you take two sets, two ways, let's say you have two sets such that every full information is not embodied. Okay, so in particular, the lattice point. What is the set? Me and L is two. You have two types. Meon L is two. Oh, but what? You cannot, so you cannot shut a set. You cannot shatter a set of two size two. Yes, you can shatter a set of size two. It means two, but no. Look at the definition. You can plus one. Or plus one. But you can shatter a set of size two. No, you can't. Two points. Two points. For the CSR, yes. Yes. So, okay, great. So, okay. I hope there's no mistake so far. I hope there's no mistake so far. Okay. So now let me tell you about this guy. I want to discuss a little bit the Q. If we see this belonging as a binary reconfiguration between X and the powers of X is the rule of the topic? Yeah, I think so. So this fact is called the PQ. Is called the PQ. It's by Matusek. Apology I'm not saying it correctly. But it's you. I think it's OU, yeah. I guess I'm. There is a check somewhere. They think it's in the S. So second A is U. Second A is U. There's no second one. Second A is U. There's no second A. There's no second A is the second A. The second A is indeed U. Yeah. Okay, so the second A is the problem. So the exista function, a function. Let's call it N. That's not a great name, but okay. Um yeah, okay, let me call it uh another name. Um it's called M. M, yeah. M, like what we call it. Okay, so okay, this is a function such that for any two numbers if no mission is the reverse. Yeah, yeah, and I'll say yeah, if Anyway, announce it. Yeah, if well, let's say that if XF is a finite set system, so by that I just mean that X is finite and X is a is a collection of subsets of X. Okay, that that's what I mean by that. Um with oh, sorry. Oh, it's like that. Such that something, and I'm going to say what the something is here, and then ah, so, and yeah, I also have to say something about the dual DC dimension. Uh it's bigger than q, but you have to still have to say what is something which is the same. Less than Quite. Yeah, less than that. Sorry, sorry, sorry, that's it. And then there is X0, X0 size at most N in Q such that X0 intersects S for any S. Okay, so let's think. Okay, so let's think about what would be the conditions. Okay, that so that's that's that so that means that there's some finite set whose size. What? It's actually big enough, right? It's not small enough. What's the problem? No, no, you want it to set the problem because it's harder the smaller you want you want you want it to be small. So you want a small set that intersects every set in your in your in your family. Okay? In your family. Okay? And let's think what could be the condition. So, one condition is, clearly, for all S in F, S is an M. Okay, that's clear, right? Because it follows from the conclusion. But that's not enough. So, and XF has what we're going to define soon as the PQ polar. TQ problem. Okay, now let me define that. So, definition has a TQ property if um or any um Fy sucks. Um P P is the bigger one, so P so for any F prime, subset of F of size P, there exists F double prime, containing F prime, F double prime is size Q, and the intersection of F double prime is not. intersection of a cover by exam. Okay? So think about it. If p equals q, then essentially it says that every set of size p has an empty intersection. Okay, this is not exactly that. It says every set of size p has a subset of size q, which might be smaller, which has an empty intersection. Non-empty. Yeah, non-empty. Yeah, none of them. If you took q equals 1, it would be always true. Yeah, for p equals q equals 1, it's just saying that all subsets, all elements of L for 1. Okay, so let me go back to the example of the race. Yes, but it's a zero zero. Okay, in the example of the race, in the race, let me just call it the race. Let me just call it a rays, has, or the family of rays, like the one, the one from the example there, has the PQ property with Q equals 2, P equals 3. So, what does that mean if you take So, what does that mean? If you take three ways, two of them intersect. That's not, you don't have to be a rocket scientist at all. Of course, two ways in different directions might be disjoint, but if you take three, two of them have to be in the same direction. So, okay. Okay, great. Okay, so anyway, this is Matuszek's result, and it was very useful, this fact. Very useful. This fact was used in the fundamental research of NIP theories. For example, it was used to give a proof of UDTFS, the first proof of UDTFS, and also it was used in the study of defining the minimum groups, for example. All of this stuff is by Alcum and Kier. And I think also Pierre and Sylvain have a paper on MIT fields and so. MIT fields and we have something that also uses TQCR separate places, but I don't know if this structure will. What? Do you know what it looks like? But what function your function can be? Oh yeah, I don't, but I mean, you can see from the two. I mean, if you read the tools from optimal. Yeah, yeah, I'm not saying the optimal. Even for big defending of PQ, after M of PQ. Is there a log upper bound for how big M of PQ is? Proof is effective, so you can read and upper bound, but maybe it's not the most efficient way. I don't know how this is, but you can look at it inside. No, I think it's not so difficult. I think it's a tower of exponential. I don't know. I don't think it's a tower. What is it, huh? Maybe just expand. Maybe just it's not a matter of yeah, okay okay, so I want to what I want to to give is is uh a definable version of this fact. Okay, that's my aim. Okay, so let's let's think what a definable version is. In the meantime, I'll write a definition that okay, so say. So say a pair of formulas let's say for it phi of xy and psi of y and over some model, some structure m as the pq property If well, I'm just going to uh it's a definable version. It's a it's just a version of the pick property that I wrote. So if um it's not gonna be a name appearing twice and has to be coming? Because I'm never going to this function n. Okay, you know what? Let's call it the details of the if I ever use it again. Don't do the with this. Yeah, now remember the so this has a picky property. If f, which is a child of x psi, is a family. Is a family of non-empty sets with the TQ. So so let's just repeat. So it just means that if you take P guy um yeah, if you take P guys from there, Yeah, if you take pig eyes from there, Q of them intersect. You assume Q is greater than the C image, correct? No, I don't. Sorry, it's just PQ property. It's just a definition of PQ property. When I give the theorem, I'll assume it. Yeah. Wait, but doesn't it imply that there's a non-empty? It doesn't follow. What? Doesn't it follow that there are non-empty? If p is greater than zero. No, okay. I mean, okay, never mind. No, it doesn't follow. You can just choose a number. Okay. So one application, so one application of the PQ theorem of Matushek is the following. If you'll have a big difference. It's the following application. So suppose T is me. I think this appeared in a paper about Go. Of Admiral and Ger. Yeah, so suppose to Esme, I think this is due to Admiral Ger in 2013 or something, and you have two formulas. M is a model, and phi of psi is about, so you have phi of x, y, psi of y, they are over m. And we assume as well that We assume as well that phi psi as the pair has the PQ volume now I'm going to say this condition about the PC dimension for Q bigger than yes bigger than the good viscous dimension of phi so the good visit dimension of phi is So the two pieces dimension of phi is just the two viscer dimension of the set defined by phi. Okay? So phi phi of xy is a formula. You can define a family of sets which are defined by varying the parameter. And then the two viscer dimension is essentially the same as the viscous dimension of phi of yx. When you place the role of the parameter and the variable. So we assume this. Then there There are W0, Wn minus 1. These are subsets of this I space over M in the Y variables such that the union of the Wi's is the set of types. First, they contain psi. And for i, if you look at this and p type of p is in w i. Wi, this is consistent. Now, B here, B is in the Manso model. Okay, so this is a pretty straightforward application of the PQ property, of the PQ theorem, sorry, and compactness. And and yeah, and right, yeah, there are a couple of questions here. For for example, what is this n? What is this number n? Well, maybe you can guess, because I said it's a pretty straightforward application. You can guess this number n is exactly this m chunk, pq. So n actually equals to, right? So it's with a correct annotation. Yeah, so do you only need q to be a VC to do a VC dimension where you run over? At least the dual VC dimension where you run over parameters from psi thing? Yeah, I mean, sure, yeah, I can make, but, but then you define the same family, so I can change phi to say phi m psi or something. No, I mean okay, it doesn't really matter. Yeah, yeah, but it's the same generality, that's what I'm saying. Um and I think this is a better way to present it. So, okay, so this is uh um one thing, one question, what is this number n? Second question you can ask. The second question you can ask is: maybe somebody wants to ask it. What? No, no, no. Because I gave this talk twice already. Somebody always asked it. I think you need to use FEPT for compactness. No, for fine. No, no, for fine, because I'm using compactness. Use compactness, so in compactness, you only need to do that with fine. So yeah, so the question that I was telling for you guys to ask was what is WR? For you guys to ask, was what is WR? It's a family of types, and we all like family of types to be, or subset of types. So it's a subset of the space of types, and space of type is a topological space, so it's interesting to ask what it is. So and then the answer is we can make this, we use the theorem, we can make this WIs global. So again, I'm assuming under the same assumptions, let's call this supposed to be three. And yeah, so let's call this star. Star is all this, star is everything. So assume star. Then there are formulas. Formulas phi 0 up to phi n minus 1 over n. So these are formulas in y over m such that this formula at the psi is equivalent to the disjunction psi i. And the same conclusion as above and this consistent. But now I don't have to say B is in the master, I can also say B in M because everything is. Because everything is in MR. Everything is the tile in EMR, everything is okay and okay. So yes, that's the statement. And what happens? Oh, yeah, so again, that's a question, right? So before I had two questions, so the question here is, what is this number n? And actually, I don't know. I don't have an example. I don't have an example where this number n is different than this m chunk. So I think it's the same, but I couldn't forget, because back is not a classroom in types. I didn't get what you're saying. You need to find classrooms? So, yeah. But if you're most ever checked. Most errors. No, but well, okay, I tried this kind of approach. I didn't, okay, I couldn't make that. I mean, you say just use this. Yeah, but I still want it to be definable. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's the issue. So, and actually, the way the proof goes for finding these formulas is by compactness. The previous is by compactness, but it's a kind of different compactness. What else? This is the kind of compactness where you find the This is the kind of compactness where you find the formula in time. And this is the kind of compactness where you want to review at the time. Different L, because path L is a checker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and there I said what it is, yeah, I'm not saying what it is. But if you try to show that the WIS are just closed, which is suffice to show that the WIS are closed, right? And then we are. No, not saying they'll disjoint. Just once. So, if I said they're closed, but. But anyway, I get closer, so. These are not the same WIs as the other. These WIs, I don't know, because of the number of. But they make it both time. Yeah. Make sure. In theory, we can, of course, play and destroy it. Yeah, these ones, yes. No, in the middle. No, in the same way. Ah, this one's too, because rotating images. But if you start with closed, then. Just let me tell you what happens in the example of the race. So in the example, essentially, I want to say that in this case, the number of formulas would be 2, and I'll just take psi 1. So there's some coding to go. So, there's some coding to be done. Okay, if I really want to talk about the context of the raise, I have to tell what phi and psi are. So, phi is the formula saying something like if a equals b, then x is bigger than y, and if a is distinct from b, then x is smaller than y, or something like that. And psi would just say, psi wouldn't say anything, okay? Something like this. Does psi say? So, in the example, I'm looking, I'm taking phi. So in the example, I'm look I'm taking phi, only x, y, maybe z1, z2. I don't know maybe I'm I don't need this this much, but anyway, so it would say something like if z1 equals z2, then x is bigger than y, and if z1 is bigger than z2, then x is smaller than y. Okay? So that would call the race, and chi of y. The race and chi, chi of y z1, z2. So it does be y. So this way I can code the family. But now what would be the psi 0 and psi 1? I'm telling you the number n is 2 in this case. So I can take psi 0 to be z1 equals z2, namely all the rays in the plus infinity direction, and psi 1 to be z1. To be z1 distinct from the two, maybe the rays in the minus infinity direction. And obviously, if you look at phi when phi of xy where y is, if you look at the family of rays in the plus infinity direction, that's going to be consistent. So that's an example where it fought, a specific example where it's not so hard to find the actual formula. Okay. How much time do I have? We have like ten minutes? So this, there is some miraculous thing going on that the PQ property in combinatorics is related to foking, which is really. Yeah, I think this is really nice. Yeah, okay. Fokin is a name when I told you first. Fokkin is an idea, right? I think it is. So So, and yeah, okay, so I can tell you the equivalence. So, a fact that following equivalent, so you have two formulas psi of xy, psi of y. Okay, so one is, and you have some set A. These are formulas over sine, let's say. So for all p in psi, phi of xb doesn't divide over a is one, and two is five psi as equality and For some q bigger than and three is that for all q, there exists p such that the pair has a peak reproduction. All of this under NIP, okay? I'm assuming it's I think I only need to come out. One and three, two units. What? One and three units. Sorry, sorry? Only for two units, only three. Oh, yeah, that's it. I'm assuming. It's the same as a PP property? It's also a P P property, right? For q property. Is it the same as q q property? What is the same? For for p equals q. What's the question though? I I you might be right, you don't have the p equals equivalent of having the p. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying this is a different object. The p might be different than q So um yeah and yeah so so right and um yeah. So, right, and yeah, so I think, and this doesn't use, this doesn't use Matusc's results. This is purely modern. Okay? In the proof of this theorem, well, I'll tell you, how much time do I have to do? Five minutes? Yeah, okay. Okay, so the real, the crux of the proof was the following theorem where we say it. So this is the So this is the previous term is the colour of this one. So again, I'm assuming TNI and M is the model. Suppose you have, suppose phi of XY is a formula over M and phi of X P doesn't Doesn't does not divide over m, then there exists some side y in the type v over m such that this is consistent. Yeah, yeah, but yeah, so essentially what the proof goes by proving this and then deducing the theorem I told you, essentially by compactness. Because maybe you can see it, because the point is you have this assumption that you have this phi psi with the PQ property, and then for every E satisfying psi, the type of the type of sorry, the form. Type of, sorry, the formula of higher x p doesn't divide by this fact, and then you can find this psi in the type of p, but the number of components you can find in the main components. So, really, it's a, it's, uh, you can't, this argument doesn't give any information on the number of components. Um, okay, um, yeah, so let me just tell you some some uh history of this uh and then does this have to do with soul dividing or something? Maybe. But soul dividing. Oh, I didn't think of that. Um I I don't think so, though. So um yeah okay. So some some history is that this was proved so this this theorem, I mean this theorem and then also the other one was proved by Pierre for epiminum theories first, but also with an extra assumption which bounces a number of coils. Which bounce a number of coils somehow, so he didn't do it for all the pre-minimal theories, only for some. And then he also generalized this to all NIP theories, again with this assumption about coils. And also there is a result by Kier Serge proving a storial version of this, which is conjectured for all Dicky-minor theories, and they proved it for some Dicky-mina theories, for example for those with definable squared functions. And then Gallatin and Lotic proved this theorem for distal theories. When he said of NFP, you write distal here. So they proved it for distal theories. And actually, the proof I have follows their status quo essentially. And there's exactly one place where they use this statue. And I don't. And and what else? Oh yeah, yeah. And what else? Oh yeah, yeah. So there's also a person called. I think I'm going to mispronounce his name. So yeah, his name is. Wait a second. His name is Pinoito. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sato and Jupal Cuevo. Cuevo? Cuevo? Almost said it corrected. Okay. Quero, I think. Anyway, I'm not the best at all semi. Had to jar. Dujar. Quero. Wow. Okay, if it's semi, then I do apologize. He proved it for he proved the version of this. He proved the version. So he proved a version of this theorem for a special case in which instead of assuming the whole theory, so he proved something which is better, also both. So it's better in the sense that you only assume the formula is MRP, instead of the whole theory is MRP, but you also assume the formula has physical dimension, physical density, sorry, less than two, which is pretty restrictive. But but yeah, so so uh okay, so there's there's an open question. Okay, so there's an open question, of course, whether one can prove this for just assuming the formula is in that instead of the theory. That's a question which I don't know the answer to. Can I ask? Would you then adjust which where psi comes from, or would you still take it in the full type of be? Wait, you're saying here? Like, would you make a psi? Ah, no, no, I'm talking about Natist. Sorry, sorry. He didn't talk about Falkinoda. He proved the one, the one I said before, but. The one I said before, like I said. Okay? You just took that. Okay? So also, there is also a uniform version. So you can ask, what does it mean uniform? So uniform means that I can change the model. I still assume the theory is MIP, but now I don't necessarily say that you have two formulas. Sorry, I'm looking at this, sorry, not six. So in in this in this in the uniform version, you have two formulas which are You have two formulas which have maybe an extra variable, which you may vary this extra variable. And you say that once you put some parameters such that with this extra parameter, they have the PQ positive for QB enough, then you can divide the side part to finitely many populas which you already know. I mean, these populas are huge. They don't depend on the model. On the bottom. I I don't have time to write it down, but if somebody wants to ask you the question, two questions. I can tell you the precise corporation. 24 version. And yeah, okay, so I'll finish. So the number n will not bear in the express function? Exactly, it won't. Yeah, that's the point. The number one and the psychology. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. We need n to be modeled. Question. Do you need M to be a model or any set? Can you change M to be a set? Mm. This here? Yeah. No, it's a model. Can you change to be a set? No, no extension base. No, I don't think so. I didn't think of that. No, I don't think it could work with a set. What an extension base. What? Oh, yeah, maybe an extension base. Maybe. The proof the proof won't work. I mean, the proof I think. Maybe I maybe maybe won't. Maybe nothing won't. Um yeah, I think the proof the proof won't work with in with that, but I think it's probably not true. And maybe you can find an example while yeah. Yeah, folks don't place different things. Yeah, but even Folks can I suspect it's not. I don't know, maybe it is. Okay, so I know this this theorem here with the the psi n's and psi 1 through psi n minus 1. Do you have any structure theorems about the psi's? Right, can you write them as a Boolean combination of like the off and psi or something like this? The off and psi or something like this? No, no. No. No. I mean, no. They just come for compactness. Right, but you might get compactness in a local text space or something. Yeah, I didn't, yeah, maybe, yeah, okay. Maybe you can, if you do kind of a find, if you really look at the proof, maybe you can find something, but didn't try. Formulate the theorem, sign. Is it formulate the full theorem? Is it in the five sine theorem? The type? Is it in the string? No, it's in the full type. No, it's in the full type with yeah, it's in the full type. Yeah. Yeah, but even this, even this. Yeah, you can ask, you can look at uh, you can ask what is this side? Well, it's not from problems. And that's that's that's your question time. So I think uh well I think you need the full type, but just to follow up on that, 'cause like if you have an opinion on like whether that Have an opinion on whether that theorem on the left could hold locally? Oh, or just assuming the formula is NIP? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a good question. I didn't think of that. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah, that's... No, my poof definitely won't talk. Wait, did maybe the tooth. No, no, the poof I have definitely won't talk. But maybe I mean and I actually you can ask whether this is true You can ask whether this is true when the formula is NIP and the theory is NTP2. Maybe that's a starting point. Because actually, if you look at the proof, there's essentially one place where you used, or maybe two places where you used NIP and NTP2 wouldn't be enough. So. I guess a simple question would be: if the formula is stable. What? Ah, yeah. If this formula is stable, then it's trivial, right? Because if this formula is stable, Because if this formula is stable and you know it doesn't divide or fork over the model, right, then it's already if you have a formula which is stable and doesn't fork over the model, then it's satisfiable in the model. Right, but if you allow maybe the parameter set is not a model, but it's just a random set of definable. It's extensible definable. Um right, but but you need right. But it's easy if this is uh um automatic growth. Automatic clothes. There you go. Can I make this story on the mic? You can make it in now, sure. Because next is an open session. So last time, 11 years ago, he and Ben, I stated the first version of Ethereum as an open question. Pierre said he thinks it's wrong. And he stated the second version as his open question. And when we realize we are compact, they are the same. So it took 11 years of the expired medium. So they took 11 years, so that's quite needed to solve. Did you not stick this process? But still, this concept. I remember. I remember. You were recording the problem session, so thanks, Aga.
