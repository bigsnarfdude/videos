Being recorded.  To Barcelona. Thank you. So, thanks to the organizers for this opportunity to present the work that we have been conducting at the University of Barcelona and the Self-Organized Complex People. So, yeah, today I will pick up the topic that we have started and that will save me some time in the introduction, where we show the work we have been doing for quite a few years now on active liquid crystals and active. Liquid crystals and active nematic. And in particular, I will focus on the world where we have interfaced this active layer with a thermotropic liquid crystal and see what phenomena has risen in that perspective. So first, just a disclaimer, this talk will be a similarity because there is no equation in this talk. So I hope it's interesting and stimulating for the audience, because there's a lot of phenomenology. You see that there's a lot of terminology, there are many open questions, and maybe problems probably that you could pause and be interested in. So, first, first doesn't work. I switch it on, it's better. So, first, just acknowledge in the collaborators. Of course, Frances Ariz with team in the group, and then Graduate students who Graduate students who experiment in particular, most of the things that we show are part of the issues of our antics. Some with this collaboration with former student Alberta Martinez, I will show some old results with still some unresolved issues of the abilities of our past student Paul Villamat, who is now a researcher in the Institute in Barcelona. Then we have a recent collaboration with another group member. With our group member, who is doing simulations in part of the data that we show here today. And then, of course, all these topics that we have started, for instance, like a few years ago, studying in collaboration with Armenian and Dmitri and on some of the experiments that I will show you. And then also part of what I will show here when we in collaboration with Alberto for Namulais and he's a student. He's a student. So, a very brief outline of what we'll be showing in this presentation. The brief, which is going to be briefer after the introduction by Clarence on Matting, I will focus on some particular aspects that I want to highlight. And then, most of my talk will be devoted to what happens to the active nematic when you interface it, in particular, with a very highly anisotropic ismetic liquid crystal. Liquid crystal, what is the role of interventional isotopes in this conditioning? And then I will describe an alignment transition that we have recently just studied in detail. And I will show some interesting phenomena that will happen when the system is placed under confinement and we see the emergence of some intriguing spatial temporal patterns. And then at the end, if I have some time, probably except a couple of minutes every sorry. Probably started a couple of minutes every sorry, I will maybe use this couple of minutes. I will prover the perspective. So let's the act the liquid crystal just modulates the actematic, but what happens to the liquid crystal? Because it's being constantly shared by all these codes. So this is a perspective that we have recently started, and I will try to show you some just a couple of points. Okay, so the kerosene tubing active thematic. I don't need to say anything more about it. To say anything more about it. I don't know if anyone has a question about the system, so we can just move to the next slide, which is how the emergence of this active pneumatic material when all these active filaments are spontaneously condensed at the water-oil interface. I just want to emphasize the fact that this material just has all these defects, and the fact that the core of these defects, these filaments are fluorescents, all these. These filaments are fluorescent, so these images are fluorescent microscopy. So the color of these effects are dark. And if you remember the many nice videos that Claire showed, there are many dark regions. This region are the void of darkness. So most of the simulations of these systems are are are are considering like there is a a uniform density. Okay, and they work for the most part, but the density is not concerned. The density is not homogeneous, okay? Because these voids here clearly have a lower density than the rays. And I will show later on that there is some patterning that shows clearly that the density is not much used. This material is also characterized by introducing lanescape, for instance, that keeps the array spacing between defects or the vortex distribution of the velocity field, like this is what I show here in this plot. show here in this uh in this in this plot so this active lane scales are balanced between uh between uh the gt of the filaments and the and the activity parameter where one wants to destabilize uh everything so one of the area and work that we did with this system is to uh try to uh study the uh you know how the this active material is affected by the viscosity by the viscosity of the oil that has to be a you know across the water oil interface okay so basically you just divide this this this So basically you just divide this setup with a well and use oils of different viscosities from low viscosity to extremely high viscosity. And in this, you see there's a flask and you will say that's a fluid. But still the active pneumatic form, but you see that the the geometry is extremely different, like at this at this end, basically the the uh there are lots of this uh of this uh hole. The system is extremely heterogeneous in this uh in this uh rocket. This grid. So, this interfacial green affects the geometry and also the dynamics of the app. So, with this in mind, then we move a step forward and say, okay, so we can play with the interfacial green, with the odd logology, to modify to affect the active matter. So, what if this oil is anisotropic? Okay, so why if we use a thermotropic liquid crystal? So, we need a thermotropic crystal. So we need a thermodynamic crystal that hopefully has very high isotropic phases at a temperature rate that we are compatible because our system is just a mix of proteins, enzymes, and those are very temperature-sensitive. And it turns out that our old friend HCV is fantastic for this purpose. So it has a semantic A phase, an anematic phase, but a temperature range that biocompatible. So that's what we are going up to. So basically, simply we just take our setup and we just change the And we just change the silicon oil that we have been using with HB. And that's the start of the presentation. So the first part would be just how the active nematic is being conditioned, is being affected by these anisotropic interfaces, and then the last part just a glimpse of the other perspectives, right? Of the other perspective, right? How is the leaping cell driven? What happens with this with this pattern? This pattern, of course. So, these are some experiments that we did some years ago now, in which we interface our active pneumatic with HCV. First, in the pneumatic phase, that's what we see here. And if I run the movie, well, we see just a typical. Just a typical active turbo regime. And if you analyze this row, we don't really see any angle. I must say that here we place this cell inside of a 0.4 tesla magnetic field, one tesla magnetic field, doesn't matter, to align the magnetic field crystal, and even that we don't see any any signs of energy. That may be not surprising because the difference in viscosity. At the difference in viscosity along the electron field at the perpendicular, we just made it within a factor of hospitality. So there is no very high altitude. Things change dramatically when we modify the temperature a little bit and make HCB go into the aspectic A phase, which is extremely nice drop. The aspective A it's a layer phase and flow along the layers has a moderate viscosity, but flow perpendicular to the layers is extremely The layers is extremely property. They're simply causing. So, first, the first PDF here corresponds to the active pneumatic layer in contact with this phase in the absence of external phase. Here, there is no map. And we already see chromatic differences. So, the average viscosity is much higher, so that's why we see many, many more effects. But what's more remarkable is the spread of this, for instance, this kind of swirls over here. Kind of shrills over here, right, where you see that the active filament is being trapped in kind of a vortex. And there are vortices like this type of different places of different sizes, so that's the first observation. And what happens if we do the same experiment now, keeping the liquids and the magnetic field, so the magnetic field aligns the liquid crystal, this alignment is scary as we go into the smectic A phase, and the result is that the flows of the actual. The flows of the actionatic are aligned. You see there's this anti-parallel flow lane just as a consequence of the contact with the control. If we just time-aggrage this, maybe this highlight of this effect, would you see that when the oil phase is in the nearly isotropic logogene, right, in the nematic phase, the time average is almost like a homogeneous. Almost like a homogeneous isotropic while if the data emerge in the O in this and the isometric A phase. Well, we see clearly now these thrills that I described, we see how they have a core very stable in time, otherwise this would average at a gray level. And basically that that over the active sealamit is kind of avoiding this from this component. And in the case of the alignment, where we see clearly this dark light corresponds to the traces where Corresponds to the traces where the defects are located. Because plasma half defects are the ones that drive the flow, and clearly they are aligned along these dark lines. Because the core is the void, you have to feel itself. Why does this happen? Well, the interpretation was in the absence of magnetic field. Well, we know that at the HCV, that the boundary conditions of the water-oil interface are planar. So you have this. So you have these experimental images. These are this beautiful apron styling of Torre Alpha Camp Collier's domain where at the interface that the planes describe this circular intersection. So basically at the filament just find the AC flow direction, which are the circumference, and then just basically just describe this rotation trap along this domain of different sizes. In the presence of the magnetic field, In the presence of the magnetic field, the magnetic planes adopt this so-called bookshelf geometry, perpendicular to the magnetic field. And then this direction perpendicular to the magnetic field is now what gives the easy flow direction. And as a consequence, that's what we mean a lot by the later. In both cases, we find that the importance of this active lanescape, in taking the This active lanescape. In the aligned case, well, the active lanescape basically gives the spacing within this bank. If you change the rigidity of object activity, we would say how this spacing changes. And in the case of this soft trapping, we would say the active latest basically determines what is the size of this domain that will be capable of trapping with. If the domain is too small, the flow will always be scattered by this value. So always things are. So always this activity skill has an important role in these kind of systems. I must say that just phrase from the press, there is this preprint in our guide where Carmen Mitchie and collaborators just have a beautiful analysis of this problem. So we see how we can control the system. So we are the masters of this active monatom with its We taint, so it's out of equilibrium, but we are capable of taking. But not really. I mean, this material is a troublemaker, and even though you think you have taped it, and you see that periodically, it just abandons this nice aligned configuration and just expels defects everywhere. And a sequence of this is illustrated here in these cartoons. This is the nicely configuration. So, this is the nicely configuration where we have this soft trapping by the easy flow direction in this fluidal focal connected domains that I showed you a few minutes ago. But then these aligned filaments are unstable, and any pack link just develops a band instability, and that results in the injection of effects, and even injection of effects into the core of this vortex. There is some effects, annihilation events, and so eventually everything relaxes and comes back. And so eventually everything relaxes and comes back to this aligned configuration. Okay, so this is simply event of these transversal instabilities that arise because you have these active filaments that are extensive and that's an unstable situation and needs to be disaligned. It happens here and it also happens in this aligned state. I mean if you look here, well this is just another parameter map that basically industries how well aligned. Map that basically illustrates how well aligned the velocities with respect to these info direction. So yellow is very well aligned and blue is not so well aligned. But if you just look at the raw fluorescent microscopy image, you just see like if you look at them in one spot, you see like now this is nicely aligned, but then after a while you see there is this it stops the flow and then it shows this lateral prolongation. So and why does it happen? Well, because you have all all these thick bundles of thick bundles of all these uh uh thick uh uh okay yeah those thick pandasophilamins that are unstable with respect to this lateral instability so this becomes unstable so it produces this uh this uh this lateral uh this lateral events okay so our material no matter what you do is intrinsically unstable okay on average if it unaverages okay you see the Average, if you time average it, okay, you see, you find an average nice tame behavior, but instantaneously, it's a it's a stable. And this that would be important enough in a so the first thing or the second thing I want to focus before showing like this, you know, our ability to use the interfacial geology, interfacial angle that we can get systematic, is uh is a detailed study that we have uh conducted to to analyze this uh this uh alignment this aligning study. Alignment statement. There is a transition from the active turbulent state, this isotropic, we could say, to this alignment state, which basically is strongly an isotropic. And within that, I use carefully changing the temperature across the pneumatic phase transition of HC, which is known experimentally that this phase transition is continuous, or at least it's later here. Or at least it's latent heat is measuring small. So if we look at this sequence, we go from the disorder to the aligned state by changing just one tenth of a degree centigrade, the temperature, and we see kind of like a continuous event. So the question was that is this really a continuous transition, which would be like maybe the obvious thing, a natural thing, because Obvious thing, a natural thing, because if the driving mechanism is this continuous creology transition at the interface, because that's what happens with HCV, then probably the response of our active material will block. So then let's analyze that in the data and see if that's the case or not. So here I'm just showing you some data at different temperatures in the aligned state, in the disordered state, and at a temperature. State and at a temperature just in between the two states. At the top, there are just the fluorescence images, but probably the most interesting panel is the central one, and this is the most visual one, where you just plot the component of the flow velocity along the easy flow direction. Okay, so black is towards the bottom and white is outwards. So if we look at the aligned state, well clearly there are these stable boundaries. Well, clearly, there are these stable bands that flay through today, but clearly the flow is very well organized, so there's no problem there. If we look at the other end in the disordered state, well, the flows are also disorganized. There's no clear structures that would be prevalent in this time. But now let's look at the intermediate state, and this temperature that is in the transition between the aligned and the disorder state. If we look at this video, At this video, well, clearly it's not doesn't seem to be in general as disordered as this one. And there are some instances or just now that we observe these flow lengths, but these flow lengths, they are not a stable, and sometimes they don't feel the whole field of view. So this transition region is kind of like a hybrid between the aligned orbit and the divorce. Let's see if we can. Let's see if we can quantify that. If we can quantify that a little bit. Well, the first thing that, you know, the simplest thing to do is we define this. Oh, it's repeated here. This other parameter, which is basically just show how well aligned the velocity field is with respect to this flow direction. And we measure this order parameter, which changes point. Parameter who changes continuously between the aligned value and the disorder value. Oops, sorry. I was in a WhatsApp but I mean what was I? The other parameter. So now, of course. Now, of course, the fact that this is continuous, okay, it is continuous, it's a second original transition. But yeah, you know, what would happen if the transition was discontinuous? What would we get? Well, we're getting something like this as well. If we measure an average order parameter, even if the system has consistence of domains, we will get an average value with its finite size defects. So basically, the fact that it is continuous doesn't tell us. What tell us something interesting are the error bars in the. Are these the error bars in this cross? These error bars basically just tell us how dispersed is the other parameter in a single temperature with respect to the average value. So in the aligned state, you see the error bars are very small, so the system is really aligned and there's not much dispersion around that value. In the disordered state, the errors bars are a bit larger, so there's a little bit of of fluctuation. There is more disorder, but what i is interesting, um What is interesting, and that's very reproducible, is the fact that in the transition region, the error parts are larger. So basically this tells me that in the transition region, there is this average order parameter, but there are strong fluctuations about this average value. So that's telling us something. That's telling us something over there. So let's look at not at the average value, but like Value, but not at the temporal and spatial average of your parameter, which is what I show in the previous plot, but just at the spatial value as a function of time, which is what we're plotting here, along with a bit. So we see that there are some small fluctuations, but then every now and then, and one is coming now, there is a very strong outward fluctuation, and if you look carefully, that corresponds to the outward fluctuation, and this corresponds to the flux. Apple equation corresponds to the formation of some precursor of a line flow rate. It just decays and becomes disordered again and then it comes up again. So it seems that there are parts of the system that want to be aligned, but not all of them are not aligned at the same time. If we kind of take this idea and measure the time erosion of this ordered parameter again in the disordered state, in the aligned state, and in the In the alignment state and in the intermediate state. And let's see what, you know, maybe all this happens, you know, maybe similar things happen all the time, this type of fluctuation. So let's look at the fluctuations, for instance, in the disordered state. There are fluctuations, you know, high-amplitude fluctuations of this ordered parameter, but if we just measure, for instance, the distribution of velocities in the system, for instance, in a minimum, I mean a maximum of this should. I mean, a maximum of this fluctuation, we see that always it's a kind of going into an isotropic trend. Or at least there is no particular favorite direction. Remember, this is performed inside of a magnet, so there is an easy flow direction that is very well defined. It's a vertical in the equation. If we perform a similar observation, similar study in the aligned state, we see that there are this narrow amplitude oscillation and basically Arrow amplitude oscillation, and basically, even if it's in a hill or in a valley, the flow is perfectly aligned along these. Now, it is in this intermediate region where if we compare the average flow orientation in a hill and in a valley, we see that in a hill there's a big trend towards alignment, and in the valley, this trend dampens and it just basically approaches the ice. Basically, it approaches in the isotropic value of A Tel and Harmonic State. So, this system, there is this kind of this oscillatory behavior that one can just use as a hint that maybe it's not such a continuous transition anymore. Maybe there are some aspects of this transition being discontinuous. But of course, I mean, this may be some indirect evidence, but the strong evidence would be to show coexistence, right? If you see phase coexistence of a disorder. Coexistence of the disorder and the order phase, okay, it's a first-order transition, it's continuous. And that's what Olga managed to do here. It's a pine-thinking process because basically, regardless if it's ordered or disordered, there is nematic order in the system. It is always an acting pneumatic. So the difference between the two phases is one being kind of isotropic and the other one being anisotropic, but it's always this is mnatic color. But it's always this mematic colour. But if you analyze the, you know, with the help of this ordered parameter map, when you identify, you know, time by time, regions where you would see the ordered parameter was in the high value surrounded by regions where the order parameter was low. So basically we showed at least this coexistence of this ordered and disordered state and that these transition seems to be discontinuous. So this is interesting because. Okay, so that this is interesting because the driving mechanism is through a continuous phase transition of H C D, but the response of the active system is discontinuous. So this basically goes along the lines that these materials always want to go its way and it has this obvious of activity that in this case is basically increases, locally increases maybe the activity and that helps to align the system. Helps provide the system and so on. So, the result of this study seems to be compatible with the fact that this phase transition is so this is the second study I wanted to share with you. The third one, which is an ongoing study, there are many open questions here, many that I'm happy to share with you and hoping for some ideas. Some ideas. Basically, it's going to again work with the artismatic in the aligned state, right? So, magnetic field, HCB in the Moucher geometry, and we have our nicely aligned flows. But now, we know, as Claire showed, that this system is also strongly affected by confinement. So, confinement can even just change the isotropic flows into other. Change the isotropic flows into a dielectric flow. So that's what we're going to do here. Just perform our basic experiment, but now instead of using like an empty cell, we want to put some basically some channels, some barriers in the cell so that we just have like straight channels of different widths and length and so on. And then we want to photosource our active material to flow within these channels. And this is what we see. So basically, this is a magnetic field. You know, this is a magnetic field, so this is the easy flow direction. And remember, in the absence of barriers, this would result in this nice, you know, aligned flow, these vertical stripes of material flowing up or down. And this is actually what seems to happen in the narrow channel. Narrow channel can distinguish like a flow rate that goes downwards along the center, and then we show some back flows in here towards the wall. But if you look at the But if you look at the intermediate and in the wider channel, it's hard to say that it is something different from just the derescopic active to move in, at least at first glance over this. But if you take the time average of this image, there's a surprise. And the surprise is that we see that the average density of fluorescence, you know, in this system. So basically, this shows that the So basically this shows that the um uh the defects, which are the dark part, the defects basically just flow along a pattern and between them there are these kind of extagnation regions where there are no defects seldom pass over there and that's what these regions are mainly occupied by the fluorescence filter. Okay, so this is this uh you know nice curving bone pattern that fills this uh uh this channel, you know, in the white and in the in the in the middle. In the middle width, not in the narrow channel where we have this nice aligned channel. Actually, you see this flag for the task stride that corresponds to the four of the class won't have defects. So there are these structures in the leadsy field. Of course, if you want to show this to our theorist friends, and they're more. Friends and their models consider that their density is homogeneous, then there is a problem here because this cannot be reproduced. Well, let's measure something that at least we could compare, which is the velocity field. So let's measure the velocity field, and from it, let's compute the vorticity field. And we find that there is a pattern of vortices that are organized inside of this point. So they are not, of course, apparently. So, they are not, of course, apparent at first glance, but if you just measure the vorticity, this is average. The instantaneous vorticity will look like this, but if you take the average, you will clearly demonstrate that this is a stable pattern. Okay, so basically we see that this spatiotemporal pattern of the density field has a correspondence in the flow field. And in fact, if you overlay the two, If we overlay the two, we find that these hot spots of density, they are just concentrated in between these points. Yes. To get a sense of how strong this effect is, do you know, Afghan, how the maximum vorticity on the plot on the right compares to the maximum instantaneous vorticity on the plot on the left? By right, you mean here and here? What do you mean by right and left? What do you mean, right, and left? Sorry, in the average, is the reddest red and the bluest blue similar in magnitude to the highest vorticity we see in the movie on the left-hand side? It should be. Z-time average. You measure the velocity field here, you can measure the vorticity map, and you take the time average. Yeah, yeah, so basically this vorticity is just from the velocity field over here. And if that's what you want. Signal to noise is what I'm after. Is it mostly signal? I mean, like if you if we comp maybe then we should compare this to the average hotel. I don't know. Okay, oh, I have time. It's got computer bottom. Oh, and you may be wondering what's the, you know, what's the, you know, the good old X CB doing in all this, watching all this happen. Okay? So All this happen. So let's take a look at the leaking crystal. How many long time? So let's, now that this is like a bright field image, kind of, these are those erbawats, sorry. But the channels are here and here. So now we're going. And here. So now we're going to see that the nematic aspect of phase transition with in the presence, this is in the contact with the acting pneumatic, but the acting pneumatic is at the end of the experiment. The actinatic is there. But what we show you like this, so that the surface chemistry hasn't changed. So you just go into this matrix A phase and what we see is the appearance of lots of lot of these feather-like disc nations that usually have parabolic domains and sort of things that typically appear when there is like curvature when the actinum is in contact with a coarse surface. So that's why we think there should be some meniscus at this outward interface that basically causes that. What happens if we we study this with the same experiment now while that diplomatic is running? While that pneumatic is running, okay, so let's melt it, go into the pneumatic, and then go back into this magnetic, but yeah, it's running. We see a formation of the same kind of structure, but it's interesting that just because of the steering, because of the activity, these structures, they kind of become organized, right? And they develop. Here they're kind of like randomly arranged, but here they become really, really nicely arranged. And with an arrangement that depends on the width of the With the channel. This observation basically caused us a lot of trouble because we thought, aha, so there is, because until now we thought, okay, there is basically this hydronic coupling between the two and nothing else. But here, oh, maybe there is more than that. Maybe there is some coupling also between the rotational field and the detector and so on. But at the end, I think we have enough evidence just to say that simply the steering provided. That simply the steering provided by the active pneumatic just accelerates the natural ripening of this structure that will just happen with time. And the fact that this is also different in terms of different widths can also be related to the to the uh to the uh to the fact that the uh that the that the flow the average flow of the material is lower for narrow channels. That's also also their answers. That's also also okay. So this is a you know a nice observation, but but at least you know to the base of our of our knowledge is not really relevant, it's not crucial to understanding you know this particular matter I saw in the previous one. Maybe you were wrong, maybe you have wanted to show you because this is nice and maybe you know like some ideas in the objects. Okay, so can we offer an explanation? Can we offer an explanation for the special temporal pattern? Well, at least we can offer like a cartoonish explanation of these quantities. But we think that the culprit of this are these transversal externalities. Remember that even when we have this nice aligning state, this is not stable, and then just periodically, it just has this transversal externality. Here, I'm just zooming in a part of the system where you can see that the material seems to be flatly aligned, but then all of a sudden it's not so happy anymore. All of a sudden, it's not so happy anymore, and then it stops. And then, basically, what it does is just like you know, injects like you know, anti-parallel effects in both left and right, and those are basically stop, and then the system just revolvers the easy flow direction and stop. So, basically, here we have these cross flows, right? The line flow, and then this kind of flow that just, you know, you know, every now and then with a remarkable purificity, emerges. Emerges transversally. And we think that basically that's what is happening in our system. In fact, if you just take the time average of this order parameter map, we see that there is some glimpse of some patterning here. So the system really wants to do some nice spatial temporal patterning, but when it's in the open, it cannot really succeed. But when it's confined, But with each confine, apparently these transversal instabilities may not be able to release all the stress that was accumulated and basically they have to coexist with the aligned flows. And you think that the result can just be, you know, with a cartoon understood as just being, you know, the result of two transversal flows, right? A flow pattern up and down, up and down, and then another flow pattern left, right, left, right. And if you just, you know, throw this in your notebook. You know, flow this in your notebook, you see that there basically you are describing a lattice of vortices and a lattice of destagnation bones. And that we think that is basically what we see in our experiments. And then there's Olga made this construction over here where she overlaid on a video just the position of the vortices that she measured independently. And here she tracks all defects and just to show that basically these extagnation points are just a forbidden. extamation points are just forbidden forbidden bands for defects. Defects will not go into this into this, for the most part, into this part and they are just trapped by the vortices and just jump from one vortex to the next. So this is where we are now and as you see there is plenty of room for mathematics models and simulations to try to understand what's going on here. Okay, so I want to devote just the last five minutes to this other perspective, which it's something that we considered a while ago, but I think we are now. Which is, now let's go to the perspective of the thermotropic liquid. So we have this, you know, this anisotropic liquid that all this nice pattern will look at it in the cross. You know, we've been close polarized, and now it's being sheared, right? It's being sheared by this complex flow. So, and in the middle, when you just injecting a magic crystal to a microphone challenges results in a beautiful scenario of phenomenology. So, let's look at our asymmetropic liquid crystal between at our system between cross-products. So, not in forests microscopy, but between cross-products. Influences microscopy, but we infros. And what we see is, you know, a very complex pattern. Okay, so this is a very thick layer, so this layer is like millimeters thin. Okay, so we see a complex pattern, but being this thin, I think, at least for us, it's impossible to really make any sense out of this. So what we would really like to have is this, but just with a very thin layer of the crystal, because if you cut any thin layer with the crystal, Crystal, because if you get everything there with the crystal, then now we can analyze, you can quantitatively analyze the correction patterns, we can extract the local fridge, we can just understand how this is oriented. And this is something that we have learned to do just very rich. To be able to prepare just a flow cell like a link crystal cell, but only that most of the space of the cell is occupied by the active space, and there is just a very thin. There is just a pretty thin oil layer provided by the supposed liquid crystal. It has to be a hydrophotic liquid crystal, and again, HCD works pretty well. And it has the side effect, and then we can just choose where we want to be the hematic or it doesn't make it behavior in place. And what we see was something similar that we saw over there, but now it's a thin layer. So having this thin layer and being equipped with a setup signal to. That with a setup signal to the postcode, where we can just, you know, in real time extract the local vibrant region. Now we should be able to analyze this flow alignment pattern, because this basically is a flow alignment pattern, which is given by this complex shear flow provided by the active active. And we want to add, you know, this is in the phase, and this is the thing getting actually in the selective gateway. But this is in the This is, in the respective phase, in the aesmectic A phase, it's a peculiar because in fact this very thin azmectic A layer just adopts a homotropic anchoring condition. So basically, in the absence of a steering zoom it up, in first quarter. But then, as you see here, then you get a certain amount of tilt and you get a very extremely small verification. This is magnified by contrast. And you see also this facility. Also, this fascinating pattern over here. So, this is a new set of experiments that we are just excited to explore. And in fact, someone even proposed that this may just be an example of a theoretical construction, which is defect-free active torbon. So, the state of our active mnematic is called active tolbooms, right? But it's clear by defect. But then there are models that describe this active torque in the absence of defect. Nice, but how do you do that? Of effect nice, but how do we do that experimentally? Well, maybe this would be how we put this. Okay, so just in line with the presentation, I took a graphical summary. So I have shown that the contact with an isotopic liquid crystal interface, such as a signature liquid crystal, is able to condition strongly the structure and the language of our activity. The structure and the lanes of our active layer. And in particular, in the case of this alignment state, we have analyzed the transition that turns out to be discontinuous while the driving mechanism was continuous itself. That under confinement, we see the emergence of this infrequent special control pattern that we are struggling to understand. And then that we have open these new perspectives of. perspectives of thermotropically crystal under flow conditions but under a very cold flow flow pattern. Here we can measure the flow pattern and the orientation of the active material using a fluorescence channel and we can measure the ordering of the active of the passive crystal layer using the color emissions. So with this we hope to be able to extract interesting quantitative information. interesting quality formation from these. So to finish, just to fight here via the funding agency, otherwise they will ask us for their money back and just thank you for your attention. Do you have any questions? I have a comment. I like your last slide that the turbulence is PFAC3. The point being is The point being is that hybrid-aligned nematic film has the symmetry of a vector field, and plus and minus one-half defects are prohibited. So, this is why you rarely realize a situation when these defects are... I mean, well, spontaneously, I think it tends to have. I will say, I don't know if you could say no defects at all, but sometimes you see some defects, but almost all the time, if you really look carefully. Almost all the time, if you really look carefully, it's because there's some last part. So, what is continuously? In this geometry, you cannot have isolated plus one half and minus one half. They should come either as integers or as something connected by a string. So, the actinematic has been, but it's the flow that it gets propagated. Okay, so, but of course in the casual actinematic flows and the ships are just connected, but Are not just connected. But yeah, so clearly the defect topology cannot be translated, it's forbidden by the topology, so that really it's a point in our favor to these. On that note, could you compare these results in the mematic page of the passive one to if you had an oriented planar alignment instead, so allowing easy access and then you And then you make sure the polarizer and analyzer extinguish that direction. So you only get directly, it moves away from that direction. We haven't done that. Okay, but basically, we could do that because basically, just depending here, usually we prepare this plate with... I mean, there are some, there's a bit tricky here. Okay, now think about it. Because how do we prepare this? I mean, you want to stabilize and the oil-water interface. So if this is usually. So if both if this is usually when this is planar, planar alignment is also kind of also hydrophilic most of the time. And then it will be very difficult to stabilize here an oil interface. I mean, everything will be taken over by water, it will be wetting with this water. So that might be a difficult question. We could put a magnetic field and just force, kind of force the line in one direction, and then just see perturbations around that. That could be opposite. I have a question regarding the unconference strength with the lanes, the bidirectional lanes. It seems that after each instability, the flow keeps the same direction. It's re-established in the same direction. That is what's initially. So the same you mean the same the same orientation? Yeah, in one lane, it was flowing one way. After instability, it starts flowing the same way. I mean they have to be alternated. I mean, they have to be alternated, uh I mean, probably like by also topology of the defects, because these parabolic defects and then the if if the next one wants to go in the same direction, there would be like a weird peak over here. So, the natural natural structure is this undulation, so one go up and the other one goes down. Yes, I understand that, Hans. Maybe my question is more about the memory. Yeah, I mean, these first instabilities they just they. Portion instabilities, they just affect a small portion of the system. The system, this is like, I don't know, one square millimeter, the system it's much darker now. Okay, so we're thinking like a regional deep perturb, but you know, then this is brought into the correct alignment by the older host system. Okay, so that's why you think the memories inside the whole active memory which is. I have a second question. It's about the PTMS channel. So they are close. So uh they are closed channels? They uh they are not I think they are not closed channels. Are they open? I think they are open. So okay, so I was a bit uh intrigued by the pattern that has stabilized when you time average and uh yes I thought if the channel were closed it could be an explanation. But no, I think they are they are not closed. I think no, no, definitely they are not closed because uh Definitely are not closed because they're way over all the first, I mean, they need to be filled. Okay, so they are close because basically, I mean, it's similar to what you do, but you know, the number of magnitude of the scale, okay? So you have to be able to feel them laterally. So they are geographical. So they're just like crests denoting a in a fat surface. They are not like enclosures. So you have like a like a, you know, like a So there is PDRS at the bottom as well. That's right, that's right. Yeah, there's a PDS bottom, and then there's, you know, there's some fields over here, and then, yeah. So we can go back and read.
