That are supposed to be really to promote thought and discussion. And so our first session will be by Johan La Kut together with Anna Bollywaito. And so thank you. Maybe we should say that in the afternoon there will be a discussion particularly focused on what morning speakers are saying. So do your homework and be ready for the afternoon. Well, thank you and thanks organized organizers for being us here in this beautiful place. Our talks will be with Anna about desingularization in Poisson geometry. So discuss some of procedures or results which exist in Poisson geometry or related fields about decimal. About decingularizing structures. And I will focus more on the, let's say, on the real part of the story. I will tell you some of these results in the real setting. Mostly focused on compact, in the compact setting or proper setting. And Anna will talk about the holomorphic setting or the semi-simple. Setting or the semi-simple setting. So, well, one, I think a lot of people are kind of interested in this procedure, so this is also why we chose to talk about this, because we are also very much interested and we discussed them many times. But as a disclaimer, neither of us worked in this field, so none of these results are ours. We're just going to talk about some some some of these are classical and so some are Of this are classical, and so some are new, some are not published, but are not ours. So, and the main idea would be, or the main question would be this. So, think about you, you start with the possible manifold and i and you would like to find a decingularization of this. So, you want to Of this. So we want to find another Poisson manifold with a Poisson map into phi tilde to mi which is regular. So such that let me enumerate here a wish list which would be likely to get well. First of all, that this fight here is regular. Is regular, meaning that all the leaves have the same dimension. The map P should be subjective and also proper. And this P should be a diffeomorphism between the regular part. Well, should be a diffeomorphism between the premium. Between the premium of the regular part of M, so of the union of all the leaves of maximum dimension to L. So this would be our differ more this. So this would be kind of the question in the possible question in the Poisson setting to build such Build such a singularization. So, if you look a bit at this picture, so what happens, this M has this top-dimensional leaves, so the regular part, and pi tilde has only regular leaves. So, for many of the leaves of M tilde, they will be set one-to-one to those of M. But then there are also. But then there are also some leaves up here which image will be maybe those of smaller dimension or maybe even some of them which are not closed. So somehow these are interesting phenomena that can happen. So this is one version of the question. Another version would be maybe you're not that lucky to build such a possible that lucky to build such a Poisson structure, but maybe instead of pi instead of pi tilde or instead of a Poisson structure, maybe you can build a Dirac structure which I did not put such an L on M tilde on M tilde such that basically these conditions hold, so such that L is Conditions hold, such that L is regular. And then you can ask sometimes that, I know, you could ask, for example, that this map here is forward, or you could even ask that it is backward rock. So in that setting, you have two options. And or instead of pi, you could ask here, instead of so structured, you could ask of having a algebra. On M field F which is regular and satisfy these properties, so which is regular and such that it comes with a Lie algebraic map from phi A T star m, which normally, well, which would be like an isomorphism almost everywhere. So, this is another type of question which one could ask. So, this would mean like they're singularizing in a way the Lie algebra T star. Okay, can I ask a question? Is there an example where it's possible of this? Yes. You can give an example. I know we'll give it. Okay. But but it will fail the third condition. The third condition. Yes, it will fail this one. Instead of this one in the example, and I will present, this will be a covering map, so it won't be that bad. Or maybe on something smaller. So and okay, so one way to construct the singularization. To construct decingularizations, and especially if we think about algebraic geometry and the decingularization of algebraic varieties, is by doing blow-ops. So, this is a standard construction. And I will explain for people who have forgotten what blow-ops are, just a little bit how this construction works. First, just for manifolds, but we'll use it a bit later. Later. So, first, as a techniques or blow-ups. Right, so and maybe I'll start just with this, explaining what is the blow-up, which I'll denote by a flip. Blow-up of Rm. So, this is a real blow-up. Of course, there are also complex blow-ups and of a point in RM, right? So, there is a In our ramp, right? So the usual picture that people draw is: well, you have Rn, you have the point, and you replace it by all the lines that go through the origin. So you replace the point by the projective space on the RF. When you identify, in this case, in this program, you identify opposite points. Right, so as a set. Right, so as a set it is Rm from which you remove zero and instead of zero you put inside a projectivization of R. Okay, this is its description as a set and as a manifold you identify this with the following construction. So and this is well This is where it gets its differential structure. You can think about it. There are pairs where this V is a point on a line in a lamp. Okay, so that's So, vectors on lines in RM. And if you think about it, well, if the vector is non-zero, this is this situation, then it determines the line. So you obtain this component, and when v is zero, you obtain here exactly the predictation. And this one you can view, so now this one is a smooth sub-manifold of Rm times the optimization of. The optimization of Rm. And this is where it gets its differentiable structure from. So, this is how it works if you blow up a point. Basically, it's a projectivity. And if you want to blow up now, if you have N inside M, a closed embedded submanifold, embedded submanifold. The blow-up. Well, you'll do exactly like that, exactly the same thing, but in the directions, it's transported to N, in M. M along. N will be first to remove N and then you add the projectivization of the normal bundle of N in N, which I'll denote with a new. which I denote with a mu of m in n okay and and then a differentiable structure I think the best way to describe it is using charts on M adapted to N, which split locally M as a product, a part in N and a part transverse to N. And in the part transverse to N, you apply this construction. First, when you apply this construction. So, basically, this is the best way to explain it. I'd like to be also to make you picture. So, think about this as N and R M, R 3, for example. And then if you blow it up, in each point, you take the normal space to it and you replace the point with the set of... So with the set of lines that point in the normal direction. Okay? Basically with the projectivization of the normal. And here, as kind of simple, well, as a remark here is that, which I will use in a second. And Mark, if you also have, for example, an action of a Lie group, so if G is a Lie group that acts on M and N is invariant, you can immediately see that this action lifts to the block. You can see that it will preserve and it preserves the standard space. Therefore, it will have an induced action on the normal bundle and then on the projectivization and then you have to check that this whole thing is smooth. Now the first decimalization result I want to talk about is about Is about proper group action, is for proper group actions, and this is following the book of Dastermat and Kolk on compact Lee group on Lie groups. First, Jorna, I want to talk about Dastermat, or at least from the book of Dastermat in the fore. And it is for proper legal practice. It is for proper Lie group actions, right? So that this will be such a result, a decingularization result, for the following setting. So you start with a Lie group T acting on a manifold, and this action is proper. Then there exists, let's say, M tilde. So G. say m tilde, so g manifold m tilde with such that g acts on m tilde, then an equivariant map P of m tilde to m such that it basically satisfies those properties. So such that so first the orbit, so now we will be testing the Orbit, so now we designularize the action in the sense that all the orbits of G on M tilde will have the same dimension. All orbits of G on M tilde have the same dimension. Okay, this is the first condition, and then I put the same conditions as here. The same conditions as here that this P is subjective proper, and that it satisfies that from the preimage of the regular part, the regular part here are the orbits of maximal dimension in M. This is a different one, it is M right, right? I'm correct. Right, so these are right is here, these are orbits of max dimensions. Sorry, so far M has no Poisson structure here. Yes, exactly. So there is no Poisson structure here, and the results that I will And the results that I will talk about, well, this is for proper group actions, then for legal points, and most will not have a possible structure somehow, but we'll see that these results are somehow related, and we'll see also some possible structures coming in. About the statement itself, are there any questions? And now I do want to get a little bit the proof of this result to see somehow how you can build how this decingularization is built in their proof. And I'll give a very so first of all, we look at and you notice like this. And we notice like this, so the space of the collection of all orbits, or the union of all orbits, where the dimension of the orbit is equal to S. Right, so we collect them all and the proof will be blowing up somehow, maybe not exactly this, how many faults, but somehow many faults will do. Manifolds, but some sub-manifolds of this ones. But I already said this, that some sub-manifolds of this ones. So, the first remark is this, that this strata where the orbits have the same dimension, they are all submanifolds. Or more precisely, each connected component Component of such an MS is an embedded subnet. I would like to explain a bit why this holds. So this uses the linearization of The linearization of proper group group actions around orbits. So I'll take this x in MS and I will construct a special, let's say, chart or neighborhood around x, or neighborhood is better said, where it will be clear that this ms is embedded in that neighborhood. So I take this ms into ms, and we know that the action is proper. And we know that the action is proper, so this implies some sorry action is proper, this implies some thing. So first of all, the orbit itself is closed. Then the stabilizers, so I belong this by g index x, so this is the stabilizer x. This is a compact subgroup. And third, so this is what follows. And then we'll have a local normal form for the action around the orbit. But for that, let me also. So that uses one more piece of information, which is the fact that this stabilizer acts with. this stabilizer acts naturally on first of all it acts naturally on the on the tangent space to m at x and because it stabilizes x by the differential and then here you it will fix the tendon space to the orbit and then therefore it will act on the coordinate. Right, so this I will Right, so this I will denote by simply by nu x. This is the normal space to the orbit at a point of x. So gx has this meaning. And for proper group actions, the group itself, Gx, the stabilizer, and this linear representation, they determine an open neighborhood of the orbit of twelve fields. So there is maybe a right. So, there is maybe a writing on the first blackboard. There exists, so this is the linear realization theorem is going to kiss. I think in the book they call it the Q theorem, and the most important part of the proof is the slice theorem. But let me just call it the linearization theorem. So the conclusion is that there exists u a g invariant neighborhood of the orbit and And there exists a G-equivariant ditheomorphism phi between this neighborhood U and the local model. And then the local model is constructed out of that data. So it is, you take the product of G. You take the product of g with this linear space and then you mod it out by the diagonal action of gx. And here, so here you act on the right by g minus 1, so you make it into a left action, and you act on the left and you take that picture. And because here you acted on the right, you can still act with g on the left, so this is why this is a g space. This is why this is a G space. And now in this local form, I can look at what this Ms is. So Ms are points where the dimension of the orbit equals S. We know that X is in there. So let's look a bit at how the orbits look in this neighborhood. So the orbit will Will be all of the form, so I can just look at this local model, there will be all of the form g times gx times an orbit of this gx. And such a thing is, of course, isomorphic to G modulo the stabilizer of this D in or V in the normal space LX. And this is the stabilizer of V in GX. Right, so G G V is the stabilizer of V in GX. Turns out to be also a stabilizer in G. Right, so these are the orbits and now if we want them to have the same dimension as the orbit to X, so then what happens? So then what happens? So then we would like these two groups to have the same dimension. Because one is d1 tv and the other one d1 dv and the other one is d1 dx. So then you want that the dimension of dx equals the dimension of dv, which is equivalent to because what is included in the other one means that the isotropy algorithm. The isentropilier debris or the V algebra of these two are the same, which is also equivalent to the fact that so V is in this space and it means that V belongs to the part on which GX to freedom. So then we have obtained our interface. have obtained our intersection. So then we it follows that I of, can people still read here? I don't know, that u intersected with ms that we built is precisely under this diffeomorphism is g times over gx x dx. Okay? And this thing on the right hand side thing on the right hand side is a closed subanic of the since it's locally closed it would be means it's an embedded subany and now right and now the procedure works as follows so you start blowing up some of these connected components but to make things very But to make things very nicely, let's do the following. So we put all the connected components of the same dimension. So let me just, you know, do that. So C is the collection of connected components of M S for some S. Okay? And then we blow up first the A and well what they prove in the And well, what they prove in the book is that this wants a mass ratification of them. I'm not going to talk about that too much, but I'm just going to take the lowest dimension of strato. So let's call this dimension C of M. So this is the minimum of all the dimensions of such connected components. We take C of M, right? So what happens if this C of M. So, what happens? If this C of M equals M, equals the dimension of M, then we are basically done. That means that this M is regular. That all the leaves, all the orbits have the same dimension. Right, so in this case, we are done. And now, in general, so we will blow up this sub-manifold. So, N is the union of all the connected components. Of all the connected components of this dimension C of n. So it's what we write like this: is the union of the connected component C in current C with dimension C equals this C of that. Right, and then what holds is that this is a this is the closed. is to be closed closed the gene variant submanifold gene variant submanifold and the next step is to replace M by the blow-up of N inside M. So now we replace M by the blow-up of M. Right, so as I said earlier, gx natural noise blow-up, and you can see that the blowdown map satisfies all these properties. It's objective proper and then we repeat this procedure, but of course we have to know that things become better. And you can see that, let me write it, it's a small. write it as a small of fact or of a claim or is that the C of this low up N is strictly larger than the C of M. Right, so we really improved something. You will not have any more strata in this C of lowest dimension. And this is not difficult to see. And why is that? And why is that? You basically, what you do here, you are removing so I just want to write here a statement and maybe this will explain a little bit the spectrum given here. Who you approve, but just explaining this a little bit. So wh why this holds this holds of because of this kind of simple memo memo is that A is a connected compact D group and you take a representation of it. So this is a linear representation of K. Of k such that the fixed point sets, this fixed point set is zero, then it follows that if you act on the projectivization of B on the projective surface, the fixed point set becomes trivial. And this is simply to see, because if you would have here a fixed point, that would be a fixed line, and you'll have a That would be a fixed line, and you'll have a one-dimensional sub-representation, and every one-dimensional sub-representation representation of a compact connected lead loop is triple. But it's kind of simpler. And you apply this, so you apply this, apply this to, in our construction here, to K being the connected component of the stabilizer of an X in N. On X in N and D being the normal space of any M. And then you'll see that somehow if you blow this up, you'll replace the transverse dimension with the predictization of this vector space, of the normal space. Space of the normal space, and there the action will have normal fixed points, so the orbits would be larger dimension. Correct. So this was a... Yeah. I'm a little confused, Johan. What if you have, say, a torus acting? And you have a weight space decomposition? I have a question about this. Lemma. Yes. But K was a torque, so yes. I'm I'm assuming that the fixed point set is trivial. Yeah. So you take a direct, it's a direct sum, say it's a complex representation. Then this is a real law. It's a real plot. Okay. Yes. All right. So a compact connected group has no one-dimensional real representation. Okay. So one coronary Okay, so one corollary of this whole theorem and of the construction, which I think constant dimension by one by one applied? I want to talk about this in a second after I give you a small corollary. So the quotient of this Of the decingularization by G. So the orbit space of this one is an orbifold. It's an orbifold decingularization of the original orbit. So this is kind of nice. So you do this whole construction, but then at the level of the of the orbit spaces you obtain a decingularization of the orbit space by normal fault. Orbit space, by an order for so this is kind of nice, and this is because of well, this is something you can prove by that the local models. So now about Louis' question. Let me phrase it as follows. So is it possible to have N? So this is the question. the question can we does there exist a decingularization does there exist a decingularization m tilde such that all orbits are are isomorphic. As G spaces. Right, so this means basically what G, because the orbit Gx is isomorphic as the G space Gypsy X and Y in M tilde. Right, so this is more than just having the dimension, the same dimension, or it The same dimension, or it is equivalent to the isotropy groups being conjugate, right? So g gx g minus 1 equals gy. There exists g such that this, so for every x and y, quantifiers, for every x and y, we can tell that isotropy groups are quantified. That's when these are. So these are things. And you might ask this question and then the projection of the designularization would be a project only on I didn't want to introduce what the principal orbit type is, but on an open dense subset of M, this holds. And that part is. Holes and this part that part is called the principal orbit curve. So you want to change the other orbits such that they also become like this. And this can be done. So this was proven by Pierre and Melrose. So first, but you have to change a little bit some things. So first, so if So if we allow either we allow that m tilde is a manifold with corners, so this is a paper that they have. If we allow m tilde to be a manifold with corners and their roof in a way is Roof in a way is similar to this one, but or in the same spirit, but they don't do the this real blow-up, but they do what is called the spherical blow-up. Thanks to that kind of topologically, well, it produces a boundary, it's like removing an open tube around the submit for topologically the spherical tube. Right, so this is one or then Then you can kind of, so once you have this manifold with corners, you can kind of double it and glue it to itself, the margins, and so on, and you can obtain one without corners. But then you will not have a diffeomorphism on the principal part, you will have a multiple colour. Right? So, or if we allow the projection from m tilde from k at minus one, and now I use. Minus one, and now I'll use what we said, but without previous training. So this is M3. So the principal part. So this will be the part of the regular part of M where all the orbits are isomorphic on the spaces. If this want to be a covering map, a covering covering projection. Right, point will be multiple multiple cover. Are there any questions for this? This was the story I wanted to tell about proper legal actions. Now, this result has been generalized to proper legal points. And this is what I want to talk about next. This is a theorem which appears in the PhD thesis thesis of Pearson Wong. Here's the one and here has a post mark and so you can state it as follows. So you start with the G now over M, a property. And then they proved that there existed the singularization of the base. There exists P from M tilde to M which is again a proper proper And it's obtained by a series of blow-ups. So it's rejective, rejective, and such that T from Pf minus 1 of M reg. So the regular part here are all the points where the orbits of G have maximum dimension. M reg is ideal. difficult difficult and uh and uh with an and and this map has an actual has a comes with an action of G so and an action of G on P that's a G Lie groups act on maps and a Lie group Maps and allegropoids act on maps. So with all orbits of the same dimension. So with all orbits of the same dimension. Right, so then once you have this, so g x on this map, then you can of course construct construct is I'll call this G tilde which is the action report of G on this M tilde. So it's really the new report over M tilde. And you can think about this one. The action is on the second P. There's two maps please. Maps P? No, I should have only one. You have the first one here? The first one here? There exists P and an action of G on this peak, on this map. So basically this G acts on its base, like any Lie group point, and then you blow up some parts of the base, and the action will, you continue having an action, because these parts will be invariant submanifold, and then it acts naturally on the normal button to any such invariant submanifold. Then you continue doing this. So you you'll continue having this action. You'll continue having this action. And you have, so basically, this semi-direct product, when you think about it, you basically did that singularization in a way too. So this one will have orbits of the same dimension. And the proof goes, as I explained a bit before, in the same direction. Before in the same direct in the same way, and it uses also the linearization. So, proof uses the linearization of legal points, of proper legal points around orbits or even I think they only use. Or even, I think they only use actually the one of around the points of zone. So this tells us that, well, well, I'm not going to explain, but basically it tells us that locally this G, the small enough open neighborhoods, it will look like exactly such a semi-direct product of a linear action and times times the theory for. times the pair group of an open subset inside or. So this is the d group point over mu x times and using this part you kind of reduce everything again to representations of convex units. And because we're only using a you're we're only look you're looking at this strata of dimensions, this is enough. Dimensions, this is enough for us to profit. So, right. So, here I wanted to what I mentioned a little bit before also part of the proofs of this entire is constructed out of a series of logs. And what happens is you have this in general that if n inside m is gene variant and a closed invariant gene variant, some form. Team variant subway hole, then G acts on the blow. G acts, and you can construct the action on the blow. And this is basically because it will act on the normal bubble. It has a natural action on the normal bubble where it's happening for the energy project. And what is also interesting is that this one, you can also identify. This one you can also identify with the blow-up. There exists a blow-up construction in the category of group points of G along the sub-group point, the restriction of G to N. I wanted to mention this because I think this construction in general also for the algebra is very interesting and Interesting, and this is somehow what I'm hoping to manage to summarize more things. And I also learned about this construction in this room five years ago from Claire De Boy. She explained. So this was this. Right, so here I finished with this story, and now I want to continue with another decimalization, and this is the bi-de singularization of I don't know. Nistor, I think, has some papers in the direction, but I don't know what's I don't know that precisely. My question is that it's. My question is that it's not written down, but all the ingredients are available. This is what I wanted to make next adjoint representation of Of, so we start with K is a compact Lie group. It's compact, connected. And we look at its rep its action, its linear action on its league problems. And this is the one for which I'll explain its uh while I'll explain this while designularization or while desingularization or while resolution, which will be of a different type. It will not be, or maybe it is of the same type. So this is one of the discussion problems if it is of the same type. But the way we'll construct it, it will look very differently. So first of all, let me just remark here something that That for this representation, we have the following: that an element x is in the regular part of this action, so its orbit would be of maximal dimension if and only if its stabilizer, kx, is equal. And why is this? This is, well, you can prove it, I think, in many ways. You can prove it, I think, in many ways. One way to prove it is that you can take an invariant matrix. So take this a key invariant invariant matrix. So for example, the negative is a killing form. Okay. And then being invariant means that, well, at xyz, the inner product will be the same plus y. is plus y and x z equals zero. And now this implies the following that the image of the adjoint of x is exactly the part of the kernel of the adjoint of x. Okay, but uh what is this space? So this means that the tangent space x to k decomposes into the varying sum of the two, but this one is exactly the tangent space to the orbit of K. Right? The image of the adjoint would be exactly the tangent space to the orbit, and a kernel of the adjoint. bit and a kernel of the adjoint would be exactly the speedy mass of kx right so this implies that the normal representation mu x would be exactly kx as kx representations right and this this explains why this property holds because we said at a point Because um we said that a point is regular if and only if this uh normal representation is trivial. And the normal representation is just the edge of representation, so that one would be trivial precisely for a big and yellow cross. Okay, so now this wheel resolution works as follows. So we take, I call it k tilde, like a resolution, will be pairs x comma t. x comma t where this x is a point in t and t is the maximal maximal abelian sub algebra machine okay so we look at this and let me also note that Let me also note that this is equivalent to T is included in Kx and T is a maximum abelian sub-algebra of T. And why is that? I mean if X is included in abelian sub-algebra, it means that it collides with X, this abelian sub-algebra, so include it in K. Include it in Kx because those are all that commute with X. So one implication is trivial. And if T is a maximal abelian algebra included in Kx, then a bigger one which would be included in X, in Tx will be the one, in Kx will be the one where you also add X, but this one is already maximum, so X has to be. And now what do we see? So we see, for example, and then the projection. We see, for example, and then the projection would be just the projection k of the first component. Right? So, so this would be the projection. And then we see already, so p at minus 1 of k regular will be basically pairs of these forms, so x, and then p has to be kx. Right, so we already see that it will be a bijection at least at this level. And now, I mean, I'm not going to prove other things, I'm just going to tell you a bit more properties of this decimularization. So, first of all, And so first of all, you can write it also in a different way because all maximal, right? We have this property that all maximal, all maximal billion are conjugate, are k conjugate. But then because of that, that means that the map from k times t, so we fix one, so So we fix one, so let's say T is fixed. We fix such a maximum obedience. So from K times T to K, which sends an element small k at X to at X of at K of X not at K of T K of T. So this one is surjective, and then you can look at its fibers, and it's kind of simple to see that this would be exactly the normalizer. So you have to model by the normalizer of T. And then, sorry, to K. And if you more doubt your opinion, And if you mod out, you'll obtain here isomorphism. And so, this is a different model for the stable space. And here, if you take this quotient, reacts trivially, so the Lie group of T, so let's call this capital T, is the Lie group, the connecting Lie group of T. So this would be a maximum torus torus in K. You can write it as also K mod T. also k mod t times over w t where this w is the quotient so m k t modulo t and this is the volume okay so this is another way to write this decingularization and here we see immediately what the orbits are are this k point This K module T module couple. And you see that these are of equal dimension. So what else did I want to say here? Here we have also something which is the Chevolet restriction theorem, but let me just call it the Chevolet theorem. Theorem is that it describes a bit what happens with this map from k tilde to k and how the orbits correspond to each other. So basically we have the following property. For every x in T the orbit of x intersected with t is precisely the orbit The orbit of the group. And another way equivalent of stating this is basically that if you look at the portion space of the module W, this is the same as so the notion gives you an isomorphism. The portion space of K for W. And here And here another way of stating this is that this map from k tilde to p, so p, this resolution, is a one-to-one correspondence on leaf spaces. One-to-one, one-to-one on the orange spaces classes okay we go. Okay, because orbit space is here is basically modding here by k, which means mod in here by double the other side so now so now the boss part comes in and uh So we can do this also if we consider here the Poisson structure. So the Poisson designularization, Poisson designularization, maybe it would be better to call the Poisson the Dirac desimularization. And now we take the dual of k with the canonical. With the canonical linear possible structure. And now, what happens? Well, we can identify K with K star using the killing fork, for example, or the metric, and then also with T star. This would be an identification of K spaces, but this will identify the Lie algebra of this possible manifold with, well, that. With, well, that one is the same as the action algebraic, and it will be identified with the action algebra here. So the orbits are the same with the syntactic leaves. You are staying in the compact case. Yes, yes, yes, from. And then what happens is that you have an Iraq decimalization here. Okay. So L K 2 K star. So this one has a dirc structure. Dirac structure. And this map is both forward and backward. Okay, and to understand it maybe a little bit better is that well if you the pullback the pullback of L will take another five minutes, sorry So now what do we have? We have this beam motor K mod T times T star. So I will put it back here, the Dirac structure. Now this is this W cover, so you can mod this out by W and what you obtain here is precisely the death singularization. This is the start. Star, right? So, under this identification, and then we pull it back to this product, it becomes something very simple. It has leaves, so it has leaves. It's pressing back the cleaves of the former K mode. forma K mod divided times xi and omega xi xi is t star and this omega xi I think for me the the easiest way to explain it so is that if you pull it back to the D group To the Lie group, it gives you the D of the left invariant extension of xi for the projection from T to K more T. So I mean all the, what happens here is that all the symplectic structure on quite orbiting right like this. And this works for this block structure, right? So you then simularize it. Of course, Q you still need to model YW, but Q is just like a product. Over here is just like a product and family of symplectic structures. It's kind of quite simple. And now the last result which I still want to state is the similarization of also manifolds of compact type or more exactly of compact types of marriage kind of really lot of another set double. Wartenes here for the similarization of compact types of maybe I just like Landes and Martinez Torres and this has not appeared yet. So what we put here 2000 So m Maris talked to explain this uh very nicely five years ago in this room. Explain it as good. So we start now with the proper syntactic group point. So this is proper syntactic group point and then M, so this Poisson structure has a So, this Poisson structure has a direct designularization, which is defined as follows. So, until there are all the pairs x, t, very similar to the one, the similarization. So, x is in m and t is now is a maximum to the abelian sub algebra of the isotropy algebra. Isotropy d algebra and x. This is, well, it is the d algebra of this dx, but you can also write just in terms of the possible geometry on the base, right? So this is the kernel of I sharp. And this whole space is inside the Gross module of Tm of a certain dimension, K being the dimension of T. Dimension K being the dimension of this subject T, of course, is part of the theorem. That is, K does not depend on the point that we're looking at. And tilde has a Pirac structure, structure L tilde, which is regular, regular, and then the projection from M tilde. So this is a desingularization. M pi, this is both, this is forward and backward, forward and backward. It is a bijection on leaf spaces, a bijection on leaf spaces. You can do leaf spaces, what else? Basics, what else? It is a diffeomorphism. Maybe I can even write it like this. So P from M till the, let me write it like this, Poisson. So this is the part of L which is Poisson to M regular is a is a dictionary. And of course, you can also use it now. Well, I'm actually use it now to build a decimalization, a transymplectic decimalization G. So you can do this M tilde and you put that omega over M tilde L. And the reason why it holds, and now I will stop here for a bit put this apart, is that such a Poisson manifold, because the glue point is proper, you know, it's linear isophole, and then it can be also linear. Linearizable, and then it can be also linearized as a Poisson manifold further. And then you know that locally it will look like a symplectic times one of this time. The tool of a convex My Simple D algebra. And then here you do exactly this, kind of on the transverse direction, include the same construct, and then together you obtain this is what we said. Sorry, for going over time, I will stop here. Yeah, we have some questions. We have to copyright these. Can we write down? Is it easy to write down the definition of the direct structure there? I think this would be the best definition, or this would be the most explicit definition of it. It's the direct structure which has displayed like this with these two forms. With these two forms. Another way, because this is a backward Iraq map, the lazy way to write it, it will be the pullback, because Iraq structures can be pulled back, pulled back of the Era structure corresponding to the Poisson structure K. Right? So there are pairs V, such that we project, such that ψ comes from Project that such that ψ comes from the base, it's the pullback of a covector, and the image of V is exactly pi-sharp of. So I'm just explaining this definition, what it means to pull back the devoxy functor. We can have more questions now or you can make the break and we can have a conversation during the break, but we also have later today a problem session So I would suggest that we have a coffee break now and start at this time schedule at 10:30. Thank you. I was monitoring. You're going to be using also the the blackboard, right? Fine if I need to decide.
