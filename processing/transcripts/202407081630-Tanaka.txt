I'm really happy to talk at this event. So I'd like to thank the organizers, Professor Pambina, Professor Kobayas, and Professor Suet. So thank you very much. So my patient is on the mass of property. So I'd like to start with the definition of a massive representation. So here, a unitary representation of a row carry contact anthropography on a Herbert space group at mass positive degree if I make it. Processor degree: if any irreducible orientation appears at most once in the irreducible logic, and I learned from Professor Kobayasi the foreign aspect. So, the matrix property corresponds to the canonical. And here we have a typical example. So, here Z is the yellow subfocus one, and the B is the space of square interval. space of square integral functions on the extra then we have a fully series extension of a function f and this precisely corresponds to the irreducible decompression of f square so the uniqueness of coefficient in the series expansion corresponds to the mass perturbation property of a present and to And today we'll start multipositive representations uniformly from a geometric point of view. Professor Kovayasi introduced the notion of physical action and the idea definition. So let's be a real finite dimensional, and X is the connected component for which G acts hotomorphically. Then the action of geonet is stronger. The action of Zonet is strongly possible if the following two conditions are satisfied. Firstly, we have a total real-time manifold S, A slice S of reflection of S, such that just set Z dot S. So this is the union of all the Z orbits intersecting with F. It's entity operating F. And on the And on this open subset, we have an anti-holomorphic homomorphism, sigma, like that. Sigma preserves HOB and acts of S, that's right, S, as the address remote. And here's that little case. So let's use the uncle. Let's use the unused half O and X converse frame. And this actually summarizes all because we can take a flight S to be the real axis and also sigma to be the standard compass computation. So it gives up the orbit and acts on the S as the identity market. And from Better Hole Ash and Holiness, we We can obtain various kinds of multiple representations by the following journey. So here, G is a regroup, and W is the holomorphic MS and G present spectrum control, and B is a unitary representation. And it is realized in the space of holomorphic sections of double. Then, Then we add multiplicative 3 if the following three conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the action of Z on the base phase X of this vector control is so reduced to it satisfy the two conditions. And secondly, the fiber is multi-sonic. And thirdly, we have some compatibility. We have some compatibility conditions with respect to these. These conditions are substituted. So, this theorem says that, and the visibility of the compaction, the multiple different property of the fiber propagates to that of the space of global section. So, this theorem is called the propagation theorem of the mass predictiveness property. Of the mass predicted property from fibers to the spatial global head. And the next slide shows some applications of this theory. The first one is finite dimensionalization. So here, Z is the unitary view of N, and W is the irreducible unitary position of G. Then, Then it is known that the tensor product with lambda i is multiple times. Lambda i is the alternating tensor product representation. And for this case, we can rewrite the tensor product in a complex geometric picture by the variable theory. Then the action on the basis space is stronger. Vasus space and strongly basic room, and indeed we can take a slice F to be the singleton, the identical set of g over t. And also the fiber is multiplicative because lambda i is weight multiplicative. So the multiplicative difference property of the fiber propagates through that of the space of crop section. And the next example is infinite-dimensional rotation. So here, Z is a collected non-compact Hamilton symbol. And H is symmetric sub. And B is the irreducible Eurohead representation of stator type. Then the Then the distribution of B to H is modulus weak. And for this example, we can realize void in the space of holomorphic sections of a Rhine bundle on the Hamilton symmetric space. Then, the action of H on J over K as some reflective. K as some replaceable by the calton decompression. So we can take place to be the a group of the calton decompression. And also, the fiber is much because we are considering a rainbow. So we can apply cobalt theorem to this case. And the third example. The half example is a representation of near-potential groups. So here G and V are the same as the previous example. And N is the maximum near potential subgroup of them. Then the restriction of we to N is also multiple satisfaction. And for this case, And for this case, the visibility of the n action on job K comes from the USL data. So we can take slice S to be the EWS server group A. Okay. And for the cover, yes, we have indicated. Indicated two directions of generalization, which is much the retail. And one is a generalization to infinite dimensional complex methods, and indeed has been done by professors with Louis Ori and me, recently. And the other directional actualization of co-homology. And this is the main concern. And this is the main concern of the talk. And our cohomology biomass is this. So here, G over L is an epic orbit over a river Rio's mass input. And a lambda is a line bundle of z over L fit terms of unit character of L, with the side value of L. And H is a closed hyperbody, and also we need version of E, stabilizing H, and acts on Z L as a negative icon. So here, Z L is the center of the real zero of L. In this setting, if the action weight on the epidemic Article 8 on the epic of it is somewhat fatible, then the thermal cover motor displacement of the Rhyme bundle on the epic of it adds multiple centrifuge. So the visibility implies the multiple different property of the cohort model. So here the degree S is the compact dimension of the Of the maximal contact temporarily over KFL. And this theorem has many applications. So I'd like to show three applications. And actually, the first one is the main application in this application. So let's go to the first application. First in the main application. So here, Jova L is an F copy and H is a reduction copy, and Ramosa is a unit L. And we assume that the pairs GL and GH are symmetric pairs, then that unitary composition of X ramp the module is multiplicative as the representation of X. Our representation of it. And here we remark that we can apply Professor Covayas' original theory when 0 over L is the Hamilton smooth space. And actually, this collector whole tool because in this symmetric setting The action of age on Java L is so reflective. So we can apply our top homology by the magic UK cell. So let's go to the second application. And to explain the second application, we need a result on the visibility of pervasion. So let's over L be an F and A is the reduction algorithm and also we need the inversion of compatible with H and L. And also we let G subu, L sub H be compact real forms of the respective complexifications of G, L, and H. In the setting, if the confactorial form acts on the compact F cobby, so repeated, then the non-confactorial form acts on the non-compact F cobby. So repeat. And the proof goes as follows: Suppose that I want compact. That our compact can form action GU over LU strong reset. Then we interpret this variability as the real Java weather and we completify the real geography and resource it to the low compact rate of all. Then we get that the action of H on to over L is also so related. Is also so visible. And from this unital token of the visibility, we obtain unital token for the mass per sequence. So we retain the previous setting, epic orbit, that is outlook, and integration, and the contrast. Then, Then, if the dermocomotive space of the ring voltage on the compact epic orbit is multiplicative free, then the derivable commodity space on the non-compact epic orbit also multiples that you free. So, here I remember that. This similarity in finite and infinite dimensional multiplicative representations in view of the possibility was already pointed out by Kosovo Bayaski in his 2005 paper when our eptic orbit is a Hamiston chemistry space. So L is the maximal compact of K. And also by Professor Hidekosekich. By Professor Hidekosekich in her 2011 paper, when our topic book is 30 grams of old, so our epic of it is the indefinite grass manual of UNN and the H is SOS. Okay, and the proof goes as false. So suppose that. So, suppose that we have finite dimensional multiplicative representation. Then, we get that the action of the compact real form is then by the unit choice. The non-compact real form acts on double L song repetitive. And to this visible action, we can apply our cohorts. we can apply our cohort of the microphone here. Okay, so let's go to the final application in the talk. So here, the U over IOU is an axis of it of a compact semi-simple chip and we identify And we identify it with the complex web management. So DC is the complex hypothetical of DU, and QC is the private hyper. And also, HU is the cross-house. So this is a compact H2. In this equation, by the beam-felt theorem, if our complex spec manifold is Hc spectral, The HC spectrum, that is, a world server of AC has an opportune orbital constraint manifold, then the durable commodity space over the compact epic orbit is 1 plus a degree. And actually, we have a non-compact version of this theorem. So now, let's draw L and affect orbit of a real semi-symmetric E, and we regard it as an open domain in a complex rate manifold. And with that 8, we are reduction of E. Then, if our complex manifold is special, The throw-commodity space over the non-compact F orbit is 1. And here we remark that we have several class casual results on spherical ratios. When HC, that's really when HC When HC is the levy subgroup of PC, then the classification was given by Professor Richmond, Margaret Wyman-Javoski, and finally by Stanford. And also when the pair GC and HC get symmetric, then classification was given by Professor Zufohi, Siam Otiya. And when GCS, a simple class for regroup classification was given by Professors Abode and Petro. And when CC and simple exceptional, and when QC and HC a maximal subloop, then the cross fitness was given by percent new. So, combining with these classification results, we can obtain several massive features and the proof was both. So, suppose that our chrome expression. So, suppose that our complex spectrum manifold is XC spec. Then, by the beambach Melfel theory, this finite dimension or computation was substituted. And by our unit type theory, these different dimensions or substitutes. Okay, so this is the end of my talk. So, thank you very much.
