These associated information in uh in cellular communications. So this is related to yesterday uh Dr. Dean Uber gave a talk uh about how to identify uh differential cell cell communications from multiple samples. But we are coming from another angle to look at this problem. So a little bit of background, as we already know, that so human tissues consist of diverse types of cells that communicate with each other. Communicate with each other to perform biological functions like organ development and also maintain tissue homostasis and also the repair response in terms of injury. So with recent development of single-cell analytic sequencing and also recently the spatial information provided in the spatial platomics does increase the interest in the inference Increased interest in the influence of cell cell communication to understand how biological functions are maintained through the cell cell communication. So as we know that perturbations to this cell cell communication can disrupt the regular biological function leading to a disease. So there's interest to identify disease-associate cell-cell communication changes. Changes. And so I'm going to talk about still in terms of single-cell analyst. I'm going to demonstrate in terms of the cell secumentation inferred from single-cell analyst data, but the method can potentially be extended to other type of inference from, for example, directly from spatial transotomics. So this is a nice paper that summarized published last year to cover available methods in cell cell communication inference from single cell analysis data. This paper investigates, so as we know, that many computational tools in the cell cell computation inference rely on the source. Rely on the resource information on the biology on intersemal interaction and then make model predictions on potential cell cell communication events from the data. And so the choice of the resources as well as the prediction algorithm can impact the communication, cell-cell interaction inference. So this paper, so the table species, the The table species. The current investigate 16 resources in terms of the database as well as seven methods that are available in the single cell RNA sequencing inference of the cell cell communication, including cell chat, cell phone DB, collectone, and so on. And then this very nice paper compared different performance in terms of the final inference, in terms of consensus, and then also provide. Consensus and they also provide an open resource interface that can integrate all the methods results available and come up with a consensus ranking related to the self-communication inference. So based on this results, what I'm interested in is, as we know, that is a single cell RNA signal. It means single-cell RNA-seq data as well as spatial tetratomic data. The data contain a lot of zeros as well as the high noise in the data. So the inference of cell cell communication network can be variable. In addition, we know that both measurements in the single-cell transit data can capture a snapshot of the cellular. A snapshot of just a cellular transcriptome instead of describing the whole picture of the whole cell cell communication system. So how can we take into account the variability of the cell cell communication inference in order to identify disease-associated cell-cell communication changes? So that's the goal that I'm interested in. So I'm going to demonstrate it using the So I'm going to demonstrate it using the one of the samples from collaborators and Yale. So this sample is one cell atlas in the human cell atomus. It's from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis related study. So this, as we know, that IPF is the most common form of pulmonary fibrosis and it's also Fibrosis and it's also characterized by the scarring or the fibrosis in the lung. But the causes of this disease is of unknown cause. So as we know, that scarring leads to the stiffness in the tissue, so the patient is hard to breathe. And so in order to understand the pathogenesis of IPF, so the lung single-cell sequencing Single cell sequencing data contributes to the human cell atomus consists of 32 IPF patients, single-cell analytic sequence data, 162 IPF patients, and 28 health controls. So our goal is to infer a cell-cell communication network. So on the right side, it displays the cell clustering results. I do cell typing to identify. Do cell typing to identify different cell types. We do some filtering to remove cell types that with small number of cells and also a subject that has in total small number of cells. And then we end up with 31 IPF patients and 26 controls in total including. In total, including 200,000, more than 200,000 cells. And based on cell typing results, we have 37 major cell types. So we don't have a prior knowledge about what cell type, what cell type cell type interaction that we are particularly interested in. So we are trying to see that in terms of pair of cell types, what pay. Terms of pair of cell types, what potential interactions that may be related to disease. That's the goal. So I'm going to demonstrate that using one of the methods come up from the table that's the paper listed below. It's from Collectone, it's also from an algorithm developed from the collaborator. So this algorithm is very simple, but instead of summarizing interaction between each pair of cells, Pair of cells. Instead, it is summarizing in terms of pair of cell types. And then it calculates, it's based on ligand receptor information, calculates the average expression level across the same cells for the same cell type, the average expression level for migrant receptor all based on DNY this goal. So that this score is another version, so that control some genes are highly expressed, other genes in general are not expressed. Are in general are not expressed. So, using these four, so that all the gene expressions are on the same scale. So, this is one of the weights that calculate based on two pairs of cell types I and J and across the pair of ligand cell, the case pair. And then once the weights can be calculated based on this two-cell type and one ligand receptor pair. Ligand receptor pair. And then we can summarize it across all the ligand receptor pairs to come up with the interaction between the two cell types N and J. And of course, because in the database more than 2,000 ligand center pairs are involved, so in order to have detailed information about how the signaling plays a role in terms of startup communication, so instead we can separate. Instead, we can separate ligand receptor parallelism from the signaling pathways. So, summarizing the signaling family here, there are three signaling families that has been already reported to be related to IPF. So those are related to either the development of lung fibrosis and also related to actuarial matrix, which Matrix which maintains the structure of the lung. So the remodeling of the actual cellular matrix can potentially lead to the development of fibrosis. We are going to focus on these three signaling fabrics. The back of the cellular panels come from this three signaling panels. Showing some of the sample adjacency matrix we learned from the collectone between IPF and control. As we can see that I IPF and control, as we can see, that IPF in general has more connections compared to controls across the three signaling families. And so to remind that our goal is to compel cell cell communications across the two groups. One is a IPF group and the other is a control group. And so based on the already inferred communication networks, so that we can Cell communication network so that we can incorporate all different methods that are available and also come up with a consensus cell cell communication results and to identify disease-associated cell-cell communication changes. So the idea is to try to learn the graph distribution using deep learning methods and then we Deep learning methods, and then we can previously assess the hypothesis to perform hypothesis tests based on generated model from deep learning, based on deep learning. So to illustrate that, we know that in this workshop, we have talked about auto-encoder variation or auto-encoder, conditional variation, or auto-encoder. So, because I'm dealing with self-self communication networks. This self-select communication network is a graph version. So we are focusing on variational graph auto-encoder. So the input contain both the learned cell cell communication network as well as can potentially have node feed. So in the graph, we know that are the cell types. And node feature can potentially promote information about the cell type. And then encoders is a two-layer neural network that converts the graph into. The graph into a low embedding distribution, and then a sample from the embedding distribution, and then we can use a decoder usually for graph version. It's simply the inner product to come up with a generated adjacency matrix. And then so the boss functions are very similar to the traditional variational author encoding, except that Of encoding, except that now the data is a graph. So I'm not going to go into detail, but just try to demonstrate and what we are going to do. So basically, we have two groups, disease group control group, and we learn or train two variation graph version variation auto encoder to learn the distribution in each group. And then we come up with any statistics that we summarize based on. That we summarized based on the graph, the generated graph, and compared between the two groups. So that's the idea. So I'm going to demonstrate in terms of compared to centrality for simple industrial. Very quickly, so we also check type one error because we generate the uh come up with uh generating models and want to make sure that we don't inflate the uh type one error. But type 1 error. So most of the dots, color represents sample size, and then we test the node centrality at different simulation, the generative size. And most of the dots are within the 95 confidence interval. What we actually found is that if we directly perform a centrality comparison between input graph, because of the Input graph because of the sample size, we have about 30 in each group. So the impurpos the for example use t t-test to compile the mean of the centrality. The empirical diff the syntactic distribution actually cannot well approximate the node uh the node distribution of the test statistic, especially when we don't have uh a prior hypothesis in mind. If you only Hypothesis in mind, we have to do botanic control so that we are looking at the tail of the probability. So instead, we rely on empirical distribution to evaluate the p-value. And just trying to very quickly, so here I bec would split the data and then check the consistency between the data. Uh the data. So within each data split we have two data. The f uh the left column is the directly tested input graph and then the right column denotes the result consistency and that's based on a generating model. So we can see that in generating model we have more consensus and then reduce the number of inconsistent results across multiple speeds of gamma treatment in multiple families. So I'm running out of time. So I'm running out of time to summarize. So we give a very general framework trying to compare graph distribution using generating model to learn disease-associated changes in cell-cell communication and based on learning the graph distribution. So this framework can be extended to any method that has been already developed. That has been already developed for self-communication inference. And some potential extensions that we can, of course, are demonstrating in terms of the simple centrality measure. We can also incorporate some other measurements to compare the graph distance, for example, based on spectrum distance. And then this framework can also be extended to evaluate some other type of graph, like a gene metric network. Thank you very much. Any very quick question while the next speaker, which is Ying Sing, prepared. Thank you. Yeah, so I just wonder, real quick, quick talk, amount of LED receptor, how many are like a marker cheats for the cell type? Like that's just very nice question, because you are focusing on the cell type cell type graphic, right? So now wouldn't add in like a markers mean for missing markers? Markers genes or missing marker genes or for that matter for the benefit or so the marker genes c can potentially be be the feature of the cell types when we learn the when we train the model. So I don't think that's why gene overlap that well with ligand receptor. Alright, in the interest of time, let's continue the discussion on Slack. Our next speaker is Ying Sung-li from the Universal Sydney.
