Having this in person, it's so much fun to be in person, and thank you for all the speakers again. Like, you've done half of my work, or more than half, so it's really, really good. Okay, so let's get started. Right, okay, so I'm going to be talking about cutting and placing of manifolds. Manifolds haven't been present so much in this conference so far, so I'm going to do a little bit of warm-up with and give a little bit of context of why CISAS conference. Where CISA's congruence came from originally, and why would we like to look at them from the point of view of manifolds? Okay, so the very first problem that we're going to see here on the slide goes back historically, very, very far back to the Greeks. So we have a two-dimensional polygon right there. It's a little square, and we're going to grab some scissors and we're going to cut that polygon into little pieces. So, okay, now you have your. So, okay, now you have all of your little pieces over there. You're going to take them, you're going to rearrange them, and you're going to paste them back. Okay, according to some rules, you can't put one piece on top of the other. You are gluing them back along boundaries. So, this is what we call cisas congruence or a cut and paste operation. A little bit more formally, just to say definition, you will say that two polygons are cisas congruent if you know you cut them into pieces and we. You cut them into pieces, and each of those pieces happen to be the same pieces for all of these sub-Is that you have there. Okay, and again, the sub-polygons are only supposed to intersect at the surfaces, as this picture here indicates. Now, one interesting question with this, even with already this very classical problem, is what are going to be the invariance? What are going to be the invariance that indicates that two polygons, for example? That two polygons, for example, are cis as congruent. Now, in the case of two-dimensional polygons, we know that that invariant is the area. So, if you have, you can clearly see that this polygon over here is going to have the same area as that polygon over there. And not just that, if two polygons have the same area, we know that there's some way to cut it and paste it so that they are cut and paste equivalent. Same area will indicate that they're cut and paste equivalent. Will indicate that the Kelton paste equivalent. Now, if you get up in dimensions, this is a harder problem. Already Hilbert's third problem asks exactly this question. What about dimension 3? If we have this polyhedra, well, can you say volume? Well, let's see volume. Are two polyhedra that have the same volume cut and placed equivalent? So he gave that question to his PhD students then. PhD students team and a very clever PhD student, you know, about a year he figured it out. So, in 1901, he figured out that that wasn't true, that there was in fact an invariant, which we now call the Denin variant, that distinguishes between objects. There's a problem with the angles between faces. So, you can say, for example, that that tetrahedron and that Q, even if they have the same volume, they're not catalysed equivalent. The problem continued continuous. The problem continued on further. The next piece of the puzzle came with Zeidler. He actually said that, he actually proved that volume and Den invariant are the only Cesar's congruent invariants in R3. Now that's interesting, that's a little different from what Den said. It says exactly the same as what we said with the area before. If you know that two polyhedra have the same, two polygons have the same area, then you know. Polygons have the same area, then you know that they are cut and paste equivalent. If you have this polyhedron that have the same volume and the same daily variant, we know that they're going to be cut and paste equivalent. And the story moved on and on in higher dimensions. Jensen proved that some generalized four-volume and some generalized 10 invariants were also the only C-sus congruent invariants in four dimensions. But as you go higher up in dimensions, the problem gets harder and harder. Dimensions, the problem gets harder and harder, and there's lots of open questions if you go like intermissions greater than five. Okay, so this is a bit of like the geometric motivation of the problem. There is like a similar path or similar problem also in the world of manifolds. So back in the 70s, there was a group of authors, Clara, Craig, Maimon, and Ossa, who formalized the notion of cut and paste groups. Of cut and paste groups, and they call them, well, they call them SK groups because let's think German. But then it walks through the classical definition of what these cut and pasting variants are. So can we look at the picture on this side? So we're going to start with a closed smooth manifold of whatever dimension you choose. And we're going to choose a geo-dimensional one smooth sub-manifold of that manifold. Of that manifold. It's very, very faint. Maybe people can see it on the slide. So it's actually here, my little care dimension one sub-manifold. And that sub-manifold, since we're working in the smooth category, we're going to choose that sub-manifold to have like a trivial normal bundle. So, okay, so now when you do the cutting, now you have these two pieces, and those two boundaries are going to be idiothomorphic. Now you're going to choose a diffemorphism of close boundaries and you're going to paste that together, similarly to what we saw in the picture of the volumes. Now, since we've chosen this trigger normal bundle of the kernel one manifold, we're not going to have any trouble in doing some nice smooth gluing of pieces, and the result is a new smooth manifold. From this picture, we could see. From this picture, we would say that the manifold M that I started with at the top is actually cut and paste equivalent to the manifold that I get out of these two pieces, which are glued via some diffeomorphism of the resulting boundaries. So, this is the classical definition of what a catalog-based operation means on manifolds. Now, as I said, these authors also formalize this as like groups. Groups, groups of groups of, you know, the relation is going to be cutting and pasting. So you start off with a monoid of diffeomorphism classes of smooth, close, oriented, n-dimensional manifolds of the disjoint union. And you're going to take the rotent group of that mind, and you're going to question by a relation. Now your relation right there is exactly what we've just seen in the previous slide. You're going to have the same pieces each time you're going to have the same pieces. Pieces each time you're going to have the same pieces of manifolds, and you are going to glue those pieces according to some diffeomorphism, choice of diffeomorphism. And it doesn't matter if you choose one diffimorphism or choose a different diffeomorphism, those two resulting manifolds are going to be in the same class in the SK group. SK actually stands for Schneider und Leinen, and it's just because the authors were German, they named the group. They named the groups with the German translation of Katin and Phaison. Okay, so that's the classical SA group. Now, before we move on, let's see an example of a Katam-Peso operation on a torous. So suppose we start with something relatively easy, a two-torus, and we're going to cut, first of all, suppose I choose to cut like this and it helps for me to use this. And just as I did in the very first slide, Just as I did in the very first slide, I'm going to rearrange my pieces and then I'm going to paste them back together. So, what I see here is an interesting relation coming up, which tells me that the torus that I started with, after I do all of the categories operation, becomes two tori. So, a toro is going to be equal to two tori in the two-dimensional SK group. And what does that mean? Well, that means that the class of a torus represents class of Adorus represents zero if it's k2. And this example doesn't have anything special in the, you know, it's not special because it's two-dimensional. In general, you could always take, say, a manifold cross I and then glue those ends together so that you get a mapping torus. And it's true that the class of any mapping torus of like any dimension you choose is Like any dimension you choose, it's actually going to be zero in your chosen dimension of the catalog-based group. So, mapping to arrive are always zero in the catalog-based group. That of course strikes a very climatic difference with cobalism groups, where you actually do have mapping tori which can represent classes. For example, cobalisms, oriented cobalism in dimension five, one choice of representation. One choice of representative of a non-trivial class could be a map in Dorus. So that's a very striking difference between SK groups and cobaltism groups. Is there a map from the cobalt groups? Actually, that's a fantastic question. This is something we've also been working on. So there's like you can define a cat and base group which is a little smaller than this one, where you also impose cobalism, but there's no map. Cobolism, but there's no map from this group directly to globalism or from mobilism. They're kind of like you know, oil and water, they don't mix. Great, so now invariants. So the two key invariants in this whole story are the Euler characteristic and the signature. The Euler characteristic, because of like an algebraic topology exercise, you have this gluing formula and the signature because of logic of additivity, you know that. Nobody of additivity, you know that the signature of you know two pieces grouped together are the signatures of the pieces. That's Nobic of additivity. So, yeah, so those are the two main cut and pasting variants for this scale blocks. And okay, so now we have this classical story of cutting and pasting. We also have all of the classical story of Caesar's congress coming from geometry, and you also have all of the work that. Also, we have all of the work that Jonathan and Ino were doing on CISAS conferences of polytopes and other settings in agro-right geometry by using K-theory spectrum. So, it's already a couple of years ago, but we started a women in topology project and we thought, well, you know, this connection between catenate-based and this case theoretic point of view, how do manifests fit in that picture? How do manifests fit in that picture? And well, initially, we thought, gee, this is going to be a new project. Every place where it says polytope, we're going to be able to write manifolds, and in five minutes, we're going to have a paper. And of course, if that didn't happen. So apart from all of the more formal difficulties that you can encounter, one obvious, immediate difference is that, well, Is that, well, you know, if you cut a polytope and you cut it into little pieces, the little pieces that you obtain are, you know, are things of the same nature. They're also little polytopes. Now, if you... The classical story of cutting and pasting, as I said, starts with closed manifolds. If you cut a closed manifold into pieces, now the objects that you're seeing here are still manifolds, but they're manifolds. But they're medical squeeze boundary. So they're not exactly objects of the exact same lecture as the thing you started with. So already, like very brutally, already from the beginning, you already have a big difference there. So what was our first step? So our first step was to tweak the classical definition of SK, of the SK groups, to kind of like be able to work with metaphors with. Work with manifolds with boundary. So, this slide looks similar to the one that I showed before. The only difference is that we are adding boundary to everything. So, our monoid will now be a monoid of the thermophyson classes of small-oriented n-dimensional metaphors with boundary and the disjoint union. A group. A group is again the rotent group of that monoid and that sort of relation, which is again. Which is again, you have your pieces and you're going to have diffomorphisms of those boundaries, and you're going to keep doing along those deformorphisms. But the deformorphisms are wet-the orientation-preserving diffomorphisms of only pieces of the resulting boundaries. Let me move on to the next slide to tell you a little bit more specifically how this gluing is done. So, the key idea is that all of the cuttings Is that all of the cutting and pasting that we're doing is done away from the original boundaries? So, for example, this original manifold had certain boundaries, they had boundaries like here, there was a boundary, there was a boundary here, and there was also a boundary here. And all of the cutting and the gluing that I'm doing, that boundary stays the same, we don't touch that, everything is done away from these. Away from these original boundary pieces. So, you know, like in our cut and paste relation, if you decided to cut here, then you're going to do your gluing back along those boundaries. You're going to remember where you cut, and you're going to do the gluing along those original boundaries so that the little red boundaries, or the boundaries that already existed, are not changed. So that's how you do your gluing. And if you define your cat and base group according to this relation, you get an exact sequence. These are all my co-authors, Hexima, Merlin, Morai, Sme, and Semikina. And we had this short exact sequence when you have the classical boundary. This is ascending the class of The class of a manifold, the SK class of a manifold, to itself, to the other group. And now, in the group in the middle, we are allowed to have manifolds with boundary. So, what the next map does is it's going to send that to the class of the boundary. So, this map is essentially taking boundaries. What kind of thing do we have here? Well, you're going to have. You're going to have like a monoid of diffeomorphism classes of n minus one dimensional manifolds. If this was an n-dimensional manifold, its boundary is one dimensionless. So now you move into like n minus one-dimensional manifolds that actually are boundaries of something, so that power. And the harmonic, you're going to get the rotent group of that, and you have some nice little group sitting in your exact sequence. Okay. Okay, so that was our first part of the work. Now we have our definition of manifolds with boundary, a catapult group of manifolds with boundary. We still haven't figured out how to use gate theory for this problem. And I remember we were sitting over there in Poland, and kind of like Ina came to the rescue because she said, oh, you know, like we have this nerd. These notes of like gay theory of squares that with Jandadan at that point. By now, if you have seen it, so there's a recent preprint on all of this with some extra applications with two local authors, more or less pronounced the name, Josephine Kuiper and Mona Merlin. Is that correctly pronounced? Me? Okay. Anyway, so I'm going to tell you a little bit about what those categories with squares are and then how we apply. Squares are, and then how we apply the problem of manifolds to this. So, category with squares has a base point, and you're going to have two types of morphisms, so the Gal fibrations and the gal fiber maps, and you have what's called distinguished squares. So, this nice category gives you a lot of control of, you can choose, you can choose what your distinguished squares are, so that gives you a lot of control of what you want your category to be. Now, we have some control. To be. Now we have some conditions for that. The category has cure products and distinguished squares are closed and are given products. You can take your distinguished squares and compose them horizontally. You can also compose them vertically. And both your girlfriend and your girl fiber maps all contain isomorphisms. And finally, if you have a square, like for example, like this, where your horizontal maps are isomorphisms, or Maps are isomorphisms, or squares like this, where your vertical maps are isomorphisms, then those are also going to be distinguished squares in your category. Okay, the squares category relate in a very interesting way with bad housing categories. If you have a bad housing category, you can produce out of there a category with squares. Actually, you can make some choices on how you define a category with squares, given about housing categories. Squares given about Hausen category. I'm going to talk about the one that worked for us in the setting of manifolds. So, what we did is like horizontal maps are going to be the, so horizontal maps need the squares, are going to be the co-fibrations from the Waddhausen category. Vertical maps for us are going to be all maps, and distinguished squares are going to have the property that if you have the push-out from C, C, I'm cutting it off. So C union B along A, it's going to be equivalent with your object right here, with this D right here. Okay? So that's how you connect the notion of like Valhausen categories and the squares categories. And you can define these squares k-theory, this intermediate space, as the base loops of that by simply showing. Looks of that by simply short set, where such a pico simplex would be like a grid of all of these distinguished squares that you have in your category. And in fact, you can define an equivalence of k-theory spectra from some Balthausen k-theory to the k-theory of the corresponding squares category that you've created out of this Balthausen category. Path housing category. I'm going to give you like a quick idea of how that equivalence goes. So a little reminder of what this... This is the original axioms had co-products. What you actually want is a nice monoidal structure. It's a bit weaker than co-products. But co-products are good intuition, even though technically that's wrong. Oh, okay. Thank you. Just. Thanks. Okay. So. Okay, so right, okay, so okay, so let's let's go back to this, let's try to give an idea of how this works. Again, listen to Ina, this is all, you know, like I'm just like trying to reproduce a little bit of like how the work went so that I can talk to the, about the application of manifolds, which is how the part that we actually did. Okay, so what do we have here? So that's a reminder of what I just said, what this gave. What I just said, what this gate theory was. Now, this is, of course, just like the loops of the geometricalization of the next category, which has objects like these, like sequences of these confidence sequences. And morphisms are going to be arrows between those sequences where you actually have this. Have this nice, you can choose any one of these squares or rectangles, whatever you want, and you're going to have this push-out and you're going to have this weak equivalence with that object with there. So that's that's, by definition, this is what it is. Now, okay, so now this thing is going to be This is actually going to be equivalent to taking the nerve of Thomason's simplicial category, which we've talked a lot about talks about this notation here. This is the Thomason's construction. And interestingly, this This simplified category here is there's a six-seg of equivalences between that category and this other category that we've heard a lot about today already. And that six-seg involves a slight modification of Thomason's construction by like just getting, I think it's just like getting the Welsh and like a Quotations are well defined. So, yeah, so just by using this zigzag of equivalences and knowing that this is equivalent to this, you can already get an intuition of how that equivalence up there works. Okay, so we have this equivalence, and now also from the, you know, from Jonathan and Inas and the other collaborators. Jonathan and Inas and the other collaborators work, they also gave us this label which computes what happens on by node. So what happens on by node is that, well, the relation is very similar to what Brandon was talking about before. This gets to zero. And now instead of in that three-term relation, we have a four-term relation. Every time you have this kind of like distinguished web, you have the relation A plus C equals. A plus D equals B plus C. And this is very suitable for the manifold situation and also for some other situations in algebraic geometry. So let me just very quickly tell you a little bit about how manifolds fit into the picture and how we constructed a squares category out of manifolds. So we're choosing some manifolds of a fixed dimension, say n, and our objects in the category are going to be smooth. Objects in the category are going to be smooth, compact, n-dimensional manifolds, possibly with boundary. And the morphisms are going to be smooth embeddings, but smooth embeddings with a very strict way on how you're going to be doing the embeddings. So in a sense, you're only seeing like this piece is going to sit into the other manifold. How do you do that? Well, you're going to force that boundaries either go to the already existing boundaries in the other manifold or they go to the Or they go to the interiors. You only have those two options. Either boundaries go totally to boundaries or they go totally to the interior part. And with that, well, with that, now you can construct Paucha squares. So this is a picture and this is also a picture. But this is a picture with actual manifolds, and that's just a diagram. So this is a nice picture. You see, like what I was talking about. You see your bees actually sitting in the manifold, or for example, this hell. In the manifold, or for example, this held piece, you see how it's set in all of the manifolds. So, all of these errors are smooth embeddings of this type. And because you're defining things very carefully, what you're getting here is actually push-outs, and the result is still a manifold. Okay, so that's what the category of squares is. Now, how do we connect both ends of this whole story? Now, we know what because of We know what, because of like work of Ina and Jonathan, we know what k0 of these squares would be. So we now want to prove that that group that we're getting there is actually isomorphic to the SK boundary group that we defined before. Now the proof is a little long, but in the last five minutes or so, I want to tell you, give you an intuition of how that works. So at least it looks very crowded right now. Crowded right now, and it might play just like a game of the difference. So, let's see, how are they different and how are they similar? These two diagrams. So, definitely, you can see that A here on that upper left-hand corner is the same as the other A from the other side. I can also see that B, or rather C here, is the same as the C over there. Now, B and B And B are the same manifold, but we see a little difference in the colour coordinate. The colour coordinate is according to the map that I'm choosing to embed these two little cylinders as colors of this boundary. So kind of like this sends the first cylinder to this manifold and the other one sends it to that one. And here the psi embedding is kind of like swapping those two cylinders. So because of that map, So, because of that map, difference in that map, when you actually go under the push-up, your gluing information is different. So, you know, you're gluing along the colour gel. So, since the gluing information is different, your result here is giving you a different manifold. So, that's the only difference there is like that map is controlling the gluing information. So, this will be, let's call that T, and let's call this D prime. And now, do we remember what? And now we remember what the K0 was telling us about the squares, and it was telling us that A plus T has to be equal to B plus C. So I know that D is going to be equal to B plus C minus A. And similarly on this side, A plus D prime is equal to B plus C. So now I have that D prime is the same as B plus C minus A. So D and D prime belong in the same class in the K theory. And in And in terms of thinking from the perspective of the cat and base group, I also see that these two manifolds are cat and base equivalent because I'm gluing the same pieces but using a different diffimorphism. So again, from both perspectives, you're getting two classes in that group on the left and the grouping on the right. Of course, the actual proof is a little longer, but this modification. But this already gives a punchline of why it works. Now, finally, one thing that we wanted to do was now look at, now we have our k-theory, well initially a space, but you can prove that this is a spectrum. And we want you actually to see how to get invariant out of there. So if you actually take pi-0 of this theory spectrum here, and also pi naught. Here and also by node here. The invariant that you're detecting there is the Euler characteristic, which can look very satisfactory because, as you might remember, the Euler characteristic was one of the main catalyst variants. And that's what we did in this project. Now, we have continued working on these ideas as Mona Berlin, Julia Sonigina and George Raptis, maybe not in alphabetical order. Making notes in alphabetical order, are working on trying to detect invariants of pi1 of the spectrum. And so far, I know that they are getting some connections with the Euler semi-characteristic, which in turn has connections to some other catalog-based groups. So it's kind of like very, very exciting news. Other work that we've been doing with this is with Julia Semikina and René Hexema with myself. Hexema with myself. We have been working and trying to have a map on the level of spectra to L-theory that hopefully will detect the signature. And then hopefully we will continue working and see what variants we would get from that map. So you know, like there's a there's a bunch of like projects that at least I find exciting along these slides. So I think I'll just stop there and thank you very much. Yes, can you compute K1? Yes, yes, so Mona and Julian, George Shaft is actually trying to work on that. I think it's going to be a lot harder to actually come up with a computation, but at the very least, you might be able to see invariants that are detected with Pi 1. And as I said, one of the invariants that avail is This is the scene right now, is a semi-characteristic, which is an invariant for vector field models. It's an interesting connection between, because, you know, this classical story about, I talk about SK groups, but there's a more, let's say, powerful caten-based group, which is called SKK. It's controlled caten-based invariants, and that group actually subjects onto combination. It's actually, let's say, It's actually, let's say, a Gatam-based version of Vector Free Bodison. So that Pi 1 seems to be like super interesting work. Sorry, go ahead. Now that you mentioned that SK play, you got this nice exact sequence. Do you know if you, because I assume that the situation for SK and for this doesn't improve with boundary, right? So if uh do you know you get such a similar sequence for SKK? Because you know that's a very sad story. We thought so at the beginning and we were defining our SKK with boundary group and it somehow, you know, like you think a little bit about it, it kind of like degenerates, it's isomorphic to SK boundary. So when you introduce boundary, you kind of like destroy the difference between SK and SKK. And then kind of when But then calculate because you know that the convergence you get a shorter channel sequence like that as well. Yes, with oriented coverage or whatever version or the coverage you frame and then to the one or less dimension. And the one to less dimension, yeah, like that. Those kind of things, you know, there's lots of ideas circling around there and maybe we don't still have a complete grasp of everything, especially with the with the boundary, which is kind of relatively new. Relatively new. But yeah, the the it was a little sad the thing I was making is already okay please. This is perhaps a naive question, but it seems to me like the natural generalization of a polytope is a manifold with corners. Yes. Does this story also work in that setting, or are there obstructions to doing this for general manifolds with corners and more complex coolings? Okay, that's something we're doing. Okay, that's something we haven't worked on, and I don't want to give you an answer on something that I'm not sure about. We have worked, so that you know, like one of the follow-up work from this was to, you know, like also following from Tabaka's question, SK, Cobaltism, there is a group which is subject to Belt relations. And now you have the challenge of saying, well, let's. The challenge of saying, well, let's look at it with boundary. Now, covalism of manifolds with boundary, if you don't have any restrictions on the boundary, it's going to be just zero. But if you have some restrictions, like the one we said was something like organization show it, yeah. Yeah, so like you know, you have a manifold, and you have, and this is a boundary, and you have, say, another manifold. Another manifold, and this is also our boundary. So, we were constructing. Suppose that these two manifolds are catalog based equivalent, and now they have boundaries, they have the same boundary, and now you're taking that boundary cross I and you're constructing a whole commodism here. So now you have, well, you have some notion of this resulting thing, it's definitely a manifold with corners. So this was Polybalt work. So, this was for the work, and we made some construction of a tricycle space where we had the squares categories, where the front and the back that was encoding the cat and base relation, and kind of like the depth of our cube was encoding the algorithms. So, I mean, this is not an answer to your question, but like when you think about colours, maybe you can make that idea fit directly onto the squares, or maybe. Directly onto the squares, or maybe depending on the purpose of what you want to do, we use we use these cubes because we wanted to engage with more stuff, but they came back. For these colours, they came back. Isn't this pretty similar to Toby's question about not double single things, but n-fold-single things? Like, if you think about it from the cobortism category perspective, you can decompose a manifold and map it onto a grid in Euclidean space. This gives me some commuting diagrams that I can. This gives me some commuting diagrams of n category of commodisms. And the corners and the edges and the faces of that grid and RN precisely would be precisely that. So you know kind of like some extended version of the escape rope and then you can like see all of the cutting and you know have a control of the gluing. That could be a pretty cool interesting project. So I have a related question. So it seems like this cutting-pasting of manifolds, like this idea to find Like, this idea defines an invariant of any category. Like, so in the, like, what you're doing is the example of the universal thing with duals, the cobordism category. And, you know, given any manifold, if I think of it as a composition of a bunch of morphisms, i.e. composition of a bunch of cobordisms, if I allow myself duals of those morphisms, if I allow myself to change the order of composition, whenever composition makes sense when I change order, that's precisely the cut and paste relation. Precisely the cut and paste relation with this composition to another. That makes sense. But given any infinity n category, symmetric monoidal, I can look at the unit and I can look at all these things that are generated by dualizable objects and this relation of composable morphisms. No, we haven't thought about that. It sounds like really interesting. Web project for the open project session. It's interesting. It's interesting. Check, yes. Yeah, just concretely, these SK groups from manifolds and then the SK boundary, perhaps you know them for n equals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Oh, let's see. So the sequence actually splits. So you would have to look at what the what that little C N so you know, that that group that you get by taking the grotto group of that monoid of like bounding manifolds. Monoing of bounding manifolds, that's probably going to be a very big group. But the sequence splits because the group is free. So, whatever your SK computation is, you're going to have the same thing plus that extra group. So, the difference between having the construction with boundary and the classical construction, you know, the diffusion like you have all of this extra stuff from this free group, that's this grotto deconstruction there. That's this grotto deconstruction there with the bounding metaphors in terms of the map test. I'll see. Alright, okay. Well, maybe we should have thought harder. We tried a little bit and then we decided we wanted to get in a different direction. But it wasn't completely trivial. Maybe if you're very used to working with these categories, maybe it's possible. That would probably also give you a nice description, but I don't know. It seems a little difficult to us at the moment when we were trying to do it, and then we didn't think back about that, but it might be a good thing to look at again. Okay, let's take a look at coffee break.
