Don't steal the punchline even. All right, so first off, thank you very much to the organizers for the invitation to speak. It's a pleasure to be here and to see all of you in person and to speak to those of you who are joining in online as well. Usual disclaimer for all of my talks, my handwriting does tend to go in and out of eligibility at random, so please do speak up if you can't understand. Please do speak up if you can't understand something I've written or said. And before I begin, let me say sort of a disclaimer about who this is joint work with. So I was going to write the names up, but I got worried I would misspell at least one of them. So I'm definitely not going to do that. So most of this is joint work with Bhagav Bhatt, Mishoma, Padak Falvi, Shreed, myself, Myself, Waldron, and Wittichek. Right. And before I forget to do this as well, I also want to point out that there's overlap with some of the results with some related work of Takamatsu and Morikawa. Did I spell it wrong? Yes, I tried. Did I spell it wrong? I tried. Yoshikawa. My notes are not great. Okay, so great. So I want to start off. And while the main thrust of my talk is going to be about sort of global applications, I want to start off and talk a little first about local motivation. Right, so let me start off just with the following definitions. I don't think it's shown up yet. Right, so if I take a Noetherian ring R, I say it's a splinter, if any module finite extension, well. So, any module finite or ring map R to S, which is surjective on prime spectra splits in the category of R modules, right? So, i.e., right, so there exists an R module map back from S to R. Back from S to R, making that composition the identity. All right. And if you're more familiar with this, this may seem a little more of a technical way of presenting this than you've seen before. So let me just say real quick here that certainly you can just replace this with inclusion. You have R is a domain, right? So feel free to think about that case. All right, so let me just start off with some basic facts. All right, so first off, well, if R is a splinter. Automatically normal and reduced. And one of the features of those splinterings is they sort of behave very differently in different characteristics. So I'm not going to say a whole lot about this, but if your ring R contains Q is equal characteristic zero, then of course the converse holds there as well. So for the most part, most of the questions when I think about and talk about are about splinter. About and talk about our splinter rings in the mixed or positive characteristic setting here. All right, so all right, one more sort of very easy fact. It's a products of splinter rings are also splinters. So if you combine sort of the first two statements here, it's pretty easy to reduce almost all questions that we're talking about for splinters. Almost all questions that we're talking about for splinters to just working with normal domains. All right. Okay. Moreover, right, so the splinter condition can also be checked locally. All right. And of course, here you could also. Um, and of course, here you could also use all maximal ideals instead of all prime ideals, too. Right, and uh, so sort of want to kind of end the easy part here with something that's maybe a little less obvious from this, but for those that have seen these things before, you'll know where I'm going. Right, so as I said, for the most part, you can reduce to looking at normal domains when thinking about the questions related to splinters, right? So, um, let's say that. Right, so let's say that again, R is an Ethereum domain, right? So let's K, let's let K be its fraction field, right? Now what I can do is look at R plus, right? So this is the so-called absolute nervous closure of R, right? So I'll say it in a couple other ways. So this is the union of all of the Of the module finite extension rings S over R living inside of a fixed algebraic closure of its fraction field. Okay. Here. And one of the points here is: all right, so the splinter condition says that each one of these are union of all the S's. Okay. The splinter condition says that these are all split. All right. So in Split, right? So, in general, then it's easy to convince yourself that R is a splinter if and only if the corresponding map here from R to R plus is pure. Right, so and what does that mean? So, this is just another word for saying that this map here is. Another word for saying that this map here is universally injective, i.e., when you base change it or tensor up to any module, it remains injective. All right. Any questions here so far? Okay. So All right, so I'm kind of amazed I get to be the first one to say this at this conference. All right, so we state the direct sum end theorem. All right, so they said if your ring is equal characteristic zero, then asking if you're a splinter is the same thing as asking that you're normal. However, in mixed and positive characteristics, equal characteristic P or a mixed characteristic, right, the condition here is. The condition here is much stronger, right? And so the direct summment theorem here says that a regular ring, right? I'll put it this way. So regular rings are splinters. All right, so one reason. Um, so uh, one reason to put this up here is uh at least to give you some uh other examples of splinters in mixed and positive characteristic. But let me say that there are quite a few more that then follow directly as well, right? So, other examples you would get in something related to another previous talk from today. So, direct summands. Of regular rings, then also automatically fall sort of into the same thing. All right, so just to put some more examples down. Rational double points of mixed characteristic p bigger than five. Characteristic p bigger than five coming out of some previous joint work of myself and others as well, fall in that category. All right, so I don't want to sort of go too deep into the local picture, so, but certainly this is a good motivation for thinking of then splinters in mixed and positive characteristic as some notion related to the mildness of the singularities of the ring. Okay, um, I do want to say a little bit, however, about uh the About the ideas from Andre's proof that, or the ideas coming out of Andre's proof, that will help show this. And I guess before I go further too, I should also mention that many of the ideas that Andre builds upon, right, so at least in dimension three, were also. Least in dimension three were also investigated by Heitman as well. Okay, so let's say that Rm is a complete local domain, right? And mixed characteristic or characteristic P. So let's say that I have a fixed prime P, which is inside of the maximal ideal, right? So then one way to interpret Andre's proof or one thing that comes out of his proof. Andre's proof, or one thing that comes out of his proof, is that there exists, uh, so and well, again, other things that are amazing about this talk, usually I just say these words and they don't really have any meaning, but they've already been defined. There exists an integral perfectoid BCM algebra. Otter B, right? And so as soon as you have the existence of these things, it's very easy to then deduce the splitting condition from this thing. But basically, this is one of the main consequences of the technique in here. Okay, I should also say that the existence of big Komacai R algebras in a Algebras in a functorial way was also looked at by Ma and Heitman as well. So there's a lot of recent work from recent years that builds upon many things. Okay, any questions here? Okay, great. All right, so one of the reasons I've tried to present it this way and introduce the B, right, is to give you another definition. Okay, so this one is due to mod Schweed. Okay, so again, let's say same setup as before. So you take a complete local domain of mixed or positive characteristic. So they defined something which is a variation in many ways on the splinter condition. They said that this ring here is. ring here is BCM regular, right? Okay, so be a little careful in their definition, although it's not super essential here. Right, take R to be Q-Gorenstein, right? So this thing is BCM regular if and only if Right, for all BCMR algebras B, the map from R to B is pure. All right, so and so let me say one more thing here, right? So in this setting, at least when your ring is complete, right, a pretty easy MATLAS duality argument will give you another way to think. Argument will give you another way to think about this. So, in the complete setting, map is pure from R if and only if it's also split. Okay? Okay. Okay. So we don't know the detail now because the digital art goes. So, I don't think I need it for the way I put it on the definition here, but feel free to take it and in my mind, and this will come out of what I'm going to write in the next board too, and maybe what you'll say in a later talk where you say more things in the local picture, right? But it should also just suffice to take a sufficiently large B here, okay? Okay, keep adding nice, keep adding other things. Okay, so not super important, and uh, I'll get to that in a second, right? So, um, but I want to sort of make the following remark. So, I've tried to set up the sort of preliminaries here as much as I can to work both in mixed characteristic and in equal characteristic P. And in equal characteristic P, right? So let me say if the characteristic of R is equal, if I am in equal characteristic P, right? So one, I want to relate this back to Rebecca's talk as well, right? So again, in the Q-Gorenstein setting, one of the reasons you might look at this or another way to interpret this. At this, or another way to interpret this is in terms of tight closure, right? So, here, right, I can talk about the so-called finitistic test ideal for the ring. Okay, in the Q-Gornstein setting, these things are the same anyway, right? So, but let me give you the definition. So, look at all the elements of the ring that send the type closure of all ideals back into the Type closure of all ideals back into themselves, right? So, right? It's a theorem that this is in fact equal to the trace ideal as defined in Rebecca's talk, right, for some for all sufficiently large B. All right, so I'm going to. All right, so what is this? This is the image of the evaluation map at one from the hom set hom B R back to R. Okay, all right, so I wrote a theorem here, right? So you can find sort of this exact statement in joint work with Ron Kea Dada, right? But the, and it's very similar to other states. And it's very similar to other statements in the work of Perez-RG. And the real heavy lifting for us in this theorem is not really due to run KRI. This is really due to very clever constructions of Mel about showing that you can take all type closure relations and capture them with some sufficiently large B. Okay? All right. So point being that, so I've got a couple of different notions of the singularities up on the. Couple of different notions of the singularities up on the board, right? So I have these splinter conditions, I have something which is slightly different. So this BCM regular, right? And I have, you can think about if you're familiar with it, notions of type closure that are also mixed into the picture, right? So, and some of the motivation for this project comes out of some additional exciting results of bot. Exciting results of bot sort of tying this picture together. Okay, so for you sort of two theorems, the first in equal characteristic p right, so again, So again, let's say that you're an equal characteristic P. So Fb is contained in your R. So then. Right, then R plus is BCM and mixed characteristic. One option then for this B here. This be here right is the following. So, again, R complete local on P inside of M. All right, so sort of generalizing this theorem, he says is that the G at a completion of R plus. Of R plus is a big Homer Cole algebra. Okay. All right. So this maybe also ties in with Ronquia's question, right? So sort of implicitly on the board, now over here, you can put in for B R plus or R plus hat, right? So it doesn't really make too much of a difference here, right? And what you'll get is the notion of sort of plus regular. Of sort of plus regular, which is the same as splinter, right? And maybe slightly weaker than if you take a larger B that dominates our plus, but we don't know. Okay? Okay. All right. So as I transition sort of to the next part of the talk, let me just tell you what the overall goal is. So, the first one is just sort of to take these notions, which are essentially local in nature, and form a global theory out of them and investigate the applications. And the second one Right, as is very common, also to introduce so-called the formalism of divisor pairs, which allows for applications related to things similar in birational geometry. All right, so that's the main thrust of the talk at this point. Okay, so I want to fix the definitions and things get a little technical in parts. So I've done what I can to try and minimize as much as possible. So to the extent that I'm able, I want to sort of fix the following setup or a big chunk of the talk. All right, so here let's take X to be An Ethereum normal integral scheme It's proper over a local ring, and for safety, let me make this complete, right? So, and again, mixed or positive. Right, so and again, mixed or positive characteristic. Okay, although at least in some parts, so wave that a little bit, okay. And then let me add in the divisor setting as well, right? So I'm working on a normal variety, so this thing, I have no problems talking about v divisor, so let me fix. Or an effective Q divisor for the talk on X. Okay. Okay. And very little will be lost in the talk here if at this point you imagine R to be the p-adx and just be taking a projective, something projective over that. That okay, so here's the big definition: sort of the generalizing or trying to globalize the definition of a splinter. All right, so we say that this pair X delta is globally plus regular. All right, sort of building on the terminology of Ma and Schwed. Terminology of mod and Schwed, right? If the following conditions hold, well, whenever I have f from y to x, right, so this should be a finite map, right? All over r, right? And this is the source is normal and integral, right? Normal and integral, right? So if whenever I take sort of a finite cover of x, the following map of sheaves on x. Right, OX to well, the push forward of the structure sheet from OI, right, then twisted. Right, then twisted by the pullback of the divisor, all right. All right, this thing should split uh in the category of OX modules globally, right? So there exists a map of sheaves again so that this composition is data. Okay, is everyone happy with this definition? Sure. Okay, or insert the word normal cover, right, inside of what's going on here. Inside of what's going on here. Okay, just a quick remark here. Right, so before you even think to worry about roundings, just don't. All right. So making Y bigger and bigger, you can ensure that. You can ensure that there are no roundings to round this downing, but join enough roots, right, so that you can just forget that you can assume that this pullback here will be an integral device to begin with. Okay. Okay, so again, let me start off with some facts. All right, so well, the first one should be immediate. So this really does generalize the local definition. So let's say X is spec R, which certainly falls in my setup, right? So then Right, so then R is a splinter if and only if it's whatever X is globally plus regular, or the pair X, zero is globally plus regular, if you will. Okay, all right, so we at least have some examples here. Right, so for those of you who are familiar with the characteristic piece side of the story, a very similar thing was done in positive characteristic, where the attempt was made, a very successful attempt, to take the notion of F-regularity and take that local. F regularity and take that local theory and translate it to study globally F regular varieties. So let me say that here. So if you're working in equal characteristic T again. All right, well then you're globally Right, well then if you're globally irregular then so at least in positive characteristic, here's another way to generate a bunch of examples very quickly, right? It's reasonable to expect that this is close to an if-mean-only if or hope that it is in some way, right? Hope that it is in some way, right? And without saying any of that, let me say that this is very closely related to the question locally of whether F regular and splinter are the same condition. Okay. Okay. All right. So some other facts. Okay. So let's say that X delta is globally irregular. Global F regular. Right. Then, oh, globally F regular, I wrote, but I don't mean that. I mean plus regular. Right. Then you also have that X is pseudo-rational. And in particular, is Comic Cauli. Is called Macaulay. Okay. And I guess I can say more. If Kx plus your boundary is Q Cartier, then X delta is also KLT. Okay. I guess I can add that, in fact, you're rational in the sense of kovach as well. Okay. Okay. And sort of lastly, right, so you can think about this if you're familiar with globally forgiven varieties as something, you know, as some kind of analog. And some of the arguments do go through. Of analog, and some of the arguments do go through pretty much the same, right? So, um, here's one: let's say that you take um uh some other right, so proper normal integral variety over spec r, right, and I take a proper birational map. Right, from X to Z over R, then if I start with a globally plus regular pair here, I can produce one downstairs. All right, so in a very similar way, sort of by taking the splittings and just restricting them open on open sets to go back down to Z. Okay, in particular, if you happen to know that the corresponding pair down here is also QCAR T, you get that this pair downstairs here is KLT. All right, so all right, great. Any questions? Great. So let me just state that now. So okay. So again, if you're familiar with Goldlaf regular varieties, great. This is some kind of possible slight weakening that could be the same. Let's say you're not, right? Then I think in your mind, you should be thinking of this. I think in your mind, you should be thinking of this as some kind of mixed characteristic analog of logfano, right? And let me just state sort of the conjecture, which would be true for globally F regular, but we don't know here. So let's say X is projective over R, in addition to being proper, right? And let's say it's globally plus regular. All right, so the question is: Does there exist some boundary divisor on X so that X delta is globally plus regular and minus Kx minus delta is ample. Right, so of course, if these were the same, then we know it for globally F regular. So I get that for free here. And otherwise, we don't really have a good way to produce the boundary divisors right now to do this conjecture. Okay. Not even in nice cases. Okay. But I certainly expect it to be true or morally it feels true. True, or morally, it feels true, right? In which case, this is some kind of a strengthening then of a log one. Okay, so what's the point here? So we've introduced this global notion. I want to sort of try to convince you that this is useful in some way. So, in order to do that, as I said, much of this is inspired by work of Work of bot, right? So, let me tell you a theorem that, in addition to showing that r plus hat p is comma cauli, there's a bunch of other global statements that Bargov shows sort of as part of the same package. So, this is bots come out of Viveg vanishing on X? All right. All right, all right. So let's say that L is a big and semi-ample line bundle on X, right? And let's say that J is less than the dimension of X, right? Then, all right, so this is going to look very technical, but the claim is that if that this really is a version of Commodore Viveg on R plus, right, so. out of Viveg on R plus, right? So again, Rm was the sort of maximal ideal of my local ring downstairs. All right, so this vanishing here looks really complex. This vanishing here looks really complicated, but it really is just somehow the R-Mountless dual of Comoda Vivek vanishing that you would have expected on X. And we'll see that, and I'll translate that in a second here. All right. So I don't, I will say something about what this X plus here is in a second, but only just say that it's the global version of the R plus from before, right? So in other words, it's the, I guess, geometrically, it's the inverse. Geometrically, it's the inverse limit of all of the covers y over x. Okay. Okay. Right. So, all right, so the first advertisement for you that this is really a useful notion, globally plus. Is really a useful notion globally plus regular for these pairs is that it allows us to give on any globally plus regular variety, you get the analog of Kadira, I'm sorry, Kamoda Geva vanishing. So let me state the theorem and then I'll say a little bit more about that duality. All right, so let's say that you're globally plus regular, and let's say I take. And let's say I take a Cartier divisor L or a line bundle L, right? And it has the form Ax plus delta plus something big and semi-ample, right? So my notation is not, is just for board notation, not for papers, right? So what I mean here is that L minus Kx minus delta is a Kx minus delta is a big and semi-ample deposition. Okay. All right. So then the assertion is that h i of this is zero for i bigger than zero. Okay. All right. So I want to. All right, so I want to sort of show you how this can easily be deduced directly from Bargo's vanishing pen. Ah, great. Right, so you're right. So I'll say that here in a second. Right, so pi is just the map from x plus back to x. All right, so let's do this. Probably should have introduced, put this definition on the other board. Right, so again, here, pi is the map from x plus to x. And here I'm thinking about this as the inverse limit of all of the y's. Which are these finite covers showing up again in the definition of globally plus regular? Okay. All right. So if I look at this on rings, of course, it looks a bit different. So on rings, the structure sheaf of X plus is, in fact, this, the union of the S's, right, going the other way. All right, going the other way. So, what I'm going to do is look at the induced map here from kx minus l into this guy, where I've twisted each one up by again by going to bigger and bigger y's, I don't really have to worry about any roundings. I don't really have to worry about any roundings that show up over here. All right, so, and this thing here is, but in other words, this is just pi lower star OX plus of pi upper star, again, kx plus delta minus l. Okay. All right. So why have I written it this way? Well, forget the limit here for a second. If I just look at the map from OX to F Laura star. Ox to f lower star oy with the delta, I've required all those things to split, right? When I have a split map, I can sort of apply any functor to it and it stays split, right? So it's easy to convince yourself that then I twist by kx minus l, right? That stays split. So this arrow here is a co-limit of split maps, okay? In particular, this map here is then. This map here is then pure. Okay. You can probably already see the relationship between the two. Now, just apply the functor you would get to sort of use this theorem. I'll see if I do it, make sure I don't do it wrong. All right, so applying this guy to the split extension stays injective, and then the injective video is preserved by the colimet as well. Right, but now the right-hand side of this thing down here, this thing is minus big enf. Right? Right, so exactly the setting where you can apply Bot's vanishing theorem. And so the bot implies that the right-hand side is zero, right? So it injects into zero. So the left-hand side then is zero. And now MATLAS duality. Right, taking the R M Atlas dual gives you, well, it's certainly sufficient to show that this is zero. Okay. Any questions? Is the NAFS any help? Oh, yes. I would love to be able to put NAF there. Love to be able to put an F there, right? So you can tell Bargov that we expect him to improve his vanishing theorem at any moment. Great. Why limit him? That was just, right? And that's the other, I keep saying that it's the analog of Karma Revive, and that's what I would have put down there if I was trying to shoot for that. Okay. Okay. All right. So hopefully, all right. Hopefully, you're at least somewhat convinced that this is a framework where I can apply some of these really awesome vanishing theorems coming out of Bargoff's work. All right, maybe say there are more that you can apply, right? But I don't really want to go into them. I think the main idea has been covered, right? So, but let me just mention it. Right, so you also have for this globally x delta is globally plus regular, right? So that the higher homology of the structure sheet also vanishes. Okay. Any questions about this? Okay. So again, Again, if you're familiar with the positive characteristic side of the story, right, then you know that in addition to sort of the global notions, globally if regular, another part of the package that's been very useful in approaching things like the MMP impositive characteristic is to look at Frobenius stable sections, right? So that's another big part of the package I want to show you here. All right, so I could say plus stable sections, but maybe the better thing to say would be to say trace stable sections of line bundles. I think I've heard them called at least once here. Let me say what that is. So, again, for much of the setup, I start off with this when I Why not map where y is normal? All right, so well, I can take this thing, and duality is going to produce for me the trace map, right, which goes from the push forward of OIKY to OXKX. And again, this is just the growth indicatual of the map on the structure sheaves that. Dual of the map on the structure sheaves, if you will. All right. In particular, I can take this map for any Cartier divisor m on x, right? So I have an induced map here. What I'm going to do is twist this kx over here to the left-hand side, right, and then twist. Right, and then twist up by M right and introduce my boundary divisor. All right, so just twisting this trace map will give me a map here from this sheaf here on y down to OX of m, right, for an arbitrary line. Ox of m right for an arbitrary line bundle. Okay, so the idea is then, well, look at the global sections that are always hit under all of these trace maps. All right, so definition B0X delta for this Cartier divisor M right is, well, the intersection, again, over all of these finite covers, right? And I'm going to look at the image of that map on H0. And so H0, Y. Why is everyone happy with the idea here? So, certainly the image for any fixed guy is a, say, R size. Is a um say our submodule here of uh h0 of xm anyways, and I'm taking the intersection inside of that, okay? All right, great. So, some properties again. Well, first off, let's say that x delta is globally plus regular. Then, in particular, V naught is H naught. Right for all m in fact, the converse also holds, and you only need to look at m equals zero. All right, so for that to be true. Okay, all right, so but if your goal is less regular, then the point here is that the trace stable sections are all the sections, right? So this gives you a lot of flexibility to. This gives you a lot of flexibility to sort of use finite covers and related things to prove things about sections of line bundles. Okay, another one. All right, so I can write down the definition here of B naught in a slightly different way. All right, so what I could do is I could take the inverse limit again over all the y's. All right, first, and then I can map that here down to OX of M. All right, so the claim is that this is an alternate description, right? It looks slightly different, but there's a substantive change, right? So before. Change, right? So before, right, I looked at sort of the intersection of images just sitting inside of the right-hand side. And here, what I'm requiring is I'm only looking at those sections which have compatible lifts up all the way for all finite covers. Okay, all right, so in particular. Right, so in particular, B not behaves sort of as you would expect it and is compatible then with finite maps. So if you would like to take the car and open up the hood, that's exactly what you need to show the statement, basically. So yeah. Statement basically, so yeah. Um, and uh, since I'm talking to an expert here, so this is one of the places where it's essential that R is complete and what's going on. Okay. Right, so um right, so uh on that board, uh, On that board, the claim was that B0 behaves as expected for finite maps. And maybe here's where your first surprise comes in. Right, when Kx plus delta is Q Cartier, you can also consider So, sort of building on a theme from Veronica's talk: not just finite maps, but for alterations. And when you do that, right, so here in the definition, all you're going to do is put down an alteration instead of the finite covers, right? Now it's essential that Kxplic. Now it's essential that kx plus delta is q k, or else this pullback makes no sense. But when you do that, the corresponding set of sections you get miraculously is the same. Okay. And so in particular, you expect the expression of the expression. You also get the expectation. You also get the expected transformation rule for alterations as well. Okay. All right, so this is a couple of quick examples. Right, so some quick examples. Right, so here sort of is the put down the bend in the road symbol for you. Okay, so let's say you take elliptic curve over Zp, right? Then Right, then surprise, the set of trace stable sections is in fact zero on the nodes, right? This is particularly surprising given that at each five, well, the easy way to see this is to look at the multiplication by P map and get P divisibility for larger and larger powers of P, right? Nothing particularly special. Right, nothing particularly special about elliptic curves here that's going on, right? You can generalize it quite a bit, but the point here is that one corollary of this is that the intersection that you're using in the definition of B0 cannot stabilize, right? At least globally here, right? For each particular Y, the image of the trace map will be some set of non-zero sections, okay? Right, so it really is an infinite intersection, and that should scare you some, right? In part, because if you're worried about. Right, in part because if you're worried about things like localization, and I've just done something like that down here, right, you can see that that can't work. Right, um, I have cheated a little bit down here because now I'm no longer really in mixed characteristics, so but forgive the forgive my notational sins. Okay, so in the last couple of minutes I have left, sort of, I want to get to at least eight feature results here, right? So, and to do that, what I'm going to tell you is, or I have to introduce some sort of adjoint analog of S0 or B0. Okay. Okay, so again, suppose now that your boundary divisor has the following form. Looks like S plus B, where just for simplicity right now, I'll generalize this in a second. The S here is a reduced prime divisor, and I'm looking with a view towards doing some sort of adjunction onto S. Okay? And Right, so this B doesn't have any components related to the S. Okay, all right, well, when you take this thing, when you take a finite map, f from y to x, right, even though I've required y to be normal and integral, right, s here under the finite cover is likely to break up into multiple components, all right. Multiple components. All right. So, what I'm going to do is for every y, I'm going to choose some prime component that dominates s. Okay, and I'm going to use that to sort of tweak my definition of. My definition of B0. So, again, to say M is a Carkey divisor on X. What I can do is I can look at what's called B0S Um, right, so look at the same intersection here where I sort of look at trace images, right? But now, in addition. But now, in addition, I also incorporate this transform divisor SY All right, so landing again down in All right, so not obvious from the description here, right, that in fact this, well, has an interpretation on X plus, right? And choosing a sort of prime divisor over S, and that you can use that in some sort of. That you can use that in some sort of Gaupine invariance among the choices of those y's here to show that this is independent of the choices of the s y's in each of the models. Okay. All right, so the following is sort of the key lemma, which really makes a lot of applications move forward. So again, let's say this is S plus B is above. And again, let's say you have a Cartier divisor, which has the form again, Kx. has the form again kx plus delta plus again plus something big and semi-ample right and let's say that uh sn to s is the normalization of this uh prime divisor s right so then uh what you get is some uh very useful lip You get is some very useful lifting of section statement. Right, so b0x delta l, in fact, with the adjoint version, surge x onto. Right to the restriction here to the normalization, where this is the usual difference. Okay. And let me just say that at this point, to prove this lifting section statement really just leverages the same vanishing theorem, right, for big and semi-ample divisors on OX plus interpreted appropriately, right? And this is sort of the Right, and this is sort of the big tool at the heart of the machinery, which makes many of the applications go forward. All right, so in particular, the big application is that you can show you get applications to MMP in dimension three mixed characteristic P at least five. So maybe more precisely, right? If you take a KLT three fold, right, and all of the closed points have characteristic P bigger than five or possibly characteristic zero, you can run a You can run a MMP that terminates appropriately in some sort of either a Mouy-Friver space or a minimal model. In fact, subsequent work by Liam Steegan has shown, in fact, that every such MMP in that setting also terminates. So it's not just the ones we can do. Not just the ones we can do. There are other statements for the MMP for sort of certain pseudo-effective pairs that are pretty standard here, and many other applications, which maybe I'll relegate you to the paper to look at. Let me stop there. Any questions for that? And like does this characterize the words? Great. So yes. So the question is: is there some sort of derived variant? Right. And I'm going to hopefully answer the question completely by not by saying that we don't have to worry about it, right? Which is that bots results in mixed characteristic and characteristic p say that splinter and derived splinter are the same. So sort of roughly speaking, we're doing both the derived derived splinters. We're doing both the derived variant already, right? And that's actually the reason why these vanishing theorems hold and the source of the whole picture here for the splinter thing. But the theorems would not hold true, of course, in characteristic zero, right? Where the derived splinter is a very different condition. Mixed or positive, right? So, yeah. Any more questions? How about Zoom? Can we hear them? Well, if there's no more questions, let's thank Kevin again.
