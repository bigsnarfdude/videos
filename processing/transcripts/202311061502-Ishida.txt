And based on a joint with my advisors, Albert Chander, then Chris Button. Okay. So uh so what is this talk about? I want to talk about carbodynamics, which means the time evolution of spacecraft. So now I want to show you one example for the video. Ah but it's already there, okay. For example, I have an instance of cup dynamics. Like originally like I have like two leaf cups called Like two linked curves called hot links. And then I apply some physical models, actually coming from fluid dynamics called vault experiments. And then they evolve in time, experiencing topological changes like splitting and buzzing. And obviously, as we can see, the number of curves changes, like two, two, five. So now the dynamics behind this doesn't really matter. What I want to say is, like, this is some dynamics. Want to say is like this is some dynamics, and we see some like topological changes. Okay, so for this kind of curve dynamics, I want to talk about like two things. The one is implicit representation of spacecraft. And the other is we are not thinking about. We are now thinking about its symplectic structure to the Hamiltonian curve diagrams. And this is our ongoing part of this meeting. And as a disclaimer, probably like this is the time a lot, I'll make a lot of sketchy arguments with doing some shitting with like notation. Okay. So talking about our implicit version of capital dynamics, I wanna talk I wanna quickly review something existing that I call existing cap d uh sorry, explicit carbon dynamics. Explicit carb dynamics. But like in order to talk about carb dynamics, you need two things. One is carb configuration, the other is carbodynamics. So the first one is carbodynamics, carb configuration. So to talk about carb configuration, I need a map gamma from some time domain t times a bunch of cycles to three-dimensional space, and in this talk I takes m to be just all three. And then this gamma is just a cut configuration both in time and space, right? Both in time and space. And then curve dynamics, or fast order in time. And if you just give a map view or a field of the curve, then you can define a curve dynamics. And in order to simulate some kind of curve dynamics that I showed as an animation, there's some technical challenge. Obviously, there's no way to describe topological changes, like splitting or muzzling, especially if the number of curves changes that you don't want to do or like. Curves and don't want to do or like to do them because the domain there is fixed to be a fixed number of curves. So it cycles. Is this in mind? I don't know. Introduce an implicit curve dynamics. So fast curve configuration. So I represent half by a co-dimensional two kind of clips variables, which is uh just a complex valued time space function. Whose zeros agree with the image of my card gamma? So, like, this is the visualization. So, like, I have cart gamma. And then, as a right-handed side at one is a visualization of the zeros, of the real part of my side, and the imaginary part of my side. And they are both surfaces with co-dimension one, and together the intersection is my curves with co-dimension two. And obviously, topological sensors are already important in my website continuously, so I have no single idea. Cool. And then implicit carbon dynamics. So I'm gonna begin with an observation. So the time evolution of eclipse by site can be actually understood as a transfer of site along some vector field. Of psi on some extra field, which means disproportionate. So if I fix a good enough psi, both in space and time, and then the time evolution of psi isolate, then we can find a vector field, V D, that solves the transport equation together with my size and my zeros. In this sense, I say the A tangent vector of the zero. The A tangent vector of psi that I denoted by psi dot is greater in terms of like minus d psi acting on d. So far, I have introduced both implicit configuration and carbodynamics, and we made this job originally for numerical purposes to nicely handle the voltage changes of carbodynamics. The Harvard theory, and we are now interested in telescope. And we are now indulging in theoretical aspects of this. Especially, we are indulging in the question whether there is a symplectic structure for this implicit representation of curves for polyton planets. And from now on, I forget about topological changes, things, and I limit my curve just like one single cup. And I do not think about topological changes because it makes things complicated. Okay. Okay, so again, Erina quickly reviewed the previous work. Like, the space or unparallelmentalized space curves is known to up to reparametalization. But this thing is known to have a symplexic structure called the mass and Binstein form, which is just an integral sum of volume created by the tangent vector, actually, tangent vector. Sorry, uh tangent the curve and complex are u and v and I integrate this model over the curve. Like this image taken from a normal Kessenberg. So the next question is, do implicit curves also element any symplectic structure? Maybe yes. And to make a symplectic structure rather than a pre-symplectic structure, I make some identification. So like I identify my function psi and psi, I must have no. Size minus some nowhere connecting function, right? Because I mean tested only in the location of the zeros. So I said the short answer that we observe so far is yes. So as I mentioned briefly, I said that tangent space at my psi is given this way. V psi and something computer over the space, and I make up some identification. make up some identification and B is equivalent to V prime if they is the same infinitesimal motion of the zeros of like star like all those calculus styles this is necessary because like I don't want some arbitrary results suddenly show up from nowhere else I continuously move my journals and we find some one form in this case one form in this case, which is the integral of B, sorry, the inner product of V and gradient or the argument of psi over the surface, all over the space. And then this defines the form, which means the two form omega as the accelerator derivative of theta is a simplistic form. I I don't I didn't write omega because it's kind of complicated, but Complicated, but actually, I mean, it's just almost the same as the explicit Mauslin-Beinstein structure for explicit curves. This is just a you know explicit Mauslin-Beinstein form written in time or max pi. So I haven't written this down. Okay. And there are many things that I can talk about this theta form. But today I want to talk about only one thing about this. Actually, theta. Actually, theta has a geometric meaning that helps us to connect explicit and implicit curves. More precisely, I say like theta has some shape. To do this, I want to make some consideration about explicit curves again. So like I want to think about some bundle structure. My base space is explicit curves, right? Equipped with Muslim LifeShine form. And then my fiber bundle is My fiber bundle is all the surfaces that are connected and oriented. And my fibrillation pi is just a operation that takes bundle of my surface. So in this sense, at each base point curve gamma, my fiber consists of all the dipheld surfaces spanning my curve gamma, like this image. Again, taking another MCS network. And I defined And I define one form for the spaces as a flux or some extra field, sigma dot through sigma. With this one form, I can formally get a structural pre-quantum model, which means B theta equals uh the previous of constant binary strong by pi. So in this sense, like theta is kind of a uniform bipolar control structure, like this. With the help of this, I can now talk about the shape of my theory. To do so, I want to think about a particular set of surfaces parameters by something A, in the same file. For this, I now fix my crypto value site for GAM and then uh And then this is a visualization of each level surface of the argument of psi. Like if I have a curve like this, and then like this is a kind of cross-section. And then like this visualization is for the argument of psi. And then like for each level surface, I'm just my cap gamma. So I can define theta sigma a thing. And of course, I can. And of course I can think about its average as average flux or V. So all over my level satisfies. This actually agrees with feedback that I defined for side. Well, like they give the same value. So So, in this sense, I somehow completed explicit graphs and implicit graphs at the level of UVL form with the help of the content. But this is and like this, you know, thing as a shape, like this. But this is my main message. Okay. Conclusion. I introduced an implicit presentation of spacecraft, and I'm And I'm studying its syntax structure. And there are a lot of things to think about and study. For example, like I see a lot of information with other fields, like complex geometry and cohomology theory, polymer cohomology and technology. So stay tuned for my future update. Okay, thank you. Can you also formulate the vortex sheet case? Oh, that's a very good question. At this point, I need a sort of other. But for yes, it's like other co-dimensional two cases. And what I can say already is, I can do this job for like the other direction, which means like point volt sets on the surface. And one interesting thing I observed is, you know, like you can talk about a symplectic form for point volt sets on the surface. For point volts on the surface, say sphere. And then this is obviously not exact because, like, it's coming from the area form of the sphere, which is not exact. But, you know, I think I can do this chart on the sphere as well. In this case, uh I can say that my implicit uh symplectic structure for crypto variables on the sphere, other than it's a reveal form. On SPI, other than it's a rebuild form, which I think is cool. And I think this kind of can be explained in terms of becoming Tambunda again. Sorry, I think I answered your question a bit too much. Thanks again, Satoshi. So we now have half an hour break. We're finished with the regular talks of the day. The last two things of the day are Cornelia Wittmann giving a tutorial on geometry of Poehler-Carnal equations. Geometry of Coyle-Arnold equations. And then immediately after, Klatz Moden giving a tutorial on Wasserstein autogeometry. But for now, half an hour break, we come back at 3.45.
