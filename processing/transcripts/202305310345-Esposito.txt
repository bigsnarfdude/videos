Okay, very good. What is the which is the pointer? Okay, here, very good. All right, so what I will discuss today is based on two joint works. One, together with Francesco Patakini, Andre Schlichtin, and Dean Slebshev, who is where we introduced the non-local interaction equation on graphs. And then there is another result in collaboration with Georg, Heinz, and Franchet, and Andres lifting. Angler shifting where we basically consider and study what happens when the graph localizes. Oh, there is some. Okay. Can I? Okay. Yeah. So, okay, let me start with a very brief introduction, just like giving motivations of why we started. So, the main motivation comes from data science, in principle, because data. Science in principle because data have the form of a point clouds, and in order to access reasonable information and important information on the data, especially when the number of data is very large, a useful way is to consider tasks associated to them, to classify the data, also to consider tasks such as clustering, community detection, and etc. Okay, but how can we think? Oh, Marcus here. Nice picture, Marco. Thank you. And okay, so one way to consider the graph is, so we can consider, we can start from a point cloud, which is basically like a set of random, so it's a random sample identical disciplining according to a certain measure mu, and we can think of Certain measure Î¼, and we can think of this set as it can be identified by an empirical measure. And in this case, we have then our set of vertices. Then, where do we see the graph? If we introduce a function eta, see metrics such a way we have an undirected graph, then the function eta is telling us whether these points are or not. Okay, and how in particular. Okay, and now we have our graph. So, what we were interested in So what we were interested in was to describe dynamics on the graph, in particular dynamics driven by non-local interaction. What do I mean is that imagine that you can that on each vertex you can store some mass, okay? And then what you want to describe is the mass displacement within the graph. Okay, so this is what we wanted to do. And the energy that we so basically we wanted to consider the non-local non-local. Wanted to consider the non-local interactions. And if you think, okay, so let's say if you think for finite graphs, then what you, so basically like what you have, you have this non-local interaction energy, which is a finite sum. In particular, by here, by rho x, I mean the mass at the vertex x, okay, or the mass at the vertex y, in that case. And okay, the main difference between Rb and the graph. Between Rd and the graph is that now on RDE, you know that if you want to model a set of interactive particles, I mean, as also Cose and also Marcus pointed out in your talk, then you can basically you can just solve these ODEs for each particle. But now the point is that on RD, particles or agents, whatever you want to call this, then they are moving and the mass is attached to the particles. On the graph, especially for what we want to describe, For what we want to describe, the particles or the vertex, if you want, is fixed. It's the mass that is moving. So basically, you want to look at the variation of the mass at each vertex, x. And if you want to do that, basically what you need to do is to consider all outcoming and ingoing fluxes. So you sum all the fluxes. Obviously, you only sum up the fluxes that are connected. Okay, so then you need to multiply. Connected. Okay, so then you need to multiply by the width function data. And okay, we go back to this later in the talk, but I mean, now, when you consider the flux, the flux is not just the product between density and the velocity, because the density is a vertex-based quantity, while the velocity can be seen also as a jump, can be seen also as a jump rate, okay, or as a difference of potentials, if you want. But I will go back to the But I will go back to this later on, especially because the choice of the interpolation function is not unique. Right, what were our goals? So in principle, the first talk was to define gradient flow of interaction energies on graphs. I didn't specify this actually in the previous slides, but then for us, a graph is identified by a measure and a and a weight function eta. In the previous slide, the measure was the empirical measure just because we had a finite graph. But we always, as a sub-goals, we always had in mind that we wanted to provide also, we wanted to ensure that the dynamic is stable under the graph limit, meaning that what happens when the number of vertices goes to finish, because this is basically what we're going to deal with, the number of well, the number of To deal with the number of while the number of data is huge, and in this sense, it is a two-continuum limit, but it's still at the level of the graph. Okay, so basically, it's a limit finite to infinite graph. Then, the second sub-goal was to be consistent with the local limit. So, imagine that we consider a wave function which is localizing. Do we get the non-local interaction equation or the in the limit as epsilon? On RD in the limit as epsilon was zero. Okay. And I will briefly discuss all these three points. Okay. So in order to fall through the first two tasks, actually, what we did was to write down a unified framework both for discrete and continuum class. Okay, these and the continuum equations. In particular, so we can imagine of a more general So, we can imagine a more general situation where, in principle, the set of all possible vertices is Rd. So, each point on Rd can be a potential vertex. And so, every an age, actually, a possible age can be any pair x, y up to the in principle. Then, actually, what is giving us then the set of ages is the function eta, okay? Because eta is that eta is giving. Because eta is that eta is giving an information on whether these points are connected or not. So, as a matter of fact, then the set of edges is the set where eta is positive. Okay, now in the in the very first slide for final graphs, mu was the empirical measure, but in particular, so as a matter of fact, you can think of a more general notion of vertices just having a measure mu. Okay, now on each. Now, on each vertex, you want to store, so we wanted to store some mass, and then what is modeling the mass is the distribution row, the probability measures row. Okay, I mean, here in principle, one could say that the support of rho is within the support of mu. But this is not always the case. I mean, we can also allow for more general, uh, for more general situations where mu is only selecting for some reason, just like a uh Some reason, just like a certain number of vertices, but the mass initially can also be outside to support of all right. And then, yes, the evolution of interest, as I said, is the gradient flow on the graph of the non-local interaction energy. And it's good, I mean, especially for this talk, always to make a comparison between the local and the non-local world. Okay, by non-local, I mean the equation on. non-local I mean the equation on the graph because the graph is non-local and then by local I mean the usual equation on Rd and in the local world the non-local interaction equation is a continued equation where the velocity field is minus the gradient of the perspiration of the of the energy so and this is a uh two bars and gradient flow uh i mean here i mentioned this paper uh but obviously i mean this was also already um Noticed by the book of Ambrogio, G, and Savare. In this paper, here they deal with more singular potential. Okay, so what is then out of then? The question is, what is the outlook of the non-local interaction equation on a graph? Okay, so I mean here I'm not mentioning like all the results. There's no time, unfortunately. I'm just like giving a list of related literature. A list of related literature, especially those that are more relevant for our purposes. So, the concept of passes and metric on finite graph has been reintroduced in this series of papers, independent papers by Maas, Mitke, Chou, Wang, Li, and Zhu, where they dealt with diffusion on graphs as a gradient flows of the entropy. Okay? And then I also want to mention many other papers that are pretty much related. Mentioned many other papers that are pretty much related to our study is this, like two papers by Heinz, Minschen, and Richman, where they extended basically what we did on for two species. And I also want to mention this paper by Day and Andrew Worre, when they study actually asymptotic properties of the non-local distance that is pretty much motivated by our first figures with that. With that, um, all right. The so basically, like, in uh, what we realized is that, especially in this paper by Elber Fatti, uh, and Schlichte, there is a gradient flow structure, if you want, for free energies, also including the entropy. But when, if we send the limit as sigma goes to zero, then the non-local metrics actually is not so clear whether there are. It's not so clear whether they're relevant for the dynamics, and also even the limit is not really well defined because, I mean, it depends on the sign, as we will see maybe later on. So then we had to find a suitable metric for gradient structures of interaction energies. And in order to do that, basically we had to understand first of all what does it mean to have an equation on a graph. So what is the continuous equation on a graph? And then how to build a metric. How to build a metric from that. Okay, so in RD, this is the continuum equation. Okay, this is written in flux form because actually like the flux form is important for us for other purposes. And the main difference is that on the graph, on the graph, the equation is not local. So the equation is not local because, I mean, as a matter of fact, we can't really talk about Fact, we can't really talk about gradients, but we need to talk about different gradients. So, in particular, just use this. So, by grad bar here, I mean by grad bar, I mean grad bar of phi, say xy is just the difference between phiy and phi x. So the gradient is a difference of subject. Actually, and then I mean, you can define the divergence as the negative adjoint operator, where obviously you need to weight with respect to the weight function eta. And then the divergence is a non-local operator. So then another point is how do we write down the flux? So what is the flux in this context? The flux in this context cannot just be the product between density. cannot just be the product between density and velocity because basically you know like we we want to we want to consider for each pair xy the dynamic between x and y so what is the density so which density do we pick do we pick rho x do we pick rho y what do we pick so in order to do that this also comes i think like from numerical schemes uh anytime that you discretize your space you need to consider an interpolation function of the density along the edges because the velocity Because the velocity is an edge-based quantity. The row is a vertex-based quantity. But if you interpolate the density along the edges, then you can write down your plots. The choice for the interpolation function is not unique. It pretty much depends on the problem that you want to describe. And in our setting, we propose a napwind interpolation where basically the density along the edge is. Basically, the density along the edges is the density at the source. Okay, that it means that the uh so if you plug this into the equation, as you can see here, you will have a gain-loss operator where the variation of the mass at the vertex x will depend on the sign of the velocity. So, if the velocity is positive, then when you plug on the other side, when you move to the other side, sorry, then you will have that rho is losing mass. Otherwise, rho will gain mass. Okay, and rho. Rho will gain mass. Okay, at rho, sorry, the vertex x will either lose mass or will gain mass. And if you consider this particular choice of the velocity field, so it's minus the dispute gradient or the first variation of the non-local interaction energy, then you get the non-local interaction equation on a graph. So here the square is because the graph is non-local, and then the non-local interaction equation is not local. So we have this double non-local equation. And here, okay, so here. And here, okay, so here I chose to, just for simplicity, to have rho absolutely continuous with respect to mu, but I mean, this can be extended also if this is not the case. All right. Now, once we have our equation, then we ask ourselves, okay, if we want to get a theory of gradient flows, what is the buses and distance? I mean, the bit, the distance, or the whatever, I mean, how do we formulate this as a gradient? I mean, how do we formulate this as a gradient flow? So we introduce an upwind transportation metric based on the dynamic formulation of the passes and distance, the two passes and distance. In particular, so the dynamic formulation of the distance by Benamu Breni, I mean, tells us that a possible way to connect two, say, different configurations of particles is to look at what are the connecting parts. What are the connecting paths? We can consider the continuum of the equations because we want to preserve the mass. And then, obviously, when we consider the continuum of the equation, we also have a driving vector field. And then the distance is going to be the minimal effort, if you want, which means that we need to minimize the kinetic energy on all possible velocity fields. So, in our case, obviously, I mean, because Case obviously, I mean, because of the upwind here, we don't have this structure here. In particular, A, we don't have the continuity equation, but we have a local continuum equation. And then, when we want to consider the kinetic energy, so to say, then you need to consider both contribution, both for the negative and the positive part of the velocity. So, I mean, like, intuitively, then what you have to consider is then this minimization problem. Okay, so the distance will come up as the. Okay, so the distance will come up as the infimum allowable possible solution of the non-local continuous equation. And then I want to minimize then this, say, sort of kinetic energy, which we can also call action. And in particular, if you want to solve this minimization problem, then because you want, I mean, like we used directly of calculus evaluation, and then we needed some complexity in both. Some convexity in both variables, so both rho and PE, but this is difficult to check unless then you go to flux variables. So we can define the non-local upwing transportation as the infimum of this action here. So basically, we just rewrote this in flats form. And we can And we can solve basically this minimization problem using the diagram of hardware separation. Okay, the main property, I mean, perhaps as you already noticed, is that I mean, I wrote a metric in quotation marks. So why? This is not a metric. It's a quasi-metric. It's a quasi-metric because of the upwind is not symmetric. Okay, so we don't have symmetry here. And so then So then the main consequence, I would say one of the main consequences is that when you want to identify this equation as a gradient flow, in particular if you want to write down the right-hand side as a gradient of something, then following autocalculus, we find out basically that this is not any minor structure, but a Finzler structure. So in particular, this is because when you want to This is because when you want to write down the scalar product, so if you want to define a scalar product on the tangent space, what you have is that the tangent space is a manifold on its own, in the sense that it will depend also not only on row, as it is for usually for buses, that gradient flows, but it will also depend on another flux chain. So on the tangent space, On the tangent space at rho, so tangent space of the probability measures at rho, I need to select a fiber, and then on that I can consider the inner product, the Vincent product. And then, okay, so if I want to understand the direction of steepest descent from rho, then we can define the gradient in, I mean, using the differentials, in particular, following auto conclusions. But the point is that if you, so when you fix here the velocity, and then I mean, you want to consider this map here, a map with respect to J. So this is a map from the tangent to the cotangent space, as it should be if you want to define the differential. And then this is only possibly one homogeneous because of the uppoint. In particular, then what you have is the direction of Then, what you have is the direction of steepest descent is not minus the gradient. So, whatever this gradient vector is, is not minus the gradient. But we have to define the direction of steepest descent as basically the vector solving minus the differential. Good. So, and then in this sense, we can then characterize the right-hand side as gradient, as a gradient with respect to. Gradient with respect to basically, we can then characterize gradient flows in these Pinsler spaces. And the gradient is going to have this form where you don't have only minus the gradient of the first variation, but you also take into account the sign of the velocity. So this is what comes if you started with the tangent space at the level of the velocity. And okay, here I'm going to be fast because I want to focus more on the graph, the local limit. On the graph, the local limit. I just want to say that in the first paper, what we did was then to use a variational characterization of the non-local interaction equation on a graph. And in particular, upon identifying weak solution as zero-level set of an energy functional, in principle, we saw weak solutions as curved on maximal slope with respect to a proper strong upper gradient. Strong upper gradients following the idea of the Georgi and the book by Rosengi and Sabre. So then basically then we then prove existence of weak solutions, as in particular considering a stability result of Palestine. And then in this sense, we've proven first a discrete continuum limit at the level of the graph and second loose existence. Level of the graph and second loose existence are a finite dimension approximation. Okay, now, okay, so this is basically what we did: a level of the role of refraction equation on the graph, but now I want to focus a little bit more on what happens if you want to localize the graph structure. So what happens if you want to go back to Rd, okay? Which can be seen as an approximation of both your space and the equation itself. And the equation itself. Okay, now we consider a localizing graph given by a particular choice of the weight function eta, which is a function of an age connectivity, another age connectivity function. I mean, here, I mean, we added basically like this, so this point here, just because we wanted to have like a more general result. But in principle, you can really think of if you forget about. Can really think of, if you forget about this dependence here, you can really think of like a localizing, a localizing getner. And I mean, here the scaling is important because we want to get an edge connectivity. It's again basically like just as a function telling us how the points are connected. So it's very general. It can be also, for instance, if you forget about this. If you forget about this, it can also be a function of the distance. Okay. I mean, it just you can see, I mean, theta basically has the same role of eta. We approach it. So, I mean, there must be some structural assumptions. Yeah, there are. But, but, I mean, it's well, I mean, yeah, for the moment being, like, it's, I mean, there are the assumptions. I wanted to skip just because otherwise it's too long, but yes. Because otherwise, it's too long, but yes. But you can think of, for instance, of theta as a function of the distance between the two points. The two points are connected if and only if the distance is in a certain radius. Okay, so the radius of each other in this case, for instance. And okay, what we want to do when, so basically, if I consider the non-local interaction equation in this regard, then I want to go from this equation, from the non-local interaction equation to the non-local equation. To the non-local interaction equations on RDE. But what we find out is that, in principle, we wanted to recover the basically this equation with the tensor being the identity. But then the graph structure gives a tensor. So then we have a tensor mobility, which depends on space X. Okay, the tensor has this form here where... Where, so in particular, here you can, so basically this tensor encodes what is left, what is left from the cloud structure somehow. And this is pretty much related with two papers, one by Lizzini, where he studies this equation as a gradient flow with respect to a particular Varsistan distance, I mean an equivalent distance, an equivalent to Versus and distance, I would say, but he has diffusion, he doesn't have no local interaction. And then the same equation. And then the same equation actually was obtained as a limiting behavior of random wolves on desolation very recently by Oliver Tzay. And I mean, I'm not going to say the surname here. It's very difficult. It's Anastasia, the second author, I mean, the other authors, not second authors. And okay, so right. So what are the steps? So, what are the steps? Very briefly. So, what are the steps that we need to do to understand if you want to go from one equation to the other one? So, first of all, let me draw your attention on this particular issue. So, here we have a Finsler structure, while here we have a reminder structure. Okay, so in particular, also we have two different distances. So, how do we, I mean, how do we pass the limit? So, first of all, we need to connect the non-local and the local. The non-local and the local world. In this sense, the main difference was the divergence, which means that if we start from a solution of the non-local continuum equation, then we want to construct a solution of the local continuum equation, which means we need to construct a reasonable local flux. And then, since we want to do a limiting argument, obviously, we need to show that. We need to show that if we do that for a sequence of solutions of local quantum equations, then we're going to get the sequence of solutions of the continuum equation. And then in the limit, we have still a solution of the continuum equation. Okay, now, how do we understand the limiting tensor structure? I think this is the crucial part. And so, as I said before, so we need to understand how do we pass from the Finsler The Finzler product to the Riemann product, okay, in this case. And what we have to do is a tangent flux is going to be of this form here. It's going to be of this form, and in particular, can be approximated by almost gradient. So the velocity, tangent velocities are almost gradient. And we need to look closely at the tangent to cotangent map that I mentioned before. That I mentioned before, and here you can see that okay, so if we replace V by gradients, then you see here that this one, so what we need to kind of extract is the symmetry. Okay, so we need to extract the symmetry from the non-symmetric structure. This is what we are doing. And basically, here, what we do is that, okay, if you first show that this basically that this map is That this map is almost symmetric again, and then you perform a, let's say, roughly speaking, an expansion of the test function here, then you get your Riemann product, your scalar product, okay, on the space of probably on the space of tangent, on a tangent space, sorry, and row. And then this is where precisely. And this is where precisely we find our text when we expand the filter product with respect to a fixed flux J or velocity quad phi. So and then here now you can see why we had like the scaling d plus two because we basically need to preserve so this is the leading order and we want this to be preserved in the link, the Weissman Longette equation. Weismanomic equation. Right, and then so what we can prove is that basically in the limit, we get to the limiting inner product where the tensor is given by this in this form here. And okay, then once we understood how to connect the two structures, then we can go back to the equation and then prove using the variational formulation. The variational formulation of both equations, then we can prove that a curve of maximal slope on the graph is converging to a curve of maximal slope on the basically on the local, for the non-local interaction equations with a tensor completed. This is in the spirit of Samus alpha t. And I mean, for this, actually, I just want to notice that the limiting space is. Notice that the limiting space is this Baselstein space where the distance is this equivalent distance here, where the tensor is bounded. Okay, so it's uniformly elliptic and bounded in this regard. And okay, so since I'm running out of time, I just want to leave with some take-home messages. So what we've proven is to graph to local limit for the non-local interaction equation. In order to do that, what we had to do as a matter of fact, as a byproduct, we connect the We connect the Finsler and the Riemann structure. So, two, I mean, if a Finsler structure with the Riemannian structure, and as an interesting byproduct, actually, we also get that the graph is a space discretization. And in particular, at least for transport time equations, I mean, provide a non-local deterministic approximation of your equation, because we get existence of weak solutions for the limiting equations from the graph. So we construct a sequence of solutions starting from the graph. Solution starting from the graph. So, okay, so everything that I said is in these two papers. I mean, the first one that I mentioned at the beginning, also in collaboration with Deian, which is published on ARMA. And then the other one is, I mean, it's done. We were supposed to submit it. I mean, to at least I had a pre-print a couple of weeks ago, but yeah, we were still like checking last details. And I want to finish. And I want to finish with a short announcement. Together with Katie Craig, Andrish Lichten, and Dimitri Janakis, I'm co-editing a special issue for the European Journal of Applied Mathematics. This is about evolution equations on graphs. So if you're interested in these things and you have some contribution, please let us know. And with this, I want to thank you for your attention. I have a question about the actual function we use to define the evolution on this app. Since if I understood correctly, we have this data, which determines the sort of interaction between points, and the back measure. So, how do you model the evolution of discrete measures? Where is it? No, the so yeah, I mean, maybe there was, maybe there was a like mu can be a general measure, doesn't have to be necessarily a Lepeg measure. Actually, so the so mu is. So, mu is just a set of possible vertices, and so basically, the so. So, the question is: how do you model the can you say it again? So, how do you model the? Ah, you mean here? You mean here, perhaps, or yeah. So, if you want, I mean, if you want to model finite graphs, then Î¼ is not the Lebesgue measure, but Î¼ is an empirical measure. So, I think that perhaps the confusion is that I've seen here, because here I brought, so here I put the Lebesgue measure, but actually, no. So, here this should be mu. Yeah. Then, I mean, mu. So, if you say, let's say, let's look at this one. Then, if mu is the empirical measure, then you have basically. Clinical measure, then you have basically this equation here. This equation back here. Okay, thank you for the very nice talk. Can you go back to the slide where you introduced the graph to local committees? Because This ether, oh yeah, this one. ITA, here what you do is you shrink basically the distance between nodes with this scaling. Or you put weight to the edges. This is not the no, the weight to the edges is actually modeled by mu. Okay. Mu, yeah, so mu is basically gives weight to the edges. Shrinking the. Shrinking the it's localizing the graph structure, and uh there is this dependence on x that we okay have you increasing the number of edges so instead of shrinking them just I mean if I think about the graph to local limit if I think about the limit I will put more edges between the two so that it's continuing the ease. Have you swear about this? I mean, so putting more edges. So putting more edges, it means, I mean, for us, like it means you go to the basically the disk-to-continuum limit that you get is you get from so you get from finite graph to infinite graph, but it's still a graph. So it's still non-local what you get, like if you put more edges. And this is another question. What is uh a non-local graph for you? So, I mean, the graph is the graph is still non-local. graph is the graph is still not local right so the graph because i mean you have like so you have uh so i mean the graph is not local for me in the sense that uh for um basically i mean how can i say please so you want to i mean you have so you have like a certain number of vertices and then you care about uh basically the mass which is so the mass basically which is moving from vertices to other vertices and this can be no longer said Vertices and this can be local in the sense that it's not it's not just i mean you're just not caring about the the local near neighbors yeah the near neighbors that you can have non local jobs precisely precisely and then double non-local because there is no local uh interaction was really brilliant i really liked uh seeing how this tensor pops up and uh This tensor pops up, and so in relation to another work where you do like this non-local interaction to the gross medium. So, I remember there's a problem when you do this upbending for non-degenerate epidemic diffusion. Question. Can you do the potential? So you let epsilon to zero, but you also scale your potential. You do the stingup limit and you get anisotropic diffusion. Do you think that's possible? Maybe it's fantastic. I haven't thought about it. Oh, so you want to do first? Okay, you want to do that. So, first of all, you do this essentially also variational structure, and then in that variational structure, you do obtain a non-linear diffusion. Now, okay, if you choose these two scales in an appropriate way, maybe you can get anisotropic diffusion, but the preference in some directions comes from the graph structure, and the fusility comes from also localizing the potential. Yeah, I mean, it's a very good idea, actually. It's a very good idea, actually, and this is, yeah, so that's why I actually liked it. Also, like, this is why I put the attention on that the graph is a non-local approximation of a possible non-local approximation of question RB. But I haven't thought about doing this. You're thinking about doing a double limit. So first the graph limit and then the. Because on both sides, you already know what's happening. So the question is, are they compatible? Yeah, it's a very good question. I haven't thought about it. I haven't thought about it. Maybe we have to close now. There are seven hours between the last talk and the dinner, so you can discuss it later. Thank you once again.
