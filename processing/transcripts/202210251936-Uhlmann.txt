We just arrived right on time. Great. So, yeah. Can you share a screen? Yes, okay. Share the screen. Let's see here. Okay. Yes, you can also make it full screen if anybody. Oh, I don't see the. Oh, you don't see the screen. I cannot see the yes, but I think this is also fine. If you stay at this window, then yeah. It's okay. Yeah, this is good. So great. We are extremely looking forward to your talk today. Sorry about the confusion. So good morning to Gunter. So, good morning to Gunther and good evening to everyone here. So, it's our great pleasure to have Professor Gunther Woman to give us the second plenary talk of our workshop. I think Professor Gunther Woman is somebody who does need a lot of introduction in the community on numerous problems and we also are excited to know 40 years of Kadara's problem and also happy birthday for your 70th birthday. Okay, thank you, Yunan. Thank you, Yunan. Thank you for the invitation. It's a great pleasure to be at least online. So I decided to give a general sort of talk. I know some of you may be very familiar with this, but I guess I will give my view of this. It's, of course, very biased view, and it's because of some of the things I have participated in in this calderon's project. In this calderon's problem or EIT. So, the general question is: can one recover the electrical conductivity of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at the boundary? It's called electrical impedance tomography for obvious reasons. Also, in geophysics literature is called electric resistance tomography because the conductivity is the inverse of the resistance. Conductivity is the inverse of the resistance. And actually, the motivation of Calderón was geophysical prospection to find oil. He worked for the oil company of Argentina in the 40s. And he thought about this problem then, but he didn't publish his result until 1980 or so. So I said 40 years because I'm taking two years off because of the pandemic. And it has been. And it has been proposed also in medical imaging, for instance, for breast cancer detection because the normal breast tissue has very different conductivity than the surrounding normal tissue, because blood is very highly conducting and tumor needs blood to grow. So, this is Calderón, a famous analyst of the 20th century. He has many contributions, including Calderon-Sigmund theory. Including Calderon-Sigmund theory, uniqueness of the Cauchy problem, Calderon-Beylancourt theorem, interpolation, many, many different Calderon projectors, important one for inverse problems, and many, many different things. He wrote one paper, one single paper on inverse problems at the end of his career in 1980. It was one of his last papers, I believe. So the research. So the reason that EIT is useful is because there is a, you have continuous, you can do continuous monitoring and portability. Like in this hospital here for the COVID patient, they are looking at the lung functioning. Because of course, you know, when you have COVID, there are lung problems and they can continuously monitor. Monitor what is going on in the lungs. Of course, it's not very high resolution, but the method is high contrast. You can detect, for instance, whether the lungs are functioning or not. An application that we have considered in recent years is imaging a stroke. Here you have a conduct, you have an inclusion or inside an Or inside another inclusion. So there is called the skull of the brain. And you may have a stroke, which can be a hemorrhage, which has a very high conductivity, or can be on the right, and can be a clot where there is no conductivity at all. So you want to see the high contrast here, but of course, there is the problem of the skull. And we have done at least the theoretical part. At least the theoretical part and Samuel Siltani have been working and trying to implement this in practice. But there are some using the method that I'm going to explain a little bit, one can see when you have a you have a hemorrhage or a clot because of the high contrast in conductivity. And the idea is to have this in again the portability is very important in an emergency ambulance. In an emergency ambulance, so you can detect quickly which one it is, so you have the right procedure to stop it. I mean, the treatment is completely different for hemorrhage or clot. However, the symptoms are very similar. So, this, let me see whether this would work. For some reason, I had to put the option to trust this document one time only. So, the method that we have developed is very much related to X-ray tomography. And you can see, well, in the left picture, there is conductivity constant, and then the second one, there is a clot, and the third one, there is a hemorrhage. Okay, other applications. Okay, other applications are because the different tissues in medical imaging is because different tissues have different conductivity, but also it has been applied to non-destructive testing, corrosion or cracks, separation groundwater pollutants, because again, the conductivity is very different. And medical imaging, because different tissues have different conductivities. In particular, the muscle tissue is what is anastral. Is what's anisotropic. The conductivity is different in the longitudinal and the transversal direction. This is a system developed by David Isaacson on the left that can be very safe. And again, the resolution is not good, but however, you can see the contrast when blood leaves the heart and fears the lungs. Because again, blood is very highly conductive. Very highly conducting, and here is the oops, doesn't work. So there's an error here, but anyways, shows the blood going in and out of the lungs. And again, this has been used in hospitals to monitor lung functioning of patients because it has Because it has several advantages. EIT is non-invasive, it's safe, it's portable, as I mentioned before, can be used continuously, and there are non-serious issues. The downside, of course, is not high resolution. So, the mathematics, very quickly, I think it's very well known to most people here: is by Ohm's. By Ohm's law, the current is given by the resistance one over the resistance times the change on the gradient, and there are no sources of sinks of current. This is the equation. And the degree to Leumann map, given a voltage potential on the boundary, maps it to the normal derivative of the current. And it's a highly non-linear problem because U, the solution, the potential, depends on the conductivity. Depends on the conductivity. And actually, the main issue is how it depends on the conductivity, because we don't just want existence on uniqueness or regularity of the solution, like standard topics in PVE, but we want to know how the solution depends on the conductivity. That's the crucial issue for inverse problems. And this is also called a dirigative Neumann because this is a normal derivative. Is a normal derivative and Calderon in a very seminal paper did a very simple computation. He considered the linearized conductivity at constant conductivity, and he showed that in order to solve the linearized problem, you need to show how to reconstruct H, which is any arbitrary function from when you know the H. From when you know the integral of H against the products of harmonic functions. If the conductivity is one, the divergence of gamma grade then you is simply the Laplacian. And so the question is, can you recover H? He took very simple exponentials, e to the x dot rho, e to the minus x rho conjugate. The idea is to kill the real parts here. So the complex part has a real and binary part. In order for rho the rho to be zero. In order for rho dot rho to be zero, to be this harmonic function, you need rho dot rho to be zero. You need that the lengths of the real part is equal to the lengths of the minor part and they are perpendicular, and then you simply get the Fourier transform because the real parts cancel out. And that's the point. Otherwise, harmonic functions are not dense. The products of gradients or the products of harmonic functions are dense. Of harmonic functions are dense. And then you recover the Fourier transform of the domain times H, therefore H in omega. Because you know it for every C non-zero, but that's enough since H is an L2 function. And Columbo Gellius, after this paper, showed that you can recover all the derivatives of the conductivity of the boundary if it is smooth. In that way, you can recover an. That way you can recover analytic, real analytic conductivity. So, of course, there are very, as is known here, there are many issues in invert problems, reconstruction, stability, numerical methods, etc. I'm going to concentrate mainly the basic question of uniqueness. And the first result for smooth conductivities was by Sylvester and myself. And we prove it for C2 conductivities. It for C2 conductivities. I will explain why in a minute. And it has been a large effort to extend this result to less regular conductivity. By the way, I'm going to concentrate mainly on dimensions three or larger, where most of the open problems are. And physically, the problems are really in three dimensions. And the conjecture is that this is true for conductivities with one derivative in. Of one derivative in Ln. And n is a dimension. In two dimensions, it's completely different. This is conjecturally to be true because you need continuation from the boundary. But it's not clear whether this is optimal or not. And that's a conjecture. It has been shown in dimensions three and four by Haberman. And Carol and Rogers had a nice result that Lipschitz conductivities in any dimension are. Activities in any dimension are uniquely determined from the Dirich eton map. And but you know, but from the practical point of view, you have conductivities which are piecewise smooth, conductivities that have jumps in different places. This is what we were considering with screen leaf and lasers, but we had to assume higher order regularity because of technical issues. But this should be true for piecewise. But this should be true for piecewise smooth conductivities. And of course, the construction was done by Nachmann. Stability, again, logarithmic stability in some sense, it's an unstable problem by Sandrida, but this is the worst case scenario. And numerical methods using what I would call CGO solutions were done by several authors. Different methods, different numerical. Different methods, different numerical methods that I'm not going to consider here. So, why is C2 conductivity? This is because the method, and all of these methods really have done this, is a reduction to the Schrodinger equation. This is not completely necessary, but this is the way the problem has been solved. You make this transformation and you transform it to the Schrodinger equation. Transform it to the Schrodinger equation, which is two orders down from the Laplacian. And that's the potential in the case of the conductivity requires two derivatives in some sense. That's why it's difficult to extend the regularity because the less smooth the conductivity is, the more singular the potential is. But for other purposes, for instance, for inverse scattering and so on, you want to consider the Schrodinger equation is. To consider the Schrodinger equation itself, even if the potential has not this form, or it could be a complex value, for instance. And the question in that case is can you recover the potential from the dedicated MMR? This is a more general question. As you solve this problem, you solve the conductivity problem as well. And this is the solution of this problem, at least in the case that, in all the cases that. That in all the cases that I know are based on this identity, Scholarless and Rhines identity is very simple integration by parts: Q1, U1 is Laplacian, U1, and Q2, U2 is Laplacian, U2. So you just apply green CRN. And then if you're looking for just unique for reconstruction, you use this formula or stability, but for uniqueness, this lambda q1 is equal to lambda q2. Lambda q 2. So, therefore, you have something very similar to what Calderon had, where the question is whether the product of solutions but different equations. That's the difference. Before in Calderon, you had the products of gradients of harmonic functions. Here you have different solutions is dense. But this is linear in the potential. The non-linearity is in the solutions ui. And here, also, this identity is linear in the. Also, this identity is linear in the degree denominator map on the right and on the potentials on the left. And the way to use this is by using complex geometrical optic solutions, which are waves for this elliptic problem. That means you can find solutions for sufficiently large complex frequency, rho, so that the solution behaves like calderon solutions for large complex frequencies. Large complex frequencies. So, ψ Q is a perturbation goes to zero for row large. So, these are, in some sense, they are waves, although elliptic providence of hard waves, they can grow exponentially, you can decay exponentially, and can also oscillate. So, you probe this with this solution. That's the reason why the potential is useful, so that you have this going to see. So, that you have this going to zero in some sense. So, this is a zero-order perturbation of the Laplace. So, this is a perturbation of the Calderon solutions. Another way to prove the uniqueness is to construct solutions concentrated near planes. This is useful for many purposes. If rho dot rho is equal to zero, the real part and imaginary part. The real part and imaginary part form a plane, they are perpendicular to each other, they have the same length. So, you can take the plane generated by the real part and the imminent part. And you can construct solutions. These are the waves for the elliptic problems. And this is A rho is quite general. They are solutions of the Laplacian. Concentrated, these are concentrated near. These are concentrated near the plane. So they're getting closer and closer to the plane. It's very similar to what happens in geometrical optics for Gaussian beams. You concentrate solutions near geodesics. Here you concentrate solutions near planes, two-dimensional planes. And this term goes to zero as rho goes to infinity. And you're replacing the identity psi q1 and psi q q q q q 1 Psi Q1 and Psi Q2 go to zero as rho goes to infinity. You take now e to the minus to cancel the exponentials. So you cancel completed exponentials in this case and you get that these are concentrated near the planes and this go to zero, the size, therefore you get the tradon transform of q1 minus q2, therefore q1 is equal to q2. And thus the proof of That's the proof of uniqueness in this case. So you reduce the problem to the radon transformer. I wanted to mention that reduction, because that's what is used in this stroke identification, is reduction to the X-ray transform. Okay, there are other applications. The mathematical theory says that the dirty eutonomy map of Q determines Q, even if Q is complex. Determines q, even if q is a complex value. So, in particular, of course, we can solve the electrical impedance tomography. We can also solve the optical tomography problem. In the diffusion approximation, the physical interpretation is different. Now, you're taking light, you're probing the medium with light, and you're looking at the response. Here, omega is the frequency, d is the diffusion. Frequency, D is the diffusion coefficient, sigma A is the absorption, and U is the density of photons. And because of this result, the lambda Q determines Q, that's what I'm saying. This has more application than just EIT. You can recover both, because you can recover the potential, which can be complex value. You can recover both the diffusion. Both the diffusion coefficient and the optical absorption. If the frequency is zero, then you can recover one of them, like the conductivity in the case of EIT, or you can recover the lower order term. One of them, one of the two. You have two frequencies, you can recover both. So, optical tomography, of course, is used to monitor the functioning of The functioning of the brain in premature babies because the light doesn't penetrate very far, but the small objects can be very useful. And there have been many other, there are many other applications because, again, I repeat, you can recover the potential, for instance, in optics, the index of refraction, in acoustics, the density of the compressibility. Compressibility, you need two frequencies, you can recover both. In inverse scattering as fixed energy, you can reduce the inverse scattering problem to the Dirty Guteneum map for the potential Q minus lambda squared. Lambda is fixed. Magnetic Schrodinger and Maxwell equations, there is a nice reduction of Holland Somersalo to the Schrodinger equation. Let Q is an eight by eight metrics. You can apply it to photohouse quantitative photocaustic tomography. Photo-cousted tomography in the diffusion approximation, and so on. There are many, many different applications. An important problem from the point of view of applications is whether you can solve the problem of partial data. So, suppose you take arbitrary sets, open sets on the boundary, and you have the voltages support. And you have the voltages supported in one set, gamma one say, and you have you measure the current in the other open set. One of uh gamma one can be equal to gamma two. That's the most perhaps the most interesting case. And is it true that you can recover the conductivity uniquely inside? And this question is open in general. There are some personal results that will mention it. There is a good process. I will mention it. That's a good problem for somebody who has a good idea how to do this. In particular, if they are disjoint, it's particularly difficult. With Amari, we prove that if you know the conductivity near the boundary, then you can recover. With Kennyk and Shostran, we show this is one of the results. You take a point outside and you take the And you take the light cone starting at x0. So, this is the cone and intersecting with the boundary that's called the front face. That's the illuminated part from the point x0. And the other, the complement is the part called the back front, part is not illuminated. Then you can, the point x0 can be arbitrarily close or arbitrarily. Or arbitrarily far, then the set gamma2 can be as small as you want. And in that case, it's true that you can recover. Gamma 1 needs to be a small neighborhood of the complement of gamma 2. For this result, we need a small intersection. It has been generalized by Koenig and Salo when there is no intersection, but the union has to be the whole. The union has to be the whole boundary. Isako has a nice result as well when gamma one is equal to gamma two. If you assume something about the complement of this set called gamma, is a plane or a sphere. The reason in that case because you can construct complex geometrical optic solutions that vanish in the set where you don't have information by reflection. If you have a plane, you can reflect so. If you have a plane, you can reflect solutions on a sphere. You can do inversion. And in that case, you can solve the partial data problem. But as I repeat, it's open in general. That's a good problem for anybody who wants to try it in the audience. And the method that we use with Schenica Shortening is using instead of the plane waves that we had before, e to the x dot rho, you take the real part of the face where plane. Part of the face were planes, we can take actually very different faces. Complex faces, again, tau is a large parameter, corresponds to modulo rho we had before. And then in order to be a solution, you need the gradient, I will mention this in the next slide, gradient of feed perpendicular to the gradient of side and the length to be the same. And the length to be the same, like what we had before. This is the Connell equation in that case. An example, and phi has to be limiting Caldeman way. This is because of the method we use. An example is the log of x minus x0. This is redress on, you consider the point outside. So we can have solutions of the equation. And if you look at the level sets of this, these are spheres concentrated at the point x0. So you are probing the medium with spheres. So that's the name will be complex spherical waves. Of course, there are complex spaces here. It's not like usual optics like we had before. Like we had before. In dimension two, I mentioned this because this is the reason why dimension two becomes a much easier problem is because you have many more of this. Any harmonic function, any feed is harmonic and the psi will be the harmonic conjugate is a limiting Kalaman weight. So there are many small solutions in dimension two that in higher dimension. The Kalaman weight. That in higher dimensions, the caliber and weight, limiting caliber and weights in dimensions three or higher are very limited, and this is an example, but there are very few of them. So these are the complex spherical ways. Again, I repeat the Connell equation is this system. Now, that's the difficulty. The real part, the gradient of the real part has to be orthogonal to the gradient of the minor part, and they have to have the same length. have the same length and in the case of log of x minus x zero you can find it exactly as the distance of this vector to the sphere because they have to be perpendicular and you can solve the transport equation is just it's very similar to a Cauchy Riemann equation I mean like for analytic functions because this is perpendicular to gradient side they have the same lengths this is like dx1 plus i dx2 Plus I dx2. So you can solve the transport equation, but in general, it's difficult to solve the system of equations. And a lot of the times it's impossible. It's a system. And the reason why they're calling Kali Man weights, limiting Kaliman weights, is because phi and minus phi are solutions. We want to cancel the real part. Part when you make the multiplication of the solutions, otherwise, you will have exponential growth. That's why it's called a limit in Kalaman weight. And then you have to have a Caldeman estimate. So the point of the Caldeman estimate, this is of course technical, but let me just mention quickly. So phi is the Caldeman weight here. And gradient appear gradient feed of mu this has to be positive in order to have something that is that doesn't vanish here. So the point is that you can estimate the normal derivative with this weight in the part that you don't know, the part where you don't have that information from something that you know. On the right side, the solution of the equation, and this is the case for. And this is the case for large tau. So that gives you control of the normal derivative on the part where you don't know. Again, this has to be non-zero in order to have an estimate. Gradient phi dot mu has to be bigger or equal than some positive number. So this is a very in summary, of course, it's more technical, and sorry for this, but this is. This, but this is the reason why they're called limiting calaman weights. And in partial data, we need to construct CGO solutions that vanish or you can control in the part where there is no information. And that's what Caliman weights do. These complex spherical weights have been used to recover inclusions. To recover inclusions, obstacles, and so on in many different situations, different equations from the conductivity to Maxwell equations, you probe the domain with these spherical waves, and when there is an inclusion, the behavior changes dramatically. So when you have obstacles, and this is a simple example of this, is the following. This is the point x0. You're sending these spherical waves. There is a difference of the conductivity. This is a difference of the conductivity here, jump, and then you can recover the place where it jumps, and an analysis tells you how much it jumps as well. So they are useful not just for uniqueness, but for determining inclusions or cavities and so on. I need to move from here. Okay, so any Okay, so an important case, which is my favorite problem, is an anisotropic problem. In this case, the conductivity depends on direction, like a muscle tissue we saw in the cardiac muscle tissue has different conductivity in the transversal and the longitudinal direction and is represented by a positive. And it is represented by a positive definite symmetric matrix. The brain also is highly anisotropic. And in that case, the equation is, of course, the same. The only difference is this is a metrics now. And again, the definition of the degree dynamic map is the same. Mui are the components of the unit normal, except that we have a Except that we have a matrix. And the question is: can we recover this matrix? So, this is one half m times m plus one functions from the divoton map. And there is an interesting invariance here that makes the problem highly non-unique. If you make a transformation, Transformation, a change of variable, which is identity at the boundary, so leaves the voltage invariant. Then you make this change of variables. You take this new conductivity, which is called the push forward of the conductivity, which is in terms of matrices. This is Jacobian transpose composed with gamma composed of Jacobian divided by the terminant composed with the inverse of the transformation. Then you get the The transformation, then you get exactly the same result. So, since this is infinite-dimensional, the group of transformations giving the boundary fix is infinite dimension, any rotation inside, for instance, will do it. Then, this is a large obstruction to non-unique to uniqueness. And you can see this easily by just changing variables in the equation. Changing variables in the equation. This doesn't work in the isotropic case because for a push forward of isotropic conductivity to be isotropic, the only way this is easy to prove is that the diffeomorphism be the identity. So there is no obstruction in the isotropic case, but there is obstruction in the full anisotropic case. And is that the only obstruction? We want to know that. We want to know that because then we can see how non-unique is the problem, and also in a lot of cases, we have a priority information, we might be able to recover the change of variables. And in geometric terms, for the people who are not geometry, this is also a geometric problem. It's a geometric inverse problem. The conductivity is also the inverse. Is also the inverse of a metric, Riemannian metric. Riemannian metric is a positive definite symmetric matrix as well. And the Laplace-Vertami operator, which is invariantly defined on a manifold, is given in this form. So if the conductivity is the square root of the determinant times g upper j, then you get the same information. And this is the dirty conormal map is called the conormal derivative of respect. Called the conormal derivative with respect to the metric. And this also arises in a string theory, not just in electrical impedance tomography. This is called the bulk. The Dirigodonima map is called the two-point function. Can we recover the bulk from the two-point function? This is the olography question. Can you recover, for instance, a three-dimensional world that represents the World, but representing it in two dimensions. You can see this physics analogy in that paper of these two physicists. And the only result that we know, I mean, there are some other partial results, but let me mention is the real analytic case. If you use even the partial data case, you can solve in that case if the derigator number are the same. us are the same then it's true the conjecture is true and then you can recover everything about the manifold actually even the topology if you want as long as you we know the dedicated map and the boundary you just need to know the boundary can recover the inside of the manifold everything inside in the real analytic case this has to be real analytic and the metrics are real analytic but that's a strong restriction So, the question is whether, by the way, there is a very interesting counterexample a couple of years ago. When you assume less regularity, you have the same, this is the partial data case for the anisotropic problem, but it can be the whole boundary. The gamma is moving the interior, but only shoulder up to the boundary. And it's known that there are counterexamples for unique continuation from the boundary. That means u and the normal derivative vanishing an open set vanishes identically in that case, which is only held up to the boundary, not smooth. And then they found non-uniqueness in the anisotropic problem, not in the isotropic one. Or gamma one are disjoint, even in the smooth case. So this is the partial data case. So this is the partial data case anisotropic, even if a smooth data counterexample. So the main open problem, and this I encourage anybody who has not thought about this problem to take it up because we have no idea about this. You take two smooth anisotropic conductivity. Regularity is not the issue at this point. Does there exist? Does there exist a change of variable which is identity at the boundary so that one metric one conductivity is the push forward of the other? And we don't only know this in the real analytic case. And complex geometrical optics solution don't help in this case. So I'm going to jump very quickly. How much time do I have? How much time do I have? 20 minutes. 20 minutes. Let me quickly, I will talk about some recent topics very quickly. One is this non-linear equations, non-linear Calderon type problems. For instance, when you have the plus n u plus v of xu. And in that case, you can even consider. Case you can even consider partial data. And the general issue here is that even you have a non-linear equation, you can solve the problem, even if the linear problem cannot be solved. For instance, the partial data problem. We know that we cannot solve it in the linear case. This means partial data. So the typically data is supported in one set and the Neumann data in the other. In the case In the case, in the semi-linear case, we can show that then you can recover the potential completely. We only assume that the potential has a non-linear part. So that means it starts with a quadratic part, and then you can have a Taylor series cubic part, fourth-order term, and so on. It's analytic in U. So it's analytic in U, not in X, in U. So it has a power series expansion in the nonlinear part. Just to give very briefly idea, for instance, let's take the case square here. Then you do a second order linearization. You put two functions in two parameters, epsilon one and epsilon two. And then you And then you get something similar to what we had before, but now you have the products of three functions or so going to be q1 minus q2, but these are solutions of the same equation. You need that the support be contained in the fixed open set. But besides that, But besides that, because we're only considering partial data, but besides that, it's the same equation. That's the difference with the non-linear Calderon problem. And we have a result with Los Angeles Ferreira and Koenig and Schotran showing that in that case, the product of harmonic functions, because the linear part of this equation is the Laplacian, that vanish on the complex. Vanish on the complement of the set gamma one where you have the directed data supported are dense. Because you have the same equation. This is the basic difference. B3 can be taken to be an arbitrary non-zero function. You just need the product of two that vanish on the part where you don't have information. But this is the same equation for the Laplacian. For the Laplacian. That's the difference. You're performing a second-order linearization. And using higher-order linearization, you can solve the general problem. And we can also solve the using also higher-order linearization. I mean, again, assuming that you have an analyticity in. That you have an electricity in u and the gradient u, that means power type of non-linearities, then we can consider a general quasi-linear conductivity. And in that case, this is the full data case. There are some results for the partial data. I'm not going to mention because we don't have the full result in that case yet. We are working on it. Then we can recover the conductivity in that case. In that case, a non-quasilinear conductivity. Since I'm running out of time, I'm not going to give the proof. There are many references for nonlinear elliptic PDEs in different contexts, you know, Maxwell, magnetic Schrodinger, and elasticity, and so on. Many references. This is a partial list. I'm sure I'm missing some important. Missing some important ones here. So, to finish in the last 10 minutes, let me mention another direction that we have been considering analog to Calderon's type of questions is when there is non-locality. I mean, there is long-range interactions. The solution of the equation at one point depends on points far away. Points far away. Very different from the Laplacian, which is a local operator. So, this is an example, a very important example, is a fractional Laplacian that can be defined in terms of the Fourier transform. You take Fourier transform, this modulus c to the 2s, you take the inverse Fourier transform. This is a convolution operator involves values of u far away from the point. So, this arises in many fields, in probability, finance. Finance, population dynamics, and so on. So these are the different types of models that arises in different types of diffusion. Of course, the Laplacian, the fractional Laplacian is the static case, the limit as t goes to infinity. This is the super diffusion case. You can also have fractional time derivatives, stop diffusion case. Stop diffusion case. As I mentioned, there are several types of applications. So, the basic problem here we don't have boundary data because this is a non-local operator. So, we consider the exterior data. So, we solve the fractional Laplacian plus Q, S is between 0 and 1, S. So, to have a fractional equation. Equation in the domain, and we have that in the exterior. So if F is in HS or the exterior, then there is a solution. You can show that there is a solution, U is in HS, and you can define the Dirigaton Eumann map as the fraction of Laplacian applied to U, measuring the exterior. Okay, so in terms of probabilistic terms, this is usually diffusion, is a process, can be levy process in the Can be levy process in the case of the fraction of Laplacian and other types of processes. And the inverse problem is you know the process in the exterior or part of the exterior, you want to recover the full process inside. And then this corresponds to the normal derivative as S goes to one, has been shown. As S goes to one, we approach the local problem. So this is the natural detrigutonoma map. Is the natural degree to know map in this case? So, the question is: can you recover the potential in that case? And the basic theorem is that this is the case even with partial data. So, you take W and W prime, arbitrary open sets can be very small sets in the exterior, very close to the boundary, for instance. You have uniqueness in that case. Again, the locality. Again, the locality, the fact it's a non-local operator, will help, as we're going to see. And this is resolved for arbitrary open sets. And there is no difference between three and two dimensions in the non-local problem. And the mechanism to solve this problem is not using what we had before, these exponential solutions. Exponential solutions is a different type of technique, is using unique continuation and the Runge approximation property. And the basic difference between the fractional Laplacian and the Laplacian is the following. You have sufficiently regular distribution. This can be very singular, in fact. Singular, in fact. And then the U and the fractional Laplacian vanish on an open set, then U must be identically zero, which is certainly not true for the Laplacian. You can have a compact support smooth function not zero. The Laplacian is zero away from the support, and U is zero away from the support, but it's not zero. But this cannot be true for the fraction. not be true for the fractional Laplacian. So this is the basic result and it's proven using the Cavarelli-Silvestre extension which I don't have time to explain. But using that, this is the main difference with the Laplacian for the point of view of the inverse problem that any function in L2 can be approximated Be approximated by solutions of the fractional Laplacian, where the support is in the right place in the set where you're given the data. So this is not true for the Laplacian. Harmonic functions are not dense. This is an infinite-dimensional complement. However, solutions of the fraction of Laplacian are dense in L2. And now L2. And now you can prove the same identity as we have before, the Lesandrini's identity. This will be zero. It's a very similar proof for the solutions of the different equation. But now you can approximate, you can take u1 to be one or something, or you can approximate any function here, one for instance, u2, any function, and then you are going to get q1, manage q2 has to be series. Minus Q2 has to be zero, it's orthogonal to any function. And that's the main reason why you have this strong uniqueness in this case, because the solutions are dense. And we can do something, we can also solve some anisotropic problems, which we cannot do for the local. For the local problem. I don't have time to explain that, and I will finish with this. So there are many results again for the fractional Laplacians. For instance, let me mention an important one that Hosh Lin and Shao. They consider the esotropic problem, Laplacian G to some power plus Q, they can recover the potential. They can recover the potential. You can do a single measurement. They can do many things: non-local perturbation, local perturbation, fractural magnetic, parabolic, didact, many, many different things. I'm sure again, I'm missing some references. And let me finish with this. Thank you. Thank you, wonderful. This is very nice. Thank you, Lund, for this very nice overview of problem and established problems. Are there any questions from the audience? It's too quick, huh? Yeah, quick, please. Maybe one quick comments. First, I feel like you solve all the problems already. No, no, not true. I mentioned several open problems. Open problems. So, do you know any results on the case where you have like a kind of degeneracy? The diffusion coefficient, you know, like vanishing out of the domain. Well, in that case, see, in that case, I did not have time to explain this in this talk, but we may have a clocking, right? May have a clocking, right? It's not true that you have uniqueness. For instance, for clocking, you make a singular transformation, you get a degenerate elliptic equation. And in that case, the coefficient vanishes at the boundary of the clock region, and then there is non-uniqueness in that case. Right, so this is a way you can do close. Where you can do cloaking in scalar case, right? Right, right. Yeah, so in general, this is a good question. In general, for more than for different type of non-generices, we don't have a full answer when will you have a non-uniqueness and when will you have uniqueness. It's a good question. Yeah, the case I know is the case of clocking and a few other cases. And a few other cases where you have a, for instance, in the Caffarelli-Silver version extension that I mentioned, the power is 1 minus 2s. The coefficient of the equation is y to the 1 minus 2s. And in that case, you have uniqueness. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about your favorite problem, the anisotropic conductivity problem. Yes. Conductivity problem? Yes, sure. Can you discuss stability and what kinds of results you would like to see, you know, in the future? What do you see are the biggest challenges? Well, in this case, the problem is even uniqueness. We don't know uniqueness in this case. So this open problem is for the uniqueness. Open problem is for the uniqueness because there is an element of non-uniqueness. But I expect that the problem will be as bad as the isotropic case in the sense that it's a logarithmic type of stability. I was familiar with some stability on the boundary. I think on the boundary, we know. On the boundary, we know that this. On the boundary, we know that this is a stable type of stability on the boundary. This has been shown. Okay, so extending that is not an easy problem. Right, right. The extension is not the problem. The problem is the problem with the method that we have, which is mainly for the local problems, the main method that we have is complex. Method that we have is complex geometrical optics solutions, right? This all the progress, not all, but a lot of the progress have been done. And to construct these complex geometrical optic solutions in the anisotropic case, to solve this equation, the Connell equation is impossible. We know it's impossible. But the question is whether there is another way to do it, right? Do it, right? That's so what I will encourage people is to think of another way to prove uniqueness for the isotropic problem. We have this method that I mentioned using reducing to the potential and using this identity and then plugging in CGO solutions. But doesn't have to be the only method. Doesn't have to be the only method. There may be another method to solve this problem. And you know, that's maybe an indirect way, I don't know. So it will be nice to find a different way to solve this isotropic problem, and then you may have a shot at solving the anisotropic problem. By the way, I have given this inflation nowadays, but I have offered a thousand. I have offered a thousand dollars to somebody who solves in full generality this problem, this problem, my favorite problem. I don't want to take it to my tomb, to my tomb, sorry. So you can show this, you get a thousand dollars. Somebody asked me a thousand dollars for every dimension. No, no, thousand dollars for all dimensions. I have a question about the stability of the inverse connectivity, the original catalog problem. I think you mentioned very briefly at the beginning, is that that is the worst scenario. This, I cannot pronounce his name, as the yeah. Yeah, that's the worst case scenario because it has to be for all it's you know, it's for all. It's for all functions, right? For all conductivities, it's not specific. So, is there any development over the past four decades kind of relaxed or some have missed patterns? Actually, I don't know any example, even to recover these continuities which we have shown, or you know. Or inclusions or cavities of this type, the estimate remains bad. So it seems to be an intrinsically bad problem. There may be some cases where the stability is better in the interior. No, in the boundary, it's very good, but as you the question, there is a question also that I did not address here. Is the conjecture also is the stability is getting worse as you go? Is the stability is getting worse as you go to the interior. And we had shown an example of that: that as you get, you know, the as you get to the boundary, it becomes more and more like a Herder type of stability estimate for a particular conductivities, for radial type of conductivities. We show this with Gen91. But that I think is true in general. So you can try to show that stability is getting. Stability is getting better and better as you get to the boundary. But I think, if in general, you will get this logarithmic type of stability estimate. And I don't know any counter example to that. I don't know if I think it is about to be the case. I just wonder if there are some improvements, like under maybe stronger assumptions. Yeah, I don't know any. Yeah, I don't know any. Yes. Good question. It's a very good question. I don't know any. As I said, it has been shown that the stability gets better as you approach the boundary for some radial conductivities, for some radial inclusions. But otherwise, I don't know. Good question. It's a very good question. I think the strengths of the method is not going to be the going to be the resolution as i mentioned sorry the the resolution but the to determine contrast it's very good to determine contrast because very specific right it's very specific to conductivity but for it's not going to be the MRI or CT for you want to see in big detail So I wonder if, for example, stability, like you say, maybe if we just want to compare the contrast, but stability highly depends on the norm on the left-hand side and the norm on the right-hand side. So if somebody changed the norm rather than L2, I mean, yeah, I don't know what's exactly there, but I say it's another metric that focuses on content rather than point-wise difference. What will that actually give us something like? That should give us something like qualitative change from logarithmic to something better. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I don't think that should be true. What you're saying should be true that by changing a norm that makes emphasis on contrast rather than resolution, you know, it should be better. But I don't know any any rigorous work in that direction. Work in that direction. Very good problem. Very good problem. I see very it will be very useful, right? Any other comments? Oh, please. I was curious about the non-local problem. I was curious about the non-local problems, like the fractional positive problem. I didn't hear the I didn't hear the. Oh, so my main question was that what are maybe certain methods that can be employed to address the inverse problem for the fractional Laplacian? Or is there like, are there any advantages when it comes to maybe uniqueness results for solutions? Or yeah, there is because this result that. This result that I mentioned here that I mentioned before that you can approximate any solution of the equation, any L2 function by solutions of the equation. That's the crucial in every fractional Laplacian method. Of course, the technical difficulties are different in different cases, right? But in every case that I Case that I know, this is the main issue. It was called the Runge approximation property based on unique continuation, which is: can you approximate any L2 function by solutions of the equation? And that's true for the non-local problem. It's not true for the local problems. That's why one can prove better results in the non-local case. Okay, but it's just like you lose a It's just like you lose regularity of the solution and stuff, right? Right. Oh, yes, yes. The regularity is much less. Yes. Definitely the case. Yes. Yes. Yeah, because you need to take the fractional Laplacian. So that's true. The solutions are not smooth like before, right? If you have the fraction and Laplacian. Any comments or questions?
