One of them is that for static states, including quantum corrections, then the entropy of a boundary sub-region is given by the minimum over all bulk regions of the area of the boundary of that bulk region over 4G, plus the bulk entropy within that bulk region. Okay, so as I say, this is valid for static states, for general states. For general states, you need to know which time slice to implement this formula, and you don't have a preferred one picked out by the static slicing of the space-time. And the answer is that you should pick the time slice that maximizes this minimum. Okay, but I'm not going to, so that's the full QES description, it's the maximum version of it. But that maximization is sort of beyond the scope of this paper. I'm not going to talk about it at all, but I am going to try and try and understand this minimization error. understand this this minimization a bit better. Okay, for the rest of this talk, I'll set 4G equal to one because 4G is normal. So there's a very closely related idea to these sort of holographic entry brief descriptions, which is the idea of entanglement wedge reconstruction. And very heuristically, what this says is that the boundary state, the reduced density matrix and region big B encodes this region little B of the bulk that I talked about in the previous slide. That I talked about in the previous slide. This can be made precise in terms of quantum error correction. I'll try to do so a bit later in the talk. But for the moment, let's just keep it a bit vague and heuristic. So it's sort of easy to check that for a pure state, the entanglement wedge of the complementary boundary region, complement boundary region, big B bar, is the complement of the bulk region little B, complement region, little B bar. Okay, so this idea is called complementary reconstruction. reconstruction. So that's now all we need to very heuristically describe a beautiful paper by Landmark paper by Daniel Harlow from 2016, where what he did is he showed, okay, forget about gravity and let's just consider an arbitrary quantum error in code that has this property of complementary recovery. And again, I'll make it precise, the sense in which I meant that later. And then he showed that any such code obeys a formula very much like the one we saw in graph. Very much like the one we saw in gravity. We have the entropy of sort of a physical subsystem, big B, of our encoded state V of psi is equal to the entropy of the logical subsystem, little B that is encoded in big B plus a constant term that we can call A. Okay, very natural to sort of associate that with an area term, corresponds to the area term we grab to formulate. And similarly, any code where a formula like this holds for Where a formula like this holds for all states in our code space, ket psi, will have complementary recovery. Okay, so there's an equivalence between two things. This is very cool and exciting because it's suggesting that this sort of central feature of gravity, arguably the most important formula in all of ADS-CFT, is actually just about sort of quantum error correction. It's just about how bulk information gets encoded in the boundary. And if you allow me to be a bit speculative and flowery. To be a bit speculative and flowery, it sort of seems to suggest there's some kind of emergent bulk geometry associated to any quantum error correcting code the right properties. Of course, really by emergent bulk geometry, I mean that there's a single constant here that we're calling area, but we're going to sort of try and do a bit better than that as this talk goes on. Okay, so that's great. All awesome, but also five years old at this point. So sort of what's missing from... So, sort of what's missing from Daniel's story? Because the one-sentence summary of Chris and my paper could almost be a one-sentence summary of Daniel's paper. Well, one thing that's missing is that there was no minimization over subsystems little b, right? So in the original, you know, the gravity story, you have to minimize over all regions of the bulk. But in Daniel's theorem, then there's just a single fixed little B. Okay. And the reason for that is just he assured. Okay, and the reason for that is just he assumes in the conditions of his theorem that little b is just the same for all states in his code space. Okay, just doesn't allow that to be different for different states. But this is just not true in general in gravity. So there's an example here on the right, which is a black hole with a region big B that is sort of slightly more than half of the entire battery. So now we can consider a couple of different So now we can consider a couple of different states of this black hole. First thing we can consider is some pure microstate. And if the black hole is in some pure microstate, then it's easy to check the area of this surface is smaller than the area of this surface. And so the little b for this region, big b contains the black hole. It contains this little b prime, goes all the way out to this surface, gamma 2. On the other hand, for a highly mixed black hole state, then that's... Black hole state, then that surface gamma two gets a large amount of bulk entropy associated with all the entropy of this black hole state here. And that means that its generalized entropy, area plus bulk entropy, becomes bigger than just the area of this surface gamma one. Hence, for this highly mixed state, little b prime is no longer part of the entanglement vector big b, just changing the bulk state has changed the entanglement edge. So there's another probably even more important example. There's technically Important example. That's technically not static, so it doesn't quite fit my thing. But that's an evaporating black hole after the page shower. Okay. So, as we, you know, probably most people are very familiar with, if we have the sort of Hawking state where the Hawking radiation is very, very, very entangled with the interior of the black hole, then that entanglement changes the entanglement wedge of the Hawking radiation and makes it most of the interior of the black hole be inside the entanglement wedge of the Hawking radiation. Inside the entanglement wedge of the Hawking radiation. On the other hand, if we just had, say, a product state of Hawking radiation interior, say we'd done a measurement on the Hawking radiation, then there's no longer an entanglement wedge in the interior is no longer in the entanglement wedge, there's no longer an either. Okay, so this is a pretty important physics. It's become even more important in the last couple of years. We want to try and understand it from this sort of beautiful, purely quantum error correction point of view that Daniel introduced in his paper in 2016. Okay, so there's one. Okay, so there's one more thing I want to comment on before I sort of really lay out that out as the goal of the paper. And that's what happens to complementary recovery when we have these sort of state-dependent entanglement wedge, when different bulk states have different entanglement wedges. Because it's sort of easy to see that for this highly mixed state of the black hole, then the entanglement wedge of big B is just little B over on the left of the black hole, but also the entanglement wedge of big B bar. Entangled edge of big B bar is just little B bar, right? It's just the stuff way to the right of the black hole. So the black hole itself isn't actually in either the entangled edge of big B or big B bar. So naively, it seems that now we've gone to these states where the entangled edge can change depending on the bulk state, then we don't have complementary recovery anymore. And by one definition of complementary recovery, we don't. There's, I think, a lesson from. A lesson from quantum information theory about how to think about mixed states, and that's that you never should mixed states rely. Instead, you should always think about a purification of your mixed state and think about a larger Hilbert state that purifies the state and then think about that pure state rather than the mixed state. So, in this case, we can consider a purification of our mixed bulk state here, call that ket psi, and then we can. That cat psi, and then we can consider the entanglement wedge of not just b bar but also the purifying system that I called r bar. As a typo here, that should also be r bar. So that's given by basically the same formula. But now we need to include this purifying system, R bar, when we minimize over folder regions. And it's easy to check that now we find that b bar and r bar has an entangling wedge that includes not just little b bar. includes not just little b bar, but also little b prime, okay, because that really dramatically reduces the generalized entropy because this black hole is entangled with stuff in big R bar. Sorry, Jeff, you have a lot of B's here. What's B tilde? Sorry, B tilde is just a dummy variable that I'm saying just minimizing it. Okay, okay. But the answer of what it will actually end up being is little b prime and little b bar. Okay. So the Okay, so the sort of lesson of all this, that was some technical comments, but you do still have complementary recovery, even in these more general situations, so long as you always think about the pure state, so long as you always purify your mixed state and then think about the two complementary subsystems of the purification, not just of the mixed state. Okay. Okay, so what is the goal of this paper? The goal of this paper. Um, oh, I have a couple of comments in chat. Um, are these to me? No, okay, good. Sorry. Uh, you can go on. You can go on. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, so the goal is just going to be to generalize Daniel's theorem to allow these sort of variable entanglement wedges. Um, but in order to do that, we're, you know, by attempting to generalize that thing, you know. By attempting to generalize that thing, we're going to get more out of it. In particular, these variable attackable wedges have a more general notion of quantum error correction going on than the sort of more traditional notion Daniel was considering. So that's going to lead to a richer and more general class of codes that our theorem applies for. And also because the entanglement wedge is variable, different surfaces get involved, then we're going to get a richer sort of emergent geometry of theory. So there's going to be a couple of So, there's going to be a couple of key tasks that we're going to need to do to achieve this goal. The first is that we're going to need to define what the area is of some arbitrary bulk subsystem for some arbitrary quantum error code, arbitrary quantum code. Okay, so Daniel gave a very nice definition of area, but it only applied for the particular subsystem that had complementary recovery for particular codes that had complementary quantum error correction in his sense. quantum error correction in his sense uh so for our definition uh our theorem to work we're going to need to be a lot more general um and the other thing is that we need to define what we mean by by entanglement wedge reconstruction um by by you know this bulk region getting encoded in a boundary region when different states have different entanglement wedges so different amounts getting encoded depending on on what the state is what does that even mean um so that's that's really going to be the bigger task i'm going to spend a decent fraction I'm going to spend a decent fraction of the remainder of this talk on it. And the answer, just heuristically, is that we're going to need to have what's called state-specific reconstruction, where your reconstructed bulk operator is allowed to be chosen based on the bulk state KSI. Okay, that's a preview of how it's going to work. Okay, but let me start with, well, yeah, so what we'll find is that So, what we'll find is that state-independent reconstruction is only possible if the entanglement wedge, if something's contained in the entanglement wedge for all states. That's exactly what he assumes, so it's not surprising that that's what you need. Okay, let me just very briefly lay out the sort of formal setup we're going to be working with. So, we just consider some general isometry or quantum code that maps a large number of little bulk input subsystems, little b1 to little b. Subsystems, little b1 to little bn, to two boundary subsystems, big b and big b bar. Okay, so this is how it sort of corresponds to ADS CFT. Each of these little b's corresponds to a different local region of bulk, and then they get mapped out to these two boundary regions, big b, big b bar. Okay, and I'm going to use little bold b to denote an arbitrary collection of these input subsystems. Say little b1, little b3, little b5. So then for So, then first task is to define areas. And turns out that's going to be going to be pretty quick because there's a beautiful definition that Chris came up with. So, I can say all the nice things I like about it. That's in terms of what's called the Choi-Jamukowski state. So this is just this particular state you get by taking some maximally entangled, like, you know, maximally entangled states on the little b's and corresponding reference systems that we call little r. So we have maximum. systems that we call little r. So we have maximally entangled little r1, little b1, little r2, little b2, and so on. And then we take all the little b's and we apply, we apply the isometry b to them. Okay, so this gives us the state on big b, big b bar, and all these little r's. And then I'm just going to tell you the definition. We define the area of some set of bulk subsystems, say little b1, little b3, little b five, as the area. Little b5 as the entropy in this particular choice-yaminkowski state of big b together with little r1, little r3, little r5, whatever the corresponding set of little r subsystems are. And that's just going to be our definition of area. It turns out you can show that in every important way, it will always agree with the geometric definition of area. There's some technical qualifications there, but I'm not going to go into them too much. I'm not going to go into them too much because I don't have that much time. Okay. So the other thing we need to do is to define what we mean by reconstruction. And that's going to be a bit trickier, so I'm going to sort of warm up to it. Okay, so let's start with just what is ordinary quantum error correction, the most traditional sense. Even here, there's sort of a number of equivalent answers. So don't worry about reading all the details of this theorem, but here's four equivalent definitions. Definitions. One, the sort of most common one, is that if you have your state on big B, your reduced state, after you trace out big B bar, then there's some isometry that gets you back the state in the code space. Okay, we have some isometry from the code space to big B tens of big B bar, but we can get back the state in the code space just from big B. This isn't actually a useful definition in practice because the moment you do that, you lose all your nice quantum error correction properties. So actually, the more interesting. So, actually, the more interesting definitions that, as I say, are equivalent are that if you have some measurement on the code space that you want to do, then you can simulate it using a measurement just on big B. And similarly, if you have some unitary evolution, say some quantum algorithm on the code space, then you can simulate that by some unitary evolution, some algorithm, just on big B without having access to Big B bar. So, there's a sort of simple generalization. So there's a sort of simple generalization of this called subsystem quantum error correction, which is very briefly talked about, but that's actually what Daniel was thinking about in his paper, where you only have to reconstruct a subsystem of the code space. So the code space splits into H little B tends to H little B bar, and you only have to get back the little B subsystem. So our isometry only has to get back the reduced state on little B rather than the entire code space state. Our measurements that we can do on big B only That we can do on big B only have to be able to simulate measurements on the subsystem little B, not the entire code space. And our unitary evolution on Big B only has to simulate unitary evolution. Unitary is just acting on little B. So that's one generalization that's very important to holography. A sort of orthogonal generalization that is also important to holography is this notion of state-specific reconstruction. So here's four equivalent definitions. So, here's four equivalent definitions of that, but I'm just going to focus on this last definition because it's sort of the simplest to understand from a holography point of view. So, it sort of almost looks the same as the definition we had before of unitaries on the code space can be simulated by unitaries just acting on big B. But there's a difference that not only do you need to know the unitary you're wanting to implement, you also need to know the starting pure state that you want to. Starting pure state that you want to apply that unitary to. Okay, so it's only if you know that it's the state is some pure state ket psi that you're able to implement unitary evolution just by acting on big B. Okay, so don't worry too much about the other definitions for now. But the important thing is to really understand how entanglement wedge reconstruction works, how quantum error coefficient logography works, we need to combine the features of both substance. Combine the features of both subsystem codes where you have these different subsystems and only some subsystem is reconstructible with the bulk, and this sort of state-specific reconstruction where you need to know the state in the bulk before you can know how to do the reconstruction. Okay, so there's the sort of overlap between these two sets of equivalent conditions is very much this condition four. It looks almost the same in both of them. So that's the one we're going to try to generalize to combine both generalizations of. To combine both generalizations at once. Okay, so there's one final question that needs to be answered before I can sort of say how to do that. And that's like, okay, but which unitaries should we be able to reconstruct? So there's an obvious guess here that you may be thinking what you're talking about is obvious. It should be just like the subsystem codes where any unit reacting on little B can be reconstructed on big B. Unfortunately, it turns out there's a Unfortunately, it turns out there's a problem with that definition. And the problem is that it's just not possible in general in gravity. So let me try to explain in 30 seconds why it's not in general possible in gravity. So consider a bulk state with two black holes like this. And those two black holes are going to be highly entangled in such a way that the entanglement wedge of Big B actually goes all the way out to the left and includes both the black holes. Okay. Okay, by doing a unitary acting just within that entanglable wedge, I can always disentangle those two black holes and transform them into just being some product state of black hole over here and black hole over here. But if I've set up my regions, big B and the state where my black holes are and stuff correctly, then that can change the entanglement wedge. So the entanglement wedge now goes between the two black holes. Okay, before that would have got a Holes. Okay, before that would have got a big contribution of bulk entropy from the entropy of this black hole, but we've now got rid of that by doing this unitary. So now that can change the entanglement wedge, and hence it can change the entropy of big B. Clearly, we can't do that via a unitary acting only on big B. So general unitaries acting within the entanglement wedges cannot be reconstructed even in a state-specific way. The solution to this, I'm just going to tell it. The solution to this, I'm just going to tell it to you. I could say a bit more to justify it, but I don't have time, is that we only reconstruct unit trees only need to be reconstructible if they don't change the entanglement structure of our bulk state. So in particular, specifically, those are unitaries that are product unitries, right? If we just apply a product of a unit tree to here and a unitary to here, then I can't change the entanglement between the two of them, and I can't change the entanglement wedge so that I would change the entropy and I can't have any problems shot. Entropy, and I can't have any problems here. Turns out these unit trees are always reconstructed from gravity. This is like the right definition of what can be reconstructed using holography, using entangled reconstruction. Okay, so I'm running out of time, but it's okay because I'm almost there, I promise. So it turns out that the right definition, what it means for entanglement wedge reconstruction to be possible, is that for any product unitary, For any product unitary, u little b, u little bold b, right? So that could be a product of unitary and little b1, unitary and little b3, unitary and little b5, and a state, ket psi. Then there exists a boundary reconstruction, u big b, okay, that does the same thing as u little b when acting on that state, ket psi. We don't care what it does on any other state. We just know what require that it does the correct thing acting on this state ket psi. Acting on the stake as such. We also want some notion of complementary recovery, just like Daniel had. And so we also require that any product unitry on u little b bar, right, the complement of u little b, can be reconstructed by a unitary on big b bar. Okay, so little b and big b, little b bar and big b bar, just like in Daniel's theorem. But now it's, it's the reconstruction is just stay specific and it's Construction is just state-specific and it's just for product interest. Just to be as general as possible, we can also consider mixed states and then purify them with the reference systems. And then our reconstructions need to be allowed to act on those references. But if that's too many letters, then just ignore those big R, big R bar and just pretend they don't exist. And that's just a special case of the theorem. We're just trying to be very general. Okay, so now this is. Okay, so now this is really the last slide. I am now at the theorem. I'm just going to state it to you. I'm not going to try to explain the proof or anything like that. Just state what the result is. So what we prove is that there are two conditions that are completely equivalent to one another. The first is literally just what I just said. It's this notion of complementary state-specific product unitary reconstruction, that any unitary on little B has a reconstruction on big B. Has a reconstruction on big B and little B bar has a reconstruction on big B bar. The second is having a holographic entropy prescription B tree. Okay, so having boundary entropy S on big B be given by a bulk area term plus a bulk entropy term, where the area, remember, is just defined in terms of this trijaminkowski state. We did that a few slides ago. So, in particular, we require this condition. We require this condition too not to hold for every single state in the code space because, again, it turns out that's not even true in gravity, so that would be too strong. But we do require it to hold for every state related to our state cat psi we're talking about by a product unit. Okay, this is a pretty natural condition on which states need to obey this. It's true in gravity, it's psi obeys the QBS prescription. And so these are our two equivalent conditions. Two equivalent conditions. And there's one complaint you might make at this point, which is that, hang on, the whole point of this was you were saying Daniel didn't have some minimization over little b, but then you seemingly don't either, right? Because this is just we have one fixed little b that that appeared in condition one and hence also appears in condition two. Okay, turns out two things are true. One, this is just a theorem about a particular psi. And so other psi's in the same code space can have different little b. The same code space can have different little b's. So that's why our theorem can incorporate variable entanglement widgets. The second is that we get a notion of minimality essentially for free. So if either condition one or two, and hence both, is true, then it's automatically the case that any other collection of bulk subsystems will have higher generalized entropy than little b does. So any little b prime will automatically have higher generalized entropy. Will automatically have higher generalization, generalized energy than it will be just from the fact that condition one and condition two hold. Okay, so that is that is the big picture summary of what we achieved with the talk. Sorry, it's a bit rushed. It sort of has quite a lot of background in this paper, and half an hour isn't a huge amount of time to discuss it all. But let me just end with some final comments and some stuff I didn't get a chance to talk about. Chance to talk about. So, the sort of TLDR of the whole talk is that this equivalence between entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic entropy descriptions goes well beyond the sort of the sort of toy model baby version where the entanglement wedge is fixed that Harlow found. And it extends to these cases of variable entanglement wedges. In particular, any complementary state-specific quantum error correcting code has an associated emergent geometry with areas. Emergent geometry with areas associated to every set of logical subsystems. And I didn't talk about this, but complementary, state-specific quantum error correction codes in this sense are really very, very general. So sort of on all the ordinary versions of quantum error correction I talked about are all really just special cases of this very general thing that has this emergent geometry. So that's pretty cool that we get that. A very important thing is that the theorem is. Very important thing is that the theorem is robust to small errors because sometimes these sorts of theorems aren't. And then given gravity is, you know, a tango energy reconstruction is only approximate, then that sort of means it's not really relevant to gravity if it's not robust to errors. I just didn't include them because it makes the theorems more ugly and annoying, and there's a lot of epsilons around. There's actually something even more exciting, which is Which is that the theorem doesn't actually require the map V to be an isometry. I sort of stated it as that because it's traditional for quantum error correction, but actually any linear map will work. And this is exactly what you need to understand the encoding of the interior of black holes after page time, where you sort of normally have more states in the interior of the black hole than you have boundary states describing that black hole. Call. And so this means there's very exciting connections to the information problem that will be talked about in upcoming work with various authors. So yeah, that's what I have. Thanks a lot. All right, everyone, let's thank Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. And let's take questions. Questions? I can start with one. I can start with one. So, Jeff, I know you don't really want to talk about the proofs. But can you sort of give a flavor of motivating the choice of the Chomolkowski state? I know you don't. Yeah, hang on. Maybe. Yeah. Let me just. I had some slides and then I deleted them because there weren't time to talk. I should have put them at the end, but it's okay. I will just open up the other presentation. And I need to. I need to stop share and then start share again. Okay. So, yeah, so the way you connect the, how the Chodjam-Mukowski state gets involved is this neat trick where if you can reconstruct any unitary, ulibi, then you can integrate over all unit trees while storing the unitary you applied in some auxiliary system. In some auxiliary system. And the effect of that thing, that's just some isometry. And what that does is it sort of swaps out subsystem little bi, swaps it into some auxiliary subsystem, and replaces the statum little bi by something maximally entangled with a subsystem. Okay, so this is something you can do just by sort of local or product unitaries. And let me show geometrically what that does on the next slide. On the next slide. So it means I can define this isometry on big B that takes everything in the bulk in little b, pulls it out of the bulk, puts it in an auxiliary sort of reference system that I call little a, and then swaps into the bulk something maximally entangled with little r. Okay, so don't worry about the details of how that works, but it just turns out you can do that if you can do this state-specific product unitary reconstruction. Instruction. That's sort of the one way. Oh, sorry, you're in that. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. So, so now just do the same thing on the other side. Okay. And now we've swapped out little B bar as well, swapped it out into little A bar. And then it is now maximally entangled with its own reference system. Okay. So now with a couple of isometries, we've sort of related our original state psi to a product state of product of the bulk state we originally had. Product of the bolt state we originally had, but now, like, not in a gravitational theory, just in some auxiliary reference system with a charge-Amelka-system. Okay. So that is how, you know, and product state. So the, because this was an isometry, then the entropy of B here just gets related to the entropy of B, this R, and this little A over on this side. But that's just a product state. So it's just the sum of this entropy, which is just the bulk entropy, and this entropy, which is just the. And this entropy, which is just the area term, it's our definition of the area in terms of the Charlie Jamokowski. So that is the sort of basic intuition for how that proof works. And then similar tricks to go the other direction. But it's this sort of trick of extracting out the bulk and swapping in half of a maximally entangled state that gets the Choi-Gramakowski state involved. So this is for the proof that one and two are equivalent to each other? That would be to prove that one implies two. To prove that two implies one, you To prove that two implies one, you use similar all the proofs use the similar sort of isometries. But yeah, for two implies one, you don't know that this boundary region structure exists. That's what you're trying to prove. So instead, you do it in the bulk and then you use some entropy inequalities to show that that stuff you did in the bulk didn't change anything on the stuff you didn't want it to change, and hence could be implemented by UN3. That's some words, but you know. Yeah, you can look at that section of the paper. And so, maybe a comment about proving three. So, if you're willing to make the more restrictive assumption that I made in my paper, then the proof that either one or two implies three is pretty easy. It's a Iraqi leab slash sub-anstopathy. I mean, is it comparably easy in the general case, or you have to do something fancier? It's. It's similar to that. So, the nice thing about your case is you can just say, okay, the state I'm caring about is going to be the charge Amelkowski state. And I know how reconstruction works for Charge Amelkowski state. In our case, all we really know is from condition one is that this reconstruction works for the state SI. But then we can do exactly this trick to relate that to the choice lamasky space. You still need this trick. So it's like a bit more. Trick, so it's like a bit more work, but not too much more work. I guess, because in my setup, there I had a structure theorem that just tells you, yeah, exactly, exactly. And then it's easy to show the minimality once you have Chris's beautiful definition. Exactly, exactly. Then it's your structure theorem just makes everything like once you have that theorem, then it's all almost trivial, right? Yeah, but no structure theorem here, or there's no structure. I mean, maybe we're just too stupid and didn't find it, but I think not. I think it's related to like, does. To like, does your structure theorem approximately survive if you make everything approximate? Yeah, I think it does. Maybe it does. Yeah, you have to decide a little bit what approximation you want, but yes. Yeah, yeah, no, but like the right definition of approximate. Yeah, I think it probably does. Look, maybe you can think about this for a couple of weeks and just come up with some beautiful structure there and the selves and all. But I did think a bit and it didn't, it seemed like they're just like much messier codes and they don't need to have some nice structure. And they don't need to have some nice structure. It's related to like you've got more than just bipartite entanglement, right? Bipartite entanglement has this beautiful structure theorem always, and like everything else is horrible. Right, right. Thanks. Other questions? Do you have questions from the in-person audience? All right. There's one in that. Closer to the mic here. Hey, Jeff. Can you hear me? Yep. So I have a question about what happens when you have non-factorizable co-subspace. So you have a non-trivial set. Yep. So the The yes, so Daniel's theorem extended to like non-factorizable code spaces, and then you can think of that as like superpositions of different geometries. R1, it turns out if you just try to naively use Chris's same definition of area and you use Daniel's definition for the state independent quantum error correcting code examples, then you can sort of. Code examples, then you can sort of get weird contradictions with minimality. So, yeah, I think that one answer is that Chris's definition needs to be replaced by something cleverer when you have these non-factorizable code spaces. So Chris's definition very definitely always gives a lower bound on the right area. But for things that are never quantum minimal, that never are actually the entanglement wedge of something. Actually, the entangle wedge of something, then Chris's definition is not necessarily equal to the right area. Like, so it works for our cases because there's never quantum minimum, so it doesn't matter. And we still get the theorem. But so possibly Chris's theorem needs to be be, Chris's definition needs to be like souped up or needs to take into account that the code subspace is non-factorizable in some way and needs to be. And needs to be adjusted. But we're not quite, basically, we're not clear of the story as that. It doesn't, you know, the obvious attempts don't work for subtle technical reasons. And it seems like you need to do a bit more work. I see. Like decent parts of it work. There's some stuff that just goes through in the obvious way, but then it's really the minimality stuff that doesn't really work. Thank you. All right, let's thank Jeff again. Thank you Jeff again. And I think there's a lunch break now for those who are on the different kind of break for those of us who are in a different time zone. So we'll see you all in the afternoon session. I mean, it has a little bit of muscle. So you can try to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that. I'm going to make sure I did that. I got literally a little bit of a lot of questions. We should do that. We should do that. That would be a good decision. Yeah, I wanted to click on the little for it. You want to wear exactly okay. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's not sure about the only IRS, but actually that would not be necessary. It would be insulation. Supposed to be contacted. That's what I wanted to say. It seems like in your lock, you're not sure. It seems to me, maybe you can do the theoretical animation, but it seems to me that this won't give you this one job. You can act with things. You can't act with things that aren't.
