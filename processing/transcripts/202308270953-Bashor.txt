Started as we thought the thoughts were good, we thought the ideas were good, so we decided to just start building stuff. So starts very fundamental and then starts spinning faster and faster until we get up to building artificial phosphorylation networks, which I think has kind of been an outstanding goal for the field for some time. I'm not going to say that our framework that we developed is going to be the best one, the be-all, end-all, the final solution. But I think it's a good start and it captures a lot of features. Good start, and it captures a lot of features of natural systems that I think we can continue to use as sort of an engineering framework moving forward. So, it's a little bit about my lab. I'm at Rice. I opened the lab about five years ago. We are really interested in how cells naturally process information for their environment. We're interested in taking motifs from native networks, turning them into new engineered network linkages, and then trying to use them to control how. And then trying to use them to control how cells make decisions, how cells move, how cells secrete, so on and so forth. We think we can turn this into biotechnology. This is a space I didn't think about as much when I started the lab. I'm in this bioengineering department. Everybody's talking about therapy, starting companies, so on and so forth. So I really started thinking more deeply about biotechnology and the connection between what synthetic biology does well and does not do well, and then actually how to make usable things to try to treat patients. Things to try to treat patients. So, one of the things that really inspires us is this concept of closed-loop cell-based controllers for treating disease. So, situation where you engineer a cell to sense biomarkers associated with the disease and perhaps secrete some type of therapeutic. So, this is useful, and a lot of other people in the field are pursuing this, but this is useful because it takes controller, actuator, sensor, things that would normally be embodied in different biomedical. Be embodied in different biomechanical or bioelectric devices and consolidates them into a cell that you can now put very close to the patient's physiology and really have it interact directly. And so this is, you know, kind of this vision of having something that can sense and respond, talk to external devices, and you can be actuated on by an external device. I kind of feel like that's a 10-year project for my lab. We're starting to make inroads, and there's some very crazy and interesting projects being spun up to, particularly this one here. Up to, in particular, with this one here, which I'm not going to talk about. But, you know, there's also biomaterial solutions that need to be put into place in order to get the cells into the patient. But the thing I want to talk about is just kind of where all this starts, which is engineering the circuit. So the circuit's the thing that has to process the information. It's the thing that has to sense and respond. It has to close the loop. So, how to do that was kind of an open question. There's a lot of different modalities out there for engineering sense and respondent bacteria and also cells. And also model cells. But I'd argue that none of them really look that much like native systems. So, native systems, I'm sure you guys are all aware, cells sense and respond to their environment using post-translational modifications. Usually a series of enzymatic cycles, kinase, phosphatase acting on a substrate. And the phosphorylation event can do a lot of different things molecularly, ranging from causing the protein to undergo a conformational change. Undergo a conformational change to creating new interactions. So synthetic biology is good at making circuits or is good at making genetic circuits. We have a really good understanding of kind of what parts to use for what. Different types of design abstractions are useful or not useful depending on the situation. But I'd argue that for post-translational networks, we're not as good yet. The compass is kind of still spinning right now. And so we wanted to try to at least constrain. To try to at least constrain the spinning needle a little bit with this project. And so, why even do this? Well, I mentioned, I think I mentioned, compared to gene circuits, signaling circuits go much faster. So, we're not trying to make them go ultra fast, we're trying to make them, you know, basically respond on a minute's time scale. So, the same kind of pace that you see physiological changes, we want cells to be able to respond on that characteristic time scale. They can directly receive. They can directly receive extracellular information from surface receptors. That's a really big one. Signaling pathways don't require things to diffuse into the cell to respond. And then there's all kinds of different post-translational signal processing capabilities that phosphorylation networks have, that Jeep circuits you want. So a lot of challenges. What design rules would we follow from where do we get the parts in the first place? Do we get the parts in the first place? And how do we tune network connections? So, really, just kind of asking, what is the design abstraction for getting to know this? And so, that was the goal of the project I'm going to talk about, which was to develop this design framework for building cost correlation networks in themselves. We wanted to develop a parts grammar, at least start to imagine one. We wanted to take that parts grammar and use that to enable customizable connections. That to enable customizable connections. So, getting back to the biotechnology, I've been able to connect this to different types of inputs and outputs. So, Zhao Yu Yang is the student that did pretty much all this work. And he's the one that kind of sat with me early on thinking about the ideas. He actually worked for Ling Chang as an undergraduate. And I'm sad that Ling Chang couldn't be here to see what he did with his PhD thesis, but it's been quite remarkable. I think he's going to be able to squeeze at least two or three. Able to squeeze at least two or three fairly high-profile papers out of his work. So, anyway, so just to get at what we thought about and we thought of for the design abstraction. So, probably, I think some of you in this room know Boris Strayman. Boris Strayman wrote this really cool article about 20 years ago describing push-pull motifs, which was his terminology that he used for enzymatic cycles that you fuss forward. And the point he really made was: kind of all you need to know about signal processing in post-translational networks is the biophysics of push-pull motifs and how they go together into networks. So, push-pull motifs, so the first design principle is going to be we're going to use push-pull motifs as our fundamental unit of network construction. And the second principle is it kind of goes back to my PhD work, which involves. Which involves rewiring signaling networks using interaction domains and catalytic domains, and the natural modularity that you see in signaling networks. And so the idea here is that we're going to take individual kinase domains and phosphatase domains from phosphatyrosine cyclin, and we're going to use those to compose our protocols. And that's going to allow us to use SH2 domains, which act as readers. Domains which act as readers for phosphorylation events. They bind to phosphorylated peptides. And those readers are going to, as I'm going to show you in a couple slides, allow us to connect protocols together on these markets. So that's the basic idea. So then, how to build this and how to measure this. I'm going to kind of walk through this. There's some detail on this slide. Just bear with me here. So the way we build these in cells, we take plasmids encoding kinase and substrate, we transfect those into hex cells. To hex cells. And they're going to express proteins. And so the proteins, or so the kinase and the substrate are going to come together by virtue of this loose and zipper interaction. And so the question is, is the orthogonal recruitment that's manifested by the Lucy zipper going to be sufficient to specify artificial flux correlation? And so we're dragging the domains to the substrate with this. And so the way we can measure this is. The way we can measure this is by multi-peller flow cytometry. We can look at the concentration, intercellular concentration of the substrate and the kinase, and also look at phosphorylation events simultaneously. And so we make these funny plots, and the funny plots are basically the substrate concentration, the tinyest concentration on these hexagons. So the size of this hexagon indicates how many cells there are in each area or in each unit area. In each area, or in each unit area. And then we overlay that with a Heller map that tells us how much phosphorylation there is for each of them. So this makes a lot of sense. More substrate expressed, more kinase expressed. At least the cells expressing more, both of those have more phosphorylation. So this is the plot I'm going to show over. So this antibody, or one of these antibodies, is specific for the phosphorylated form. For the phosphorylated form of the substrate. It won't bind to the unphosphorylated form of the subject. Okay, so quantity of substance. Yeah. So then the phoscorrelation is the ratio of that signal to that signal. Because that signal tells me how much substrate was. Some type of western blood? What's that? Something in the blot of pair of population? We did western blots at the beginning and then we stopped because it's really slow. But you do validation up front with western blots to show that the antibodies are working on the proteins. The antibodies are working on the proteins that you think they're working on. And then you go in, and then we can just do flow cytometry from there on out. Make sense? Okay, so we call these triple H plots. These are hexagonal hit and heat maps. So the triple H plots here show that when you have a recruited kinase, you get phosphorylation. Substrate only, non-phosphorylatable, kinase dead, and then unrecruited where the ziphar interaction is broken. The zipper interaction is broken. Don't phosphorylate. So the answer to this question is yes. Okay, so we can throw a phosphatase into the mix. Now, same idea. Now the phosphatase gets recruited to the substrate dephosphorylase in a phosphatase activity in a recruitment-dependent fashion. So we can now shift the equilibrium back and forth with the phosphatase in the prime. Okay, so what we did next was we took a modeling approach to see if we could basically predict phosphate. Basically, predict phosphorylation equilibrium based on parts composition. So, we have different zippers, different affinity zippers, different activity enzymes, or different alleles with different activities, and then different expression levels. And we worked with my very close friend, Pape Jemeta at BU and his postdoc, Jason Rocks, to develop a model that fits a subset of our part space and then use the model to predict the rest of it. So, looking at phosphorus. The rest of it. So looking at phosphorylation equilibrium for all of our allateral part space, which is 216 different configurations. And so we picked some of those, we built them, or first we modeled them, and then we built them and saw that there was pretty good agreement between the model and the experiment. So relatively simple demonstration, but nonetheless goes a good way to demonstrating the composability of our parts. What parameters are you setting? What's seven? How many parameters are you fitting? I think seven. So there's phosphorylation rates for the parts. So there's catalytic rates for the parts. There is interaction affinities. And there's also background phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. And then concentration. So we can connect these together now, and I'm going to show you using the SH2. you using the sh2 domain is the key to making is the key to building this just this two-step network here and so the this is the thing we had to engineer to get this to work so this is a protein that consolidates the kinase in the second push pole with the substrate in the first push pole so when you phosphorylate that then you get recruitment by this SH2 of the second substrate and you get turnover so that's how you consolidate two steps So that's how you consolidate two steps into one cascade. So this works well. When we add the upstream kinase, we get two-step phosphorylation here. That's what this is showing. And then when we make the substrate multivalent, we can see basically the tripling of the phosphorylation in the signal. And this multivalency is going to be important for engineering downstream side because I can show. So then we use the same modeling approach, much bigger part space now, and therefore bigger behavior space. And we're interested in this region here, which is basically shows a high-fold change. So this is when we add the kinase now, the area of behavior space that has low background and high phosphorylation. So we picked some of the configurations from that high gain space. We modeled. High gain space. We modeled them and then we built the actual circuits. And there's a little, so the model agrees with the experiment a little bit less well here. But what we're getting out of this are configurations of parts that are going to maximally amplify the input signal into output phosphor emission, which again is something important for engineering a circuit. I'm going to show you guys at the end. Okay, so good validation of our design strategy. We can express, we can tune. We can express, we can tune, we can interconnect the push pulls. So, what do we do next? Well, we should do something interesting with these next, right? So, we hook these up to receptors. So, here we've engineered receptors that have kinase and zipper on them. And the idea is when these binds a ligand, this is going to form a complex that's going to allow turnover of the substrate. Okay, so this works. I didn't think this was going to work. This works incredibly well. You get a nice 20-fold change. We get a nice 20-fold change with our best circuit. Here, I'm showing that when we eliminate the phosphatase activity, the full change goes down. The absolute phosphorylation goes down too, but the full change is what we're interested in here. So, and that's because this reverse reaction that's now giving the lack of the reverse reaction is giving the system higher background. So, we built this reporter system now to see how. Reporter system now to see how fast these circuits would go. And the reporter system is basically a condensate, so it's an IDP with a chair and an SH2, a condensate that hangs out in the cytoplasm. And so when we add the ligand, what we're going to look for is, upon phosphorylation, movement of the GFP into the condensate. So red plus green makes yellow. So there it goes. Okay. And we can see that it's turning on. You know, we kind of see the first activation within 10 minutes here. It really picks up steam after about 30 minutes. Say it's a steady state after an hour or so. And then we add an inhibitor for the kinase because our ligand is really tight and we can't wash it off. So we just add an inhibitor for the kinase. Turn it off pretty fast. And that turn off is dependent on the phosphatase too. So how does this work? So, how does this pathway compared to the pathways? I was actually quite shocked at this. I thought this was, you know, Frankenstein pathways going to be absolutely terrible in terms of speed performance. Turns out it's pretty comparable to, say, LDK JAXA and TGF signaling, both of which involve animization events. This guy here is really fast. This is kind of, as I began to realize going through this project, it's very hard to achieve these speeds. It's very hard to achieve these speeds. This is growth factor response, ERC signaling, is very much optimized for speed. And we think that's because the receptor is pre-organized. And the two receptor hats don't necessarily need to find each other anymore. So anyway, we're doing okay there. We can change the extracellular amines. We can have the receptors pick up cytokine. We can also hook up GPC. CytoPan, you can also hook up GPCRs. So those are definitely interchangeable. So as far as outputs go, I don't want to get too much into the molecular details here, but we managed to get our sensitive response circuit to open calcium channels. And the calcium channel opening now allows us to secrete a cargo protein. So we have in this circuit kind of the early stages of rapid, basically on-demand post-translational secretion that we can think about putting into our Putting into our cell-based controllers. So, this is kind of the coup de grace here. So, Jeff, you engineered a full membrane to nucleus pathway here. So, this is seven protein, or sorry, seven proteins, seven genes, six proteins. And the key to getting this to work was taking this middle protein that I discussed before and appending an NES. And appending an NES and MLS to it. So it's now partitioning really quickly back and forth between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. And then we hook up the output phosphorylation to a synthetic transcription factor that can now recruit an activation domain and drive GIP transcription. And so just to be clear here, this pathway consolidates the sensor module that I showed you. It also takes kind of the back. And then it also takes kind of the best designs from that two-step cascade that do the most healthy aging. Okay, so this works really well. You get about a 20-fold change in transcription in response to ligand. And the thing we did finally was now we took the full sensor response circuit, we hooked it up to TNF alpha as a sensor, and output was IL-10. And so this is now going to give us basically a closed loop. A basically a closed-loop anti-inflammatory program. So, T cells, when they're activated, secrete TNF-alpha, and then IL-10 is something that can turn them down. Yeah, you got four minutes. Four minutes? Okay, I'm almost done. So, we put these into co-culture, we measured cytokines, and then at the end looked at T-sulf proliferation. And so, the idea is we want this thing to control inflammation, basically. So, when there's no sulfur, So, when there's no circuit in place, we get TMF alpha going up kind of uncontrollably, get a massive proliferation of T cells. In this configuration where there's no circuit, but just constitutive secretion, you see IL-10 continue to rise as it's secreted, but T cells are suppressed. So, IL-10 is also toxic, I shouldn't mention that. So, it has promises a therapeutic, but you administer too much of it, the patient gets sick. Much if the patient gets sick. And then finally, the closed loop one works great. It manages to, in a relatively short order, about 12 hours or so, get both side epidemics to sort of hit this low set point. So that was what we were going for. Right, so just to summarize here, we established a platform for post-translational circuit engineering, which I think kind of now puts the push pole sort of at the center. Push pole, sort of at the center of things for building networks, sort of in the same way trans-regulating promoters are the unit of network construction for gene circuits. We showed that we're capable of making network connections to diverse inputs and outputs, and I think we're sort of on the way to proving that this framework can really allow us to connect anything to anything, because it's just using protein-protein interactions to do the job. And then there's great. And then there's great potential for biotech 2. So things that we're kind of spinning up now, so we're obviously interested in attaching a lot of different receptor moieties to this. So dimerizing receptors I showed you, GPCRs, and then also trying to build an RTK scaffold. This again going to go much faster. Hopefully turn on the pathways and minutes on like a two to five minute time scale, like you see the GFR response. GFR response. I think this is probably the most interesting future space for this audience, like really looking at different signaling properties for different network topologies. We have built a high-throughput circuit construction and testing platform in my lab that allows us to test hundreds of thousands of circuits in single experiments, and we're trying to adapt it to this now to really see: like, you know, are there different selective advantages of having different Selective advantages of having different topologies under different conditions. And we started to hook these up to different imaging modalities. And I wish I could get into more detail here. This area in particular in the lab is starting to get really interesting. But we can build a circuit that generates an EVR signal. We can also build a circuit that generates an MRI signal. So on our way to being able to report on physiology as well as control it. Okay, and then we've Okay, and then we've also managed to get these things to work in primary cells, which is kind of a big step, really, kind of a protein engine, or sorry, a protein expression and promoter engineering puzzle. Fortunately, I don't have time to talk about any more. So I'd like to thank my lab and my funding sources, collaborators that help with this, and really things jagged you a lot. I think when I started, a couple of my colleagues said there's really like one or two Couple of my colleagues said there's really like one or two students that are going to get you technical. The rest are going to be there, and you'll have a lab, and it'll make you feel cool. So I actually ended up getting three or four, but if I would have just had to have one, I probably could have made it work with just him. Absolutely amazing. So thanks a lot for listening, guys. If you separately control the timings of the process with various perspectives, if you get going an ultra-fast, like ultra-sensitive ETO cycle. I think that's something that's appeared on our whiteboard at some point. I mean, I think there's we need more parts, basically, but I think that's a great idea. One more question? Yes. Yeah, so I was wondering: do you think it you could? So I was wondering, do you think you could build combinatorial cross-forrelation networks for cost-relating multiple sites on the protein? Yeah, that's one of the aims in the R01, actually. I didn't show any that. We haven't quite gotten to that yet. But just having a multi-site phosphorylation now attracts multiple reader domains that either bind cooperatively or only bind when there's some set of phosphorylation events that are different. That are differentially marked by, say, two different input parameters. Yeah, I mean, I think we could go basically all the way through the 16 logic gates if we had enough parts with these. What do you think was the main bottleneck to being able to build these networks? I imagine people have been trying to build these for a while. Like, what was the it so it's parts. And I didn't really, I didn't show too much about how we went through minimized domains. Went through minimized domains, main point mutations, main mutations on loops. Also, these things would express an evenly across the population, express robustly, and then also do plus correlation robustly. It was really just refining the domains, and that took about a year, and then we could kind of build some really good lesson. Great, thank you so much, Kim. Appreciate it.
