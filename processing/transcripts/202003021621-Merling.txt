Okay, so yeah, I just realized that many a few years ago I gave a talk here. I think it was called approaches to equivariant A theory, where we still had no idea what we were doing and trying to come up with things that might be the thing that we want that's connected to H coordinates. So now I'll tell you like a few further steps in this story. So let me just start with some modifications. In this story, so let me just start with some motivation. Okay, so a very classical question in geometric topology is suppose that you have two smooth n-dimensional manifolds, and you know that they are homotopy equivalent. So you ask. Equivalent. So you ask: are they actually diffeomorphic? Okay, so the strategy to answer this question is you can first try to construct an age coordinates between them. Okay, so what does that mean? This means So what does it mean? This means, so W is going to be an n plus one dimensional manifold with boundary being the disjoint union of m and n. And what makes it an H coborism is that the inclusion of these boundary pieces are homotopy equivalences. Okay, so for example, you have something that looks like this, and so this is your W, and then you can ask, is the H coordinates actually diffeomorphic to M times I? And if it is, then you know that M and N are diffeomorphic. Okay, so you want to know obstructions to H coordinates being trivial. And the classical theorem of smale for simply connecting manifolds and then independently by Barden, Mazer, and Solings tells you that if M So M is a smooth, compact manifold of dimension at least 5. Then if we look at isomorphism classes of H cobord dispens on M then Then this is in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the whitehead group of pi1 of m. So by definition, this is a quotient of k1 of the group ring. So mod plus minus the elements in the pi mod of n. Okay, so and by definition of the each cohorts, Definition of the H-coordinate space, this is pi naught of the H-coordinate space. So that space is defined in such a way that you have a path between H-coordinates exactly when you have a diffeomorphism. And so moreover, we can say that we associate to an H-coordinate something called this white attorney, and that's going to be zero exactly in this group, exactly when. Group exactly when your H-coordinates is trivial. Okay, so now maybe let me say, so the slogans are so the obstructions or obstructions to H coordinates on M being trivial being. They live in this group pi naught of H of M. And I didn't tell you anything about the space, but the idea is that the obstructions to families of H coordinates on M parametrized over some space. Now these, so the obstructions, again, sorry, obstructions to H coordinates, so again being trivial in the space, the H coordinate space of M. Okay, so Baldhausen's theorem in 82, proved much later together with Jaron and Rognes. So this was sometime in the 90s, says that says that A of X, so this is the algebraic key theory of X splits as the suspension spectrum of X times this other factor called the whitehead spectrum or whitehead space that has the property that if I plug in a smooth compact manifold M, this is exactly the This is exactly the, okay, so not the H-coordinate space, but the stable version of the H-coordinate space. So this is defined as the co-limit of the H-coordinate spaces where we cross with intervals. So this is for M compact and smooth and manifold. It's important. It's important. Okay, so let me maybe draw the analogy here before we move on. So this result, right, of Smale, Barden, Maser, and Stallings. So what it says is that it says that if I look at pi naught of the stable each coordinate space, Coordinate space. This is defined in terms of a k-group. And what Walthausen says is that if I look at this whole H component space, not just its pi naught, this is defined as in terms of a k-theory space. Okay, so it turns out, so this stable H-covari space is also the critical input to compute homotopy groups of V diff of your manifold. So maybe I'm not going to go into this story now, but this is one reason why we really care about it. So, in good case. So in good cases when the other things in the story work out, the computation is reduced to computing the homotopy, when you want to compute homotopy groups of PDF, are reduced to computing the homotopy of this phase. Okay, so now suppose that M is a compact, smooth Smooth G variable. Okay, so now you will see the progress in the story. So oh, yes. Well, for this, it could be anything, but very soon. So for the talk, let's make it finite. I'm not saying that there's no interesting actions by non-finite groups on manifolds, but But okay, for very soon you will need to be finite. Okay, so now you will see the progress. So in previous talks, I might have stated the following as a dream, and part of the dream was defining the terms involved. So now I'm going to state this as a conjecture where all Where all of the terms will have been defined. So Ag of X splits as the suspension G spectrum of X times some other factor such that again, if I plug in a manifold, a compact smooth stream manifold, this is going to be a manifesto. Manifold, this is going to be equivalent to, okay, so this is going to be space, okay, so maybe just let's make everything spaces here so that, sorry, space and fixed points. So if I take the fixed points of the spectrum and I look on the infinite loop space level, this is going to be a Infinite loop space level, this is going to be a space of equivariant each coordinates. And what does the infinity mean here? So this is going to have to be stabilized with respect to representation disks. Okay, so everything will have been defined, except we're still trying hard to maybe modulo this part here. Here, so this is as defined as anything in the literature, but if you're not happy with the literature on non-equivariant each horn spaces, so we still need to, we're still trying to find out exact details to make this very precise. Okay, but now everything else will have been defined. Okay, so this is the spectrum defined by Malkiewicz and myself. And myself. And so, in the quest for this gadget, we have actually defined two versions of equivalent K-theory. So, I think the one that I was talking about last time that we call AG course. So, that's the thing that naturally comes up if you look at K-theory of group actions for the Walthausen category Rx of retractive spaces over a G-space. You can use either the standard dilooping machinery. The looping machinery or Barwick and Shaz, and last one's K-theory of group action. So then you get something that's not this. It's what we call digital course that doesn't have the correct properties to fit this theorem, but is also very interesting. And it's related to bivariant A-theory. Okay, so now I'm going to talk about the thing that we want for this geometric application. Okay, so this, so now you're Okay, so this, so now I just stated a conjecture, so let me maybe. Okay, so what we can prove, okay, so okay, not only have we defined these things, but okay, now we can prove enough of the conjecture that so even if the full conjecture is not true, at least enough is true that we can relate this G spectrum to equivariant H coordinates. Two equivariant H coordinates. So we can prove, so I'll split it into two parts. Okay, so the first one is joined with Malkiewicz. And this is what, so it's computing exactly the fiber of this map. So there exists a fiber sequence. So now I'm just going to give a name to the fiber and I'll just call it HG. Hg of X such that again if I plug in a manifold and I look at the fixed points of the spectrum, so basically this should be a manifold now and its infinite hook space level, I can connect it back to actual H coordinate spaces, but H-co-border spaces, but these are going to be non-equivalent stable H-coborder spaces of terms that look like the terms that appear in atom beak splitting. So it's fixed points of M and then homotopy orbits with respect to the bile groups. Okay, so this is part one. And then note, and this is what I'll mostly talk about today, but so this just relates it to stable H coordinate spaces and then it still does. Covoir spaces, and then it still does not relate to a covariant H covariance. So, part two, which is the much more geometric part, so this is joined with, so also with Malkovic, but also with Tom Goodwilly, Anti Gussa. And Malkiewicz is showing that, well, carefully defining such a space A space and showing that this agrees with this fiber. Okay, so now maybe let me make the spectra say, so this is a spectrum, and this is a spectrum, and this is a space. Okay, and this is a spectrum. Sorry, there's spectra and spaces, but when you see loop infinity in front of something, I guess. When you see loop infinity in front of something, I guess it makes it clear which ones are spectra. Okay, so I'll talk for the most part about this, and then maybe at the end, if I have time, I'll say a little bit about the second part, which is really the part that we have worked out first and was the motivation for why this should be meaningful, but there's just so many details. So many details and geometric fiddling in there that well, that's not complete yet. Okay, so now sorry, just while you're reasoning, the representation, like I mean it seems like there's choices there. Do you mean the regular representation or does it? No, so we're we're gonna have to take the co limit. A co limit of representations where instead of crossing with intervals, we could take a cofinal set and just copies of the regular representation. But we're taking a co-limit of representations and crossing with representation disks. Okay, so Okay, so how do we do this? So I will have to review the definition of Ag of X, and so everything in order for this to work is defined as spectral magic functors. So now let me just go on a small interlude on reminding everybody about spectrum matter functors. and also tell you a way to think about them that we use in order to streamline the computation of this fiber. Okay, so let me do a review from scratch of this. I know many of you have seen it, so I apologize. Okay, so maybe, so the first Okay, so maybe so the first thing to note is that so a spectral category with one object is exactly a ring spectrum. And a spectral category R with objects at S. Okay, we can think about S. So if it's one object, it's exactly the data of a ring spectrum. The data of a ring spectrum. This is a ring on many objects, right? So, an object set S in, actually I want to leave some room there. Object set S in spectrum. So it's a regular many objects. So what we have is we have a spectrum for every pair AB in our set S. AB in our set S and maps R A B R C A to R C B and so on. They have to be unital, associative. Okay, so now a spectrally enriched functor from From a spectral category R to spectra. So this is the same data as a module over a ring of any objects. So a module over this R, right, so explicitly what we have are maps MB, tensor, R AB to M8. Okay, so I'll come back to this. I will want to give a further interpretation. I will want to give a further interpretation here in a second. Okay, so now to define spectral mathematics, so let me give a definition. So if I take the set S to be the set of G mod H's, okay, and now we're going to assume G is finite, I can define, and let me also define S H K to be the category of spans Spans going from G mod H to G mod K that for now is viewed as a symmetric monoidal category under this joint union. Okay, so I can define the following ring on this object set. Okay, so BG is going to be a ring on object set S. Set S in spectrum. So I have to define the spectra. So I'm going to define VG, the value at G mod H to G mod K as the Rexum K-theory, so the siegel K-theory of this category of spans. Okay, so and this definition appears in Guillumei and then the theorem. Okay, the theorem is that Bg modules is equivalent to G spectra. Okay, and so this is a theorem due to BMA, but so since then it has attracted a lot of attention and many people have thought about different ways of thinking about this, so maybe I won't write it all down. But so Claire Barwick with Saul Glassman and Jay Shah have thought about this, and Dennis Nardin has given a proof of this, and Nico Naumann I know also has thought about a proof of this, maybe in joint work with Akhil Math. We've been joint work with Akhil Matthew and a lot of work that Helika and Peter and I have done with Bert and Peter also goes into part of this theorem. So this is theorem has become, has gotten a lot of attention and many people have now thought about it and it's because it is really very useful and so none of the stuff. So, none of the stuff that I'm talking about, I don't think it can be done without spectral market context. Okay, so we'll see how we'll construct everything, and everything is gonna fit very nicely in this framework. Okay, so maybe let me first make an observation. So, we already know that what I really want to think about is Waldhausen categories in order to build the objects that we're interested in for equivariant A theory. interested in for equivariant A theory. So note that I can consider this category of spins instead as a Waldhausen category. Well, this is a little hand wavy, you so you have to instead consider retractive G sets over G mod H times G mod K, but you get something equivalent to it. But you get something equivalent to it. And instead, I could consider something that I call BGWALD, where another ring in spectra, where I just define these using this dot construction. Okay, so I'm going to want to construct a module over this. So, first, we have to streamline everything and make sure that no matter how we define things, you really can go back and forth and get. Can go back and forth and get and still get a G spectrum that was, at least by this theorem, defined as modules over BG. So let me okay, so I don't know if I want to call this a definition since I will not give the full definition, but let me just say this. So I'll use a language of multi-categories. So a multi-category C has a collection of objects. Collection of objects and also anarimorphisms. So anerimorphism sets. I guess I don't have to put this in quotes. So C, A1, AN to B for all N. Okay, so let me just, of course, these have to satisfy multiple. Have to satisfy multi-composition, associativity, unitality. But let me just give you an example and you'll know exactly what those conditions have to be. So one example is any symmetric monoidal category. So I can just define these maps as the maps from the tensor product and Any operat, oh, so this is a multi-category with one object. Okay, and if you know the definition of an operat, you know which diagrams need to commute for associativity and so on. And that will tell you also what more. Oh, I guess this is also an colored operator. I guess that's also Okay, so now more non-trivial examples are the category of symmetric monoidal categories. So this is a result by Eltendorf and Mandel. And the category of Bauthausen categories, which is a result by Blundberg-Mandel plus Plus, am I gonna give you myself Ina's name? I think that's correct. Okay, so moreover, so maybe I can fit this in this corner. So the other thing that we have is we have a diagram, and I think Anna-Marie is going to talk about this in her talk. Is going to talk about this in her talk, so I'm only going to advertise what we have, and I think she will tell you more. So we can take the S-DOT construction from Walthausen categories to spectra, or we can take the Rensume K-theory, Siegel K-theory, to spectra. And we have a map here by forgetting structure. And everything here Everything here, okay. So, everything here is multifunctorial. So, again, this is so this is a multifunctor by Bloomberg, Mandel, and Zakarevich. This is a multifunctor by Almondorf Mandel. And this is multifunctorial, this natural transformation by Baumanus Orna. Okay, and I remember. Okay, and Anna Marie will tell you more about this. Okay, so now okay, I really do not want to erase that, so maybe I'm going to erase stuff at the top here and keep the definition of multi-category that we still want to have in front of us. And let me put the observation about multi-categories that first of all. That first appeared in Elmendorf Model. And so the observation is that in order to make sense of rings and modules, you don't need a symmetric monoidal structure. All you need is a multi-category structure. So what's the functor from Waldhousen categories to symmetric minoidal category? So you just keep the co-product. Oh, that's it? Okay. Okay. Looks like a forgetful kind of stuff. Yeah, so it's a forgetful functor. Okay, so the observation is that so we can make sense of rings and modules in any multi-category. So forget about multi-metric monoidal categories. All we need is a multicategen. Of course, all we need is a multi-category structure, so we can use any of these. And the way to make this precise is by defining small parameter multi-categories and map them via multi-functors into your desired multi-category. So for example, so these are the examples, the great observations in Helbendorf Mandel is that you can cover rings and modules via the following parameter multi-categories. I'm going to define MR. Categories. I'm going to define MR to have only one object, R. And the multimorphisms are going to be, so there's only one object, and this is going to be a point for everything. And then the claim is that a multifunctor from this MR to any other multi-category is the same data as a ring. Data as a ring in M. Okay, so this is, I guess, by definition if this is some random multi-category, but if this is actually symmetric monoidal, it's exactly a monoid in that category. Okay, then, yeah, I really love this paper of yours, Mike. And you'll see why in a second, because it's gonna make everything so nice. So we're gonna define a parameter multi-category with two objects. Multi-category with two objects that we'll just call R and M. And now the multimorphisms are going to be, okay, so you could guess what they are, right? We know what maps we want to encode. So again, they're all going to be a point or empty. So if all AI and B are equal to R, we want it to be a point, or if B and one of the Ai's is equal to R. of the AI's is equal to R and sorry is equal to M and all other are R, then we want it to be a point and otherwise we want it to be contractible. Okay, so now the claim is that a multifunctor from this parameter multi-category into any multi-category is exactly the data of Of a ring R and a module M. Okay, so now. Commutative, right? Commutative, right? A commutative, yes. Um actually, no, well, yes, usually you did it for commutative, but right now I only care about associative, so I'm not requiring anything to be symmetric. Then bimodal? So if you had a symmetric multifuncture, then you'd have something commutative, right? Multifuncted, then you'd have something commutative, right? Oh, yes, okay. Unless you want it to be M. Unless you want to require that the M appear only on. Yeah, so you're right. Right now the M only. Okay, well you can fill this in. So you know what you see what you can encode. You can encode everything. You can encode everything. Community modules, sorry, community rings, modules over community rings by modules, right? So you just declare here what maps you want to have and what maps you don't want to have. And so maybe you could also ask for all of these to be symmetric. Okay, so let's just take this great observation of Elmendorf and Mandel and we And Mandel, and we what Kerry and I did is just generalize this to bring so many objects. So you can just let S be any finite set. And we can define these parameter multi-categories. Okay, so let me just tell you, and I will let you fill in the maps that you want. So here, the objects, to encode a ring on many objects, the objects are going to be. Many objects, the objects are going to be S times S. So that's how we're going to have objects, so all the pairs. So we know that that's what we want. We want rings indexed over pairs. And then for the modules, we want the objects to be, again, SMSS, but also distributed union S. So we want to encode exactly these guys. Okay, and now you could fill this in yourselves. Yourself, so we know what maps we want to encode. Okay, and right, and this is also going to generalize. A ring on many objects is going to be a multifunctor, and a ring on many objects in the module over it is just going to be a multifunctor from these parameter multi-categories. Okay, so here, a ring, a spectral category is also going to be just a multifunctor. M R S to spectra, and this is going to be a multifunctor M R S M S to spectra. Okay, so why is this helpful? Okay, so while we still have this little diagram here, so note that this compares all these multifunctors, but now Compares all these multi-functors, but now with this perspective, so all we have to do here is I can take, maybe you cannot see this color, let me write in orange, I can take this parameter multi-category M, RS, MS, for some given ring and module, and all I have to do is pre-compose. So if I have, if this is a multifunctor landing. If this is a multifunctor landing in here, then therefore I'm going to get a multifunctor landing in spectra because all of these are multifunctors. And I can also go back and forth and compare them. Okay, so this tells us that it's enough to work in here in order to get a spectral machifunctor. And moreover, okay, so now I think I can erase everything. Okay, and so moreover, we can also prove, so using this result of Monasorno and this perspective that all of these correspond to multifunctors and this is just precomposed with the multifunctor from this parameter, multi-categories, we can immediately prove that modules over this PG wall are the same. This BG wall are the same with modules over BG. Okay, so from that we only get a map, and we still have to show the equivalence, and the equivalence is just fiddling with when the Rexumke theory and this dot give you equivalent things. And so in this case, that follows, so yeah, this is a very weird. Yeah, this is a very weird case, but luckily things really work out. So, in Waldhausen's paper, you have an equivalence if cofibration sequences are split up to weak equivalence, but you have a cylinder functor and so on and so on. We definitely don't have that in finite sense in these categories. In Bjorn's book with Goodwilly and McCarthy, they do it for additive characters. Well, that also doesn't work. Well, that also doesn't work. But in this case, we can reprove Walthausen's theorem still works if you have cofibration sequences split functorially up to weak equivalents, which almost never holds. Like it doesn't work for abelian groups, but it works here. Okay, so we do actually get an equivalence. Okay, so the upshot of all of this was that Was that so? It's enough to construct a BGWAL module, but not in Spectra all the way, but just in Waldhausen categories. Okay, and this is crucial because all the things that we want are really just Walthausen categories. So let me give you now the examples that we care about. So the example So the example that we constructed, which is this AGX, is formed as a BG valve module where at level H, and now I really apologize for this clash of notation. So now the RHs are not the rings. They're the modules, but it's retractive spaces, so I have to use R. So now the ring is Is those categories of spans. And the modules are going to be the categories of H equivariant retractive spaces over X, with weak equivalences being on fixed points. So the genuine equivalent weak equivalences. So, right, we have defined, and maybe I'm not going to go into this now, we have defined, so in order to construct this, we have to define these module maps. And they have to respect certain properties. And the main property that we wanted this G spectrum to satisfy, so the property that we were after, and if you didn't have this, then we knew that it's not the right thing because it would have the wrong pi naught, was that the fixed points split over the pipeline. Split over conjugacy classes into terms just like the ones in the technique splitting. Okay, so this was all motivated by work of Wolfgang Luc and lots of other people way back in the 70s and 80s on an equivariant whitehead group that also splits like this. Okay, so now we know that this. We know that this at least has the correct pi naught to be related to the equivalent H covariant space. Okay, so now in order to connect it, to compute this fiber, so we need to write down this map. And we need to write down this map as a map of spectral machine functors, but very carefully so that everything is compatible with these splittings. So we have these kind of splittings on the suspension G spectrum, also on those fixed points. Also, on those fixed points. And we have to rig everything very carefully so that everything is compatible and we get a splitting like this in the fiber. Okay, so for this, the other example that we construct, where we build on work of Bad Gioj and Dorabiala, is so we want to construct really in order to get this. To construct, really, in order to get this map for free, a sub-module of this PG-Wild module. So I'm going to call this AG homotopy discrete X. So this will be a submodule of this AGX, and it's going to be the one where the The module Balhausen categories are going to be the subcategories of retractive of H equivariant retractive spaces over X of the form that Y, the retractive space, is going to be. The retractive space is going to be equivalent to y. Well, I guess it's going to be equal. It's going to look like yx, this is a space equivalent to x, disk to union a bunch of disks times d mod h's. So this construction appeared in Badric and Dorabiala, and they had showed that. And they had showed that this does model the H-fixed points of the suspension G-spectrum. So there's still the work to show that everything is compatible with the transparent restriction maps that go into the data of writing these action maps. So a theorem. Okay, so a theorem is that this does indeed model the suspension G spectrum as a spectral acupunctor. So of course there's other models of the suspension G spectrum, like taking representables, it's much easier. But so this is the one that we can show easily is a submodule of this and we can write down the map. And, well, not And, well, not just that, but we don't want to just write down the map from the suspension G spectrum to AG of X. We also crucially need it to be compatible with the splittings if we want to get the splittings for free on the fiber. So maybe, let me see. So from here, so we get, so this was also part of the work that Badger and Dorabiela did. So they have shown that this inclusion. Inclusion into the fixed points of AG is compatible with the splittings. So we still have to show compatibility with the restriction and transfer maps. So here we get the map. And for advanced and dorabiela, we get it's compatible with the tongue gig splittings. Okay, so from here, it's all easy. Okay, so that was the hard work. From here, we can just we're gonna define this to be the fiber uh of this map. This map. And right, so we, and now we can use the non-equivariant theorem. So by the non-equivariant stable parametrized H-coordinates theorem of Walthausen, Jarn, and Rogness, we get that, so we already know that this is going to split. Already know that this is going to split, it's going to be compatible with the splittings. And it's so on fixed points, this is going to have, we can look at the fibers of those maps, and we're going to give it this is, will have a splitting into stable each coordinate spaces. Okay, so now you might wonder, so there's something wrong in what I wrote down on the board. On the board, which is the non-equivariant theorem, of course, only applies to a compact manifold, and these are not compact anymore. So this is a little bit of a lie. But so actually what we get, so I'm writing this more nicely, but what we get is something that we can define this to be, which is the co-limit over H coordinate spaces of compact things. So, what we really get is M crossed with representation disks. Then, the sub-H means, so only H isotropy and WH actual orbit. WH actual orbit. So now all of the stuff inside is compact. Okay, so I guess the little lemma is that for any G fixed, sorry, any G space, its H fixed points, you can write as a collimate of representations of terms like this. Okay, so now maybe in the remaining time, I have until 20 after, is that right? So maybe in the remaining time, Right? So, maybe in the remaining time, I will tell you more now about the next step. So, a little bit of what goes into that. Sorry, when you say H isotropy, do you mean that V has H isotropy or M times? Yeah, so let me maybe define this. Okay, so let's erase this confusing thing. And let me just define, so X. So X sub H, I'm going to look at the subset of points in X for which the isotope is exactly H. So this is the H fixed points and take away all the bigger fixed points. Okay, it's good that I defined it because it comes up in the next part also. Is this thing a manifold? You do the quotient? Here it's a manifold, yes. But so the proposition that I'm talking about, I think, works for every G space. And I don't know, it seemed kind of weird when we proved it, and I still couldn't find a mistake. Maybe, so I'm pretty sure by now that it's true, but this is. It's true, but this is the co-limit of X times EV. Yes, so the H isotropic points. And that's sort of the trick to express things in terms of colon bits of compact objects. So here it's a manifold and we want to be applying this to compact manifolds. Compact manifolds. Okay, so now maybe let me talk a little bit about, okay, so this next thing that I called step two, right, so this is joined with, not just with Kerry, but with Goodwilly and Igusa and Malkiewicz. So the remaining thing here will be to show that this, so let's make this a manifold now, it really splits, okay, so this is going to be the space of actual equivariant H-cohortisps. And we want to show that it splits into stable spaces of okay, so now I will be loose again, but what? Everything can be. Be loose again, but what everything can be made precise by taking co limits over compact things. Right, so first, right, so here in this object, right, so what stabilization do we need? Okay, so to see that you need to cross with your presentation disks, so you don't even have to think very far. It's enough to only think. To think very far. It's enough to only think about pi naught. So the equivariant S coordinates, H coordinates theorem, so forget about any space level stuff just on the group level, already requires crossing with representation disks. So let me. So there's this old theorem of Araki and Tawakubo that shows you that shows you that we so suppose that Wmn is an equivariant H covortis. So you can define white hat torsion that lives in this equivariant white hat group. So this is the equivariant white hat group. Okay, so here Okay, so here I'm back to just group level stuff. So the theorem that this is zero, so non-equivariantly, the torsion was zero of an H-coordinate was zero exactly when your H-coordinates was trivial. In the equivariant case, that's not the case, and the statement is that there exists a big enough representation V such that W W cross dv is equivalent to m cross dv cross i, not equivalent, sorry, g diffeomorphic. So this is what triviality in the equivariant case means, that you have a G diffeomorphous with your manifold cross I, where the action on I is just trivial. Okay, so this is one of the many versions of the equivalent. one of the many versions of the equivariant H coordinates theorem. Okay, so what's really going on there is the following. So let me make one more definition that's very important in this geometric part. In this geometric part, so suppose that x and y are g spaces and x to y is a g map. So this is called isovariant. If okay, so equivariance already implies that if I compare these isotropy subgroups, I have an inclusion of this one in this one for every x. This one and this one for every x. So isovariance means that I should have equality. Okay, so it's a map that doesn't just send fixed points to fixed points, but for examples, of course we still get the fixed points mapped to fixed points, but we'll also get the H isotropic points mapped to Y isotropic points. Okay, now I think the Okay, now I think the relevant theorem from the old geometric equivalent geometric topology story is the following. And I think this goes back to Haushild in the 70s. I have learned it from Wolfgang Wick's book. So it says that if something called weak gap hypothesis Hold. Okay, so one are weak gap hypotheses. So this just tells you that if you look at different fixed points and you look at the difference of their dimensions, that the dimensions are always less than or equal to three. And in some contexts, they're less than or equal to two. And there's all sorts of conditions that go. All sorts of conditions that go in this, in the organic surgery, sorry. So, for this, I think it's, you want the dimension of the fixed points, different fixed points, to be less than or equal to 3, very bigger. You want the dimensions to be at least 3. If you compare any two fixed points for h not equal to k. Okay, so if you have this kind of condition... Sorry, I can't read that. You have the G action, and you can say for subgroups K and H contained in each other or what? Yeah, so of course if they're equal then this is zero. So if I compare those dimensions, and I guess I have to take the bigger one first if I want to get something positive, they need to be at least three. And also if you have it from And also, if you have different components, for every component that you take in those H fix points, this condition needs to hold. So, here I might want to put for any component in case I have several components. Okay, so if I have such a condition, then the conclusion is that an equivariant of H coordinates on M is isovariant. Is isovariant. Sorry, Buna, I want to get. I mean, you are assuming all of these are sub-manifolds. What kind of action do you have here? Yeah, all of these are going to be sub-manifolds. So you have some actions through smooth maps on a compact smooth manifold. And now, if you have this kind of condition on the dimensions of the fixed points, The dimensions of the fixed points being far apart enough from each other, then there is such a result of Haussl that said that an equivariant h covaris is actually isovariant. And maybe something to note is that an equivariant each coordinate, the map is automatically isovariant because it's an inclusion. So what isovariant each population means, it means that all the homotopies, everything has to be through isovariant maps. And okay, I just erased this theorem, but let's just think about it. So what I erased, right, it said that you have to cross with a representation and then you get the condition that you want to hold. So know that you can always make such conditions true if you cross with a big enough representation. So I think that's sort of how this goes. Sort of how this goes. So, in the last minute, maybe let me just see very briefly just a splitting idea. So, suppose that G is equal to Cp, so that we only have Cp and trivial fixed points. And now, suppose I want to prove that there is a fiber sequence that I can split where Where here I just take an H-cobordence on X, and well, suppose an equivariant one for now, and I restrict it on an H-covordence on the fixed points, and then I want to say that the fiber is an H-coordinism over the complement. Okay, so know that this is just not going to work unless you work with isovariant H-coordins. Because if you delete part of the H is the H is the H is the Horn So if you delete part of this h coordinate 1x, and you want to construct an h coordinate over this complement, so you might still have the maps from w with the deleted part and back to itself. So those will still be defined, but the homotopies that makes it, that would make them into an H-coordiness might have had to go through all of X. So unless you have a map that really respects isotropy, unless the homotopies respect isotropy, And there's a homotopy with respect to isotropy, this is not going to work. So something like this will only work if Hg means isovariant H covariance space. Okay, maybe I'm out of time. Let me just take half a minute to say. So then I think the idea is that What we can prove is that once we stabilize, so everything that will prove the splitting will be for isovary image coordinate spaces. And then we'll want to prove that we have such an equivalence in the collimate of our representations, which would be a subtle version of this theorem of Hausheld. Okay, so I think we can stop here. See if we can stop here quite on time. Great, that answered all the questions.
