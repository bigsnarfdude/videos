CO2 in the rocks, dispersion and heterogeneity. And this is a very important topic. You guys probably would learn a lot from the CO2 sequestration and the central we are not following this particular topic a lot. So we are looking forward for this talk. So floor is yours, Andy. Take it. Okay, thank you very much. And I'm very sorry for not being able to be there. I'm very sorry for not being able to be there in person, but I understand that the meeting meeting is very interesting. And I'm very pleased that you invited me to participate. So I'm very pleased to participate, albeit remotely. And today I thought I'd just talk a little bit about some of the problems we've been working on related to CO2 transport and spreading in porous rocks with direct application to problems of CO2 storage. To problems of CO2 storage. And I really want to focus on the challenge of trying to describe how fluids move through porous rocks and talk about several aspects of the rock structure and how this can impact the flow pattern of a fluid and leads to some real challenges in terms of trying to quantify and even develop simple equations to describe the flow. And then I want to, so I'll talk about layering and baffles and About layering and baffles, and what we call thief zones or layers of high permeability, and then talk about what happens when we have interfaces between different layers. And all of these can lead to quite substantial, have a quite substantial impact on the flow. And then I'm going to move to a problem of dissolution of the CO2 into the background water and talk about some of the challenges there of dispersion. So, there's a general theme of dispersion and transport going through this talk. And just to sort of motivate the talk, as I guess we're all aware, there's a lot of CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions. And this just shows a chart from 1990 up to 2019 showing this sort of continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And I guess there's a whole series of different sources of these emissions. We're getting the blue is the CO2 from fossil fuel and industry. And industry, and the orange or the reddish orange colour is the methane emissions, and then we have land use emissions as well. So, there's a series of different sources of this CO2. And one of the big challenges is to try to capture a lot of this CO2, particularly from point sources such as industrial output and output at power stations, and try to then store that CO2 in the subsurface. And this has got enormous potential for reducing. Got enormous potential for reducing the continual emission of CO2 into the atmosphere because storing it in the subsurface provides a huge, there's a huge reservoir of rock in which that CO2 can be stored. And this can account for, according to the IPCC and the IEA, they're looking to store about seven or eight gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050 per year. And that represents nearly a third of the power and industry. Power and industry-related emissions today. So, it's a huge amount of the emissions are planned to be stored. And there's a whole series of challenges in doing that. But one of the main challenges lies in characterising the subsurface sites and working out how much CO2 can be stored there and where the CO2 will go if you pump CO2 into the subsurface. And the general idea with CO2 storage is that you take a saline aquifer. Take a saline aquifer in the subsurface, this may be two well one or two kilometers below the surface, and then inject the CO2. And it might be that you inject to a depleted oil or gas reservoir or into a natural saline aquifer. And there's some processing system on the surface to capture the CO2 from a series of different sources. And then that CO2 is pumped into the subsurface. And what we're going to focus on is what happens in the subsurface and where the CO2 spreads. Subsurface and where the CO2 spreads. And since we're talking about such enormous volumes of CO2, it's very important to try and understand where the CO2 spreads so that it can be stored safely underground and the risk of either leakage back to the surface or uncontrolled migration of the CO2 is actually understood just to understand how many wells are needed, what the pumping rates are, what the injection pressure should be so that the CO2 can be safely stored. Pressure should be so that the CO2 can be safely stored. And the reason we go down to about a kilometre and a half or deeper really comes by looking at the density of the CO2. So this is showing the depth in the crust, and this shows the density of CO2 increasing as we go down. And you see that when you get beyond about one and a half kilometers or so, the density is actually quite high. And so going below those sorts of depths, we can store a lot more mass per unit volume compared to shallower rocks. Lower rocks. But then it's very important to understand how the properties of the CO2 change. And you can see it's as the pressure changes, it becomes very dependent on temperature, the density. And so we need to understand what the temperature of these systems is as well. So there's a series of physical chemistry type challenges about understanding the state of the CO2. And typically, it'll be in a supercritical state where there's no difference really between the gas and the liquid phase. It's really a supercritical phase. It's really a supercritical phase. And you can see the densities are many hundreds of kilograms per meter cubed. So it's got a density close to, but smaller than that of water. So it's a buoyant fluid. And the viscosity is typically about a 10th or a 20th of that of water in these conditions, just to give you a sense. And the sort of rocks that we're looking at are many of these sedimentary rocks. So they can have, this is a car key, so it just gives you a sense of the scale of some of the structures. The scale of some of the structures in these rocks, these very complex bedding structures, which happen on centimeter scale. This is on a sort of tens of meter scale, and then we can see, you know, this is a person for scale. We can have layering and rocks with bedding up to hundreds of meter scale, which extend laterally many kilometers. And so we can think of many of these reservoirs as being very thin, vertically thin layers compared to their horizontal extent. And we'll Extent. And we're going to look at how the flow migrates through these layers. But as you can see from this small-scale picture here, there's a huge amount of structure in the rock, which can mean that the flow travels along certain preferred pathways through the rock. And it's that structure that we're going to have a look at today, just to understand some of the challenges of describing that and then predicting where the fluid we're injecting travels. And this is just a simple experiment. We'll come back to a bit later, but this shows a laboratory experiment of a A laboratory experiment of a bead pack where we just have water going through this bead pack, and this little layer here is higher permeability. So, these beads are about three millimeters, the rest of the beads are one millimeter. And what we see is the permeability here is a lot higher. So, as this dyed water comes along going towards the right, it channels through this high permeability layer and comes out the other side while the fluid in the low perman zone is lagging behind. And this leads to dispersion of the flowframe. And this leads to dispersion of the flow front, and that's a very important phenomenon that we're going to focus on in some detail. And the sort of things we're trying to understand are how the CO2 spreads when it's injected into a layer. So there's an example in Sleipner. This is a reservoir in the North Sea that the Norwegians have been pumping CO2 in. So the gas comes out of a deep system, natural gas. There's about 9% carbon dioxide in this gas naturally occurring. So it's separated. Naturally occurring. So it's separated on the platform and then it's re-injected into this shallower layer here. And there's been a lot of what we call time-lapse seismic, so seismic surveys of this reservoir, trying to look at how the plume of CO2 spreads. So this is a vertical section, essentially, horizontal and vertical section through the reservoir. And what we're seeing is the change in the reflection amplitude with time of these surveys. And so where you see colors, that represents a change. That represents a change in the amplitude of the reflections of seismic waves moving through this system from the surface. And so, this is showing the evolution of the plume in time migrating from the dot, which is the injection point, and the CO2 migrates up and also spreads laterally. And this is several hundred meters laterally and a few hundred meters vertically, just to give you a sense of scale. And so, we're going to try and have a think about how that works. Well, if we're injecting into a rock. Well, if we're injecting into a rock which has a series of horizontal layers, and each of these layers may be 10 meters or five to ten meters thick, with a series of less permeable rock between them, more like a seal layer between them. And then if this rock has been under through tectonic stresses and strains, it might have fractured after it's deposited. And so there may be a complex series of fractures and layers in the formation. So this is denoting. So, this is denoting a series of fractures and then a series of layers. Each of these would represent one geologic event producing a layer of sediment. Then, as you inject the CO2, you can imagine it spreads out under this less permeable layer. It reaches a crack in that layer where there's a fault from some tectonics. The CO2 leaks through, reaches the next layer, and it gradually spreads in a fashion like that, somewhat analogous to this sort of Christmas tree-type structure here. Structure here. And if these layers are inclined, you can imagine having a different flow pattern. And we want to try to develop some models to describe that. Well, if we just start with Darcy's law for porous flow, Darcy's law tells us the flow is given in terms of the pressure gradient and the gravitational force. And so for a buoyant plume, a free buoyant plume rising through a porous layer with a density difference delta rho and a flux of fluid Q, you'd expect the speed. Fluid q, you'd expect the speed to scale with the density different or the buoyancy g delta rho times the permeability k divided by viscosity. And the speed will also, you also expect the flow to be just a vertical cylinder rising through the rock. And if the radius of the cylinder is B, then the relation between the speed and the flux is going to be U is Q over pi B squared for an axisymmetric cylindrical plume rising through the rock. So B would be the radius that. So, B would be the radius of that plume. With typical numbers for permeability of about 10 to the minus 13 meters squared, a density difference of 100 kilograms per meter cubed, and a viscosity of 10 to the minus 4, we are looking at speeds of 10 to the minus 6, 10 to the minus 7 meters per second. So the CO2 is traveling tens of meters per year as it moves through the rock. And with a flux of, say, 10 to the minus 2 meters cubed a second that we're injecting, we'd have a radius between about 30 and 60 meters. About 30 and 60 meters, so that's the typical scale we'd expect. And if we think about this data from Sleipner, we're seeing a much bigger structure, so it isn't just a simple Darcy flow rising under buoyancy through that rock. And you might say, well, perhaps there's some cross-flow dispersion or diffusion leading to spreading of the formation. Well, the typical, you know, if we imagine it's rising up with this speed, u, then the time to travel at a vertical speed y is given by y over u. And so the diffusion. y over u and so the diffusion distance in the horizontal we'd expect to scale as the diffusivity or dispersivity times the time squares of that and as long as this distance is smaller than the the radius the the we this q over pi u then the dispersion is going to be small and this simple buoyancy calculation will work and so that so so we can sort of neglect molecular diffusion or poor scale diffuse dispersion um as long as the distance the plus As long as the distance the plume has traveled in the vertical is smaller than q over pi d, where d is the dispersivity. And the typical values for dispersivity in rocks might be 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9, meters, sorry, that's meters squared per second. And with that sort of flow rate, we're expecting dispersion only becomes important after a kilometre or so. And so dispersion won't explain this simple poor-scale dispersion, won't explain this complex structure. And it's more about the large-scale structure. And it's more about the large-scale structure of the rock that's having an impact on the flow. And so, what we can imagine looking at the flow past a specific baffle, so imagine we've got these seal layers of low permeability rock with fractures in, and the CO2 is going to run through one of these fractures. We can model that as a simple buoyancy-driven flow. So, this is a current of syrup spreading between two plates, which are parallel to the plane of the screen with a narrow gap between them. So, it's like a A narrow gap between them, so it's like a two-dimensional analogue of the flow. And this fluid spreads out over this impermeable barrier, i.e., one of these seal layers. And then when it reaches the fault at each end, it drips over into the next layer. And this experiment is upside down because it's a dense fluid sinking rather than a buoyant fluid rising. But we can imagine as you change the point of arrival relative to the two ends of this finite length baffle, then the current becomes more asymmetric. And so you get a certain amount leaking. And so you get a certain amount leaking one side and a certain amount the other side. And we can predict the fraction leaking from each side just in terms of a simple buoyancy-driven flow. The depth of the current is delta rho gh. So the flow rate depends on permeability and the buoyancy, just the simple porous media equation. And so we're able to predict the flux from each end. And it just depends on the ratio of the length of the source to the distance to each end of the baffle. And this agrees very well with experiments. And this agrees very well with experimental data shown by the red dots. And so, if you imagine now, you've got a series of layers in the porous rock, and we have a whole series of these layers, and the plume starts off, and it pops over a whole series of these layers leaking through the gaps in the seal rock. Then, what we're going to get is a gradual spreading in the horizontal direction of the flow that's moving dominantly vertically. And using this simple partitioning, we can see that the amount of flow we accumulate from each of these. We accumulate from each of these layers is just going to follow a binomial distribution in terms of the fraction that moves one side and the fraction that moves the other side of the baffle. So if it's all symmetric, F will be a half, but you could imagine these layers being shifted. So the plumes actually arrive at some asymmetric point along the barrier. And of course, if we have lots of layers, this binomial distribution tends to become a Gaussian. So we can take a limit with many layers and we'd expect that. With many layers, and we'd expect the flux coming through each of these gaps in the seal will just depend on this Gaussian distribution. So it depends on the square root of the distance or the height, and it decays with the horizontal distance squared over the height. And then there's a characteristic gap between the successive layers, H, and there's a length of the baffle L, which just determine how quickly this decay occurs in the horizontal direction. Occurs in the horizontal direction. And if we compare experimental data, so you might notice here there's a series of little pots collecting the fluid coming through here. And when we collect enough fluid in each of these pots, we can weigh it and just check. And we actually find this follows a very nice Gaussian distribution. So this is like a fluid mechanical version of the Galton box to model how the binomial or the Gaussian distribution develops. And if we have an asymmetric system, we get a very similar result. Get a very similar result. Again, it tends to a Gaussian, but now we just have the value f is a quarter, not a half in this example. And so, what we see is that the fluid is dispersing horizontally because of the structure of the rock. Okay, so the structure of this layered rock with a fractured seal leads to this distribution where we have a dispersion that depends on the square root of the distance traveled in the y direction. So, the horizontal distance scales with the square root of the vertical, and then there's a coefficient depending on. And then there's a coefficient depending on the length of the baffles and the height of the layers. And if we just plot this out for typical values, we're seeing we may get horizontal extents of 20, 30 meters for very small baffles as the plume rises tens of meters. And if we have longer baffles, maybe hundreds of meters long, then the horizontal spreading may go up to 300 meters when we've been through nine or 10 layers worth. And this is sort of comparable to what we're seeing in Sleipner. To what we're seeing in Sleipner, where we have a horizontal scale of two or three kilometers and a vertical scale of about 100, 200 meters, in this case, with battles 10 meters apart. And so this type of dispersion produced by the structure could actually be causing some of this. But of course, that leads to a challenge in terms of how we model this. And one thing we can do is we can add some tracer to the fluid. So if I just run this movie, this is fluid is dripping. This is fluid is dripping through here, and as this movie comes along, we change the fluid from red to black. And you can see how the black fluid moves drips through each of these layers, and it's moving faster in the middle than the edge. And so that'll have an important impact of you doing a tracer test in terms of when the fluid will arrive at different places. And we can plot out the general shape as a function of time. And if we just think about that Gaussian distribution and we look at conservation of fluid. We look at conservation of fluid, the black fluid moving through this system. We can work out an effective stream function for the flow. And so the streamlines for this flow are self-similar and follow horizontal position scales of the square root of the vertical position. And by integrating our distribution for the flux, we can actually work out the stream function, and then we can work out the path lines of the fluid and hence of tracer through this system to work out the arrival time at a series of points. Arrival time at a series of points on either side of the system. And so, from the macroscopic picture, we've been able to develop a stream function and a macroscopic description of the flow. But the relation to, if you like, a bulk Darcy's law is more challenging. And one of the challenges numerically is that these layers, there may be very many of these layers on centimeter scale or tens of centimeter scale. And if you're modeling flow through a rock hundreds of meters thick, then actually how you describe. Then, actually, how you describe the effective flow properties is very challenging. And a lot of the numerical approaches are just to reduce the vertical permeability, but of course, that doesn't give you this lateral dispersion. That just ends up giving you a plume like we saw before, and we can work out the radius of that plume, whereas this continuously spreads in the horizontal. And if we think about the system being tilted, it becomes even more challenging because what's going to happen when it's tilted? What's going to happen when it's tilted is if we take a single baffle, then what happens is the flow partitions. And so, in this case, you can see some flow moving over the top side of the baffle and some dripping over the lower side of the baffle. And as the point of arrival of the fluid changes, more tilt tips over tilts over the top or bottom of the baffle. But eventually, if the flow is small enough, all the flow just dribbles, drains over the bottom of the baffle. And so, as the flow gradually evolves in The flow gradually evolves in space and moves over successive layers. Eventually, all the flow will drip over the lower end of the baffles, and at that point, we reach a quasi-steady state. And we can work out that critical flux just by looking at the same Darcy model for the flow. So we have the flow associated with the cross-flow component of gravity because the depth changes here drive a flow given by dH dx cos theta. And we've also now got a component of gravity along the boundary, which is a Gravity along the boundary, which is a sine theta term, and we add that term on, and there's a plus or minus depending on whether we're going upslope or downslope. And from that, we can work out the critical flux so that all the flow just drips over the bottom and that it just arrives at this top corner, not getting over the edge. And so, with that critical spilling flux, supply flux, we can work out how many baffles, how many layers of baffles we need to go through before we reach. We need to go through before we reach a steady state, and so there's going to be an initial phase of dispersion of the plume and then a subsequent steady state. And so the plume is going to have a shape like this, as seen in this experiment. So it disperses initially. So what's happening is the fluid, and this is showing the experiment upside down, but the fluid is essentially dripping over successive baffles and eventually it becomes sufficiently thin that nothing drips over the upstream side. And so we just have. Stream side. And so we just have a series of independent flows going over each of these rows of baffles up through the system. And so we get a parallel plume moving at an angle to the horror to the vertical, which is all controlled by the geometry and the angle of tilt here after this initial dispersion phase. And here's some experiments just showing predictions compared to experiments of that critical flux showing this simple model can describe that very nicely. And again, there's a challenge of And again, there's a challenge of trying to describe this lateral dispersion and also the final angle of flow from a very simple Darcy law model. We can predict this in terms of this macroscopic picture of the flow, but if we're trying to develop this from a very simple model, it's more challenging. And what we can see is tracer in this case, because we have different amounts of flow going along the different rows of baffles, the tracer again travels at different speeds. And so we're doing an Different speeds, and so we're doing an experiment to look at arrival times. We're going to see a very different range of arrival times, all controlled by the geometry of the baffles and the length or the gaps in these baffles, which determines how laterally extensive this plume is. So that's a first example of one of the important macroscopic effects of dispersion that can occur in porous rocks. And of course, if we have a background flow, a hydrologic flow, that can act in a similar way. Flow, that can act in a similar way to a tilt. And so a hydrologic flow gives us a pressure gradient in this direction and draws along the fluid. So it again behaves as if it's on a tilted system, even if the baffles are all horizontal. Well, having seen dispersion associated with breaks in these seal layers, so these would be the seal layers, what I want to now talk about are the effect of having lenses within each of the layers of a slightly different permeability. Slightly different permeability. And one of the big challenges in trying to model rocks and trying to model the flow between, if you like, an injection well and the far field through a reservoir, which is really what we're looking at in the problem of looking at CO2 sequestration, is trying to do experiments to measure what the properties of the rock are and the subsurface. And if you look at the technology available at the moment, you know, if you drill a well and you're going to start doing some COT sequestration of that well, Doing some COT sequestration in that well, you can take out the rock from the core that you've drilled and learn everything about the hole you've, the little core of rock. That has a scale of, say, 10 or 20 centimeters in the radial direction. You can do some testing around that with different electrodes looking at the resistivity and so on. So, you can measure with well-logging data, you can measure properties perhaps within 10 meters. Measure properties perhaps within 10 meters of the well. You can do, if you have two wells, you can look at measure the time it takes for the pressure in another well to respond to the pressure in the first well. But that's an average, a vertically average signal over the whole formation, but it tells you something about the pressure connectivity in a well test. So you don't learn about the detailed vertical structure, but you do learn about the horizontal structure. You can put seismic waves through the system, but they have a wavelength of 20 meters or so. A wavelength of 20 meters or so, and so you're not again looking at the very small structure. And so, the missing data comes when we're looking at distances of, say, 100 meters to one to 10 kilometers away from a well and trying to understand the vertical structure on scales of 10 centimeters up to 10 meters. And in these rocks, there can be lenses or layers of rock of one permeability surrounded by rock of other permeability. And this leads to very significant changes. And this leads to very significant challenges in trying to model how the flow works. And so I want to just talk about a very simple set of calculations. And we saw this picture at the beginning where we have a high permeability lens in a layer of lower permeability. And we're going to look at a flow going through this system. As the flow propagates through, we're getting this change of the flow front and it shears out. And a similar thing happens if we put a low permeability lens in. So this is now low permeability and the fluid. So, this is an Loop permeability, and the fluid is delayed going from the left to the right. And so, again, we shear out or disperse the flow front, and because the fluid is delayed going through here. Now, the classical picture or classical understanding of the effect of these lenses or layers of low or high permeability is that they act to provide a dispersion, a macroscopic dispersion, which essentially means they act to diffuse out the flow front and the diffusivity. And the diffusivity that comes from, there's different ways of deriving this, but the diffusivity, if we have a very big layer, comes by looking at the flow around one of these layers. And of course, there's going to be some, if it's these are high pumbility, the flow will accelerate slightly faster here. And so a line, a tracer, will get distorted if it goes through a field of these randomly distributed baffles or hyperm layers. And if the velocity difference for the flow in the background going through the flow. For the flow in the background to going through the layer is delta u, then a simple model for dispersion would be that there's a the dispersion scales as this velocity difference times the size of the baffle times the number density of baffles per unit volume. And then there's a constant lambda, which you can calculate by looking at the detail of the flow through each of these baffles. Well, that's very interesting. And that seems to work on small scales. But if you model a calculation where you're looking at Model a calculation where you're looking at flow on length scales of order a kilometer or so through a layer in one of these formations, and we put a series of these baffles in as we move downstream. Then, what we find, we did a series of numerical calculations and we looked at how a flow front or a line of tracer spread out as the fluid moves down the layer. And what we found was these are a series of different calculations, and we found that the variance of the i.e. the Of the, i.e., the distortion of this flow front. If it's a pure dispersion, like a diffusion type process, you'd expect this to, the variance of this to grow like t or the standard deviation to grow like the square root of t. Well, if we scale and if it's a uniform flow, then that'll scale like the square root of x. So you'd expect the standard deviation sigma to scale like the square root of x. But when we do a numerical calculation and we plot it as a function of x, we find that for many of the calculations, it keeps. For many of the calculations, it keeps on growing. And so it doesn't seem to actually be described as a simple dispersion effect from the local flow around each of these lenses. And so there's a question about what's happening. And if you go and look in rocks and look at the dispersivity in rocks, what you typically find is as the scale increases, the dispersivity also increases. And this makes you suspicious that there's something, may make you suspicious that something else is happening as well. Else is happening as well. And so, what we did was we had to look at a system where we imagine we've got a lens of high permeability in the formation. So, we have a channel, finite thickness layer. So, this is one of these sedimentary layers with seal rock above and below. And we have a flow going through this total amount Q. And this lens of high permeability essentially draws in all the blue streamlines and they whizz through here and then they come out again. And so, if we think about the Think about the fraction of the flow going through this high-permeability lens, which depends on its permeability, and there's a fraction, the remaining fraction, goes through the rest of the formation. And if this adjustment zone is quite short compared to the length of the lens, then as a very simple model, we can say that each streamline has a certain probability of moving into a lens or remaining moving at this slow speed. And so we can, if the probability If the probability is p, then what we can do is we can say that if we have a random series of these lenses at different heights in this channel, then the probability that a particular streamline will move through m lenses out of a total number of n lenses is just given by m choose n of p to the m 1 minus p to the m minus m, just a simple binomial distribution. And if we're looking at a channel, then depending on channel then depending on the the value of q1 over q1 plus q2 there'll be a certain number of streamlines that that are deflected into the high permeability lens and so depending on the the ratio of the permeability of the background and the hyperm lens a certain fraction of streamlines are channeled into this and so at each for each streamline at each height in the in the uniform flow in the uniform layer there's a certain probability that it'll get deflected or taken into the Deflected or taken into this high perm lens depending on the height of the lens. And so, if you're in the middle of the channel, there's a very high probability that you'll be deflected into the lens. So, this is probability as a function of position across the channel. So, the streamlines in the middle often get deflected into the hyperm lens because there's a range of heights for this lens where the streamline in the center will get diverted into the lens. But the streamlines near the edge are less likely to be diverted because of the hyper. diverted because if the hyperm streak is on the other side of the channel it's not going to get diverted so the probability drops off as we move to the boundaries of the layer and in the middle the probability is highest that will get deflected into the layer and it really depends on how much of the flow what fraction of all the streamlines are diverted into this as to whether this has a constant probability or there's actually a probability less than one that the streamlines in the middle get diverted into this lens and and so what we And so, what we can do is we can say that the mean travel time on a particular streamline is going to depend on the probability that that streamline is diverted into the lens times the time to travel along this path, plus the time traveling along the slow streamline times that probability. So, it's just a simple probability. And the variance of this just depends on relative to the mean. It's just given by the difference in the times through the. The difference in the times through the low, the slow, and the fast rock times this product of the probabilities. So, what we'd expect is that this is going to lead to a dispersion. And so, again, if we have n lenses, then the expansion of this probability allows us to work out the chance that you go through m of the n lenses. So, there's a range of these travel times. So, the mean and the variance scales like this. And so, in the limit of a large number of lenses, we're going down a long channel, it's just going to follow. It's just going to follow an exponential Gaussian distribution. So there's a mean travel time, and then there's a variance. And the mean is just given by the mean travel time through over a distance L. And the variance just is L squared times sigma squared. This sigma squared, this variance divided by time cubed. Okay, and this just follows from the classic work of Levin-Spole and Smith. And so once we have this mean speed and this dispersivity, mean speed and this dispersivity in this travel time distribution, we can start to describe things in terms of a probability distribution. And so we can think about having a tracer and a tracer will have a probability distribution of where it's going to be, depending on its height across the channel. And so it's moving with a mean speed, which depends on the height in the channel, depending on what the mean travel time is. And it's going to have a dispersivity. A dispersivity in terms of the probability that it goes through different numbers of lenses, and so we can start describing how a fluid moves through the system in terms of this concentration distribution. And here's just a plot showing when we have one lens, we're not actually tracking this Gaussian, but once we get to four or more lenses in a row, it actually starts converging quite nicely to this Gaussian distribution. And so what we've And so, what we find is that, depending on the permeability ratio, we're able to predict the mean travel time at each height. And so, if this is the position across the channel, this is showing you the mean speed at different heights across the channel. And so, the mean speed is faster in the center than at the edge because there's more chance the streamlines in the middle are diverted into the hyperm lenses. And then the dispersivity increases towards the middle. But if all the um But if all the streamlines in the middle are always diverted, then that dispersivity drops off again, okay, which is this anomalous drop in the middle. But essentially, the mean velocity is increasing towards the center. And so if we take a patch of dye in a cell and we add it forward, and we go through, this is distance down the channel, and we go a long way down the channel through 10 to the four times the thickness. So this would be a The thickness. So, this would be a 10-20 meter channel, and we're going a kilometer or up to 10 kilometers down the channel. What we find is that the distribution of tracer follows a mean shown by this dotted line, and then there's a distribution of concentration relative to that mean. So, this is the horizontal average, well, sorry, the average depth averaged across this channel of concentration. And what we see is there's a zone here, and then there's a sharp peak at the front where all this. At the front, where all this fluid has been carried with this mean speed. And so, what we're going to expect is that at early time, this diffusion we'd imagine is going to dominate and cause the cloud of tracer to spread like the square root of distance or square root of time. But as time goes on, this shear in the velocity profile, the expected velocity profile, is going to mean that tracer near the edge goes a lot more slowly than tracer in the center. And that's going to cause... In the center, and that's going to cause a shearing of the profile, and that shearing is going to dominate any of this dispersivity at long enough times. And then we're going to expect to see the tracer spread out linearly with time. And in fact, that's exactly what we see. So if we plot the concentration multiplied by square root of time, and we plot distance relative to the mean divided by square root of time, we find at very long time, there's a little peak at the front. Time, there's a little peak at the front where that's the flow with the uniform speed in the center of the channel. But the main part of the die is actually spreading and the concentrations varying like one over time, and it collapses to this black curve. And this is distance divided by time. W is just the mean speed times time. So in the main part of the channel, the shear is actually controlling the spreading. And we're no longer getting Ficky and dispersion, but we're actually getting a shear-driven spreading. A shear-driven spreading, so the whole cloud of fluid spreads like time. And this means a flow front, so a CO2 front, would also spread like time and it would shear out along a layer because of the heterogeneities within a layer. And this means we're getting, we're only accessing a very small fraction of the pore space because we're shearing out the layer. And in fact, we can see this very clearly if we look at the concentration averaged across the channel at each point along the channel. At each point along the channel, and we work out the center of mass of the distribution of tracer. So, this is a line that was originally a vertical line, and we're looking at where the center of that line is at some later time, and we're looking at the variance relative to that mean position. What we see is that the variance or the standard deviation, i.e. the square root of that variance, initially spreads like the square root of time. So, this dispersion seems to dominate. But once the shear But once the shear takes over and the shear occurs because the streamlines near the edges are less likely to be diverted into a high perm lens, we actually see the variance increasing like time and we're getting a shearing of the flow front. So this is even in a linear channel. Local lenses of different permeability cause linear shearing, not square root shearing. And the transition time between these two essentially can be calculated as the Calculated as the, if we work out the this mean dispersivity from the this occurrence, this probability of going through a lens or not, and we work out the mean flow and the divergence from the mean flow as a function of height in the channel. Once we've gone for a time greater than the dispersive, the mean dispersion divided by the square of the difference in velocity between the center and the edge of the channel. Between the center and the edge of the channel, that time scale tells you when the shear takes over, and that's exactly given by this point here. As you can see on this graph, here this is just showing that transition time scaled with that property there for different properties. So what we've seen is that these lenses are actually going to cause linear shearing of a flow front, so a CO2 flood as a function of time, and this will cause a very rapid spread. Very rapid spread of the leading edge of the CO2, and a huge fraction of the pore space won't be accessed by that CO2 flood as it goes through the formation. And what we've done so far is just long linear lenses where there's a very rapid transition from uniform flow to flow through the long linear lens. This can be generalized to more localized lenses, elliptical lenses, where there's a 2D flow field coming in and out. And to do this, we can look at the travel time distribution. The travel time distribution of different streamlines from the bottom to the top of the layer. So, this is the travel time to go from one end of the domain to the other as a function of the height. And what we see is in the center, the streamlines that go through this lens have a shorter travel time, but now there's a distribution of travel times. So rather than being streamlines that go through the lens have one travel time and ones outside have a second travel time, there's now a whole distribution if we start putting in some geometry in this lens and it's no longer just a thin channel. Just a thin channel. And depending on the height of this lens, we get a whole family of these travel time distributions. And there's a mean travel time distribution given by this black line. And so if we then have a distribution of these lenses at different points down the channel, we're going to see a travel time distribution that's basically sampling a series of these different distributions. And eventually, that's going to lead to a mean velocity profile down the channel, which is greater in the middle than at the edges. And we're going to see a And we're going to see a dispersivity, just as we saw before. And so, when we put in some tracer and it moves down the channel, again, eventually it starts spreading out with time. And so, if we look at the statistics, early on it spreads like the square root of time, and then later on, it's spreading like time. And so, if we're modeling a flow front moving through a real rock with these fluctuations in the structure within the rock, we need to account for this dispersivity. And often, this is called a fractional flow in models of flow in porous rocks. But this isn't a fractional flow that's coming from tests on core scale, where you're looking at a process called the Buckley Laberetta, the fractional flow through individual pore spaces. What we're looking at here is a much bigger scale effect due to the structure, the varying structure of the rock from the way it was deposited. And it's very interesting that if we look at, going back to this picture here, I showed of crossbedding or I showed a crossbedding, or we look at a bigger scale. What we can see is there are interfaces between the rocks. So we can see here there's this rock has a bedding in this direction. Here it's got a bedding in this different direction. And there's an interface between these two layers. And so one question we can ask is, how do these interfaces impact the way the fluid moves through the formation? Because as the flow comes through this formation, it's going to have to move across these interfaces. And many of the many rocks are just filled with. Are just filled with these interfaces. You can see here, this layer is thinning out. So there's an interface here and an interface here between the layers. And so understanding what they do in terms of the flow path is also very interesting. And so there's two things that are important. One is the shape of the interface between two layers. But the second thing that's important is in a cross-bedded layer, we typically characterize the layer in terms of two permeabilities in a long layer or a long Or along strata and across strata permeability. And the permeability in this direction is typically much smaller than in that direction because all the flow can channel along the large grains in that direction, but not in this direction. And so for flow to move horizontally in this layer, the pressure gradient actually needs to be at an angle to the horizontal in order to allow the flow to continue to move horizontally. We can model this in terms of a permeability tensor. Model this in terms of a permeability tensor with pressure gradients, and the components for the pressure tensor are just given in terms of the components of the high and low perm stripes through the system. And so there's a mean permeability, and we can work out the angle at which those pressure, the pressure contour is to the horizontal. Well, there's two things I want to show here. One is that if we have an interface, so this black line is an interface, if you just focus on this here, if we have two Yeah, if we have two layers isotropic layers of rock, then if we imagine a flow coming along this layer and imagine this is isotropic, then these vertical lines show the pressure contours, lines of constant pressure. And because it's isotropic, the flow is just moving down pressure gradient. And when it reaches this interface, it moves to a rock, which in this case is now of higher permeability. And so the pressure contours are further apart. It's again isotropic. But as it goes through this interface, the fluid at the bottom Through this interface, the fluid at the bottom enters the high permodity rock sooner, and so that moves ahead of the fluid at the top. And so, what we see is we get a shear established locked in due to the path through this interface. And as we change the interface, the amount of shearing changes. So, that's one effect. The next effect is that if we have a cross-bedded layer and the pressure gradient is at an angle to the pressure gradient is now at an angle to the horizontal because of the cross-bedding, then it's. Because of the crossbedding, then imagine we come from an isotropic layer of rock and we move across a vertical boundary into a layer that's got anisotropic permeability with pressure gradient in this direction. Then the pressure contours, lines of constant pressure, need to deform over from being vertical to being inclined at this direction. And so they spread out a larger distance at the bottom than the top. And that means the pressure gradient at the top of the layer remains higher than that at the bottom of the layer. And so the flow is faster at the top. Layer, and so the flow is faster at the top. And therefore, again, we get a shearing effect, even with the vertical interface, because this layer is cross-bedded. And that shear depends on how cross-bedded this layer is, but also the difference in the mean permeability of the two layers. And then we can obviously think about having a cross-bedded layer where we also have an interface shear, a sloping interface between an isotropic and a cross-bedded layer. Again, we get some shearing, and then we have another. Get some shearing, and then we have another interface and go back to the original isotropic layer. The distortion happens symmetrically, and so we can actually get a flow pattern like this established just because we go through a cross-bedded layer. And so, what we're seeing here is that the effect of having interfaces between different rocks, which happens within these sedimentary systems, also causes a next shear in the flow pattern. And again, this can cause this long-term dispersion where. This long-term dispersion where flow fronts will spread out like time, and it's going to limit the access to all the pore space in the system. And this is very important if we're trying to calculate how much of the pore space is accessed by the CO2. Well, I thought I'd just finish off by looking at another model where we need to worry about dispersion, and this is in terms of the long-term fate of the CO2. So, the ideal place to put a CO2, a pulse of CO2, is in CO2, a pulse of CO2, is in one of these structural traps. So the CO2 is injected and it'll pond in some structural trap where there's a seal rock above that holds the CO2 in. And so if we look at geologic strata, this is a cross-section through geologic strata, there's often structures that are deformed where we get what are called anticlines. So these are level layers of rock that are deformed. And this vertical scale may be 10 to 100 meters or so, and the horizontal scale is. Or so, and the horizontal scale is more like 10 kilometers. So, these are this is a very exaggerated picture. So, it's a gentle increase and then decrease. And so, you can look at from the surface and plan view, you can look at these clot what are called closures. And these closures typically have a structure like this. And this is one that's being looked at at the moment for sequestration of CO2. And the CO2 will collect in some of these layers and remain there because it's less dense than the surrounding water in this system. In this system, well, when the CO2 is trapped in there, the CO2, we're interested in knowing the long-term fate of the CO2, and the CO2 will dissolve into the water below. And as it'll initially dissolve, and this water here becomes saturated in CO2, but you can only take a few percent of CO2 in the water before it becomes saturated. And then, in order to get any more dissolution, you need to supply some unsaturated water from somewhere. And so, there's a background hydrologic flow that Background hydrologic flow that can supply the water. And so you can imagine having an aquifer flow with a flow Q coming along, and you've got your CO2 trap, and there's some dissolution here. Well, we can look at a simple model of convection and show convection takes off in three to 100 years or so, and it'll dissolve in here, and this will become saturated. But then, in order to dissolve more of the CO2, we have to actually have a flow coming past, and these flows are very slow, and so typically. These flows are very slow, and so typically it might take 10 to the four to 10 to the six years to actually have enough water go by to dissolve all the CO2 in a trap. Obviously, it depends on the aquifer flow rate and it depends on the size of the anticline. And so, there's a question as to whether you may get convection occurring that happens faster than that. And so, we can do a simple calculation to say, well, supposing we've got a gas plume trapped here and it's dissolving. Well, if it dissolves, the water. Well, if it dissolves, the water with CO2 in becomes denser than the unsaturated water. So it turns out there's a density difference of one or two percent between CO2 saturated water and the unsaturated water. So this will tend to sink along the aquifer and there may be a counterflow that sets up against the background hydrologic flow that's coming along. And if we get this counterflow occurring, then that's going to bring in more of this blue fluid, unsaturated fluid, and make. Blue fluid, unsaturated fluid, and may accelerate the rate of dissolution. And we can calculate how much of an extra effect that's going to have by looking at imagining we've got a background flow, QA, and then a draining flow, QD. And if we imagine these are just on a sloping aquifer, then we've got a layer thickness H, and this is H minus H, and there's some pressure gradient along the aquifer, and then there's a buoyancy head. And so we can look at the So we can look at the net flow arriving here and the net flow leaving. And so we can then get an expression for this draining flow here. And so by combining these equations and eliminating the pressure gradient, we can actually get an expression, an upper bound expression for the draining flow in terms of this parameter gamma, which is really a ratio of the background aquifer flow Q compared to the buoyancy driven flow, which is controlled by the density difference between the Which is controlled by the density difference between the saturated CO2 water and the unsaturated water. And so, what we find is that with a weak background flow, we're able to get a counter flow upstream, which actually dominates, and that brings in a lot more unsaturated water and can accelerate this dissolution. And that's very important to understand. But if the background flow is very slow and the layer is thin enough, diffusion may come in, and we may actually. May come in, and we may actually mix these two fluids as they spread out, and we can actually get a hydrodynamic dispersion effect controlling this. And so what may happen in that case, well, I'll just show this calculation just to finish up. So imagine we have this CO2 saturated water at the top of the anticline and it runs out down the aquifer. As it runs down the aquifer, it may diffuse. Down the aquifer, it may diffuse the CO2 into the water coming along from the far field. And in that case, we may end up having a situation where there's a at each position along the aquifer, there's some mean concentration of buoyancy, or if you like, CO2 dissolved in the water. And then there's a vertical gradient between the saturated water at the bottom and the less saturated water at the top. And so if this vertical gradient is actually quite. This vertical gradient is actually quite small at each point, and it's dominant. We're dominated by this horizontal structure, then the pressure gradient is going to be some pressure on the base of the aquifer plus or minus the hydrostat associated with this mean value. And we can justify after the calculation that this term is very small. And if we have this pressure gradient along the aquifer, we can look at the we've got a mean flow, and then we can look at the perturbation to the mean flow. Perturbation to the mean flow, and so we get a velocity perturbation to the mean flow solving Darcy's law. And what we can then do is we can then write down the transport equation for the mean buoyancy. Okay, so the mean buoyancy is going to be transported by the mean flow. Okay, there's going to be a molecular dispersion effect diffusing the mean, the gradient along the channel. And then there's going to be some transport associated with this fluctuation in the velocity, the shear, and also. The shear, and also the vertical gradient in the buoyancy across the channel, this B hat or delta B. And if we want to solve for this term here, which is this shear dispersion-dominated term, we have to balance the vertical diffusion of this fluctuation with the horizontal shearing of the mean, which is creating this vertical gradient. So the gradient cross-the cross-layer gradient in velocity shears out. In velocity, shares out the mean buoyancy gradient, and that drives the vertical diffusion. And so we can solve this equation to find b hat in terms of u hat and b bar because we know u hat in terms of b bar. And so once we've solved for that, we can solve this for this term here, averaged over the channel. And when you do all that, you get this extra term, very interesting extra term, which goes like the cube of the buoyancy gradient along the channel. And so what happens is we can either have a Is we can either have a balance between the advection and the diffusion back upstream or the advection and this dispersion term due to this point this shearing. And so there's numerical solutions where we vary the Rally number in the channel, and we can either get a dispersion dominated or diffusion dominated profile of concentration back upstream. And this shows you that it's possible for even if there's a background hydrologic flow coming from right to left, the CO2 can actually. Left, the CO2 can actually migrate against that flow a certain distance down the aquifer. And so you might detect CO2 that seems to be leaking, but it's actually just part of this buoyancy-driven dispersion. And so it would be entirely safe in terms of where that CO2 is propagating. So, and here's just some solutions. These are some numerical solutions, just confirming those asymptotics. This is an intrusion spreading out where diffusion is very slow. This is the dispersion regime, and this is a pure molecular diffusion type. Pure molecular diffusion type regime. So, what we find is there's a sort of regime diagram where we may get this buoyancy-driven dispersion, which we can use to work out how far upstream the CO2 propagates. So, that's probably a good place to bring my talk to a conclusion. And I'd be very happy to take any questions at this point. So, what I've tried to do is show some of the challenges associated with modeling flow in these porous rocks. Flow in these porous rocks associated with the structure of the rock, where the complexity of the geology can actually lead to some very interesting and surprising effects in terms of the flow pattern and the fact essentially that you get a fractional flow, not a uniform flow. And so Darcy's law becomes of limited value if you're trying to look at what fraction of the poor space you've got CO2 flooded into and also where the leading edge of your CO2 is. But we can also see that some of these effects of dispersion are going to be very Of these effects of dispersion are going to be very important in terms of understanding the dissolution of our clouds of CO2 once they're trapped in the formations. So, there's a lot of very complex modeling to be done on these very hierarchical structures that are real natural rocks. So, I'll stop at that point and be very happy to take some questions. Thank you, Andy. Okay, so folks on Zoom, Okay, so folks on Zoom, you can post your questions in the chat box or you can unmute yourself to ask a question or raise your hand. And let's take a question from the audience in the person. So yeah, here. Thanks, Andy. This is Charles Menevo. Real, real interesting, beautiful models. I had a quick question about what happens in the direction into the plane. I noticed the models were essentially two-dimensional, and I was wondering. And I was wondering whether transport into the sort of into the plane of the screen, I suppose, into the other direction, how does that affect things? For example, your first example with the Pascal triangle, I wonder, do you need generalizations like Pascal pyramids and things of that sort? Anyway. That's a great question. So I think there's a whole myriad of problems here. So in many situations, So, in many situations, depending on the rock that you're trying to inject CO2 into, you might drill very long horizontal wells. So, the wells may be, you know, two, three kilometers long in the layer in which you're injecting. And so in that situation, and that was the case in a place called Insala in Algeria. They had, I think, one and a half kilometer-long wells inside the formation, which was only 20 meters thick. And so, there, you'd really have essentially a two-dimensional. You'd really have essentially a two-dimensional flow if you're able to perforate that well all along that one and a half kilometers and get a uniform or near-uniform flow spreading from it. So as an approximation, you could imagine in that situation, this 2D picture applies. But you're absolutely right. In some other cases, the flow is injected from a point source. So Sleipner in Norway, it was injected from a point source. And there, you could imagine trying to generalize what we've done here, some of these problems into a radially. Into a radially symmetric problem, probably not for the baffle, the water, the sort of waterfall multi-layer problem I showed at the Pascal's triangle. There, I think, there's a sort of interesting question how to generalize that in a radial flow, because you'll have a flow spreading along the baffles, and these baffles are likely to be fractured in a very laterally continuous way. So, essentially, because they're on sort of regional scale tectonics causing. Sort of regional scale tectonics causing the fractures. So you can imagine in that case having your CO2 plume spreading into the page under buoyancy forces below one of the baffle planes and then leaking up along a linear fracture essentially on two sides of a where it's spreading. And so there's a generalization which I'm not aware people have looked at, but that would be a very interesting calculation to do in terms of understanding the spread in that direction. So I think that, and I think in all these questions, So, I think that, and I think in all these questions, in all these problems, there's an issue about whether to look at whether you're going to get really symmetric flows or you're going to get some extra non-negligible complication coming in because of the sort of going from 2D to 3D. And I think it's probably case-dependent. And I think there's a lot of further interesting challenges. But I think one of the things I was trying to illustrate here was that the sort of conventional approach of using Darcy's law and prep. Of using Darcy's law and perhaps just using a different value for permeability to describe some of these effects doesn't always capture all the processes and phenomenon. And it'll be the same thing in the dispersion around lenses. Some of those lenses may be quite continuous in the direction into the page. Other ones may be sort of ellipsoidal structures. And so I think if they're ellipsoidal structures, the analysis presented here probably applies for the full 3D problem. And so I think there's And so, I think there's probably different limits where we can extend and develop these models into 3D. But that's a very, very good question. Thank you. Thank you. Question from Martin. It's okay. Andy, I have a quick question on in these highly heterogeneous rock systems. Do you have some sort of like a thumb rule or a screening criterion for even just before? Or, even just before you design your CO2 injection strategies, and you know certain things, properties about these subsurface environments, that what would be the risks of actually having these kinds of heterogeneous structured reservoirs as a target reservoir for your CO2 injectors. They may have the capacity, but the problem is that they have so many other pathways for it to leave. They have so many other pathways for it to leak into. Or you're assuming that all these fractures and everything, none of these things reach the seal until the time everything has been trapped? That's a great question. So I think, yeah, I mean, the key, the sort of order one ingredients you need are a sort of permeable, laterally extensive rock where there's lots of pore space, and then a seal layer above it so that the CO2. Seal layer above it so that the CO2 can't escape. And that needs to be a thick, very low permeability layer with a very high capillary entry pressure so that you have quite a lot of certainty that the CO2 is going to remain in that region. But I guess within the sedimentary formation, there can be a lot of microfractures and other structures, and also there can be a series of bedding planes and crossbeds and so on. And crossbeds and so on, just because of the way the geology makes the rocks. So, there's both depositional processes that can lead to particular ways in which the strata are built up, which can lead to anisotropy, for example, and the multiple layers with layers of clay or shale interbedded between the bigger grains. But then, once the rocks are, if they're deposited in a submarine environment, they'll start to compact post-deposition as they're compressed, and that can lead to. They're compressed, and that can lead to shrinkage. And you can get fracturing within the layer, but it may not impact the seal layer above. And so, you can have a competent seal, but actually have lots of small-scale fractures within the formation itself. But of course, when you're injecting into these systems, you need to limit the injection pressure so that you don't exceed the fracture strength of that overlying seal layer. But there's a whole sort of But there's a whole, so I think there's some high-level screening calculations or modeling you can do to select ideal sites. And obviously, there's a lot of depleted oil and gas fields, particularly gas fields where the seal's been competent for millions of years. So in those systems, within the structure, there can be lots of layers and there can be lots of internal baffles and the baffles may not be fully laterally extensive. Fully laterally extensive, there may be gaps in them for various reasons. And so, I mean, for example, at Sleipner, the plume traveled through nine layers, and we don't really understand how it travels through each of the layer, each of the sort of seal zones between each of the layers, whether that's because there's fractures or gaps in the seal, because it's not fully a competent layer. But it's, I mean, there's different models for it, but it's not fully understood. And of course, you know, being below. And of course, you know, being below the sea, a couple of kilometers below the seabed, it's difficult to get a very detailed understanding of that. Well, thank you. Hopefully, we'll get to pick up your brains in person in the next worst workshop. So, let me thank you for your very exciting talk on the CO2 trapping mechanisms in this really important process. I don't see more questions on Zoom. So, thanks, Andy. And I'm asking Professor. I'm asking Professor Jekoman to share his screen. Well, Andy Woods is a tough act to follow.
