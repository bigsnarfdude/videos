Before we start, I want to say that if you have any questions in the online audience, I guess either ask your questions as usual, but I will also want it for the chat to lay the here. But avoid the floor. Thank you. So, yeah, thank you to the organizers. It's a pleasure to be here. It's a pleasure to be the opening act for this. To be the opening act for this nice conference. And so, yeah, so I'll tell you about staltotic regularity for continuum Schrodinger and Dirac operators. And so staltotic regularity is something that... Okay, so stop tautic regularity is something that started as a. So, can people hear me over Zoom? I'm going to assume so. I'm not wearing microphone. I'm not wearing a microphone. Yeah? Yes. Okay, okay, thank you. Okay, so, yeah, so staltatic regularity is something that started, that was, it's a theory for orthogonal polynomials with compactly supported measures. And the role of infinity actually is important in this theory. And so one of the messages of this talk will be in how the fact that these continuum models have unbounded spectrum, how Models have unbounded spectrum, how that affects the theory, how that changes things, and then also how, in some sense, yeah, just how the continuum role of this really changes things. So let me just get started. And so the first system that we're considering is half-line Schrodinger operators. Very classical setup, an operator on this Hilbert space L2 of 0 infinity, where the potential is real. Where the potential is real valued, and we're assuming that the potential is bounded. Well, we don't mean pointwise bounded, we mean bounded in a locally L1 sense. So, what we would call uniformly locally L1. And under this assumption on the potential, we get a self-adjoint operator with a Dirichlet boundary condition of zero with a domain that explicitly you can write out this way. This is standard. And really, you'll see that for this topic, the half-line setting is natural. But of course, once you understand the half-line setting, you could make some conclusions about full-line operators. And so, in particular, you can make corollaries about ergodic Schrodinger operators, which are, in particular, close to the subject of this conference. So, okay, so the basic So, the basic question is: how big is the spectrum, or how big is the essential spectrum of this operator? Well, okay, I mean, if there's no potential, the spectrum is the half-line. If the potential is periodic, the spectrum is a union of closed intervals, fine. But in general, the spectrum can be very thin. So, it can be a Cantor set, it can have zero Lebesgue measure. I'm giving here some references that are in the continuum setting, but of course, there are. Continuum setting, but of course, there are. If you look in the discrete Trinidad operator literature, there are, of course, prior references, but these are some for the continuum case. So, even in the continuum case, where there's this heuristic that at large energies, maybe the Laplacian is dominant, even so, the spectrum can be very thin. So, it can have zero Lebesgue measure, it can have zero Hausdorff dimension, zero lower box counting dimension. Dimension. And yet, one message of this talk is that there's some universal thickness conclusions about the spectrum, and that those universal thickness statements are formulated in the language of potential theory and Martin functions. And in particular, there's an effective notion of size of the spectrum, which I will tell you, and which I'll try to convince you is a notion of size. So, for some So, for some background, if you have a compact set E, you can define the so-called Robin constant. The Robin constant in potential theory is a minimizer over probability measures that are supported on the set E of this logarithmic self-average. So, you could motivate this through a. Through a like a, you can view this as like a coulomb interaction in R2 or in C, and you can view this as like a potential self-energy and say that's the Robin constant. And the Robin constant, if instead of the Robin constant you want to talk about logarithmic capacity, the two are related this way. And we talk about polar sets. Polar sets are those that have capacity zero, which means they have Robin constant plus infinity. And polar sets. Infinity, and polar sets are very small. So, if you want to relate this to other notions of smallness, for example, any countable set is polar, any polar set has zero Hausdorff dimension. Neither of those are equivalences, but that's roughly where it fits. So these are very small sets. And when we say quasi-everywhere, it means except on a polar set. Now, you can take this notion of polar, you can move it conformally, so we can talk about polar sets even when they're. So, we can talk about polar sets even when they're not compactly supportive. Okay, so for motivation, then, let me recall just a few aspects of staltoptic regularity in the setting of Jacobi matrices. So, if you have a if you start with a compactly supported probability measure, call it support E, and actually I should really say call it essential support E. Support E. So knock off any isolated pure points that the measure has. So really, it's like you're talking about the essential spectrum. So E could be the essential support of mu. Okay, if the measure is supported on R, then you have orthonormal polynomials. Standard construction, these orthonormal polynomials obey Jacobi recursion. And these coefficients a and b n, of course, enter a Jacobi matrix, which is Enter a Jacobi matrix, which has μ as the spectral measure. And now you have a universal inequality there. The rate of growth of the AKs, the AKs are strictly positive, Vn's are real. And if you look at the sort of the average AK in this sense, it's bounded by the capacity of E. So this is a universal inequality for any μ of this form, any μ compactly supported. Compactly supported, non-trivial measure. And the staltopic regularity corresponds to the cases of equality, where this limit is exactly the capacity of E. And this is just one of the characterizations. So this is a starting point in a theory that also describes asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials, the zero distribution of the orthogonal polynomials in the limit, so as a deterministic. So, as a deterministic density of states, and so on. So, I won't get too deep into this, except to say our results are directly motivated by the results that exist in the orthogonal polynomial case. So, okay, so however, I should say in orthogonal polynomial theory, for example, the rate of growth of the orthogonal polynomials is bounded. Polynomials is bounded also in a root asymptotic sense by the Green's function for the complement of the spectrum. And so that Green's function for the complement of the spectrum with a pole at infinity. But now if I'm going to tell you about a similar theory for operators that have unbounded spectra, then the question is, how do you put a pole at infinity if infinity is now not an internal point of? Now, not an internal point of your complement of the spectrum. Infinity is now a boundary point. And so that's where the Martin boundary comes in. So the construction is you start by assuming that you have a domain which is Grinian, which just means it supports non-trivial positive harmonic functions, if you will. And on it, you have a Green function, which is a A green function, which is a function of z and w, and it's really for each w, it's a function of z, it's harmonic with a logarithmic pole at z, and which has boundary values which are zero quasi-everywhere on the boundary. So it's a positive harmonic function, logarithmic pole at w and And zero on the boundary. And well, bounded away from the pole. Bounded away from the pole. Bounded away from the neighborhood of the pole. Okay, so the Green's function has a pole at W, so what happens if you move this pole, if you draw something? I mean, so the typical situation for us is you have some set E that's a subset of the real line, and you have your region omega, which is C minus E. And this is for sure going to be Grinian. And now you can have poles at points Wn and you can try to move this Wn out to infinity. And if you just do that, this is not going to converge. This is not going to converge. The way that to make it converge, this is a construction of Martin. The way you make that converge is you take this green function with a polar wn, you normalize it. You pick some normalization point z star, which is actually completely irrelevant in the end. But you pick some normalization point z star, you normalize by that, and then you let wn go to the boundary of omega. Go to the boundary. Go to the boundary in what sense? Let's just say it means it eventually leaves any compact subset of omega. If this is what we mean, that we're not even referring to any prior notion of boundary. Okay, and so one reason this construction is of interest is, and this is the Martin construction, that this actually gives you a new notion of boundary. You can think of Wn leaving. You can think of wn leaving out to infinity, or you could equally well think about wn leaving somewhere to here, and giving you some harmonic function in the process. You could view that harmonic function as a boundary point for omega. And it turns out that gives a topology, that gives a compactification if you include those and you identify the point w with the function, with the green function. function with the green function you get a compact set in the right topology okay and so this gives a martin boundary which is in general distinct from the euclidean boundary and in particular if we talk about martin functions at infinity they are those that are obtained as limits as w n goes to infinity. So let me say you're all distinct with these problems. Um is there any sort of conclusion either way? Is there any sort of inclusion either way? Yeah, so you can certainly, there's a compactness to this. So if I know I have the Euclidean boundary point and I take some sequence of Wns approaching that, I know that there's a pre-compactness, I know that there's a sub-sequence that converges. So I know that I'll have at least one Martin boundary point that I can find there. But the opposite is false. And actually, it's easy to see in a case where he, say, To see in a case where E say consists of bands. So if you have a set E that's like a finite gap set, you could see that if you are approaching this point from above or from below, you get two different functions. And so this Euclidean boundary point corresponds to two Martin boundary points. Yeah. Whereas if you have this point, anything here would give you the same limit. The same limit. And so you can really think of, so this is really two Martin boundary points in a way that's kind of intuitive, I think. Now, an interesting case to us is, of course, in general, we can have Cantor spectrum. And then you can argue that this is sort of this is a yep, so then it then whether you have one or two Martian boundary points kind of corresponds to having ah okay. Having okay, so I should have said, right, so this is what I should have said there, right? So, in particular, when you have a Denjois domain, which is a domain which is a complement of a subset of a real line, then if you have a, then as soon as the set E is not polar, your region is greeny and supports green functions, and in this Denjois domain, every Euclidean boundary point corresponds to one or two minimal marketing boundary points, meaning you can take convex combinations of those two. Convex combinations of those two. That's why minimal is also a notion. Okay, and so that's a general result. And so whether it's one or two corresponds to kind of, you can view that as a kind of thickness statement. Right? This, if you're willing to accept this is thicker than this, it really comes out to be if you're in a counter setting, it comes down to some kind of local density. I don't know. But stated in this potential theorem. But stated in this potential theoretic language. Okay, so in particular, we need the Martin boundary for some of the proofs, but the Martin function at infinity is the one that really appears in the results, in the conclusions. And so I'm going to focus on that. When you have a semi-bounded set, like a spectrum of a Schrodinger operator, then the Martin function is unique up to normalization. So you're in this case of one because you're Of 1 because you're semi-bounded, so your infinity kind of looks like the boundary point of a gap, right? So it kind of looks like this situation. Okay, that's informal, but it's correct. So there's a unique up to normalization Martin function at infinity, and this limit is convergent. This is for sure. Now, this limit could be zero or it could be positive. And there's an Achieser-Levin condition, which for saying, Achieser-Levin condition, which for semi-bounded sets says this. So it's really the question of whether this is zero or positive. If it's positive, you say this is an Achiezer-this obeys the Achiezer-11 condition for semi-bounded sets. And in that case, you normalize the marking function this way. This just looks convenient. Okay? And well, that gets me to the first result. So for any Schrodinger operator with, remember, just uniformly locally bounded potential. Uniformly locally bounded potential. The spectrum, the essential spectrum is not a polar set, is a Chiezer 11. And actually, the Martin function has this two-term asymptotics with root minus Z as the leading term and then constant over root minus Z as the second term as Z goes to minus infinity. You can turn this from a Infinity. You can turn this from a radial asymptotics to a non-tangential asymptotics if you're just willing to accept the real part in front of this. Okay, now, the Achiezer-Levin condition has been studied in the literature. It's of interest for various reasons. This kind of two-term asymptotics has not been studied, it seems, before. But for us, it's super important. So the second term, so this was not even conjectured previously. So, this was not even conjectured previously. But for us, it's super important because this constant in the second term turns out to serve as your renormalized Robin constant. And so then, remember that inequality between coefficients, between the Jacobi coefficients and the Robin constant? Well, that looked multiplicative. But those A's were positive. You could put a log on everything if you wanted. Well, the Schrodinger version. On it. Well, the Schrodinger version of that result is this universal inequality. This renormalized Robin constant for the spectrum is less or equal than the length of the than the lower average of the potential here. So Martin functions as such, Martin functions have appeared in inverse spectral theory implicitly and explicitly. You could say that, you know, in some sense, if you think about the Marchenko structure, If you think about the Marchenko-Ostrovsky theory for periodic Schrodinger operators, the Lyapunov exponent for a periodic Schrodinger operator is the Martin function at infinity. You can tell that because it's a subharmonic function on the complex plane that's harmonic away from the spectrum, that's zero on the spectrum. That's one way to tell, and it has the right normalization of infinity. Of infancy. So there's different characterizations of this Martin function at Infinity that are useful. Okay, so to go further, what else can we do with this? Well, let's look at the Dierschless solution. So for any complex Z, look at the solution of this initial value problem. So the Dierschless solution normalized. Normalized. I know, but you're gonna troubleshoot it, which you have to figure out. What's uh like you doing it? I don't know. I don't know if that's meant to be. I'm sorry right now, right? Yeah, what's the week we got fucked up? We don't punish for it. I'm being Zoom bombed yet. This is my first Zoom bomb. This is my first zoom bombing. For someone who's not newster. Yeah, yeah. Cool, cool. Okay, well maybe it's okay, maybe it's safe to continue. Okay, maybe it's safe to continue now. So, okay, thank you. Okay, so you have the Dirichlet solution. For that Dirichlet solution, you normalize it this way. That Dirichlet solution, you want to know the rate of growth. It has an exponential, it grows at least exponentially, and this is a lower bound number rate of growth. You can view this as a Comte Thomas estimate that is optimal. Optic up to the knowledge of the essential spectrum. And okay, if I'm going to talk about things being optimal, then that gets us to the cases of equality. And so, well, the definition, also inspired directly by the Staltotic theory, is, let's call a potential regular if there's actually equality here. Remember, there was an inequality with limit. Well, if there's limit exists and is equal to Well, if the limit exists and is equal to this renormalized Robin constant, we call that a regular potential, and that has a bunch of equivalent characterizations. We don't have to get through all these in detail, except to say the potential being regular in this sense is equivalent to having sub-exponential growth on the spectrum at every Dirichlet regular point of the spectrum, or almost everywhere with respect to harmonic measure, or it's equivalent to having. Or it's equivalent to having just one point in the upper half plane where that's actually equality. So it's, yeah, we have a bunch of equivalent characterizations, some of which are interesting as necessary conditions for this and some as sufficient rate, really, if you compare these two. One function each quality, right? You can do it either way because we know, so maybe you might have missed it. The limit is the The limif is bigger than, and so then here we have the complementary lim suit plastic. Okay, so yeah, we have all sorts of equivalent characterizations there. Okay, next results, what about the density of states? We have a deterministic density of states, we're just considering still a single potential, but you can look at the Dirichlet solution, you can list its zeros, you can You can sum up the Dirac deltas at these, and you can divide by x. Now, there's infinitely many zeros of this Dirichlet solution, so these are no longer probability measures. So a lot of the arguments from the bounded case just go completely out the window. You're not dealing with a limit of probability measures, you're dealing with a limit of infinite measures. And so, really, the proofs rely much more on The proofs rely much more on harmonic and subharmonic functions and much less on just working on measures on the real line. Okay, but so you have that, and from the Martin function you get a candidate limit, which is the distribution of Laplacian of the Martin function. The Martin function at infinity, I mentioned, is also subharmonic on C. So it has a distribution of Laplacian, which is a positive metric. And you have... And you have two implications. It turns out, and this is known to be, you can't do better than this, if V is regular, then you have limit, then you have convergence of these normalized zero-counting measures to the density, to this, to the Martin measure, as being a kind of density of states. Conversely, if you have convergence of the zero-counting measures, then V is regular, or this is just to say this is. This is just to say, this is just in the language of the Borel functional calculus. So, this is just to say there's a polar set x such that the spectral measure for the operator is supported on x. So, this is to say spectrum is, you know, spectral measure is supported on a very small set in this other case. But this case can happen. Okay. Another application that's closest to Ergo Discity. To ergodicity is well, if you have an ergodic family of Schrodinger operators and you have the Lapunov exponent that is positive on some set of energies, well, this is known to not be enough to give localization. It's not enough to give you pure-point spectrum just to have positive Lapunov exponents. However, just from this, it's enough to conclude that for almost every operator in the zergotic family, again the spectral measure is supported on some polar set. Supported on some polar set. So it's enough in particular to tell that the spectral measure is zero Hausdorff dimensional on that set. So it's completely kind of model independent for any ergodic effect. Okay, there's also I consider interesting applications even for essential spectrum zero infinity. If you have a potential that's decaying Potential that's decaying in this sense, then okay, then the essential spectrum is, of course, zero infinity, but then also V is regular. And that, of course, doesn't, so of course the opposite doesn't hold. If you have a, you can construct basically a sparse potential which will have essential. Which will have essential spectrum zero infinity and be regular, but not be decaying. This is true. But you have various relationships between this average of the potential and the essential spectrum. So if you're willing to, so if you assume that if you have a Feldschringer operator with essential spectrum in zero infinity, then In zero infinity, then that tells you that lim inf of the lower average of the potential is positive. If the lower average is actually less or equal than zero, then well, then it's of course zero, then that's enough to conclude that the essential spectrum is all of zero infinity. And if lim sup is less or equal to zero, then your essential spectrum is zero infinity and v is regular. Is zero infinity and v is regular. And so to compare this, there's a result of the Manic Remling that says if your essential spectrum of the Schringer operator with plus minus V is contained in zero infinity, then that implies that the essential spectrum of both is zero infinity. And if you trace through these, you can see that these conclusions will recover this result and also will tell you regularity. Somehow, if you know that essential spectrum. Somehow if you know that essential spectrum for both plus minus v is in zero infinity, then you know that this limit is positive for both plus minus b. Then you know that v has zero average, so you know you're in this case actually. It's just an illustration, a special case of our results. But okay, one more example about this. If you view a potential that's that alternates That alternates between plus minus one, faster and faster, that's going to have essential spectrum zero infinity. The fact that it oscillates faster and faster between plus minus one means you can control the part below zero, and then you can use, and of course this will have zero average in the limit. And so this is enough to conclude the central spectrum is zero infinity. However, even in the average sense, this potential is a very simple. The average tense, this potential doesn't decay. This is just to kind of see what's true and what's not. Okay, another thing you can do with this is you can obtain a continuum analog of Withem's theorem. So another criterion for regularity is really in terms of the behavior of the spectral measure. So if μ is the spectral measure for the operator, and Operator, and say on the essential spectrum zero infinity, if your operator has absolutely continuous spectrum, then it is regular. So you can conclude regularity also from continuity of the continuity of the spectral measure, or more generally, from more generally you would want to compare to harmonic measure for the spectrum. For the spectrum. Okay, so I'm going to tell you a few, make a few comments about the proofs, and then I'll tell you something about the Dirac setting and what goes different there. So one important property behind this is an extremal property of the Martin function at infinity. So the setup is as before. You have a semi-bounded subset of the blue line. Semi-bounded subset of the blue line, you have the domain omega. And if so, remember the domain is Grinian if it can support a positive harmonic function that's non-constant. Well, if it can support a positive harmonic function that has this kind of asymptotics at minus infinity, then that's enough to conclude that it's an Achiezer-Levin set. And actually, that's enough to conclude this inequality. So the Martin So the Martin function, which remember this Martin function ME is the one that's normalized by this going to one, right? So if it's, once it's an Achiezer-Legen set, you can normalize the Martin function this way. So this then tells you it's an IKS-relevant set, and the Martin function is the smallest one with this kind of asymptotic sequence kind of setting. Asymptotic symptoms. So remember all these conclusions, like a Comte Thomas estimate, where you get an inequality. That inequality with martin function serving as the lower bound comes from this kind of mechanism. It's the smallest harmonic function with certain properties. Okay. Moreover, once you have this kind of positive harmonic function, if you kind of apply this twice, you can get twice, you can get actually two competing, you know, you can get two inequalities where this one is coming from omega, this one's really coming from the cut plane. So for this one, you would ignore all the gaps and get a lower bound this way. And so that helps bound things. Now, if now another, so okay, so another lemma which this one by itself is elementary, but if you have Elementary, but if you have an analytic function on the upper half plane, which decays linearly at infinity, then it has to be of this form with finite measure mu. And in particular, look how an upper bound is really enough to tell you that you have a function of this form, and once you have a function of this form with a measure that's finite, you can. form with the measure that's finite, you can expand this. And so you can get that this exactly behaves as mu of r over z at infinity. So an upper bound gives you an exact asymptotic term. So as a corollary of this, if you have a positive harmonic function on omega, which now obeys two term asymptotics, so going beyond just root minus z, if it obeys two term asymptotics like. If it obeys two-term asymptotics like this, that's enough to push you to a Martin function with this kind of exact two-term asymptotics. That's the kind of reasoning that happens. I'm of course omitting a lot of things here, but that's the principle of it. Now, where do we get subharmonic functions? Where do we get harmonic functions on the domain? Well, we look at the Dirichlet solution. Well, we look at the Dirichlet solution. So you take the Dirichlet solution, you take the log of its absolute value divide by x. Well, that's going to be subharmonic on c because u of x z is an analytic function, is an entire function. And it's going to be harmonic on the upper half plane because the Dirichlet solution has no zeros there. One interesting thing is that if you control the dirus for solutions, Dirichlet solutions, you can conclude that this family of subharmonic functions is pre-compact. You put x bigger than 1 because you want to avoid some phenomena near 0. That doesn't matter. This family of subharmonic functions is pre-compact in a distributional sense. And another is that subsequential limits are harmonic in omega. So notice that that's an improvement. So, notice that that's an improvement. The subsequential limits are better than the functions themselves. The functions themselves have some zeros on the real line, including some zeros and gaps. There's the solution has some zeros on R, including zeros and gaps. So, H has singularities on R, including singularities and gaps. But actually, if you take the limit distributionally, that limit is going to. That limit is going to be going to be suddenly harmonic, it's going to be a positive harmonic function, in fact, harmonic. So, any poles, any singularities that appear in gaps, they vanish in the limit. You're not taking limits pointwise, you're taking limits distributionally. Okay, so once you have these subsequential limits, which are harmonic in omega, if you control their behavior finely enough. Their behavior finely enough, then those can be your harmonic functions with which you compare the Martin function and use pre-compactness to make a lot of things work. Now, instead of controlling the growth of the Dirichlet solution, it's better to switch to Weyl solutions and to averages of n functions. So the Weyl solution you have away from the spectrum, and there's a technical lemma that tells you that really this. That really, this product of the Dirichland-Dewey solution is bounded above and below. Heuristically, this is very familiar, right? We have the Dirichland-Dewey solution, and this is here in the upper half plane. These are two linearly independent solutions. So the Wronskian is non-zero. So if Duronskian is non-zero and constant, it sort of couples the growth of one with the decay of the other. But of course, that's not quite sufficient to tell you this. Quite sufficient to tell you this, there's a different argument that tells you this. Because in the other statement, you have u prime, psi prime, and they're all mixed in a strange way. This is a bit different, but it's the same heuristics. Now, there's the familiar m functions, the logarithmic derivative of the vial solution. And so, once you have this boundedness in the limit, it means you can repeat. limit, it means you can replace this by minus 1 over x log of psi, and then psi you can integrate the logarithmic derivative all the way from 0. And so suddenly, instead of viewing this quantity, instead of viewing the Dirichlet solution this way, you're viewing minus the real part of this average of m functions. This also looks, if you're thinking ergodically, this also looks like an ergodic average of m functions, right? But we're not necessarily working But we're not necessarily working with ergotic potentials. But still, that's the idea. You're now viewing an average of m function. In particular, you no longer have any problems at x equals 0, and you just average the squared of x. Okay, so you have this average, and now the question is, how precisely can you control this average of m functions? Functions. B is just bounded, right? So the average, first of all, doesn't have to have a limit, right? We know that. Okay. So one thing I should say, you're going to get, as this average, if you take, right, if you're going to, if you pass by pre-compactness to subsequential limits and take those functions, you're going to get positive harmonic functions. One of the things we're clearly going to need is we're going to need to know. Going to need to know the asymptotics of that limit at infinity. And so, for that, we need to know the asymptotics of an infinity, not just of individual m functions, but of these averages. And so, you need some uniformity in this. And so, asymptotics of m functions are, of course, a familiar topic. You have semi-bounded operators. You're studying these as non-tangential asymptotics as z goes to infinity. And if you denote by k the square root of the square, And if you denote by k the square root of minus c, the first thing that might come to mind is that the m function goes as minus minus c at infinity. Well, that's not precise enough. We want two-term asymptotics. The next thing that will come to mind is this. This gives you the right heuristics. This gives you the right idea. You have v of x here, and you have it's divided by the square root. However, this is not general enough. This this asymptotics actually holds when Actually, holds when your v is continuous or has a Lebesgue point at x, right? But we don't want to assume that. And there would be no uniformity in that statement. This little O here would be problematic. Because remember, one of the issues that's hidden here is this is a limit as z goes to infinity. But we want to first average that in x, take a limit as x goes to infinity, and then have that obey some asymptotics as z goes to infinity. So there's a commuting of two. Failure. So there's a commuting of two limits that's going on that's non-trivial. I'll say more about that in two minutes. So, okay, so in fact, you can't use this asymptotic expansion. This is better, but this still doesn't give you enough control over the error. So, in fact, what you need is to expand like this. You need to acknowledge this extra term, and then you'll have an explicit. And then you'll have an explicit big O of that's next order, and that explicit big O is now controlled uniformly in X. So, in particular, when you average these things, this will stay big O of k to the minus 2. So, this is the expansion you need, and then you deal with this second integral term. It does turn out to vanish, but only because you first wrote it down explicitly for whatever. First, wrote it down explicitly for what it was, and then made it vanish. Okay, and so now you're seeing how in the average of the m functions, you're going to have, looking at this formula, say, right, just for motivation, if you average this, you're going to get minus root z, you're going to get an average of v divided by root z. And so you see how the right expressions show up. That's really all I plan to say about the proofs. There's a number of technicalities that don't go so well on the slides. Okay, so as my last topic, and I think I have how much time I have still? Let's say eight. Okay. Okay. So okay. Okay, so um well so So, after we completed this work, Ethan Waltney also joined us to work on Dirac operators. And so, we started to study half-line Dirac operators, and we're studying them in this Zakarov-Shabbat form, where you put i minus i there, and you have a complex value potential, or operator data, however you want to call it. This is the form that appears in the Laxpur representation of the NLS. Of the NLS. But of course, it's also equivalent to this form, which may be more familiar from some literature. It's more classical, where you write it this way. But this is, of course, equivalent up to a matrix conjugation. You take the matrix that corresponds to Cayley transform, you just conjugate by that. So this is just an algebraic plan. So anything we say applies to both. But okay, but this form is more convenient to work with. So assume now that your operator data is uniformly local L2. And well, once again, you write down, you make this precisely into an unbounded self-adjoint operator. Now, this may sound controversial if you see this for the first time. How is this the Dirichlet domain? So, first of all, elements of So first of all, elements of this domain, elements of your Hilbert space are now vector-valued, because this is acting on, you know, it's L2 of C2 valued things. Now, the reason this corresponds to the Dirichlet domain is if you switch to this, it will correspond to one of the entries of your vector being zero. But if you work out how your boundary values How your boundary values look. So, sorry, if you look up, if you work out what the self-adjoint boundary conditions look like for this thing, they are not given by the sort of the cosine sine thing like for Schrodinger operators. They are given by F1 being a unimodular multiple of F2. That's just how it works. Because this is your kind of your signature matrix. Kind of your signature matrix at zero that comes out. Anyway, this is a self-adjoint boundary condition. Maybe I could have left it at that. So for Dirac operators, the spectrum is unbounded above and below. This introduces differences from the potential theoretic side. You will now have Martin functions which will have this kind of asymptotics. Of course, you're not going to want asymptotics as z goes to minus infinity, because that could be on the spectrum. Infinity, because that could be on the spectrum, which is going to go up instead. That's not a problem. And this time, instead of root z being sort of the extremal behavior, z is the extremal behavior. C is the fastest growth one can have in a Martin function. And okay, and so you can conjecture that you'll have Martin function asymptotics that behave this way with, again, a new renormalized Robin constant. A new renormalized Robin constant waiting here in the two-term asymptotics. This is motivated also by, if you look up, you know, one periodic Dirac operators have been studied. So if you look up the asymptotics there, you see this is the two-term asymptotics. For the, you know, put an imaginary part of this, that's your Lapton of exponent for the periodic derocon, for example. For the periodic they are comfortable for it. So, okay, so now it seems like we have a clear conjecture, right? We expect asymptotics like this for the Martin function. We expect that regularity corresponds to this renormalized Rubbin constant being the long time average of phi. Turns out not to be the case. Okay, and okay, so this is the thing I already said. You're not in the semi-bounded case anymore. You're not in the semi-bounded case anymore, so you're looking at Martin functions, which now you're using this Achiezer-Levin condition. This is actually the Achiezer-Levin condition that was originally considered on the literature, as opposed to the semi-valid one. So we do prove that the spectrum is not polar. The spectrum is an Achiezer-11 set in this sense. And again, if you normalize the And again, if you normalize the Martin function so that this limit is 1, the Martin function has this two-term asymptotic behavior. And B is now forced to be a positive constant. And this will serve as the renormalized Robin constant. And it is true that you have this universal inequality. The Robin constant is smaller than this limin. What I don't know if I emphasized enough is when you have Emphasized enough is when you have an inequality like this, you should view this as a really as so your constant B is a decreasing function of the set. So if I have sets E and F that have this asymptotics, if E is a subset of F, then B E is bigger than B F. Right? So an upper Right? So an upper bound on BE, BE less than something, you can view as size is bigger than something. Certainly in the sense of monotonicity. It really behaves as a Robin constant, so to say. Okay, so this inequality is true. If you look at the Dirichlet solution, which has this boundary, this has this initial condition 1, 1. Again, for any fixed x, u of xz is an. Fixed x, u of xz is an entire function of z. So you have these subharmonic functions. Away from the real line, if you take the Leiminv, you have again this. So you have again your Com Thomas estimate. However, so if you're thinking this is when we should be having equalities, well, a counterexample is provided by this. Counter example is provided by this. So if you have sine of x to the alpha, where alpha is bigger than 1, so something that oscillates faster and faster, then, well, your spectrum is going to be r. So we prove this. The spectrum is r, so this Robin constant is 0, because the Martin function for r is just imaginary part z. So in particular, v r is just 0. Zero. Okay, and you have this, so the growth of the Dirichlet solution is precisely given by the Martin function. However, clearly the limit of absolute, the average of absolute phi squared is one half, which is clearly not equal to this. And the mechanism is this. Once again, we look at the We look at the functions we get from this expression, and those functions do obey this. They do obey this two-term asymptotics. However, here, these two-term asymptotics don't commute with the limit. In the Schrodinger case, I told you there's work to do to make sure they do commute. You have the limit x goes to infinity, and asymptotic says z goes to infinity. And that sounds like a purely That sounds like a technical part of the work where you roll up your sleeves and you make sure it works. Well, here it turns out it doesn't work. And so instead, you need to improve. So you first need to improve your universal inequality, and then that is going to give you an equivalent statement. So the improved inequality looks like this. So this looks uglier. This looks uglier, right? What this does is this takes first small local averages of phi and then it takes their averaged L to norm. And so it takes these small local averages, takes their L to norm, and so really what this is saying is for any epsilon, PE is less than this limit. Right? And now you can see how this behaves differently in the example above. Differently in the example above, right? In sine x to the alpha. If you have, so sine x to the alpha, if you're just taking the pointwise L2 average, then that is going to be one half. But if you start taking small local averages, pushing those, then this is going to decay actually point-wise. Anyway, so with this, you then have a characterization of regularity. Of regularity, that an operator is regular if and only if for every epsilon. This holds. And really, the reason, and I'll stop there. So the reason behind the hood, what's going on, is that before we worked with the scalar averages, right, the scalar averages appeared in the second term. So their limits were what mattered. It turns out in the Dirac case, you can't think about scalar averages of absolute five. can't think about scalar averages of absolute phi squared. Instead, it turns out that you have to take this kind of Fourier transform. So take a finite truncation of phi from 0 to x, Fourier transform that, take, you know, square it so that you have a positive measure on R, and divide it by x, and it turns out that this By x, and it turns out that this, you know, that uniform local L2 condition for phi gives you that these measures are bounded. You know, the supremum of sigma x is finite. So the measures are, there's a bound on the measures. And that means you can take the set of vague limits. And whereas before, there were a lot of pre-compactness statements and compactness arguments that I didn't say, where you passed a sub-sequential. That I didn't say, where you pass the subsequential limits of these averages and harmonic functions and so on. So before you would take limits of this, now you have to look at vague limits of these measures. And so that means that the statements I showed on the previous slide can then be reformulated this way in terms of these measures. So this doesn't look terribly pretty, but turns out to be the right way to view this. out to be the right way to view this. So this is really your improved universal inequality, and this is really the characterization of regularity as an equality for all vague limits. Anyway, and you have a same kind of characterizations. I'll stop there. And thank you. We might have time for one question in the future. So I have many, but I'll go with one. So these results of the Schringer operator that you shared with us at the beginning, how stable are they under perturbations or these small O's that you get in these two terms and studies, how do they get them under feet itself? So yeah, so any time. Time, so the way we viewed this is anytime you have little low, it's not really set up to have any kind of uniformity. So anytime you see a little O, run away from it, kind of expand by an extra term, then have a big O here. That big O is going to be good. So for example, if you look at how, you know, the way that this asymptotics is derived for Is derived for say V having a Lebesgue point at X. It's really that this is a more foundational statement, and from this statement, it then becomes an exercise to see if V is a Lebesgue point, then this holds. So that this implies this is a measure theory exercise, right? But this is maybe this is a better, more robust statement. And so similarly, we expand it this way precisely because this little logo was not. Because this little O was not good enough. This big O will have good. Right, this big O, it's not written explicitly, but this big O is then stable, yes. It's really the truth that you can expand further and further and get more and more integral terms. And you can be stubborn and expand more with more integral terms. And so at some point, you know, if you're willing to put up with factors of k, then you have, if the factor of k is satisfactory for you, then it's true. And let's let's think uh with the way that okay. Yeah, I'll take a minute to switch to the uh other
