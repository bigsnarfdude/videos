I would like to start by thanking the organizers for the invitation to participate in this workshop. Of course, I would have preferred to be on site in your beautiful city, but it's great to be able to participate remotely. So my talk today will be about the different properties of anti-coherent spin states, which I will define in a moment. And this presentation should be seen as... And this presentation should be seen as a kind of overview of my various works on the subject, resulting from many collaborations with PhD students but also with colleagues from University of Liège, Parisud, Tübingen and York. So before I get to the heart of the matter, let me stress that a central tool in all this work is the Mayo Ranas representation, also called stellar representation. Representation, also called stellar representation of spin states, which gives a geometric picture of spin states where the notions of symmetry, geometric phase, topology become relevant. But today, my aim is also to show you that there's more than that to my honest presentation because it also gives access to all the toolbox of quantum information theory, as we shall see. So now let's come back to anti-coherent spin states. What are these states? I will speak also about AC states to be short. They are defined in contrast to coherent spin states. And a coherent spin state is itself defined as an eigenstate of a component along a certain direction n of the spin with the highest eigenstate. spin with the highest eigenvalue jh bar so as you can see a coherent spin state as a preferred direction in space and this is why these states are often called the most classical spin states in contrast ac states or anti-korean spin states are defined as the states characterized by a vanishing spin expectation value Expectation value so that there is no longer a preferred direction in space for the spin. And more precisely, one can define anti-coherent spin states to different orders. So a spin state will be said to be anti-coherent to order t if all these moments of j dot n with order k ranging from one to t, the order of anticoherence. 1 to t, the order of anti-coherence, are independent of the direction n. So if all these expectation values do not depend on n, on the direction, the state will be anti-coherent to order t according to this definition. So let me start by giving some examples, maybe. I will work in the standard angular momentum basis, JM, and in this basis, the Schrödinger cat state, which is a super. A cat state, which is a superposition of a spin coherent state pointing upwards and a spin coherent state pointing downwards, is one anti-coherent because the expectation value of the spin is zero in the state for any value of the spin quantum number. Another example is given by this D key state, J0, which is also one anti-coherent for all integer values of the spin quantum number. Quantum number. Now, if we go back to the definition, we see that the definition involves a continuous parameter, which is this direction vector n. But in our work, we managed to reduce the conditions of NT coherence to a finite number of conditions in terms of expectation values. There are, in fact, t plus one squared minus one condition for. Square at minus one condition for anti-coherence to order t. And if you work out these conditions, then you find back that for a state to be one anti-coherent, the expectation value of j should vanish. And for example, for a state to be two anti-coherent, in addition to the first condition, the variance of the spin components should not depend on the direction. So the variance should be. So, the variance should be isotropic. And so, you see that the notion of anti-coherence is somehow related to the notion of isotropy of a pure spin state to some degree. If you look at these conditions, then you immediately see that they are non-linear in the state, they are quadratic in Xi J. So, one question that I was So, one question that arises is: to what order a spin-j state can be anticoherent? And in this plot, I show the maximal order of anti-coherence as a function of 2j, where j is the spin quantum number. For example, when j is equal to five, two j is equal to ten, and the maximal order of anticoherence is three. For j equals six, it is five, and so and so on. It is five, and so and so on. This maximal order has been determined independently by myself and by Marcus Grassel in an other context with other techniques. But in any case, our results are consistent and show that the maximal order achievable for a spin j state grows like two times the. Grows like two times the square root of j. So it grows with the spin quantum number, but it grows only as the square root. Okay. After inspection of all these orders as a function of j, it has been observed that there was some relationship with the existence of spherical design in three dimensions. I won't go much more into details. If you have questions, you can. Into details. If you have questions, you can ask them after the talk. So I will move on. So, what we are considering are single spins of arbitrary quantum number J. And in this study, as I said at the beginning of my talk, one can gain additional insights by using the Mayorana representation, which is based on the one-to-one correspondence between single-spin. Between single spin J states and permutation invariant or symmetric states of many spins, 2 J spins, or qubits. In this particular mapping, the spin operators belonging to the single spin correspond to collective spin operators in the multi-qubit system. The standard basis, the standard angular momentum basis corresponds to the symmetric DQ basis. Dickey bases and the full Hilbert space for the spin corresponds to the symmetric subspace of the multi-qubit system. In addition, we have that spin coherent states correspond to symmetric separable states, which means that all these individual spins all point in the same direction. This is what we call a coherent state. We also have that. We also have that a rotation in spin space corresponds to a symmetric local unitary transformation in the symmetric subspace. And what we have shown is that in this picture, anti-coherent spin states in fact correspond to maximally entangled symmetric states. So you might ask what kind of maximal entanglement is this? Let me explain. Is this? Let me explain it in a bit more detail. Suppose you have a symmetric state, psi s of n qubits. Then you can compute its t qubits reduced density matrix. This is the state of t qubits only out of the n qubits. This state, rho t can range from a pure state to a maximally mixed state in the symmetric. A maximally mixed state in the symmetric sector. By the way, because the original state ψ is symmetric, all reduced density matrices of T qubits are identical. So we only speak of one, which is rho T. So let us consider these two extreme cases when Rho T is pure or when Rho T is maximally mixed in the symmetric substrates. Substrates. And for this, we need to consider that ψ is, for example, a coherent spin state. We have seen that a coherent spin state corresponds, in fact, to a symmetric separable state, a product state. But for a product state, all subsystems are themselves in a product state because there is no entanglement. And we end up with a coherent state for rho T, a pure state. Pure state because there is no entanglement, and this is also a reason why spin-coherence states are called the most classical in a sense because there is no entanglement between the qubits in this case. What we have shown is that if you take as state psi as an anti-coherence pin state of order t, then the state roti that you compute is Compute is in fact maximally mixed in the symmetric sector, which means that the original state ψ is maximally entangled with respect to some bipartition, the k n minus k bipartition with k that can range from 1 to t, the order of anti-coherence. So in this case, we have maximal entanglement and we have thus maximally non-classical spin. Non-classical spin states, so to say. This is a bit related to the notion of absolutely maximally entangled states that were discussed by Carol earlier this week. So in a sense, anti-coherent spin states can be seen as extremal symmetric multi-qubit quantum states. Of course, this is only one possible characterization of Characterization of anti-coherent spin states. There are other characterizations that can be given. And one insightful characterization is based on the multipolar expansion of the density matrix of a spin state. So if we now work in the multipole operator basis, which is the equivalent, the operator equivalent of the spherical harmonics. Then any spin state can be expanded as follows, where rho zero is the maximally mixed state and where these coefficients, rho lm, are the state multiples of rho, of the global state. Now, in this particular representation, what we have shown is that anti-currion spin states quite naturally correspond to states for which the state Correspond to states for which the state multiples with L from 1 to T are equal to 0. So, in fact, this means that the angular dependence of the state, the low degree angular dependence of the state, is somehow lost or hidden. And so the isotropy of rho is high if the order is high. Order is high. Okay, now that we have characterized anti-coherence in different manners, we can ask ourselves how it can be quantified, this anticoherence of spin states. And to this end, I will now introduce the notion of measure of anticoherence. What I will call a measure of anticoherence to order t for pure states is a real function a t. function A t of the states psi which satisfies this minimal set of requirements. First, the measure should range from zero to one. It should be zero only for coherent states and should be maximal only for anti-coherent states to order T. And finally, I also ask that the measure be invariant under rotation. Invariant under rotations of the spin. Okay, according to this basic definition and what we have seen before, a measure of anti-coherence can somehow be seen as a measure of isotropy of a spin state at a given order in a multipole expansion, or it can also be seen as a measure in another context as a measure of hidden polarization. As a measure of hidden polarization in multi-photon states, because multi-photon states are bosonic states, so symmetric states of qubits in the end. Now, let me show you some measures that satisfy this criteria. A first measure, a simple measure that we can construct, is based on the linear entropy of entanglement. The linear entropy of entanglement of psi for a given bipartition, which is the T n minus T bipartition. We know that this entanglement entropy is zero for coherent states, as we have seen before. We also know that this entropy of entanglement is maximal for anti-coherent states. And so, what we only need to do is to rescale this linear entropy to be between zero and To be between zero and one, and we will have a proper measure of anticoherence. This is what we call the purity-based measure of anti-coherence. It depends only on the purity of rho t, the reduced state of t qubits out of the n qubits. And this purity can be expressed in different ways. For example, it can be expressed in For example, it can be expressed in terms of expansion coefficients of the spin state in the standard angular momentum basis, but it also can be expressed in terms of expectation values of spin operators, like it's shown here for t equals one, t equals two, or it can even be expressed in terms of state multiples that I've introduced just before in terms of these rho lm coefficients. These rho lm coefficients. So there are different types, different ways of computing this purity-based measure of anti-currents, which is very easily computable. But this is only one example, of course. And a more systematic way to construct measures of ND coherence is to use distances between density operators having the property of invariant. Having the property of invariance under unitary transformations. So let me explain this. A measure of anticoherence, A, T, with respect to a given distance, D, can be defined as follows, as a linear function of the distance, D between the reduced state, Rho T, and the maximally mixed state in the symmetric sector, where D can be any. Where D can be any distance, for example, the trace distance, the Hilbert Schmidt distance, the birth distance. And as you can see, using these standard distances, it is very easy to obtain a simple expression of these measures in terms of the eigenvalues lambda i of rho t, of the radius state rho t. Now, of all these measures, only one seems to Only one seems to satisfy an additional property that comes on top of these requirements. And this additional property is the monotonicity in T, the fact that we can also ask an additional condition, which is that a state is always more anti-coherent to order T than to higher orders. Order D than to high orders because high orders of anti-coherence correspond to higher orders of isotropy. And so this is a quite natural condition that we could impose, but in fact, it seems only to be satisfied by this birth distance measure of anti-coherence. Okay, by the way, this is only a conjecture that is well supported by numerics, but it has not been. It has not been proven yet. Okay, let us now move on and talk about the potential applications of anti-coherent states because of their remarkable properties, as we have seen. There are many of them. I will try to illustrate some of them, but as you can see, the list is long. I will start by discussing the specific role of AC. Specific role of AC states in the theory of entanglement classes. Okay, and in this theory, an important concept is the notion of SLOCC class. So if you take two states, two multi-qubit states, psi and phi, they are said to belong to the same SLOCC entanglement class if they can be related by some inverted. Related by some invertible local operation. Now, in operational terms, this means that these two states can be interconverted by means of local operations and classical communications with some non-vanishing probability of success. This is why we have this S, which stands for stochastic. Now, it turns out that the Hilbert space associated to a multi-qubit system can be Quit system can be seen as the union of all its SLOCC classes, and in almost every of these SLOCC classes, there exists up to local unitaries a unique state denoted by psi C, which is called normal form by Berstrade and critical state by Guru and Valer. And this critical state is characterized by the fact that it's one By the fact that it's one qubit reduced density matrix is maximally mixed. And so, what this means is that if the critical state belongs to the symmetric subspace of our multi-qubit system, then it should correspond to some one anti-coherent spin state in the spin picture. And what we know from this theory of entanglement classes is that this state is then. Is that this state is then unique up to rotation in its SLOCC class? So, in the end, you see that AC states are natural representatives of the SLOCC class and that this special classification gives us a way of identifying all inequivalent AC spin states, whereby inequivalent I mean states that are really not. States that are really not connected by a simple rotation of the spin. So, this is what we did for the smallest value of J. Now, to discuss this, I need first to introduce in more detail Mayer NAS representation of spin state. So, I will discuss that now. The main point of Mayer NAS representation is to realize that any space. Is to realize that any spin state is in fact equivalent to a symmetric n-qubit state, ψs, which itself can be represented in terms of any single qubit state, these states phi i, which are shown here, and where the sum here runs over all the permutations of the n qubits. But as we know, a single qubit state can be represented. A single qubit state can be represented on the block sphere by a point, and so this means that any symmetric state can be represented by n points on the block sphere. So, in the end, a spin state can be visualized as a constellation of points on this block or Riemann sphere. So, this is clearly a geometric representation. In this representation, a coherent spin state or symmetric separate. And spin state or symmetric separable state will be represented by n degenerate points. But as soon as two points are different on the block sphere, then this means that the state is necessarily entangled. It cannot be coherent. Okay, let me go back now to the SLOCC classification of AC states, and I will start with the easy cases of. The easy cases of j equals one and j equals three half, which corresponds to two qubits and three qubits in a symmetric state. Why is it easy in this case? Because for a two qubits, it is known that there is only one SLOCC class that contains entangled states, and one representative state of this class is the Bell state, which is one anti-coherent, and it's the unique. And it's the unique one-anti-coherent state up to rotations for j equals one. For j equals three-half, so three qubits, we know from the work of Dieu, Vidal and Sirac that there are two SLOCC classes containing entangled states, the W class and the GG class. But out of these two, only the GG class contains an anti-coherent spin state, which is Which is the G G state, which is depicted here in the Major representation. So it's quite easy because both for J equals one and three half, the AC states are unique. There is only one anti-coherent state up to rotations. Now, things are much more complicated for cube. For four qubits for J equals two, because in this case, the number of SLOCC classes containing antigraph spin states is infinite. So we go from one and two SLOCC class to an infinite number of such classes for four qubits. So what we managed to do is to find for each of these classes containing AC states, AC states, a representative state that we parametrized by some complex number μ that you can see here, which labels the class, in fact. And if you look at this state in the Meyerhana representation, then it is represented by four points displaying a dehedral D2 symmetry, which means that there are two symmetry axes, like it is shown here, of order two. Is shown here of order two. Out of this infinite number of inequivalent anti-coherent spin states of spin quantum number j equals two, there is in fact only one which is also anticoherence to order two, to an higher order of anti-coherence. And this particular state is the famous tetrahedron state, where the Majorna points are at the apex. Are at the apex of regular tetrahedron. So, for this state, and only for this state, we have that the spin expectation value is zero, but also that the variance on the spin components are equal for all directions, for all components. Okay, let us summarize. So far, all All anti-quariant states that we have encountered, the Bell state, the GG state, the four qubits, AC states, had a particular point group symmetry. And this is precisely what motivated us to investigate in a bit more detail, in a general way, so to say, the consequences of a point group symmetry of the constellation on the anti-coherence of splin states. Of spin states. And what we have shown is that the hedgehog, the N, rotation reflection symmetry, and in particular inversion, and cyclic symmetry with an orthogonal symmetry plane of the constellation, all these symmetries imply that the corresponding spin state is anti-coherent to order one. For the particular case of a cyclic symmetry or cyclic symmetry, Cyclic symmetry or cyclic symmetry with a vertical symmetry plane, we could not conclude, which means that the state might be anti-coherent, but does not need to be anticoherent. So indeed, you can see that some types of symmetries in the Mayorana representation imply anti-coherence. But I would also like to stress that it is possible to find states with no symmetries in the constellation. Symmetries in the constellation, but which are nevertheless anti-coherent. So, this is not the whole story. Okay, I will now briefly discuss the usefulness of AC states for measuring rotations. For example, as when a spin is subjected to a magnetic field, we know that within the framework of quantum mechanics, the quantum mechanics The quantum Fischer information is the relevant quantity that constrains the achievable precision in parameter estimation via the quantum Kramer-Rayer bound. In our case, the parameter can be the strength of the magnetic field in which the spin is immersed, or it can be its direction. What we also know is that the quantum Fischer information in the case of pure state and for a rotation. And for a rotation of the spin is simply given by the variance of the spin components. So, what has been shown is that when the direction of the magnetic field is known, then the state which is optimal to estimate the magnetic field strength is the GG state, because this is the state that will give the largest. Gives that will give the larger quantum fission information and thus the highest sensitivity. Now, when the field has an unknown direction, what has been shown is that the states that become optimal are then anti-coherent spin states to order two. So, what this means is that these two anti-coherent states ensure an Ensure an Eisenbeck limited precision scaling regardless of the magnetic field direction, which is fixed but not known. Moreover, it has also been shown that the same states, so anti-coin spin states to order two, are optimal when one wants to simultaneously measure all three Euler angles of rotation. So you can see that for both For both for these two cases, the GHG states are not optimal, but these are the coherent states that are optimal. Okay, now another way at looking at the sensitivity of spin states to rotations is to consider, as was first done in this work of Chrisomarakos and Anderscore Nado, is to consider the fidelity. Is to consider the fidelity between the spin state psi and its image under a rotation of angle eta about an axis n. And then this fidelity should be averaged over all possible direction of the rotation axis. Why consider the fidelity? Because it turns out to be directly measurable in experiments. For example, you can have a look at. For example, you can have a look at this work where they measure the fidelity. And with this definition, the goal will be to find the state psi, which for a given angle eta will minimize this average fidelity. In other words, we are searching for a state which will change the most on average after... Change the most on average after a rotation because this fidelity should be minimized over all possible axis of rotations. Okay, these optimal states have been found up to J equals 2 in this first work and later we have generalized these results in our quantum paper, where we have shown that the average fidelity can be conveniently expressed in terms of measures. Expressed in terms of measures of anti-coherence. And with this expression, we could show in a very general manner that the states minimizing this average fidelity at small angles of rotations are always the most antiquary in spin states. Here I show an example for J equals 3. You see on the top panel in red, the minimal achievable average. The minimal achievable average fidelity as a function of the angle of rotation eta. And in the bottom panel, I show the measures of anti-coherence to order one, two, and three. And what one can see is that for small angle of rotations, angle of rotations comprised between zero and this value, the optimal state is the tree anti-coherent state, which has Which has a Major representation with points at the vertices of an eigosa hedron, as shown here. Okay, now I will spend the end of my presentation on the dynamical aspects of AC states. First, what we have studied is the decoherence of these AC states, and in fact, of arbitrary spin states. And in fact, of arbitrary spin states, motivated by questions about the scaling of the decoherence rate with the spin quantum number, with the order of anti-coherence, but also motivated by work on quantum speed limits for dissipative quantum dynamics. So, our model is simple, is a simple depolarization Markovian model as described by the Lindbert-Master equation. The Lindbert-Master equation, as you can see here, where we account for depolarization in the three spatial direction with a priori different rates along the z-axis, gamma z and perpendicular to this axis. In this case, it is possible to find analytical solutions to this master equation for arbitrary value of the spin quantum number in the multiple. spin quantum number in the multiple operator basis. And what we find is that the state multiples decay exponentially with some decay rate given by this expression. And if you wait long enough, then the stationary state of the spin turns out to be always the maximally mixed state. So the spin ends up completely depolarized in this model. Completely depolarized in this model. So, with this model, we have shown that in the case of isotropic depolarization, so when all the rates are equal, the states that are the most decoherent, the most fragile, are precisely these anti-coin spin states. They are the states featuring the largest purity loss rate. And in fact, for a pure state, we could express the We could express the purity loss rates at the initial time as a function of the measure of anti-coherence to order one of the state psi. And what you can see from this expression is that the phenomenon of super decoherence, which is attributed to a purity loss rate that scales like n squared, where n is the number of. like n squared, where n is the number of spins, is directly related to the measure of anti-coherence of the spin state. We could also generalize this result to arbitrary mixed states, where now the coefficient in front of this n squared is given by this expression, which can only be positive for entangled states, which in this case highlights a connection between super decoherence and Super decoherence and an entanglement. This connection is completely absent in the super radiance, but it seems to be always present in super decoherence. What we also could show is that the long time behavior of the purity is dictated by higher orders of anti-coherence, not only anticoherence to order. anticoherence to order one but also by higher measures higher order measures of anticoherence okay now i will conclude this presentation with a few slides uh on the preparation of uh anti-korean spin states in the lab even if this may seem a bit far removed from the from the theme of the workshop it's fun so i will i will spend a few minutes on that I will spend a few minutes on that. First of all, one should know that anti-coherent spin states up to order five have actually already been produced experimentally with light. So in this context, the Stokes operator that one can associate with quantum light play the same role as the angular momentum operators of a spin. And in the And in the experiment of 2017, the AC states were prepared in the orbital angular momentum states of single photons by means of spatial light modulators, as you can see in this setup. And what was measured in the experiment was the fidelity, in fact, this observable, which is the projector onto the initial state. So for light, ACC. Light AC states have been produced up to order five, but of course, it will also be interesting to be able to produce AC states with real spins. For example, the spins of cold magnetic atoms like strontium, which has a spin quantum number nine-half, or dysprosium used in Paris, which has a spin quantum number eight. Number eight. And so to find protocols capable of producing these AC states, what we have used is optimal control techniques. And in particular, quantum optimal control. What is it? It is essentially a technique that attempts to steer a quantum system to a target state. In our case, the target state will be an anti-coin spin state. In spin state by finding optimal control parameters in the system Hamiltonian. Our system Hamiltonian or control Hamiltonian has this particular form. It has a first term that describes a rotation, a variable rotation in time, and a second term that describes a squeezing along a fixed direction x. Why do we consider this particular type of control Hamiltonian? Because it is easily improved. It is easily implementable in the lab. It's as simple as that. But there is also another reason why we use this type of control Hamiltonian, because it is somewhat inspired by the workings of classical ironwork. So what we are trying to do is to do quantum ironwork. The idea is that by appropriately rotating a piece of metal and squeezing it in a Metal and squeezing it in a fixed direction, it is in principle possible to obtain any desired shape. In our case, we are not dealing with a piece of metal, but with a quantum state, but the idea is basically the same. What we are trying to maximize is the quantum fidelity. So, the fidelity between the final state and the initial and the target state, which is the antique spin state. So, I will just end. So, I will just end my talk with two short animations, which show that we can indeed produce antigraph spin states with appropriate control parameters. So, in the top left panel, you can see the Houzimi function of the spin state as a function of time. In the upper right panel, you can see the minus. Right panel, you can see the Meyer representation of the spin state. And in the bottom panel, you can see the controls, the two rotations along the y-axis and the z-axis, together with the fidelity, which ends up very close to one, which means that we manage to produce the trahedron state in this case. And I have also the animation for higher spin quantum numbers, where here we are producing an anti-correlation. An anti-Korean state to order five with appropriate controls. So you can clearly see the effect of the squeezing here along the x-axis on the Houzimi function. And at the end, we managed to produce this particular state. And with that, I'm done. I thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, John, for an excellent talk. Any questions? Questions? Hi, John. This is Ugnan from Brussels. Hi. Thanks for that clean. Thanks for that clean and nice talk. I wanted, when you described the measures of anti-coherence, I was wondering, so maybe I got slightly distracted at an important point, that's why I want to come back to this. Do these measures somehow, I mean, a measure is expected to somehow compare the level of anti-coherence, right? In a sense, one would maybe, I mean, here you only demand invariance, you demand the extreme. You demand the extremal kind of values for the measure on the sets that we know are fully coherent or fully anti-coherent. Maybe I missed that. Did you kind of motivate somehow these measures to be monotonic in somehow capture increase of anti-coherence in a certain way? So, yeah, this point, I guess it is related to this. It is related to this conjecture about the bus distance measure of anti-current. So, indeed, you could ask, of course, that as the order increases, the measure should decrease. You cannot be more two anti-coherent than you are one anti-coherent because two anti-coherence implies one anti-coherence. So, this is indeed a condition and that. This is indeed a condition, an additional condition that could be imposed, but it turns out that there are very few measures that satisfy this monotonicity in T, in the order T. And the only one that seems to satisfy it, in fact, we could not prove it. It seems to satisfy it. It's supported by the NURICS, but we could not prove it so far. Okay, I wonder if there is anything like no per you know, like. Anything like, for example, measures of entanglement, like the types you mentioned, you know, they're also entanglement monotones, you know, that they also don't increase under certain operations. And I wonder, okay, you spoke about SLOCC, which is a bit different, but still, I wonder whether in this context there exists a sense in which one could try to define by means of some kind of transformations, free operations. Three operations, what is more coherent than what? Yes, that would be interesting to investigate the connection with all these entanglement measures. But for example, this inequality about the burst measure of anti-coherence could be seen to derive simply from the contrast. From the contractivity property of the burst distance, but this is not the case. This is more subtle. But anyway, I agree with you that the connection with measures of entanglement could be clarified. Any other question? I have a question. What's the physical mechanism you're Mechanism: You're modeling with this depolarization master equation. You have how does this thing happen in nature, so to speak? Yeah, for example, if your spin is submitted to some fluctuating magnetic field, then its time evolution will be dictated by this Lind-Bloodmaster equation. This is one example. This is one example. Sorry, fluctuating magnetic field. What does that mean? Yeah, this means that the direction of the magnetic field is constantly varying. It's just noise. But in that case, the field just instantaneously rotates around the instantaneous magnetic field. There is, I mean, the the shape of the const of the constellation does not change, it just rotates. Constellation does not change, it just rotates. Correct? No, here we consider that the spin is an open quantum system, so it is no longer described by a pure state, but should be described by a mixed state. So it's a bit different. We can no longer speak of only one constellation to describe the state, it's really. The state, it's really dissipative dynamics, quantum dynamics in this case. That we're you have an evolution of the shape also of the of the state. Yeah, you could use a generalization of the Mayohana representation to mixed states, which has been which has been invented, but we did not this we we only focused on the We only focused on the purity of the state. There is only connection, the only connection we make with anti-coherence is via these measures of anti-coherence, but we are not speaking of a geometric representation of the states. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any more questions? Yes. Yes. Hi. And my question is about the control problem and how can we find the parameters of the control Hamiltonian from the target state? Yeah. This is in fact an algorithm, a well-known algorithm that uses gradient descent. That uses gradient descent, like for example, is used to train artificial neural networks. So it's quite standard. The idea is that you... Yeah. Sorry, then it's possible always to start with the coherent state with all stars at the same point and then it's like a standardized process. Yeah, it has been shown that there is a It has been shown that there is a theory paper that shows that you can reach any state starting from a coherent state with this type of Hamiltonian. So this Hamiltonian is enough to reach any state starting from some coherent state. This has been shown. This is proven. This is proven. So the only difficulty is to find the right controls that will fulfill this. And do you have any estimate of the time it takes to reach a particular state? This is ongoing work, to be honest. So this is what's Be honest. So, this is what we're studying right now: what is the minimal time needed to produce some anti-coherent state? We will also study the effect of decoherence on this preparation, because in real experiments, you always have some level of decoherence. So, this is ongoing work. I cannot answer your question right now. Right now. Any more questions? Okay, let's uh thank our speaker again.
