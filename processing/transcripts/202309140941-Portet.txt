remind you so the intermediate filament protein or tissue dependent and also depend on the development. So in short, what we can say is we are going to have expression of imantin in fibrograph, ultracyte and so on and in epidemiologic cell we are going to have more catin and so on. However, all these proteins share the same concept, so that is going to be the So, that is going to be the monomer for an intermediate filament protein. And so, this port is conserved over all, I think, the IF protein. However, the tail, the A and the F and the tail are going to be variable. And we are going to see that is going to be important later. And they are going to form a phenomenon. So, if I manage to have time. If I manage to have time, I'm going to present first something in vitro. So, how the filaments are going to really assemble and elongate. And after, maybe, if I manage to be fast enough, I will speak about how finally the network organizes under intracellular transport. And so, I started this work a long time ago and working with Ara Derman and Northern Mucke. And not very muxeur. So, in here, the first question was more how we also is in between, okay? Not in the frame. So, for me, it's in between the two. But, and so the question was how are we all going to have this elongation of filament? And so, for the experimental data, they put uh in the soup some uh free fi uh Purify protein, and over the time they observe the form, the assembly of filament, and they elongate. And so, we are going to do that using different microscopic methods, so electronic scan force microscopy, so a lot of different things. And so, what type of data I'm going to use in here? Going to be first the how the middle of How the middle length of fioma evolved in time, but also after the distribution of length. And so, using this type of data, what could we learn when we compare that to mathematical models? I think and micron. I think so. Ah, yeah. I have to look. Okay, so I will go back in case check that. Okay, so the first work we did along in 2007, so we were only using at this time as data how the mean length of Philaman evolved, and so that we were at this time working only with Pinot. And so we And so we use so always what I'm doing, I'm going to try to have several scenarios and I compare the scenario to the data and after I use some criterion to try to evaluate the goodness of the fit but also the simplicity. I'm sorry I'm a mathematician so I want to have the simplest model as possible to explain the data. Okay and so in short what we observe In short, what we observe is, so first we have tetramer, we have a first lateral aggregation and after a few seconds we're all going to have the formation of what we call a ULF, a unit length filament. And this unit length filament is a 32 mer. Okay? And after that, we are going to add the uh so The lateral aggregation and after longitudinal anime. So, meaning we are going to have a filament that is going to fuse with a ULF and we are going to have something longer. However, with this study, what we managed to show is if we have not the filament anime, we cannot see the elongation of the Elongation of the filament as in the data. And so it was like in 2007 and so at the beginning, so we had some problem to publish this one because people were saying like, okay, the physiology, how how the the the end of Fiona are going to find each other and we refuse and so on. However, two years later he was shown in cell Was shown in cell, and so in here you really have the adding of two filaments, and there is no cross-linker. Okay, so it just only called adding is two filaments or not? Yeah, the end. Okay, and after, so in here we were using only the dynamic of the min length, but we have also the dynamic of the Also, the dynamic of the distribution. So, we have at several points, we have the distribution of mass of cinema. And in here, we have seen, so this lateral aggregation, in fact, the formation of the ULS happen in the first one, three seconds. So, after that, what we did, we assume we are going to have a model that is going to only Going to only try to look at this longitudinal anoding and how we can explain this longitudinal anoding. And so for the model, we are going to have just for the smallest thing are going to be the ULF. And after we are going to assume a ULF can fuse with another ULF, ULF and Philaman, and Philaman and Silaman. And in the model, we are just going to assume, so a filament of less. And so a filament of length I can merge with a filament of length J and we are going to have this one. And what is important in here is going to be this constant of association. Yeah? But so you also don't have guys breaking apart as well. No, so that is so. Just my next thing. In here, what we are going to have, because so we are going So, we are going to have this constant of association that are going to depend on two things. So, a K0 that is going to be a three-factor, the unique, the unique parameter, three parameter of the model. And after we are going to have some KIG that are going to depend on the length of filament. Now, so I'm using a Shmolyshowski equation to Equation to follow and to create my distribution of length. But in here, I just put coagulation. I don't have any fragmentation because, so in the lab, they did not observe any fragmentation. Instead, you do have fragmentation, these are family and so on, but that is a consequence of a post-consumption. Of a post-transactional modification. So you need the interaction with a kinetic or something more. Okay? But in here, no, we have only so pure coagulation. And the work in here, and so we have this more resource key and discrete because we managed to transform our length into a number of ULF. We know exactly, so we have some entire digital. So we have some entire vegetation for the ULF and we know exact well. We know the contribution when you add one ULF to the length of the phenomena and taking into account this entire this distribution. And so now the big question is, okay, that is a Okay, that is a free parameter. We are going to estimate that by fitting the data. However, what is this flow? What is this KH? So in here, so I'm going to, so the product between, and so you see this one is going to be applicable to all of them, the same way, a unit one. And so this presenter. And for the KIG, so in here I assume I assume so that is going to be diffusion control. And so, to find an expression depending on the length of the two filaments that are going to interact, I'm going to need to specify the property of my object. So, yes, I have the size, but also what type of how I'm going to represent that. Because if I represent my intermediate phenomena as the overcooked package, As an overcooked spaghetti or uncooked spaghetti, we are not going to get the same TIG. And in here, in fact, it took me a long time to find something that was going to work. And after in 2009, I was working with a distribution of length of V mantin up to twenty minutes. And to represent that, And to represent that, I will have just a stiff approximation representation of, so I should say, if I represent my filament as a stiff row, it was working. Okay? And we published that. One year later, we got data using TERF. Now we have a different from before. Two hours and four hours. And there, And there, the model using the KEG with a stiff representation for the filament totally failed. However, I was able to represent the data with some description as factual for the protein. Finally, we try We try to we manage to reuse the approach we developed in these two things. And it was developed for DNA. And so now we are going to have a KG that is going to accommodate stiff and flexible. So we are going to have some semi-flexible polymer representation. And so now the KEG depends on the The Keg depends on the length of the protein of the polymer, but also the persistent length. And that is good because if I want to play with different intermediate filament protein, you find so keratin have a persistent length of that and desmine and vimantin something else. So hopefully I'm going to get, I'm going to be able to use this model to represent different types of protein. Okay? Protein. Okay, and so now in here, I just because at the beginning I wanted to see what was going on and so on. So some details about the KEG when we have a representation for the filament as semi-flexible protein. So in here we calculate the KEG. So that is the length of the first filament and the second filament. And so for different Phenomena and so for different persistent maps. And so what, so at the beginning, you have the fission, the longitudinal handling of one ULF and another ULF. So that is obviously the faster. And after all, we have a decrease over the time, but not too much. And also, what is the effect of the person? Show what is the effect of the persistent length of this rate. And so, in here, in here, you are going to have the rate of association of one ULF and a filament of two and so on, five and twenty. And in here, the colour, the different curves, represent the rate where we. the rate where we when we have different persistent length. And so what we see, we have a small effect of the persistent length, but not too much. Okay, so now, now I want to see what is going to be because when I put different expressions of my KG in my Schmolushowski equation, I'm going to have different response and different distribution. And for first, I wanted to see First, I wanted to see, because we were putting this, and we see we do have a decrease of the rate with the length, but not too much. And so, I wanted to see if I just assume, in fact, we have no dependency on the length, what will be the response. And so, in here, so in red, you have, so again, mean length and the distribution of the length over time. Over time, and what we can see, in fact, the length marker only when the filaments are getting longer. And after that, I wanted to check what was the effect of the persistent length on the dynamic. So, again, mean length distribution. Okay, so we do have a small effect, we have seen we have an effect. Effect, we have seen we have an effect of the person length on the ray, so we're all going to have an effect on how the filament assembles. So we are all going to have longer the persistent length flow in the elongation. However, we have absolutely no effect on the shape of the distribution. And finally, And finally, in the model we have also this K0, and this KDE row, because it just applies uniformly to all the rate, we are going just to have this K0 just tune the D9. So if you increase the K0, you are just going to have a bit faster and nothing. Now, let's go back to the data. So in here, we are So in here we have desmin, vimantin, assemble in this buffer with this concentration. And I remind you, we have for vimantin and desmine the same consistent time. And in here, what I did is I fit the mean length of the dynamic of the mean length of the filament, and I don't. And I identify my K0. And after, when, so in here, you see, I just recovered this red line and this blue line. So just by fitting the mean length, I'm going to get, in fact, the good shape of the distribution. Now, if I do exactly the same thing with Keratin, Keratin, a different persistent length, in here, this date, this thing were a This day, this thing were assembled in another type of buffer, and the concentration was much smaller. And so, again, I fit the mean length dynamic, and I managed to recover the good shape of the distribution. So, in short, in here, what we can have is we can reproduce with this model, so ULF, ULF, ULF, Filament, Filament, Filament, longitudinal and link. Longitude dynamic handling, we can reproduce the dynamic of these three proteins. But if there is something else for me more interesting, I think, is seeing that I can recover the good shape. And so, that means there exists a specific probability or distribution probability for these minions. Mean length, these are names and so in here, be careful. Okay, question mark. So, I start after working with Ben Sadri in Eronga, and in this paper, in fact, he was approximating this data, so that is the mountain, and he was able to approximate the data. Was able to approximate the data by log normal distribution. And after, when I checked, so I did some statistic analysis, so and I compare the data with dot normal, gamma distribution, and exponential distribution. And it seems for these four five data points, the best probability distribution was the log normal. Okay, fine. So I was thinking like, okay, I spent 20. Thinking, like, okay, I spent 20 years of my life trying to find KEG, and in fact, just don't know more. Okay, now I say, okay, fine, I'm going to. So what I did is I take the data, I calibrate my Smoothowski coefficient with my KG. I find the issue, and I find, so that is going to be the So, that is going to be the black line. And after I try to fit on the solution of my dynamical system, a lot of normal. Ah, it works. So, but when after I compare the solution to my solution of the mechanistic model to the exponential distribution log normal and gas. Log normal and gamma. Yeah, so the exponential is out, but it's not clear if between the log normal and the gamma distribution, I'm not able to really distinguish what is the best model. But what is very interesting, for sure, in fact for me, I have a good move. But so when you estimate the two parameters of your log normal for each Load normal for each prime prompt, we all going to have some things that are going to be time dependent. And look at that. So when I fit all, so there is maybe something else. There is maybe a kind of relationship how finally the mean and the spread evolve over time for the inner. Okay, now if we Okay, now if we go back a little bit to the biology and why that could be interesting. Now, so I have my K0 and now I'm going to have the effective rate, so K0 times the KIG. And so in here look at, oh, for the V-malt gene, we were there, the desmine here, and the keratin here. And so, remember, desmine and V-maltin. Desmine and V-mantin, so have were in the same condition, same buffer, same concentration, protein concentration, and they have the same cursor. But this one, for the keratin, it was 40 times lower for the concentration and in a different button. So I don't know if we can. But so, if we want to try to understand what We want to try to understand what are the differences in this thing. If we go back a little bit to the right, we know the V-mounting, so in here, between there and there, we have about death mean is about six times faster than this one, the V-nante. But we know they are the same cage. The same cage. So the differences come from the K0. So now, remember your question yesterday? So in the K0, I put under the rub all the electrostatic work and wrong. And when they merge, there is this little tail and little head. And so all the All the activity of this little thing comes in here. So, in here, I do need the length of the filament, I need the persistent length, but what matters is what is not really described in the word. So, it's finally every other. And okay, so but So, but at least what we can do with this model is we can compare the assembly kinetics of different buffers. So, for example, in here you have, so if you just look at how the death mean in this concentration assembled in this buffer or this buffer, you see you all going to have an effect of the buffer and you can quite Buffer and you can quantify that. So in here, you go three times faster in this one than in this one. Something else, so you also can play with the ionic strength. So you can put more fault or now, so that is not published yet. Also with the model, I'm able to, in fact, reproduce the so I can use not only I can use not only on the distribution of length, but also on the intensity of light scattering. And so, with this, ah, yes, that now something I'm not sure. If I so that is the mountain again, so from ten. So from 10 per second minute 2 hours 4 hours. If I fit, if I find my k0 by fitting the mean length up to 30 minutes, I find that. If I fit the dynamic of the mean length up to 4 hours, I find something slower. I find something slower, smaller. And so we do have, it seems, a slowdown. So now, again, I don't know if that is really true, because these two data points, two and four, they were done with thirds. And that AFL. So it might be something. It might be something else. It might be something else. Or lately, so in fact since last, this year, Cecile de Duc from Muno Institute, she finds she can have fragmentation. However, for her, she was working, so her first time point was one hour after six, eight, twenty, twenty-four hours. 24 hours. So we are not working on the same time scale. So if I don't, at least for me, I do not need the fragmentation. So to go back to your, because again, simpler model as possible. I do not need the fragmentation to represent my data, but maybe, I don't know, after some set. I don't know. After some fail uh in the data uh it was maybe too many uh oh more um label on the on the filament. So maybe it's for the I don't know okay. So in short in short for the conclusion of this one we have a model now that is going to be able to represent different Intermediate filament depends on the contour length and the persistent length, but that finally is not the most important, but is necessary. And so we can look at the vision dynamic. And but so what is important is what finally is in the soup and what going to change the Is okay there. Okay? And yeah, we can accommodate mean length distribution and light scattering day. Okay, how many? 12 minutes to the hard stuff. Talk about it. Okay, so let's see if I can show you a little bit of uh now in the set. Okay, now I think everybody knows. So now this work all done in a party, uh Paris. So, all the experimental data are done in PAFI, Etel Menville in Palestine, and Loduk in Mononau. And so, the question was, it's more like, okay. Now, I have in a cell, I look at astro science, and in here, the cell is on a circular population. And in here, we all going to observe resonance of the mantra. When they silence the Silence the kinesin. So, kinesin, remember, kinesin is they go from the center to the periphery. Oh, that is my mathematical formalization. Everything is simple in my life. And so the kinasin goes there. If you silence them, all the demantin is stuck in the middle. Now they s silence the DNA. The DNA do the opposite. They go from here to here. They go from here to here, and in this case, everything is there. And now they dissolve the trap, they dissolve the microtubule, so no more motor protein, so sorry, intermediate now. Microtubule dependent motor, but we still have in here so acting dependent transport, and in here we have everything that if we wait long enough. If we wait long enough. So here we add the distribution of V19 in FEM depends on transport induced by microtubule and also actin. In a first work, we first look at what is going on when we have just some actin-dependent transport. And so in here, we have our cell and at the time. And at time zero. And after we inject some no-codazole, and so we dissolve, and we look how the radial profile of V-mantine evolves over time. So that is before injection of nucodadol. And step by step, you see we have a kind of stabilization of our vimantine. And so in here, we start, I think, after four hours. After four hours. And so, at the beginning, we were assuming we all just going to have a kind of advection, so just push by the acting induced transport. And at the beginning, we were assuming everything can move. And we were stuck. We had to split our material between so some port can be mobile and some port can be must be immobile. Must be immobile. And we are going to switch between these two bit. And so going from mobile to immobile, we are just going to assume as the material is at that, he gets attached, I don't know, anchor to something. And otherwise, he cannot throw it. So we were going again to consider 10 or 11, we had more, but scenarios with different Scenarios with different combinations of assumptions about: okay, I can get trapped, I cannot get trapped, I can really detach, I cannot detach, sorry. And for the advection velocity, for the velocity of the actin that is going to drive the organization of the V-mantin, are going to assume so constant over the cell, or it's going to space the or it's going to be space dependent or I'm going to have something that is going to depend on the material I just function. And the best scenario is when we have so as the material is moved, it gets trapped and immobilized, so irreversible trapping, and we are able to work for strict To reconstruct using the data of VMAMT, a profile for the phase dependent of the retrograde flow of ACT. And now what we are going so what we are trying is really by image analysis quantify the retrofit flow. Using FRAP data also, we were trying to see using how, so to understand how, so if you use your FRAP data, you are going to have some specific shape in here. And what we show in here, so the distribution of length of filament do not affect the shape of your fat data. Of your fat data. However, the velocity of your filament, oh no, no, no, what is going on? The velocity of your filament, depending on what type of velocity you assume for your filament, you are going to have different shapes. So if your profile, your fat profile is a kind of traveling wave, it seems maybe. Wave, it seems maybe you have constant velocity for your filament. If you have a kind of piecewise linear profile for the frag, it's going to be constant over time and uniformly distributed. And if you have signal weight, you are going to have maybe more normal or gamma distribution for the velocity. And so, even comparing to the data, what we seems the gamma distributed velocity. Gamma distributed velocity work the best, but what is important is we have very few phenomena moving. We have few phenomena moving very fast, but the majority of the phenomena does not move. Okay, and now five minutes including the questions. Okay. Now, I die, I have to move me, but that all after That are astrocyte V-mantin and the frac, and what you see is in fact the V-mantin filament moving along the microtube. Now the question was how that can happen. And so we try, so now we have no more data. It's just theoretical. Theoretical. And so we just, so the question was: how a very long, elastic, flexible filament can be transported in an efficient way and if just connected to some specific point along the net. And so, and we have two types of So, and we have two types of two teams of motor, and so we cycle this Togof-Woo model that was described before. And so, we are going to now represent our intermediate filament in here by a series of nodes that are going to be connected by screen constant. And at each node, we are going to have allowed the attachment. Allowed the attachment detachment of the two types of motor. One going this way, one going this way. And the question was: can we, if we do that, could we move? The answer is yes. And we were able to reproduce also crete road grade, anterade, and slow motion. But here, what is important is we have a multi-stable system, meaning it's going to depend. System, meaning it's going to depend on the initial condition and the initial condition in this framework are how many motors of each type are going to be attached at the beginning. And so, meaning to regulate the transport in the fan, the fan must regulate the distribution of motor in the file. Now, I don't speak too much about that, but if we do the same model and we add noise, in fact, what we see is the presence of noise is going to annihilate the effect of the initial condition, and in fact, the noise is going to organize the transport of an ensemble of kilometers. So, even So even at the beginning we have some disparity in the attachment, but the noise is going just to wash out the defect of the PD cell function. And so that is a good strategy for a cell would be to have very few binding flights because more Binding site because more binding site, more things you have to organize, and it's going to take long time. But you can just finally regulate your microtubule-dependent transport by regulating the interaction between the motor and the tame, so PSNL DNU. And based on the model, it will be more efficient if It will be more efficient if the binding sites along the intermediate filament are fewer. Thank you. So in the in vivo case, is there any shot of doing some sort of tracking or image analysis to get the length distribution of the filament so that then you have your model from the first part with fragment. Model from the first part with fragmentation, so you could get it regulation. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, two different calls from those videos. I don't know if somebody maybe did do that, but I will not trust their value of it. Yeah. Going back to the first part, and where the fragmentation term, and I think when we did this first. And I think when we did this for Acton decades ago now, we found that if you didn't include that, well, for one thing, you can see that the equilibrium just gets continued to be driven. And eventually, if you ran it to infinity, you'd end up with one ball control. Fragmentation actually helps. You can use fixed rates, and it does shift and fill the bottom part about distribution rates about the bottom part of the bottom level. I remember, I don't remember the specific details. We had two terms, one was kind of basic. Two terms, one was kind of based on contacts within the gel, one was the thing is, I never tried to add the fragmentation because, for example, so when I was speaking with Ahar, he always, or not there, but always they were always saying, No, we don't care. At the end, there is just one Shiana. And yeah, so we can do it. Yeah, so my memory is that term, it ends up being small, but it makes it reversible and that gives you at least fixed. No, no, for sure. If you have the fragmentation, you are going to achieve fence of an equilibrium. Me, I'm just like, okay, we should probably leave it for coffee discussion now, so it's like. For coffee discussion, no, so it looks like something we're done. Do you want to talk about the charge difference between the designated character involved between the first part of the is there a different charge on the monopover? Because you have this thing where the salt increases the assembly kinetics. Is there a screening effect, maybe? Yeah, yeah, okay, I got that. Like for the same purple or shorter system, it probably diffuses faster. Is that true? I don't remember that. I mean, you have faster assembly. I mean, you have faster assembly over the shorter persistence, right? Is that just because the polymer is slower? Because it curls the sword. So you have to do first. Oh, no, okay. You don't have the diagnosis. You just use the model and you get the number.
