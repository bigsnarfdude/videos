    system which is what I've been working with for I guess the last ten-ish, nine, ten years. Ish nine, ten years. And so this is sort of an introductory, an introduction to that system, but it's written in such a way that it is meant to be an example for how we think about building models as math biologists. So to sort of get started, one of the useful things, and we run into this problem with physiology in general, is that there are so many different interacting systems, and usually when Systems and usually, when people, whether they're at whatever scale of research they're doing, they focus on one system or one part of a part of a system. And so, when I think about the ovulatory cycle, there are all of these other things that can interplay with it, which makes for really interesting topics in terms of things that could be done from a mathematical perspective, because you can use mathematics to build bridges between these different areas. But for Different areas. But for the purposes of today, I'm going to focus just on what we know about the ovulatory cycle, not in its entirety, so much as just sort of like how we can think about it. And then later in the week, thinking about how we can use that to connect it to other systemic interactions. So, some of the questions in human-female reproductive endocrinology that are either unknown. Are either unknown or things that sort of vary between people are things like just the general physiology of the menstrual cycle in a general population. Super vague, but it's only now that like we can actually get a ton of data and try to answer some of these questions. So that sort of speaks to the idea that there are also inter-individual variations in the characteristics of ovulation. In the characteristics of ovulation, most notably, like cycle length is one of those things that is sort of easy to measure. And then there are these other things that you can measure. And one of the interesting questions is to try to see how these things vary between individuals based on things like age, body temperature, ethnicity, BMI, stress, lifestyle, add a whole bunch of other things to the list. The other interesting thing is that the cycle itself also changes. The cycle itself also changes within people, right? So you have one person and they don't necessarily have a cycle that looks the same as time moves on. And so thinking about what the parameters of their variation are is another thing that we would be interested in. There's a mystery involving what actually happens with follicle selection. It's still a mystery to this day. Like we can measure things, but it doesn't tell a complete Measure things, but it doesn't tell a complete story. And then the portion that I'm more interested in has to do with what happens when things go wrong in the ovulatory cycle and how do you rectify things like ovulatory dysfunction given variations in underlying pathophysiology. And then, how, starting with that first slide, how does the intersection of reproductive endocrinology and other complex systems change toward inclusion? Complex systems change toward influence things. So, that's just sort of an exhaustive list. Well, it's not really exhaustive, but a list to get started about sort of the power of where you can use math in this context. So when we start thinking about the ovulatory cycle, one can sort of think about this picture as being a representative of all of, not all, some of the interactions, but the major interactions is a communication that happens. Interactions is a communication that happens between the brain and the ovaries, right? So, hormones get produced in the ovaries, those talk to the brain, and then hormones get produced in the brain, and those hormones talk to the ovaries. So, these are sort of like some of the major players in that. So, I won't talk a lot about this, but basically, there are two things that are happening with the brain. There's the hypothalamus and then there's the pituitary gluten. And so, the signaling that happens in the The signaling that happens in the hypothalamus via these GNRH neurons is going to sort of affect the hormones that are produced in the pituitary, namely LH and FSH. So mutinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone. Those two hormones are essential when thinking about what the ovary actually does and in turn how the ovary produces steroid hormones like progesterone and estradiol and inhibitin. And estradiol and inhibiting, which then sort of feed back to the brain. And on top of that, there's, at least displayed in this picture, there's a lot of positive and negative feedback that happens throughout the course of the cycle. And so the strength of that feedback is potentially going to vary depending on what the hormone concentrations are and whether it has an excitatory or an inhibitory effect when it comes to the brain. So that's sort of like the overview. So that's sort of like the overview of the HPO axis. And when we think about what that does, it really sets the tone for what actually happens in ovulation, right? So on the other side of the screen, now we kind of see that there are very sort of specific temporal variations in the hormones, and the way that these hormones sort of increase and decrease over the course of an ovulatory cycle are what An ovulatory cycle are what is setting the tone for things like the length of ovulation, the length of time that you spend in one state versus another. So, what this does is it actually sets up a series of different stages within the ovulatory cycle. So, on the one hand, we can look at what the actual follicles are doing and how they're growing throughout that process. And the generalized process is there's a bunch of The process is there's a bunch of follicles, and they some of those get selected to grow. There's the follicles themselves are protecting the egg until we hit the point of ovulation. And there's all this sort of feedback that occurs so that a dominant follicle is selected, it ovulates, spits its egg out, and then there's another confirmation that the follicles undergo after the point of ovulation, which After the point of ovulation, which is called the luteal phase. So the beginning part of this is the growth of the follicles. So we call that the follicular stage. And then the end part of this is the luteal stage, where the corpus luteum is established, and we also get a boatload of progesterone. So all of these sort of dynamics are coming out of, at least these guys, are coming out of what's happening from a physical standpoint and also a signaling standpoint. A signaling standpoint within the ovaries. And then all of that just sort of restarts once other signals are either met or not met. So we have this whole sort of big giant system and we know that there are questions that we could ask. And the biggest thing is, well, how do we tackle that, right? Because it's not just this system. There's a lot going on, right? There's a lot going on, right? We have the brain, it's a big system. The ovaries, it's a big system. They have like thousands and thousands of cells, maybe millions, probably millions. And so one level of complexity is like, well, what scale do we actually want to study this in, right? So if I look at the ovaries and I'm just like, well, there are some cells in there, and yeah, they produce hormones. But if we look inside a follicle, right? Look inside a follicle, right, and there are many follicles, then we see this: which is we're going to have an egg, we're going to have some cells that are called granulosa cells that do one thing, and then, well, they do several things, then we have the feca cell, right? So basically, there's the egg, there are sort of these layers of granulosa cells, there's also layers of fecus cells. They are producing proteins that talk to each other inside of the ovary. That doesn't appear. The ovary. That doesn't appear on the first picture, right? Like, so if we have to ask questions about what's happening within individual follicles, do we look at it at this level or do we say, well, overall, yes, this is happening, but we don't care about that right now. And that's sort of a decision that's made in terms of modeling, right? So I'm not necessarily going to look at this scale and say, I want to know what's happening with all of these. I want to know what's happening with all of these cells and how they are interconnected in terms of the signaling processes that go on. But I have to know that sort of at the outset. Or I need a very good reason to sort of focus on this. So that's just one example of how the previous system can be made even more complex depending on what questions you're interested in asking. The other complex issue, so I mentioned that in a follicle there's the egg and then there's the There's the egg, and then there's the follicular cells, and there's sort of all of this structure. Well, the follicles are responsible for producing steroid hormones, like again, estrogen, progesterone, sorry, progesterone, estrogen. There are these other ones. Testosterone is a big one that I'll talk about later in the week, right? And all of this stuff is happening within the follicles. So, this is sort of a picture of, again, those sort of two cells on the previous slide, this sort of two. This sort of two-cell, two-gonadotropin theory of hormone production is what it's called, because the fecal cells are the only cell type that can produce testosterone and androgens in general. And then those sort of move into the granulosa cells, and that's how we get estradiol out of it. So you need the granulosa cells because they're the only ones that have the enzyme that will convert testosterone into estradiol, but you need the fecas. But you need the thecazelles because you need a precursor to begin with. So, this is a completely different level and a different scale of thinking about the problem. So, now we're like, okay, well, we have, we're not looking inside each of the individual cells and looking at the proteins that they produce so much as now we're looking at the steroid production cascade. And that's actually another piece that I'm interested in looking at. But again, that's a decision to be made in terms of scaling the... Of scaling the complexity. The benefit of mathematics is that we can use it to bridge the gap between those scales in a less difficult way than it would be for, say, someone who looks at the production of steroids in a lab and someone who looks at, say, the signaling in between the different cells within a single follicle as opposed to a population of follicles. So, the next question is: where do we begin? Right? So, I keep talking about how we make decisions. And so, when you're building a model, the first thing you need to do is, well, figure out what you're modeling and then sort of write out your list of assumptions. And that's going to be based on the biology, that's going to be based on data that you have, whatever. Then you define the variables and the parameters, right? So, the variables are the things that we want to be able to sort of track typically. Sort of track typically over time, but I'm talking about a very sort of specific class of models. In this case, ones that we would use differential equations to define. The parameters, we've heard this a lot. It's very hard to actually get parameters that we actually know the values of. And so that's another part of it. But by defining the variables and the parameters in such a way, we can actually develop expressions that sort of connect these variables together. That sort of connects these variables together in a mathematical way. And hopefully, some of these parameters have been defined for us in the literature. So, for this system, right, so this is just sort of a different visualization of the previous system, we can sort of make modeling choices that make our lives a little bit easier, but it also sort of allows us to focus on the things that we want to focus on. So, there are classes of models that deal exclusively with the hypothetical. Exclusively with the hypothalamic feedback and how GNRH neurons work. There are other classes of models that sort of more generally think about what the ovaries are doing and maybe what the pituitary is doing, but not necessarily the hypothalamus. And so I'm going to sort of talk a little bit about the Celgrade approach to the system. Jim Celgrade was my postdoc advisor. And so the class of models that he and his students have sort of developed over the years focus on sort of a We ears focus on sort of a compartmental framework where we're just sort of sticking the ovaries in a box, we're sticking the brain in a box, and then we're sort of using what we know about the biology to account for the arrows that go between them, whether they are inhibitory or excitatory in some sense. So we've identified that we have these two major subsystems. We need to identify what we should actually be modeling. So good choices in this case would be LH and FS. In this case, it would be LH and FSH, which are our brain hormones, and then estrogen and estradiol and progesterone are other choices based on what the ovaries produce. There are also inhibitins, there's also testosterone, there are other things that we can sort of add into the mix. Our general rule of thumb when creating, say, a system of differential equations is to basically describe the ins and outs for every single variable. For every single variable, right? So I have some hormone or I have something that I want to measure, and I'm going to say that it changes according to the things that add to it and the things that take away from it. And that's it. Easy, right? Yeah, done. We have completed our model. But that's basically it, right? So I'm making it sound easy not because it is. It sound easy not because it is, but because, like, it's sort of a tractable way of being like, okay, how do these things interact? What do we know from a biological standpoint? So, the next thing that we do is we're saying, okay, we know we're modeling this system. Let's come up with a mathematics, a mathematical schematic for it. So, that's basically going to be a way of describing the mathematical equations without actually using math, but it allows us to sort of be very But it allows us to sort of be very clear about how we are, what assumptions we're actually making, and how we're tracking things over time. So, in this particular subsystem, where we're thinking about what's happening in the brain, we can define four variables. So, the four variables are basically two versions of LH, which is a luteinizing hormone. And I haven't even told you what that does, but that's cool. That'll come later. And then two variables for FSH. And And part of the reason for splitting it up is this way is to sort of take into account, without actually modeling neurons, what happens in the hypothalamus. So we can assume that there's some part of the brain that's responsible for synthesizing LHNFSH, and then there's some part that facilitates its release into the serum. And so we want to track what's been produced but hasn't been released yet, and then everything that's in the blood. And so that's where we come up with those four variants. And so that's where we come up with those four variants. So the two compartments that we're using to describe those things are those two boxes. And then we have to sort of build in the effect of the ovarian hormones in this system. So we write down some equations. So rather than going through what these are in specifics, we're sort of thinking about how we construct the model. So first of all, like to anybody, really, you're like, Anybody, really, you're like, why are we using these expressions to develop a model? And a lot of times, what it comes down to is being able to describe what happens. So, in one case, right, so we're talking about the LH that's been produced but hasn't been released yet. It's synthesized, and then when it's released, we lose it so that the serum LH increases, and then there's some clearance through kidneys, livers, whatever. Through kidneys, livers, whatever, excretion, et cetera, that clears it from the system. So that's one way of sort of defining the things that we want to model. And then the next piece of it is coming up with the expressions for that. So there's a Hill function with a parameter of eight. Exactly. Exactly. So, when we're coming up with the models, we're like, okay, so what do we know? What we know is that I'll start, I'll avoid the Hill function for now. So let's talk about progesterone. So progesterone serves two functions. One, it inhibits the synthesis specifically of LH. LH depending on its concentration. And for those of you who know dynamical systems, that's where the delays come in, which I am not going to talk about at all. So pretend they're not there. So progesterone inhibits the synthesis of, in this case, LH, but not necessarily FSH. And it facilitates the release of both LH and FSH. So the modeling choices, right? So I told my students when they're like, So I told my students when they're like looking at models and things, like it's important to have a sense of functions and what they look like, right? So like literally just like, if I were to plot this function, what would it look like? And so you can tell that these are not going to be biologically accurate. We're modeling the effect, not the mechanism. And so the question is, and what you hope is that if you can account for the effect, then the overarching behavior. Then the overarching behavior will be something that's reasonable without having to add in more variables that we can't measure, more parameters that we don't have values for. And so we're just modeling that effect. Of course, there's a lot of biology contained in here, but for example, we're going to put P in the denominator because if P increases, then synthesis has to decrease. Then in the release term, we're going to put it in the numerator so that when there's more P, there's going to be more Going to be more release of both LH and FSH, things with their appropriate compartments. And similarly, it works for estradiol or E2 as well in the sense that estradiol will inhibit the release of both of those things. And the major effect of estradiol during a key point in the cycle is that it stimulates and very, very quickly what's known as the LH surge, which is surge, which is the major thing that's needed for ovulation to occur. And it has to be super sensitive. So I did not make this modeling decision, but I do support it. And the decision is to use a degree 8 hill function because it sort of acts like a switch in the sense that once you get to a value at E that's like high enough, it's going to immediately. It's going to immediately flip on, right? So that's what my Hill function looks like. And the higher that parameter is, the sharper this transition has to be. So once E2 sort of passes that magical value, it will immediately kick a whole lot of LH into the system. Ask a question. Yes. So you stated very matter-of-factly that progesterone inhibits synthesis, which stimulates your. Which stimulates Nestrodel does the opposite. So, to a naive outside, that seems like it's working at cross-purposes. Most cases, like insulin secretion, the things that promote secretion also promote synthesis because otherwise you'd run out of insulin. And vice versa, if you were producing it but not releasing it, you'd be building up a lot of insulin to no purpose. So, can you give us a quick insight into what is this? Quick insight into what does this gain for the system? Does it make the dynamics richer? I believe that the way that it's set up, because of this, it has to do with the timing of how these things operate. Right? So, P4 is only ever elevated during the luteal stage because if it's going to stimulate, say, If it's going to stimulate, say, the release of the hormones, we're trying to sort of get back to the beginning of the cycle. So the only time that P4 is strong enough to actually allow for that to happen is sort of during the lum TL stage. In terms of estradiol, there are sort of the other feedbacks, but the thing that we have to remember is that LH and FSH also signal the production of these dyes. And so the feedback loop is a little bit more. And so the feedback loop is a little bit more complicated in that sense, yeah. Is this why you had to put the delays in order to get the timing correct? Say that again? Is this why you needed the delays to get the timing? So it's yes. So you do get more accurate timing with the delays. However, the delays are not explicitly needed. So the version of the model that I worked on was to get rid of the delays and try to sort of. To sort of have some version of that that works. So, a different version of an answer might be that that interaction forces a refractor. Once you release it, you can't release until you build up enough that storage. Unlike the deep in insulin, where And pretty soon they have to open it. Yeah, so the amount of E two that's needed has to be sort of high enough to kick that off, but P4 is very potent at limiting this portion of it. So even during the point where P4 is actually pretty low, it's also inhibiting LH, particularly in the absence of that kick of. Of that kick of YouTube. Other question? Okay, so that was what I wanted to spend the most time on, and then I'm just going to say this is the rest of the system, and there's a bunch of other stuff there. So this is the ovarian system, which in the way that it was originally described by the cell grade group, there's three follicular stages, and again, for the timing, three follicular stages, just to sort of account for the growth because. To sort of account for the growth, because follicle selection is still a mystery, right? So we're just assuming that there are signals that allow this growth to happen. There are what are called two ovulatory stages. So that's right around, it's like a two to three day period, right around the point of ovulation where LH kicks up and does its signaling thing to signal that the egg needs to be released. And then there's four luteal stages. And if you look at these, you're like very And if you look at these, they're like very sort of linear. So they also just act as a delay between these sort of maturation points. So what we can do there is basically be very sort of fine-tuned about the types of signals that work in allowing the follicles to advance through these stages. Because the earlier part of the cycle, the follicles will only respond to FSH, and it's not until they've matured enough or are large enough or some kind. Enough or are large enough or some combination of the two where they acquire the appropriate receptors, does LH start to have an impact on the growth of the follicle? So you can fine-tune that process by having a number of variables. And again, I worked on a reduced version of this model where I was actually able to capture the behavior just using one follicular stage, one ovulatory stage, one luteal stage. But that's all I wanted to say. That's all I wanted to say. Yes. And then at the end, you compare it to data and you're done. Right? Not really. There's some stuff that went on here. But there are also a lot of challenges involved, which I will talk about tomorrow. Okay, can I ask a question? So you on this speaking of data, you talked about Speaking of data, you talked about how it seems like there's more data now. I'm just curious about what that you kind of referred to as what changed, where are you going to use data? Okay, so I'll describe it briefly because it's literally what I'm talking about tomorrow. But it's like it's the difference between having data which are like invasive and being like, hey, a group of women, come in and get your hormones. Women come in and get your hormones. Like, let's stick you with an ideal and like, let's track your hormones for every single day of your cycle for a month, versus, hey, what's your cycle length? Put in a number to an app and like you get a bunch of data from, you know, the sort of digital qualitative data that is easy to amass, but not necessarily useful for a modeler who is trying to track things over time. Who's trying to track things over time? And what I would like to do is be able to sort of bridge the gap between those with models. Like, let's make use of the data that we actually have to figure out how to incorporate it into our models when this would actually be perfect, but no one's doing this anymore. Right? Like, these are data from 1990. And I think the other more recent version we have from like 99. Awesome. Yeah, just a related question. Is that a problem? Um 'cause I would probably even study slightly like um with the the age of of administration. So I'm wondering if you mentioned 1990s. Do you think some of this has changed over time? Well, so these were specifically in women and not adolescents. And adolescent biology, even in terms of the menstrual cycle, is a little wonky to the extent that, like, there would be some changes. Like, there would be some changes that would need to be made, even though I'm not clear on all of the differences. But it doesn't stabilize for a while after Menarchy, so it would probably require some differences in terms of the model just. Your modeling is an older woman. Meaning close. Yeah, older-ish. When I say older, I mean one statement, not adolescents. Yeah, that's a different. Adolescence. Yeah, that's a different piece for sure. Okay, so I So I'm giving a different example, but a similar flavor of kind of thinking about if we want to put together a model We want to put together a model. What are the kinds of things that we need to think about? And what's the process that we go through as we do this? And as I mentioned, a lot of my earlier work was coming more from the mathematical neuroscience side, where we have a lot more detail at a certain level that we can think about for specifying particular parameters. Of course, we also make assumptions there. Of course, we also make assumptions there, but the pathway of the mechanisms is much more clear. And so, in the large scale of current metabolic modeling, things are much more kind of compartment-based. You know, it's like we're sampling from the blood, we have data of what's happening in the blood, and we're going to use that to kind of infer a lot of other things that are happening in a lot of different places in the system. And sometimes we In the system. And sometimes we take a couple different compartments into account. You know, this can help for delays, as Erica mentioned, or this can help for other kinds of exchange where you may have concentration gradient differences. But it's not really accounting for a lot of the physiology of the system. And so, in terms of the big picture and big problems of the field, I think this is something that we really need to do in a place that we really need to do. Really need to do in a place that we really want to go with this is being able to take more of the physiology into account, think about how these things interact. And I'm just going to start talking about one little piece of this, which is thinking about really nothing too fancy. Thinking about nothing too fancy. Fancy, but thinking about a system that hasn't, or a piece of a system that hasn't been considered as much previously. So, if we're thinking about this in the context of metabolism, we know that there's this huge switch that goes on between the fasted and the fed state. And so, here, when we think about this fasted state, we have our glucose coming mostly from the liver, and we have the And we have this release of glycerol and free fatty acids or fatty acids from the adipose tissue so that we can measure what's happening with these things and that they're being used by the body. And then when we switch to the fed state and we have glucose coming in from some external source, then we want to suppress that glucose release happening from the liver. And we also want to suppress the release that's happening in the The lipolysis that's happening in the adipose tissue. And so we have insulin playing these roles and regulating both the glucose dynamics and the lipolysis and binding, signaling these metabolic changes that need to happen. And then this phenomenon of insulin resistance that we're all familiar with, where we have more insulin than normal required to achieve the same level of metabolic. Achieve the same level of metabolic control. And one thing about insulin resistance is that it can be tissue-specific. And it's thought that really being able to understand insulin resistance as it's arising in different tissues can help to understand the progression of disease and also to understand insulin resistance as it may be different in different types of disease. And so that's something that we've been really interested in trying to get at. And typically, the And typically, the best way of understanding tissue-specific insulin resistance is with this multistage hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. So you can look at different levels of insulin to understand what's happening in different tissues at those different stages. And usually we start with a lower dose and get a response from the adipose tissue and then increase to higher doses where we can see response in the liver. Response in the liver and the muscle. So, we're interested in thinking about this in a more physiologic, not completely physiologic, but more physiologic kind of context. And so we're going to look at this in the context of an oral glucose tolerance test. So with the clamp, you're kind of very carefully controlling everything externally, which is very valuable for knowing exactly what your inputs to the system are. To the system are. With the oral glucose tolerance test, you know that you're giving a certain amount of glucose, but you don't know all of the details about how that glucose is hitting the system. But it does give you then this interesting time response, which is the thing that we're trying to look at. And the question that we were asking here was: if this kinetics of interaction between the glucose and insulin response and the glycerol and insulin response. Glycerol and insulin response are different in the population that we're considering, which is a cohort of insulin-resistant adolescent girls. And so, as Erica said, there's a lot going on in adolescence. One of the things that goes on in adolescence is that there's more insulin resistance overall. And this is really driven by growth hormone, is really important for a lot that's happening in development, but can cause a lot of problems for people who are already. Of problems for people who are already insulin resistant heading into adolescence, right? So it's something that happens to everyone, but if you're already further along on the scale, then it can push you into even into diabetes for a temporary period of time, sort of like gestational diabetes, something that's more reversible. But very key that it's this population, because one of the things that we are finding is that there is. We are finding is that there is does seem to be a difference in the kinetics here, and this is not necessarily true for what people have found in adults. So, just to quickly give you a sense of what's happening during the oral glucose tolerance test, we're frequently sampling this. So, this is not what would happen if you were just going to go to the doctor and get diagnosed, but this is an experimental research setting where we're sampling much more frequently. Sampling much more frequently, so 15 to 30 minutes, and then out to an hour every hour, and tracking what's happening with our glucose and glycerol. And so you can see that after the time of the drink happening at time zero, the glucose comes up and then comes down. And from that drink, the glycerol is then getting suppressed and then recovering. And our insulin is rising and then falling. So this is just sort of overall the So, this is just sort of overall. The shaded region is showing you all of the variability among our 66 participants. So, there's a lot of inter-individual variability to consider in this as well. But this shows you what the overall trends are for what we would expect from these metabolites. And so the oral minimal model is a model that was developed in sort of the early 90s, really trying to understand this glucose-insulin interaction. Insulin interaction. And the idea for this is that you have the glucose coming into the blood from the drink as well as from your endogenous glucose production, and you have some sort of uptake from that. And then you have insulin coming into the blood, and basically, this insulin action was a way of going not just from the exact measured insulin, but into the way that insulin is. But into the way that insulin is acting on the glucose. So, this insulin action then acts here and acts the main way that it's acting in the oral minimal model is on the uptake side. And then we have the clearance of insulin action as well. And so, from this kind of schematic, these equations were developed, where essentially here we have the glucose compartment. The glucose compartment and or the glucose concentrations. And so with the glucose, we have this glucose-dependent. So both of these terms are multiplying my G. So I have a glucose dependent and insulin-independent and then insulin-dependent term that are affecting that uptake. I have here some baseline glucose and then the glucose that's coming in from the meal. Glucose that's coming in from the meal. So that's what's being represented in this equation. And then, in terms of the insulin action, when insulin is below basal, this is just decaying, so just going to decay to zero. But when insulin is above basal, then we have some sort of forcing to increase what's happening with the insulin. So that's the general idea for the oral minimal model, explaining how glucose and insulin interact. How glucose and insulin interact. And we wanted to see, using this same kind of idea, can we understand how glycerol and insulin could interact? So with glycerol, we have lipolysis taking place that's insulin independent as well as insulin dependent. And then we have some clearance from that. And for our insulin, again, we have the insulin concentration increasing in the blood after the drink and some clearance of that. And some clearance of that, and this insulin is acting to suppress the lipolysis. So the insulin-dependent lipolysis. There's also a component of the lipolysis that may not be suppressed. And so this is what we wanted to represent. And so we're going to use the exact same representation of insulin action that we saw for the oral minimal model. So here, we just have this decaying when it's below basal or Below basil or growing when it's above basil. But for our glycerol now, which I'm denoting with the small G, I have my uptake of glycerol. And so this is again just sort of in and out, right? So for my glycerol in the compartment, I have coming in from the lipolysis and coming out from this uptake. And so I need. And so I need a way to represent this lipolysis function. And so people have looked at this, parallel on colleagues looked at this for free fatty acids. And glycerol and free fatty acids are released together and have similar properties. And so we used a similar form to what they used for free fatty acids to try to represent this with glycerol. And so what I'm Clothrall. And so, what I'm going to talk about, this is the form that we use where we are able to change these parameters L2, X2, and A. We also have been exploring where we can make simplifications with some of these parameters. And you can see this insulin action is acting within the lipolysis function to suppress whatever that maximum lipolysis rate is. So that as that insulin action goes up, the lipolysis level goes down. Polysis level goes down. So that's the general idea that we had here. So, from this, we have a quick example fit of what happens for using the oral minimal model to fit the glucose and insulin data and the glycerol model to fit the glycerol data. And so, here you can see our data is in the individual points and then the numerical solution going through them. Numerical solution going through them. So, this is for our glucose and glycerol, and we can see we're capturing the rise in the suppression. And what we were really interested in was what was happening with the insulin action for these two things. And so you can see this is what the modeled insulin action looks like for the two in these lower panels. And we felt that these were different, but we wanted to understand how they were different. And so, as I mentioned, And so, as I mentioned in previous work with free fatty acids, it had been found that you could kind of combine these things and use a single insulin action for the role that it was playing on both free fatty acids and glucose. And when we were trying to do that fitting, it was just not happening. So, we started looking at them individually to try to understand what was going on and then to see where is this difference in what's happening with the insulin action. And so, some of the metrics that we developed to look The metrics that we developed to look at the differences here are thinking about, you know, well, what's the difference from the insulin peak to the peak of the insulin action? So if we specify an insulin peak and then the peak for the glucose insulin action and the peak for the glycerol insulin action, we can think about the relative difference between the glucose and glycerol peaks. We can think about the peak timing. The peak timing just by itself. And then we also looked: so if we truncate the experiment here at four hours, what is the level that this has recovered? And so how much is this above baseline, our beta G? And using all of these different metrics, we were able to then quantify where some of these differences come in between the dynamics for the glucose. Dynamics for the glucose and the glycerol. And we also then looked at this in phase space just to think about: so, if we want to understand how these things are interacting, we have a much more typical sort of interacting oscillators of our glucose and insulin here, where you can see in our normalized concentrations here. Our normalized concentrations here: if the glucose is going up and then the insulin goes up, and then that starts to bring the glucose down and then the insulin down. So, we have this sort of delay like we would see in a standard predator-prey model. But we see something very different with the glycerol, where it's basically tracking in this clear out and back because it is following so much more closely. And so, we kind of have a cartoon of what this would look like if we thought that the time. Would look like if we thought that the time scales were actually similar for the glucose and glycerol, then we would expect there to be this kind of similar delay in terms of the action, but that's not what we see in terms of where the suppression is happening. So we think that there really is this difference, although likely related to the population that we're looking at, because we would expect that the dynamics would be similar to what was previously found for free fatty acids. So we find with this kind of So, we find with this kind of approach that the glycerol is changing more quickly, which is suggesting that the adipose tissue is responding more quickly. And this is an interesting kind of addition to the idea that the adipose tissue is also responding at lower concentrations of insulin, right? So, if you start at a lower concentration and respond more quickly, then you can get a much faster response. And within our population, especially, it's Especially, it seems that the response for the glucose is significantly delayed. So, again, preliminary results that we're seeing just in this one population. You're really interested in looking at this with more work in other populations. And then, this is the work of my undergraduate student, Griffin Hampton, who is just graduated and is heading off to a post-boc program at NIH before hopefully going on to an MDP. For hopefully going on to an MD PhD, and then close work with my clinical collaborator, Melanie Creek Green, and all of our glucose modeling was done by my PhD student, Kai Bartlett. So, thanks. So, um, you said your population or it's like Population are insulin resistant, but age-wise, what was the vital age of age-wise? Age-wise, so these are adolescent girls, I believe that the mean age was around like 14.6 years, but we're generally looking for one of the studies that we were doing here, we were looking at polycystic ovary syndrome, and so we're looking a little bit past. And so we're looking a little bit past puberty, initial puberty, so that they're fully through puberty, but adolescent. One of the things you see is how much information, like they're massively trying to compress the knowledge that we have of physiology into testable hypotheses that are mathematical equations. Of course, the hard part is then translating this into a clinic where you can start trying to make. Into a clinic where you can start trying to make decisions and understand how to impact people. So, art, okay, sorry. Where did you get fixed that gap? Oh, sis. Ceci it. Last time I think it just went away. I didn't have to adjust the displays. Um okay, I had a very different idea of how this session was going to go, but I'll just wing it. So this is more sketchy to try to highlight general ideas for the group rather than try to make you experts in how beta cells and insulin secretion works. But anyway, we'll see how it goes. But anyway, let's see how it goes. That's the way I was advancing it. Yeah. All right, so the story begins about a half century ago with this electrical recording from betas. It's actually from an island of Langerhands, which is hundreds of beta cells electrically coupled. But we'll treat them as if they were a single cell. So, contacting what Dave said about how you often have very sparse data, this is really the tip of the iceberg of what's going on. I mean, they did these recordings because the beta cells secrete insulin, and insulin is important for diabetes. But it's not just this electrical activity that drives the insulin secretion. There are other things going on. So, it's also causing a rise in calcium. So, just like neurotransmitter. Calcium. So, just like neurotransmitters, it's the raw and other endocrine cells, it's the increase in calcium which is causing exocytosis of hormone-containing vesicles. But in addition, the beta cells are metabolic sensors. So, there are oscillations of calcium that underlie this. But there also are the beta cells are metabolic sensors, and there are oscillations.
