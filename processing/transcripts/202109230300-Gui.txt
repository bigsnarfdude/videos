Thanks, Professor Lee. Thanks, Professor Rem for introducing me. And you can hear me right. So as you can see from this title, the topic I will talk about today is quite related to the previous talk given by Professor Nina Yun, and it is also quite closely related to yesterday's core's talk, the morning's talk, which would talk about this. This problem from the category point of view. And I'm going to talk about this topic from both VOA and a kind of geometric point of view. So first, let me give you some motivations and also some references about this problem. And actually, the problem of understanding and Understanding and classifying or calculating the mod the twisted modules and fusion rules for the permutation always has a very long history. Actually, before, so I only here I only list the names of mathematicians and certainly before the mathematical works, many physicists have done a lot of important works, but I didn't, I just didn't list that. I want to focus on the math side. And so, one reason that we care. So one reason that we care about permutation oval is, first of all, in general, ovipo theory is very hard to understand. Even then we know very well about the original VOA, it's in general not very uneasy to know a lot of information about the corresponding orbital VOA. Suppose that we are given a finite group action on that VOA. But permutation orbital theory is a type of theory that Theory is a type of theory that we can know a lot of information, a lot of orbital information from the original information. So, here are two examples. First of all, there is a very nice relation between the twisted permutation VOAs. What I'm saying is, as you can see from the title, you have a tensor product of the same VOA B. And you think about the permutation action, you promoting the tensor components. Actually, Nina has already mentioned. Actually, Nina has already mentioned this in previous talks. So I just focus on the history and the reference here. And also, as you have, as Amina already mentioned, that we have a nice, very nice relation between the twisted permutation representations for tether product VOA and the untwisted modules for the original VOA. So we can, at least on the module side, we know a lot of people. A lot of obvious information from the untwisted theory. And many people have contributed to this part, like Baron Don Mason. And this is also Nina had mentioned this in her talk. And so Baron Don Mason mainly work and Dong Shu Yu mainly work on the GOAT side and on the conformat side we have the class Dongo and Shui. This is for the modules and only not only for modules. And not only for modules, for the fusion rules and fusion rings, we also have quite a lot of results. For example, on the conformal net side, we have some computations of fusion rules for computation tweet modules. So on the conformal side, this is inspired by understanding the two interval like Jones-Mass Muslim factors or constitution or the super selection setters. And this is initiated by Karl Kiachi, Lungo, and Mueger in their very important paper. And Mueller, in their very important paper, which initiates the study of the strong irrational, completed rational conformant net, and also some subsequent work like Long Go Shi and Kas Long Go Shi. So this is on the conformant net side. And on the VOA side, we have a recent result by Dong Li Shui and Nina. And so for these two types of results, they deal with explicit modules. I mean, explicit in the sense of the result here, because in this Result here because in this result, the twisted modules are explicitly constructed. And in these two on these two sides, the conformat side and the VOA side, the results here could compute very explicitly the fusion rules among these explicitly constructed tracing modules. And on the other hand, we have the model functor point of view and the transaction category point of view, the model functor point of view. Point of view of the model, what the formal point of view is was given by Barmer and Schweigert in tension category is from Eddie Michel, Corey Gulia, and Marcia and Colin Dinani. And compared to the conformant S side and the VOA side, the category side and the module functor point of view provides kind of complete result. So the result here on the module functor side and on the tensor category side. The category side are more or less complete. But when applied to explicit conform net problems or UOA problems, there is something more we need to do in order to calculate the fusion rules. There is some subtlety here is that in these two results, they give you, okay, they give you some calculations of the fusion rings, but in these characterizations, the objects are constructed very innate. Are constructed very in an abstract way compared to the result here and here. So, what I'm saying is that you know the result here, but it's not so easy to directly apply their result, their computational fusion rings to compute the fusion rules between the twisted modules that are explicitly constructed in the first paragraph. first paragraph because it's not so obvious to identify the abstract objects in their result in this categorical or module function results with the explicit twisted modules constructed here so we still need some work in order to fully understand the future rule of things and my talk is actually trying to understand this kind of relation because already in the previously mentioned uh computations of future rules there is a fusion rules there is a there is this kind of relation that um the result of the fusion rules between permutation twisting modules that very result that that expression is expressed in terms of some higher genus fusion rules of the original untwisted voa or conforma net so there's so these fusion results suggest that there is such a relation and my goal of this talk is to make this relation precise and Precise and try to also try to make it complete in the VOA setting. And actually, my work, my talk is kind of a mixture of the Barrenton Mason, the VOA approach of Barrington Mason, and the geometric approach of the Baumeil Schweigers. So, this is my goal of today's form. I first want to say something about the second line, about the high. The second line about the high genius and twist parasites. I want to talk about how mathematicians now understand this topic in the VOA setting. In this, to approach, so one main approach to hyogeneous chiral COT is through the notion of conformal blocks. So, first of all, let me fix some definitions and notations. So, B is a VOA, as always, but I assume it has positive energy. Has positive energy. And by V modules, I mean in this talk, V modules to be admissible modules, but with a slightly with one extra condition that each greater subspace is finite-dimensional. So this finite dimensional condition is to guarantee some nice analytic property. Because sometimes I want to say take the product, take the trace. If you want to take the trace, then if the each greatest subspace is fine-dimensional, then you can easily. you can easily um you you can you can you can do something very well it's so i'm going to assume this this is my position but but this this is very this is not a very strong it certainly covers not only ordinary modules but also uh logarithmic logarithmic modules so this is not just an ordinary field it also includes a lot of uh logarithmic modules and i want to give you a rough idea of what are conformal blocks so first of all to define the conformal blocks Define the conformal plot, I need the following data. I need a combat remnant surface C without boundary, but instead of boundaries, so instead of boundaries, I need to choose some mark points. You need to think about the mark points as the punctures, as very small holes. So, we have, so in Jan's talk on Tuesday, in his second talk, when he introduced the COCLT. Introduced the COCFT, he talked about Riemann surfaces with boundaries. So there are some small circles, like right. But here, you have to, it would be better to think about the holes to be very small, some infinitesimal boundaries. So we use the marked points to represent these infinitesimal small circles. And you think about this picture as some states coming inside. States coming inside and they interact, but the states are interacting. So, this is the rough picture. And one more thing is that I want to fix some local coordinates, eta one to eta n. So, each eta j is a local coordinate at xj, which means that it is an inductive holomorphic function defined on the neighborhood of xj, which identifies xj with the origin. So, these are the data I need to define conformal blocks. Need to define conformal blocks. Also, there is one important thing is that I have to attach to each mark point or puncture, if you like, I have to attach to each puncture a V module, WJ. And with this data, I can define a conform block. So the reverse definition is very technical. It was given by True and also by Franco-Benz V. I'm not going to talk about this reverse definition, but actually this definition is quite closely related. And this definition is quite closely related to the Siegel's commutation formula, which James mentioned in today's talk. It basically just says that this conformal block, first of all, it is a linear functional from the Tensor product of all these modules. It is a linear function on this Tensor product. And second, this linear functional has to be invariant under certain action of V. I'm not going to talk about what is exactly this. Going to talk about what is exactly this action and what is the precise meaning of invariant, but I just want to point out that this definition, invariant and action, it really depends on your remote surface, especially its complex structure, which means that if you change its complex structure, also if you change the mark points or change the local coordinates, then its detonation, the meaning of invariant and address will be different. So, this is something we have to pay attention to. And I try to, so this is again. Um, so this is, I guess, something that many of many people in the audience are not familiar with, and I try to connect this component with something that many of you are familiar with. That is the fusion rules. So, if you take the Riemann surface to be genius zero, the Riemann sphere, you choose three mark points, and with some correct choice of global coordinates, this component is precisely the intertwining operators of BLA in the literature. And in particular, the dimension of component. particular the dimension of conformal blocks will sorry I have to make a uh the the yeah the dimension of conformal blocks associated to W1 W2 and the contragrin module of W3 is precisely the fusion rule between W1 W2 and W3. Okay so this is something I want to say about the conformal blocks. And I want to mention two extremely important facts about conformal blocks. And as you can see, And as you can see here at the bottom of these slides, many people have contributed to the proof of these two properties. But recently, the proof was completed very recently by three algebra geometers, Damionini, Gibney, and Tereska. What they say is this. First of all, let's assume that VS CFT type, C2 coherent. is uh cf2 type c2 cofinite and rational um and uh the first thing is that the dimension of the space of conformal block um it is finite it is finite dimensional in particular the fusion is finite and second it depends only on the topology of c the number of mark points on each connected component by connected components i mean that i do not really assume the the convect remain surface to be connected i allow it to contain several components contain several components and but but but but the importance of what is what is said in this formula is that the dimension of component it does not rely on the complex structure first of all it does not rely on the complex structure it only relies on the topology and also it does not rely on the location of these smart points you can certainly move these smart points along each connector component and this does not change the dimension of the component blocks Change the dimension of the conform blocks. So, this is one important thing. The second important thing is the factorization property. And instead of giving you a complete and rigorous statement of what is factorization property, I want to show you using these two pictures. So, roughly speaking, factorization property allow us to compute the dimension of conformed blocks for higher geneous remote surfaces or those with many. Those with many marked points to those with lower genus or those with less marked points. You can see that from this picture, these two pictures, the genus are lower and each part, the number of marked points are less than the number of mark points here. So by unit factorization, the dimension of conform blocks for any remote service, any data that I gave you before could be reduced, could be Could be reduced, could be calculated using the fusion rules. So, once you know the fusion rules, you can use any dimension of conformal blocks. So, this is the importance of factorization property. Okay, so what I said before, what I said previously are all about untwisted modules. Okay, so what now I'm going to tell you what are the definition of conformal blocks. Certainly, I'm going to restrict it to the genus zero case, and I want to. General zero case, and I want to talk about what are the conformal blocks for twisted modules. And I'm also, I'm not really going to give you the rigorous definition, I'm going to show you what are the main difference between the conformal blocks for twisted modules and the previously introduced conformal blocks for untwisted modules. So first of all, the first paragraph is the setting. I'm going to let you to be a VOA and in later slides, you will be a cancer product of V. Okay, let you be a VOA and I'm Okay, let U be a DLA and I'm going to fix a finite group to be a group of automorphism of U. And for each small, small, each small G, an element inside G, we can define a G-twisted module. So actually, we have seen this more rigorous definition in Ina's talk, so I'm not going to say too much about the definition of twisted module. But basically, it says that when you change, it is a multi-valued function of z. When you change the argument of z. When you change the argument of Z, then this field will be changed. So you have to pay attention. When you move along a circle, you will get a new field. You will get a different field. So this is something, this is one important thing that twisted modules are different from ordinary twisted modules. And because of this important point, we have to define or have to understand twisted component blocks in a slightly different way. So here I'm going to focus on I'm going to focus on Jinga Zerotlocks for three mark points, but you can easily generalize that to more than three mark points. So let me focus on this picture. I have three mark points, x1, x2, and x3 on the sphere. Okay. And I have, besides chewing the mark points and the local coordinates, I have to choose three paths, gamma one, gamma two, and gamma three. Okay, and these paths are okay and these paths are these paths are outside they should not pass through the mark points and second they have they should have the same endpoints okay and um roughly speaking a conformal block is a linear functional from um okay i'm going to associate a g1 twisted module w1 to x1 and g2 twisted module w2 to x2 and similar g3 twisted model to w3 G G3 twisted module to W3, and then you can take the tensor product and you can think about a linear functional of this math QW1, tensor, W2, tensor W3. And a conformable block for these treatment modules should be something that is invariant under the action of V when you only move along these circles. Like when you move from here to here, to here, then it is kind of invariant. But if you do not move along this circle, for example. If you do not move along this circle, for example, if you move first, move along this small circle and you go along this path, then it is not kind of invariant. So we really do need to change, sorry, to choose a path in order to define this, the notion of conformal blocks. So this is one main difference between the two set component blocks and the unto safe component blocks. There is another difference or another thing that we have to pay attention to is that, okay, we have associated Okay, we have associated twisted modules to these three mark points with G1, G2, and G3. But to define some good notions of conflict blocks, there are some conditions that G1, G2, G3 has to satisfy. And these conditions are subject to the geometry of this Riemann surface, Riemann sphere, and the path you choose. That is, okay, I choose some small circles, epsilon one around x1, epsilon two around x2, and epsilon three around x. And epsilon 3 around x3. Okay? And I define alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 to be three parts starting and ending at this star. So alpha 1 is here. You start from this star, it goes to here, move around this circle, and you go back along gamma 1. So this is alpha 1. And alpha 2, alpha 3 are understood in a similar way. And now you try to think about the homotopic class of alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3. So these three are elements of So these three are elements of this gamma, the fundamental group of P1 with X1, X2, and X2 removed. You think about this space, you remove these three points, and this fundamental group is isomorphic to the free group with two generators. And you can even show that any two of alpha one, alpha two, alpha three are free generators of this fundamental group, gamma. Okay, and also inside this fundamental group. Also, inside this fundamental group, the alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 bracket are subject to this relation. So we also need to require that G3, G1, G2 are subject to the similar relation. Okay, so this is another thing we have to pay attention to when we define the twisted component blocks. Now I want to add, I want to talk about the tensor product part, the permutation theory for transerp VOA. Theory for tensor product VLA. First of all, I'm going to let E be a finite set. So say it is labeled by 1 to N. And I take the tensor product of N pieces of VOAB, and I allege G to be the full permutation group of E, and it permutates the tensor product VOA by permutating the tensor components. So, first of all, this is the result by Baron-Domason, which Nila. Result by Baron Domason, which Nila has mentioned in her talk, which says that, okay, for each G, for each permutation G, small G, you think about all the G orbits inside E. So for each G orbit, you take the small omega. Small omega is one G orbit. For each omega, you take W omega to be an intuitive V module. Okay? And you take the tensor cross. Okay, and you take the tensor product of all these W omega. Omega runs over all the G orbits inside E, and this tensor product comes naturally with a structure of G twisted U module. Okay, so this is the result by Baron Dormation. So this is about modules. And next, I want to show you how the genus zero twisted conformal blocks, which we have seen. Blocks, which we have seen in the previous slides, are related to untwisted higher genus component blocks. So, let me, I need to tell you what are these high genus remote surveys? Where do they come from? How to conspirate it? So, here is the description. We need to consider the branch covering of the P1, the Riemann sphere. So, roughly speaking, these branch coverings are unbranched, which means that these are just ordinary covering space. Ordinary covering space. These are just ordinary coverings outside x1, x2, x3. So outside x1, x2, x3, these are the ordinary covering which we have learned in the first algebraic topology class, which all of us are familiar with. But at this x1, x2, x3, at these so-called branch points, it is not the ordinary covering. It looks like the map Z to Z to the power K. So this is called a branch covering. And we can use branch covering to construct high genius surfaces for. To construct high genus surfaces. For those of you who are not familiar with branch coverings, I give you two examples. So, this is a genus one to genus zero. This is a very old example which maps the elliptic curve to the Z plane. This is the very famous branch covering. And I want to think about the branch coverings of here and X1, X2, X2 are the branch points. And moreover, this set, the inverse image of X1, X2. The inverse image of x1, x2, x3, these are the set. This will be the set of marked points of C. Remember that when I talk about unto the component prof, we choose marked points, right? So x1, x2, x3 are the mark points for p1. And the inverse image is precisely the set of marked points on C, which means that for each point inside this inverse element, I'm going to associate an ordinary module. So on X, on the P side, So on x on the p side for the mark points of p1 associate uh twisted modules on the for the mark points of c I'm going to associate untwisted modules. Okay. So the details, the details are the following. So first, I'm going to tell you how to determine this branched covering. So first, this branch covering is not necessarily connected, but for each connected component, For each kinetic component, is in one-to-one correspondence with a G1, G2, G3 orbit, which I call big omega inside E. So, this is this, there is this one-to-one correspondence. Every this orbit, big omega, corresponds to a connected point C, big omega. And then record that we have an action of the, so this is the fundamental group of this space, right? So this. So, gamma is the fundamental group of this phase. And you have an action of gamma on E by sending each alpha bracket to GJ to have this action. And when you restrict this action to each orbit, you have a one orbit action. You have a transitive action. And this action is equivalent to an action on a coset on G over a subgroup, which I write G omega. Okay, so G so gamma omega. Okay, so G uh so gamma omega. Gamma omega is a co-finite subgroup of gamma. And from our first algebraic topology class, we know that there is a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of fundamental group and the covering space. And you use this correspondence to produce the covering outside the branch points. Okay, so this is how you get the branch covering outside these branch points. But what about X-Deep branch points? X-D branch points can look like this. Points and look like this. So, first of all, you look at the phi inverse x1, x2, x3. These are all the marked points of C omega. It turns out that there is a one-to-one correspondence between if phi inverse xj and the gj orbits. And you can associate these mark points, you can associate the ordering modules to these marked points of C omega. And you also know the branching index 0L. These branching index are given by the size of Given by the size of the GJ orbit, small omega. So, anyway, we have this main theorem. The main theorem says this: you think about the tensor product. So, these are the twisted modules, the permutation twisted modules, W1, cancer, W2, cancer, W3. You can think about a linear functional of this tensor product. You talk about, you can think about whether this linear functional is a conformal block for the twisted, for the permutation twisted modules or not. permutation twisted modules or not you can also think about this tensor product of as the tensor product of these untwisted modules of v and all you can also talk about whether this linear functional is a conformal block for the branch curve in c or not and it turns out that these two are equivalent this same linear functional is a conformal block for the genus zero sphere and the twisted modules if and only if it is a conformal block associated If it is a conformal block associated to the branch covering and the mark points and the interest in modules. So we have these equivalence conditions. And so this gives us a relation between the conformal blocks, genus zero, conformal blocks of permutation twisted modules and the untreated modules. Okay, and I also want to point out that this result does not rely on C2. This result does not rely on C21 and it's all rational. This is a very general structure result for the conformal blocks. And also, this theorem tells you how to calculate the dimension of the twisted conformal blocks for genus zero. In other words, to calculate the fusion rules. Because if you know the genus of each connected component, you can use the factorization property to reduce to the fusion rules for interesting modules. The fusion rules for interesting models and the genus could be explicitly calculated using the remarkable risk formula. And I want to finish my today's talk by mentioning some applications and outlook. So first of all, because now we have a genus zero, we have a relation between genus zero tweet permutative treatise theory and the intuisted high genus theory. And we also have a VOA and conformal correspondence on the genus zero side. On the genus zero side, and actually, so far, all these types of component VOA correspondence are mainly on the genus zero side. So, there is a natural problem about how to generalize them to the high genocide. So, the result we see today gives us one option. That is, okay, you just need to do the genus zero correspondence for the primitive tuition modules. And this amounts to doing the conformal VOA correspondence for hydrangeas modules. And because on the conformal net side, Because on the conformal analysis side, the confusion orbitals are related to multiple interval subfactors or confusion, then it gives this our result gives an explanation of how why this multi-interval result, multi-interval stuff are related to high density of t and these are two problems that I'm interested in, it's fusion problems that I'm interested in, and I also believe that these are quite interesting problems. So, first is that, okay. The problem. So, first is that okay, now we have another new way to understand hygiene. We can use genus zero permutation theory to understand hygiene CFT. So, we try to go further. We try to do more to do more thing about understanding hygienus from genus zero and vice versa to understand genus zero from the point of view of hygiene. So this is one problem. A second problem is to try to prove a similar result for on the conformal SI. For on the conformal S side, because conformance on the conformal S side, we have a definition of conformal block by Mateus, Douglas, and Andre. So it's very natural to think about proving a similar result for the conformal nets. So these are all I want to say. So I want to stop here. Thank you.
