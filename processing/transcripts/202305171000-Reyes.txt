Well, first of all, thank you again for the organizers, Marien, Gabby, and Robert for the invitation. We are glad to be here. Well, the in part of the In fact, the method of our leaf can be applied not only to find the spectrum of the two token of the cycle, but also to the k token of the cycle. Even you cannot show that it can be applied to find the spectrum of a graph when the graph has some symmetries, in particular in this case. Symmetries, in particular, in this case, have circular symmetries. And the problem I explained, Christina, before is that in our case, the method applies when you have orbits of different sizes. When you apply the automotive group in the graph, you have orbits of different sizes. And so it cannot be considered as a cover of the original graph because of this. Because of this. Okay. Then, as the method was already explained, I prefer, in order not to be too much repetitive, I prefer to change a little the direction and speak about other two methods for computing. To methods for computing the sum spectrum of the tokens, but for graphs with special symmetries, in particular wall regular graphs and distant regular graphs. This gives you a chance to speak a little more about preview results about these nine graphs. But these are the notations for the Jacinti spectrum and for. And for the La Flacian spectrum of the particularly, I will focus on the spectral radius of or the index of the utera. As you know, it has many applications in finding. Panding or bounding the device parameters, parameter, radio, automation number, etc. Well, I am lucky that Christina and Monica present me. I don't have to to say what is a token graph oxygen problem. You can use these examples. Well, what about the spectrum of the token? Related to what I want to explain to you. There are these three results. One of them, you already know this one, they say that the spectrum of the K token is contained in the spectrum of the H token or Visa Vesa. The spectrum of H token is contained. The petrol hoverage token is containing the kick token. But look at this previous paper, the Adena, Gotzil, Robert and Polov, that they found that all the strong B irregular graph with the same parameters are cospectral symmetric squares. Symmetric square is the same as two topics. And a very recent paper, it is a Recent paper, it is an archive, this one, that gives bounds. When you go from the spectrum of the spectrum of FK, there are, of course, New Eigen values that call them non-trivial. And then in this paper, he proves this bounds for the non-trivial eigenvalue. For the for the non-trivial eigenvalues of the of the k token, uh the eigenvalues that are in the k token but not in the k minus one token. Okay, but look at this, basically is a constant in our results that look at this that the eigenvalues of the fate token is. Is basically this is the spectral radius, and this is the actual connectivity. And basically, you see, is k times bounded above for the k times the spectral radius. Well, it's interesting. I could not resist the temptation to explain you what is the local spectrum of the graph because it is used in some of our basic results. And it was interviewed by myself and Carida in 1997. And it is defined as follows. You see, it's Is this the eigenspace? And so you have the unitary vector representing the vertex u and you project this vertex. It will be Will be by the time potential that project onto the eigen space, and you compute the square normal this projection. Okay, and we call this the new project did this better on this on design. On this eigen space, and at least the same that looking at the diagonal entries of the importance, and it happened that these numbers satisfy properties which are similar to the whole multiplicities. Of course, such a multiplicity, such a local multiplicity not need to be integer, right? Not yet to be integer, okay, and in particular in the end they might be zero for some eigenvalues and some vertices. But in any case, for the spectral radius, the local multiplicity of the spectral radius is always positive because these are the entities. Why delay? Well, basically the idea is when you are looking at the graph from a given vertex, you can find some properties of this. Of this graph, but looking at it from this vertex, for one given vertex, what is more important, what is the important thing is to know the local spectrum of this vertex, not of the whole graph, but only the local spectrum of these vertics. And so you see the properties of the local multiplicities when you add the local multiplicities. Local multiplicities of all the eigenvalues for one vector, you get one. The same way when you compute the trace of the metric, you get n or the sum of the multiplicities in there. And moreover, when you add the multiplicities of one eigenvalue, but for all the vertices, you get the whole multiplicity. You get the whole multiplicity. So things happen as the global multiplicity splits into the vertices. And so, as I told you, this allows to allow you to calculate things. For instance, when you want to compute the number of cosmets rooted at a given vertex, use the local multiplicities at these vertex. Well, that's a good similar results. And of course, the U local spectrum is defined by Vicky, Vicky adding values which are not which multiplicity which are not node. Okay. And we use this concept mainly, we use this concept with Gravity and myself. With Garrigan and myself to prove the so-called spectral theorem, that is a quasi-spectral characterization of distant regular graphs. Probably the spectrum of a graph and some basically that there are numbers. If this is the diameter, you have these vertex. Knowing there are numbers of vertices which are a maximum distance of a given vertex. The maximum distance of a given vertex and the spectrum, you can decide if the graph is distance regular or not. Okay, so this is because we call passive spectral characterization. In particular, this was used by Van Dam and Cullen to know the first infinite families of numerous sensitive distant regulatory graphs. So, at this moment, or the distant regular graph we knew. Graph with new all the infinite families were also vertical sensitive. Modifying the Grandman graphs and using the result to prove that the optimal graph were distant regular, they managed to prove that they were also distant regular. And another tool we use, this was also also introduced by Mars. Also, also introduced by Monica the case of regular partitions. So, only to point to this, okay? It's a characterization of a regular partition. If the characteristic matrix of the partition satisfy this condition in the case of the adjacency matrix, or this condition in the case of the Laplacian, you can state that you are. State that you are dealing with a regular partition. And from this result, you can easily deduce how the leaves, the eigenvectors of the adjacent symmetry leaves to the eigenvectors of the quaiens leads to the eigenvectors of the big Vectors of the B graph. And so the spectrum of the Causion is contained in the spectrum of the graph, as Monica explained. And this can be considered as a generalization of wall regular graphs. A graph is wall regulatory, the number of possible walls prototype given vectors or a given length or given length or the L walks put as a given vertice only depends on the of the length of the vertices for instance since the the possible vertices of length two are the degree of all regular graph is in particular regular and in fact all the distant regular graphs are more regular but the convergence is not War regular, but the conversion of two is the more general set, the set of war regular graphs. It was introduced by Glotson and McKay. And it happened that these are equivalent characterization. It's regular, only if it is spectrally irregular. Spectrally irregular, it means that the local spectrum of inverted is the same. So it vectors have the same local vector PCBs. And also the And also, this is also a result with the spectrum of the delayed methods graphs for any two R disease with the hypospectral, another characteristic. It can be to say more than this. I will play later. Well, let's go now to the spectrum radius of token graphs. Spectrum radius or token graphs in this case. And I basically mark that the approval of which it is based on the local multiplicities and the result I gave you before about the closure walks. You can compute the the sc the spectral radius of any graph by computing these limits. Computing these limits, this or this? This is the definition right here: the number of walls starting from a given vector or the number of possible walls. This is general for any graph. And we use two two parameters that are defined in the following way. In the following way. For all the given subsets or a given size, you are considering the spectrum radio of the u-related subgraph with the condition that the size cannot be greater than the disconnectivity in order not to disconnect the raft. And so taking the maximum and the minimum of this. Minimum of these u-delated so graphs of the spectral radius, you get these two parameters which are relevant to our study. For particular graphs, well, if G were regular, this parameter is just the spectral values of irrelevant what vertical. What better you delay? You always obtain the same spectrum ratios. Moreover, this distant regular graph, this was a very nice result of Brauer and Pullen, proved that the maximum, every distant regular graph with V D has maximum vector connectivity. It was a long-standing conjecture and they did. They conjecture, and they manage to prove it. And now, Christina and Edwin Van Damme and myself, in fact, proved that the spectrum of the u-delated subgraphs only depends on the distance field with vertices of u. This is a character is another characterization of the distance regular graph. I mean you have a distance regular graph. I mean, you have this everywhere now, you have, for instance, you are looking for all the triples in such a way, saying that these two vertices are distant two, these two vertices are distant three, and these two vertices are distant four, to put an example. So, in any relating these three vertices, or every any triple of vertices satisfying this condition, you get the cospectral graph. You get the co-spectral graph. And this is a characterization also of the standard YD. And so this allows us to compute these parameters only for some subsets when the gravity is unlike. For instance, you want to compute the case of 2, you only need to look at the actual distance L. Well, and the result is, one of the results is the one. And one was based on preview results of Christina Ernest Gariga and myself and Nikitov saying something about the spectral radiation. How do you think that you? And so you have a series of bounds, lower bounds and upper bounds, of the spectral radius of the top k. But you again, you see, basically, you see the k the spectral radius of f k is k times the spectral radius of g, of the original graphs. And this is a constant in all the results. And this is a constant in all the results. In all the results of F appears that the constant k. In the case of 2, you also have this. And moreover, if in the case of K2 and not having poor regularity, you have exact values of the spectral value of the two. the spectral radius of the two token in terms of the of the spectral radius of the original graph. See again two and two equals two. Some consequences or some examples when as in the spectral radius of the path or n vertices is this one and the spectral radius of the completeness uh bipartite uh graph. Very patterned graph. And then it is one, you have that the spectral radius of the two token of the path is bounded above this cosine. And in the case, the spectral value of the cycle is precisely this value. And the the spectral value of the of the two token are the complete graph and is this one. graph and then it's this one and these are some examples our you see again for the spectral idea of the path you compute easily of course this number of vertices is much greater than this than our two is the binomial and non-binomial two but you see the this the spectral radius of the two tokens The spectral radius of the two token of the cycle is two times the cycle of the spectral radius of the path. And these are two simple particular cases. This was also mentioned by Monica. Okay, spectral radio of the cycle is K24. And again, you see one, two, one square root of two to square. Round square root of two to the square root of two. Well, and in the case of distant regular graph, we found the following. We found that if a distant regular graph has these intersection numbers or these quotient metrics, what happens that you are considering the token of this. The token of this graph, of this tangular graph, the quotient matrix of the token, of the quotient Laplacian matrix of the token, is basically this submatrix here. You remove the first row and the first column, and so you get this matrix. You multiply this metric by two, and then you get the question matrix of the two topics. Okay, in the case of this time regularity. That regularity. This is the lemma. This is the lemma. That relates the quotient metrics of the distant resolve graph and the quotient metrics of the token of this graph. Of course, as you know, this spectral method, you see again the two. To the matrix, you see again the two, okay. We are going to consider the two tokens. Of course, the eigenvalue of the matrix are eigenvalues of the two tokens, but not necessarily all of them, a part of them. And the same for the La Pacian metrics. I don't know if the question La Pacian metric has been used very often, but it's defined as a spectrum. There is no problem. As a spectrum, there is no problem, and this is what happens then. Because very known results say that the spectral radius of the quotient of the graph coincide with the spectral radius of the graph. And so you have this, you can. You can compute the spectral value of the two tokens from the spectral radius of the quotient graph, which only depends on the parameters of the distant regular graph. Remember, we are dealing with distant regular graph here. And whenever you change it by party, then the same happens for the two token. And then what are some consequences in terms of the five results we mentioned? The results of what's your product product and the results of both. In the pain of the first case, in the pain of the first result, now we have that all these term regular with the same parameters, have symmetry squares that two tokens, okay, with the same. Tokens okay, with the same spectral radius because, as we saw, the spectral radius of the two tokens is computed by using the perception numbers of the distant pierograph. So, they have the same distance, the section number, they have the same spectral values. And this is, in fact, another problem for conjecture you want. Could be true that. Could be true that the same happens, I mean the same result of this paper, but not for a strongly regular graph, but for distant regular graphs. At least you know that the spectral radius is the same. And some eigenvalues are the same because the quasi-matrix has some other eigenvalues. This would be an open problem for it. Product for the meeting. And in the main audio results, we have that for the two token of the regular graph, you have this bounce. Again, with the constant. And well, I think it's basically. I think it's basically all. These are some references, and this is the end. Thank you very much. Any questions, comments? I I want to make a comment because probably the people that exist in Portugal s here. See, there are some important observeds. That's very nice because this graph is related with only one token. It's related with some graph that used to us to construct polytops. That I don't remember, but the graphicahedron is related with this because if you have a token in a vertex and you move In a vertex, and you move by the edges, you construct the graphic ahedron. And maybe a nice question is. With only one token, sorry, with only one token. With only one token, the skeleton of the graphic ahedron is your graph. And the graphicahedron is a polytope that was inspired us with the permutahedron. But you, when you only have one token, no, no, no. No, no, no, because you move well with this definition, I mean, well, you only have one. Let me think exactly. Oh, it might be some variance. Yeah, no, because you have yeah, the idea is that you have the token and you construct the graph that you move. Ah, yeah, you have exactly the same graph when me. But you only have our token. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I I have to think exactly what is the have to think exactly what is the yeah because you might be the entire yeah yeah yeah because you say okay you have to go to this to this to this option yeah there is that is related but well let let me think what it's exactly yeah because you have the graph okay i have i have to think and i i want to remember what is the relationship yeah because you you you in the permutahedron you have all the permutations and you are you can move you construct a graph with all the shapes that you can do right yes with a generating loop or the generating sort of the set of the group on the right generating when you consider the token you lose symmetries you lose I don't know I don't know. In very few cases, you will get a very symmetric graph when you look very you have different orbits. No, the idea is that you create a new graph and you construct a graph that if you can move to the to some place or not. But yeah, if you can move to some place, you have an. Have you removed one or two stairs or something like that? Something like that. Well, it's really, really related, and I don't know what happened with two tokens, but your graph is really nice and interesting, the spectra of you. Well, I have to say that the token graph are not our graphs because they were considered long before. Yeah. And they studied the Hamilton Tomicity and many, many things about the Great GIA. The work yeah and uh thank you, Michelaisa. Some people want to share something or have a question or also ask people that yeah, and to the people in the question? No, no. Okay, they say only hello. They say only hello. I will leave the open problem. Yeah? Do you want? Okay. Well, we have probably half an hour before the coffee break and we have later a a session of exchange our res our something that we was working yesterday. Yesterday, and I don't know if you can start with this part of the plans, and we go to take the coffee break and after the Dimitri's talk and come back to other groups. I don't know if some group can start or want to start to share with us something in this half hour. I think because the idea is come back after. The idea is come back after the mystery store is have a small session with a preliminary result or something that is going to share with the rest of the face. Each group has some representative that wants to say something, then you're very welcome to do so. We can do it. Yeah. Okay. It's only five minutes. Yeah, it's only five minutes. It's a smallest one, that's more important.
