Everyone, in our next lecture today, we will continue exploring wind more and we're going to focus on offshore winds. Our instructor is Dr. Adam Monaghan from University of Victoria. Thank you very much, Louise. And yeah, I've been very much enjoying the summit school so far. I've been learning a lot. And I really appreciate the extent to which the other instructors have laid the ground. Have laid the groundwork for things I'm going to be talking about here. So, hopefully, everyone has been brought along up to the point where these slides make sense. And just in case you're curious about the fact that I identify this as part five, despite the fact this is the first of my lectures this week, this does follow on directly from the lectures I gave last year. The slides have been posted on the ShareDrive and summarized by Richard over the last couple of days. Okay, so by way of outline, I'm just going to again just briefly review planetary boundary layer physics, maybe not as rapidly as, or not as in as much detail as I would have done in the absence of Richard's overview, review session. Then, because I think whenever you're interested in interrogating some physical system, it's really good to try to understand what the available data sources are. It's going to talk a bit. sources are and it's going to talk a bit about the kinds of the kinds of data that we can make use of in trying to understand winds over the ocean. I'll talk a little bit about global scale observations of sea surface winds and some marine boundary layer processes, what makes the boundary layer over the ocean different than over land. Fundamental physics is the same in most ways, but there are some essential differences in detail. Essential differences in detail. I'll talk a bit about how the sea state, which are basically how wavy the ocean surface is, how that affects this drag coefficient that we've been talking about. I'll talk a bit about how static stability influences wind profiles and the way that plays out over the ocean. So, static stability, again, referring to how potential temperature varies with altitude. And then finally, I'm going to talk about wake effects. About wake effects. So, what happens downstream of some sort of obstacle? It could be a turbine, it could be a wind farm, it could be something else. And then, how, in particular, stratification influences the recovery of the wake downwind. Okay, so by way of review, and before I get going into the main material here, I would like to encourage people, if you have questions, please feel free to just put up your hand or call out if I'm not looking your way. Out, I'm not looking your way. Okay, the planetary boundary again, um, it's the lowestmost part of the atmosphere which is in contact with the underlying surface. And we're going to define the boundary there as that part of the lowermost atmosphere, which is actively turbulent. And it's important because it's where we live, but also it's important because it mediates the exchanges of mass, energy, and momentum between the underlying surface. Between the underlying surface and the atmosphere. And when I say surface here, I mean both the solid land surface and the water surfaces. As we've heard quite a bit about, processes in the planetary boundary layer are strongly affected by stratification, so how potential temperature varies with altitude, as well as large-scale pressure gradients. So that's the weather Richard was talking about, which we can, for the purposes of About. For the purposes of thinking about these boundary layer processes, we can think about the weather as being imposed from the outside somehow. We know that shear, so changes in the velocity with spatial coordinate, and generally we think about that as changes of velocity in the vertical direction. The presence of shear could help generate turbulence. And we're going to measure the intensity of turbulence by something we've called turbulence kinetic energy. And so, similarly, unstable stratification. If I have very warm air below, colder air above, that can cause buoyant motion within the air. That generates turbulence as well. That produces turbulence, kinetic energy. In contrast, if I have stable stratification, so warmer air above a cooler surface, then that means that you actually have to do work to vertically displace. To vertically displace parcels of air that tends to consume turbulence kinetic energy, it inhibits the turbulence. And we've seen how this plays out in general terms, and we're going to talk a bit in these lectures about what this looks like over the ocean. Reviewing these power spectra, which we have seen a couple of times in the last couple of days, focusing here on the left-hand panel, this shows power. Panel. This shows power in an observed wind time series over a broad range of time scales. So the frequency is given on the bottom of the horizontal axis and in the top gives the corresponding period. So we, to the left of the figure, have long time scales of a year, and to the right, we have short time scales of a minute to a second. And as Richard talked about the other day, we can see that at 10 meters, there's a reasonably clear distinction between two different colors. Distinction between two different classes of variability, the relatively short time scale turbulence and the relatively long time scale weather. And so, if we're interested in trying to understand the evolution of processes on longer 5, 10, 15 minutes, something like that, we can undertake this Reynolds decomposition, which Richard talked about extensively yesterday and Mustafa was talking about this morning. Which Mustafa was talking about this morning, a more modern analog of the same idea that one is breaking down slowly varying part of the system, rapidly varying part of the system, and then focuses that you focus the dynamical attention on the slowly evolving part of the system, but because of the non-linearities and the dynamics, you can't ignore the fast variability, but you have to somehow account for it. And so we've seen these. And so we've seen these equations already, and we're going to see them again tomorrow. So these are the Reynolds averaged equations for conservation of momentum, which is the first two. That's the horizontal momentum budget. Conservation of energy, thermodynamic energy specifically, which is the third equation. The last equation is conservation of mass. And so this is after we've applied this averaging and we've assumed that our turbulence statistics are horizontally homogeneous, which is not to say that we have the same. Not to say that we have the same fluctuation of the wind at one place as we do at an adjacent place. What we're saying is that the statistics are the same, and so all of our horizontal derivatives of averages are vanishing. This is a great simplification, particularly in complex terrain, anywhere you have any sort of surface heterogeneity. But over the ocean, actually, this is often a reasonably good approximation once you get away from coastal areas where there are. From coastal areas where there are obvious horizontal homogeneities. And again, our state variables, we have the components of the wind as a wind vector. We have our geostrophic wind vector, which is the UG and Vg. Now, you might recall a couple of days ago, Richard introduced this notion of geostrophic balance, which is a perfect balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. Gradient force and the Coriolis force in the horizontal, which is a really good leading-order approximation to the character of the flow outside of the boundary layer on scales of more than 100 kilometers or so. It's like a larger scale flow. But we can also invoke this notion of geostrophic balance by saying I can rewrite my equations of motion, and everywhere I originally had a horizontal pressure gradient force, I can replace that with the flow. The flow, the wind components that would be in perfect geostrophic balance with that pressure gradient force. And that produces what we call our geostrophic wind. And so in these first two equations here, what we have on the right-hand side, that F VG and that F UG, those terms are essentially proxies for the horizontal pressure gradient force. It's just been rewritten. But one of the nice things about rewritten But one of the nice things about rewriting it in this way is that we see that time variability in our winds is strongly influenced by the mismatch between what the actual wind is and what it would be if it was in perfect geostrophic balance. That these so-called ageostrophic terms, that imbalance between the true wind and the geostrophic wind, that is what is playing an important role. That is what is playing an important role in driving the time variability of our wind components. And actually, we're going to exploit that fact tomorrow and building some idealized reduced models of sea surface winds. Theta, our potential temperature, and F, our Coriolis parameter. So again, these are describing, these equations of motion describe motions that are at least to some extent influenced by the fact. Extent influenced by the fact that the Earth is rotating. And again, let's shrink this a little bit. We cannot neglect these terms, which involve our turbulent covariances in general. They are going to influence the slowly evolving part of the flow. And so, what we need to do is parameterize them. We need somehow to represent. Parameterized, and we need somehow to represent them in some way that allows us to solve this set of equations, which is not at this point closed. Because I have, to go back to the idea of what a closed set of equations is, I have more unknowns in these equations than I have equations, because at this point, before parameterizing them, our turbulent fluxes are unknowns. Could you remind me? you could you remind me how this was an approximation of the nail-stokes equation like how is it simplified it's it's why okay it's well it is an approximation because what we've done is we've done a Reynolds averaging and we have assumed that our dynamics or turbulence is horizontally homogeneous. So those are things we've done. Now, why is it a simplification? It still looks. Done. Now, why is it a simplification? It still looks pretty complicated. It's still a nonlinear partial differential equation. It's simplified because it means that I go back to my power spectrum. Even though it's still a nonlinear partial differential equation, it's a nonlinear partial differential equation which is describing this range of time scales and not this range of time scales. And so I don't have to explicitly represent scales from, you know. From a second to a year in my model, or in physical space, from a millimeter to 10 to the seventh meters, which is the sort of typical scale of large-scale planetary waves. That's 10 orders of magnitude in linear scale, which because we're working in three spatial dimensions represents, you would have to have a state variable of size 10 to the 30 if we weren't making this approximation. So that would matter when we are. So that would matter when we are numerically solving it. Absolutely. This is done for pragmatic reasons very often. But also, it does allow us to say, again, going back to from a more observational perspective, where we have this fairly clear distinction between weather variability and turbulence variability, it does allow us to really focus on, if we don't really care about the turbulence for its own sake, then some. Its own sake, and in some areas, that is a really heretical thing to say. But if you're really interested in the slowly evolving part of the flow, how things change from hour to hour or day to day, and you don't care what little world of wind sat where, when, you just want to average over it, then this gives us a simpler set of equations to deal with, focuses the model on that range of scales. So again, just thinking about some of the sort of characteristic ideas that we use in thinking about the planetary boundary layer, we have this notion of the surface layer, which is very poorly defined and led to some controversy in our conversations for the last couple of days. That bottom, roughly 10% of the atmosphere, of the boundary layer, rather, where turbulent fluxes, although they do change with altitude. Although they do change with altitude, they don't change much. And in that layer, we had talked about some of these dimensional analysis arguments, which give us some suggestion as to what we might expect the wind profiles to be within that surface layer. And we saw that we had our vertical wind distribution as having this logarithmic component. As having this logarithmic component, if we take this kind of classic, what we can call Monen-Abuchov similarity theory and apply this to thinking about these profiles. So we have a logarithmic profile with a correction, which is determined by essentially the stability of the atmosphere, right? So whether or not we have warm fluid below cold fluid or cold fluid below warm fluid. The question came up yesterday as to what this uppercase L is. Uppercase L is. This is the so-called Abakov length, which has this very strange definition in terms of the friction velocity. That's U star, which is a quantity which is measuring how the turbulence is moving momentum around and our surface energy flux. So W prime theta prime is how the turbulence is moving energy in the vertical. It turns out, actually, this quantity L here under stable stratification. L here under stable stratification can be interpreted as sort of roughly speaking the altitude above the surface you have to go before the shear or the buoyant suppression of turbulence is stronger than the shear production of turbulence. So, right down near the bottom of the atmosphere, we have our strongest shears. We're always going to be generating turbulence. But under stable stratification, if you go high enough, eventually, High enough, eventually the effect of stratification will start taking, that will overwhelm the production of turbulence energy by the shear. So that's kind of a physical interpretation. And then sorry, can you explain that again? This stratification overwhelms. So you mean if you think about it. So it's that is irrelevant at that scale, or will you? So if I think about the turbulence kinetic energy budget, where I have terms which Kinetic energy budget, where I have terms which are generating turbulence of kinetic energy and those which are taking it away. Then, right at the surface, the effects of stratification are generally negligible because the shear is so strong. But as you go up, the shear gets weaker and eventually the buoyant consumption of turbulence kinetic energy overwhelms the shear production. Yeah. Yes, I was being quite imprecise in my characterization. And we also have, of course, this quantity we've talked about at some point. Course, this quantity we've talked about at some length, which we'll talk more about today, the roughness length, which is this effective altitude above what you would normally think of as being the actual surface, where we are going to say that our eddy average, our slowly varying winds are going to rest. This is, as Richard had emphasized, not a very well-defined quantity in many ways, and it spans orders of magnitude. It is nevertheless at the heart of the way that we actually model. Way that we actually model exchanges of momentum, energy in weather and climate models. So it is something that's reasonably well studied. We're going to actually be focusing over the next couple of days with our focus on offshore winds at this lower range of Z-naught scales, where typically over the ocean, Z-naught, our roughness length is on the order of 10 to the minus 3 meters. And we're going to see that there's some interesting effects over the ocean, which we don't see over land in the same kind of way, based on the fact that when you blow on the ocean, the ocean moves. When you blow on land, it doesn't. Which is actually an oversimplification because vegetation does move, but it doesn't propagate like waves do. All right, so that's my very brief review. All right, so that's my very brief review of the material that we're going to be building on the next couple of days. Any questions about that? So how do we know what we know about the winds offshore? There are multiple sources of data that we can make use of to study offshore winds. They all have advantages and disadvantages. And so what I'd like to do now is just briefly go through some of those and indicate, from my perspective anyways, or my experience, what those. In my experience, what those strengths and weaknesses tend to be. Generally speaking, generally speaking, the best quality wind measurements you can get are from an anemometer, which is a measuring instrument you put in the wind, the wind moves past it, and it tells you what the wind, speed, and direction are. Those could be on fixed towers or on meteorological buoys. Or on meteorological buoys. Now, when I say best quality, I do put an asterisk there because not all anemometers are equally good. We've talked a little bit about some of the old-fashioned ways of measuring the wind with anemometers, a so-called cup and vane anemometer, which you may have seen on a weather station that's been set up on a building, whereas the wind blows. There are some cups that spin around and a weather vane that adjusts itself to whatever direction the wind is coming from. Direction the wind is coming from. But an instrument like that, there's frictional couplings. If the wind isn't blowing fast enough, the cup doesn't spin. And so you get all of these measurements of wind speed zero, which aren't zero. They're just a low wind. And so, you know, that happens. And then sometimes they get old and they get gunk in them and they don't spin properly anymore. And at sea, you have corrosion from seawater and all sorts of things. From seawater and all sorts of things. But if you have something like a sonic anemometer, which measures wind speed using, by measuring the Doppler shift of sound waves, those can actually provide incredibly accurate local wind information. Often these are at hourly resolution. If you are at a particularly well-instrumented site, that might even go down to even go down to a 10-minute resolution, or if they're actually actively trying to measure turbulence, you might even get a 10th of a second resolution. But typically, operationally, you get about an hourly resolution. And because these are often deployed for operational meteorological purposes, we have records that might span years or decades. So you can get really good statistics. But they tend to have poor spatial coverage. So just to give you a couple of examples, we've heard a little We've heard a little bit about this so far, and we'll see this again. These three towers that have been deployed by the German government in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. So these are associated, they're platforms with meteorological masts that allow us to actually get a lot of information about offshore winds. But you see, this is a very large geographical area, Germany here. Geographical area, Germany here, Denmark, and Sweden. These are sparse observations, right? These are individual points in a very large area. As another example, a figure from a paper I wrote several years ago, looking at winds from buoys offshore of the west coast of Canada. We have here eight buoys, just to give you a sense of scale. This is Vancouver Island. Island. I don't know why here. Eight buoys covering a very large part of the ocean. So, really good observations, actually, but you know, pretty sparse. Those are fixed? Those are fixed operational buoys. Yeah, yeah. So these aren't Lagrangian trajectories or anything like that. They're just, these are, these are put out. They're actually wave buoys, but they also have surface meteorological observations. Surface meteorological observations. Yes. By hourly resolution, you detect they measure it once every hour or do they average it? Yeah, it's a good question. Typically, that's an hourly average. Yeah, yeah. But it's a good thing to check because sometimes when meteorological information is provided to you, they tell you what the resolution is. They're actually giving you the sampling rate, which is a very different thing. Which is a very different thing. And even from the same data set, different variables might be sampled and some might be averaged. That's why net CDF files with the metadata can be very nice if they have been put together carefully. They give you that value-added information. Something that's been of increasing importance because meteorological towers are extraordinarily expensive to set up and operate. To set up and operate. And if you want to have vertical profiles of the wind, instruments using LIDAR have been extremely effective. So this is kind of like radar by using visible light. And what these instruments do is they have beams of visible light, which as that light moves along, it scatters off of aerosol particles in the air. And that backscattered radiation is measured by the device. And based on the Doppler shift of that backscattered, And based on the Doppler shift of that backscattered radiation, they could figure out how those aerosol particles were moving. And assuming they're just carried by the flow, that allows us to estimate what the winds are. These have been used for quite some time on land, and increasingly we're seeing these so-called LIDAR systems or floating LIDAR deployed. Again, very expensive, and you can imagine how difficult this is. You've got this instrument sitting on top of a buoy, which in the waves, in the waves. Buoy, which in the waves in the wind is doing this, and so what the local vertical is is changing all the time, and so it's a very complicated signal processing problem to actually then determine what it was actually observing in terms of the flow of the air, but it seems to work pretty well. And you can get up hundreds of meters easily and get very nice profiles with quite high resolution and time. But if the air is too clean and you don't have enough backup, And you don't have enough backscattering aerosols, you don't get a good signal. Now, typically over the ocean, that's not a problem because there's usually a lot of sea salt in the air from breaking waves. They're incredibly expensive. These are not things that most people will just buy and set up in their backyards. And again, because of that cost, there's an associated sparse spatial coverage. But you can get really nice data. So this is. Data. So, this is a time series over four hours of winds from 12 meters to 200 meters. The colors show the wind speed. I'm not going to go into details about what the dots are. What we can see is you get very nice information about the flow in the bottom couple hundred meters of the atmosphere from this particular LIDAR system. So, these capture vertical information. At one fixed point. Well, it's one fixed spatial point. Yeah, so they spin around. And so they actually measure some volume of air, which, and that volume changes as you move away from the surface. So there are some nuances in how you interpret this, particularly, I mean, if you look at the, say, 10-minute averaged quantities, those nuances may not matter so much. But if you then look at the deviations from those 10-minute averaged quantities to get some idea of what they call turbulence intensity, then that is going to be more of an issue. Um, then that is going to be more of an issue. So it is a measure of three-dimensional three-velocity patterns, horizontal primarily. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then my other question, which is general to this and the other types of dynamometers, is there a best practice for what the sample rate ought to be for these averaging? It depends on what your question is. But you can, the best practice, I'm not going to flip back to it, but if you look at that power. Flip back to it, but if you look at that power spectrum, you can see what you lose if you average on different time scales. For sure. Yeah, so by just looking at the power spectrum, you can see if you're averaging, what the hell, off the back. You know, if you are averaging at a time scale, I can't do this for a reason. Yeah, if you're averaging at a time scale, right, that is. A time scale, right, that is over here, then you don't lose that much of the variance. Remembering as well, this is a semi-or the log-log plot. So the vertical axis is logarithmically scaled here. But once you start averaging, say, here, then you're right in the middle of your turbulence, and you might actually wonder what you've got left. Some mixture between the turbulent part of the flow, the slowly varying part of the flow. So, yeah. So, yeah, so to some extent, it is problem-dependent, but you can use if you have good high-resolution observations. Yeah. And actually, I did a, it wasn't so much a wind project, but I did a project with a student several years ago looking at high frequency observations of surface solar radiation 100 hertz with pyranometers and trying to understand how much averaging you have to do before you actually start. You have to do before you actually start significantly degrading that signal, and you can actually do this kind of thing systematically. But the problem is, you got to have to have the high-resolution data first to know what you're going to lose. Okay, if you want better spatial coverage, another class of anemometers are so-called scatterometers. And these are very, very interesting from a physical perspective. Interesting from a physical perspective. So, most of you will drink tea or coffee. You'll drink hot beverages, right? And you get something that's too hot. And what do you do to try to cool it down? You blow on the surface. When you blow on the surface of your tea or your coffee, you'll often see these little ripples that form. Little waves. These little waves that form are so-called capillary waves. And these are waves for which the restoring force. For which the restoring force is the surface tension of the fluid. And they have a characteristic wavelength, typically a couple of centimeters. And so, what scatter operators do is they use radar with about a two centimeter wavelength, and they beam it down at the ocean surface, and they measure the backscatter. And by understanding this backscatter of this radar, which has about the same wavelength as the little waves at the surface, they can actually figure out. Surface, they can actually figure out what those capillary waves are in terms of their orientation and their magnitude. So, for people that have done degrees in physics, this is a problem of Bragg scattering. And then from that inversion, you can actually figure out what the surface turbulent momentum flux is. And using the formulas that we've talked about, you can infer what the winds are. And that produces scatterometer data. And that produces scatterometer data. And these are operational. They've been, we've had scatterometers on satellites operationally for two and a half decades, anyways. They are hugely important for weather prediction because they tell us about winds over the ocean in places we wouldn't have observations otherwise. Global observations, kind of. Now, at any given place, it might only be once or twice a day, depending on what the orbit of the satellite is. What is the orbit of the satellite? In terms of downside, you know, really what they're measuring are those surface stresses. They're measuring the surface turbulent momentum flux, and you have to translate that into a wind, a vector wind. So that involves a bunch of the approximations. We've talked about up to this point. And also, at least historically, they have trouble seeing through clouds that are raining because the raindrops are about the same size, they're not quite. Same size. They're not quite a couple centimeters, but they get up to, you know, five millimeters or so, and they scatter the radar. But, you know, if we have a look, this is a figure I made several years ago showing the number of observations per quarter degree by quarter degree box over the ocean in a seven year period. And you see that, and the color scale is just simply the raw number of observations we got in many parts of the ocean over that. In many parts of the ocean, over that seven-year period, in those small boxes, we had more than 3,500 observations. And that was only 2005, right? That was 20 years ago I made this plot. So we've got a lot more observations now. But you can also see that there are these places where there are relatively few observations, like in the western Pacific and the northern Indian Ocean, and in a band that crosses the equatorial Pacific and the Equatorial Atlantic. The equatorial Atlantic. People that study meteorology and climate dynamics will know these as the intertropical convergence zones, where you have a lot of rising air and a lot of precipitation. And you also see these funny cross-hatching artifacts that are associated with essentially just the swath, just the orbit of the satellite. But depending on what you're doing, these could be a remarkably useful data set. Useful data set. And then finally, we have reanalysis products, which we've talked about a bit up to this point, which we've tried to emphasize are not really data. They're model products, but they're model products that have been brought into as close agreement as possible with real data. And so actually, Mustafa talked earlier on about this notion of data assimilation. And that's, you know, in general terms, it's the process by which these models are brought into accord with observations. With observations. And what's great about them? Global high-resolution representation on a uniform grid. Right, these are very clean data sets. Many of them are many decades long in terms of the information they provide. Contemporary reanalysis products are at a quarter degree resolution, so very high resolution. But their model products, and particularly surface winds, are going to be influenced. Winds are going to be influenced by how the models that are used parameterize those turbulent fluxes within the boundary layer. They do assimilate scatterometer observations for the period of time they exist. So they are making use of, they're leveraging these observations, these satellite observations. And in my experience, for the problems that I have looked at, and I don't want to say this is true for every And I don't want to say this is true for every problem we might look at over the ocean. Reanalysis products over the ocean are generally quite good, particularly surface winds. They're in good agreement with the other data products that I've looked at to ask similar questions. I wouldn't say this over land. And we could talk later on about why, but the boundary over land has some other complexities. The boundary over land has some other complexities. In particular, it suffers from a lot of these horizontal homogeneity issues or heterogeneity issues that we've talked a lot about. Right over the ocean, things are pretty horizontally homogeneous. And again, my caveat is the reanalysis products are pretty good if you stay away from the coastlines. So again, if you are interested in thinking about offshore winds, all of these different data sets will provide you information, but it's always good to go in knowing something about. Go in knowing something about the strengths and weaknesses of what data set you're looking at. Because you don't want to spend all your time modeling data artifacts. Okay. How do winds differ over the ocean relative to over the land? There's a number of differences. I'll kind of run through them here and then I'll touch upon several of them as we go along. The first thing about winds over the ocean. The first thing about winds over the ocean that is different than winds over the land is that they're faster. Generally speaking. In general, that's because, in a very simple explanation, the surface roughness over the ocean is generally much smaller than over the land. And so for the same wind speed, the surface drag, the surface turbulent momentum flux, is smaller over the ocean than it would be over the land. Than it would be over the land. So, from a wind energy perspective, right, offshore wind is great because the resource is stronger. Once you get away from coastal regions, generally speaking, the day-night variability of winds over the ocean is quite small. Richard talked at length about diurnal variability of the winds and argued that it really had to do. Argued that really had to do on land with the day-night variations in surface cooling and heating, right, which changed from having a stable boundary layer to an unstable boundary layer. Water surfaces generally have much smaller diurnal cycles of temperature than land surfaces do. There's a number of reasons for that, one of which is that the heat capacity of water is very large. Another is that Another is that when light hits the surface of water, it penetrates, depending on the wavelength, maybe a couple tens of meters down. Whereas light, when it hits a land surface, doesn't, right? You can go five meters down in the water and you can still see. You go five meters down under dirt, you don't. All right. And so the energetic exchanges are really concentrated at the surface on land and in the At the surface on land and in the water, it's distributed. But that doesn't mean that we don't have variations between stable and unstable conditions. It's just that over the ocean, they're generally driven more by horizontal transports. So if you blow cold air over a warm ocean surface, then you get unstable stratification. If you blow warm air over a cold surface, you get stable stratification. Warm air over a cold surface, you get stable stratification. Now, this can also be influenced by internal oceanographic processes which influence the surface temperature. So, for example, upwelling, which is when water moves upwards in the ocean. And generally, ocean water is colder the deeper you get. That brings up cold water. So, that can also affect surface temperature and surface stratification. One of the big differences, another big difference, I should say, between Another big difference, I should say, between land and water is the fact that the water surface is dynamic. It supports waves which move, right? Propagating waves. Whereas the land surface, even though if you blow air, if you blow wind across a field of wheat, the field of wheat will slowly move back and forth and you'll hear sort of soft rustling of the vegetation. It doesn't propagate. It doesn't carry energy in the same way. It doesn't really change the surface character. Same way. It doesn't really change the surface characteristics. Whereas, as you blow wind over the ocean, those waves move, but also they can go from being very, very small to meters high. So there is this two-way influence between the bottommost part of the atmosphere and the surface ocean through changing how rough the surface is. The winds change the surface roughness, and then that feeds back and influences the turbulence properties within the planetary boundary. Turbulence properties within the planetary boundary layer. And we'll talk more about this in a minute. One of the complications is associated with this is that when we were earlier on talking about the sort of layering of the planetary boundary layer into a viscous layer at the bottom and then a surface layer and then like an Ekman layer above that. You can still do that over water, but between the But between the surface layer and the viscous layer, you now generally have to think about another layer where you're actually sitting within the waves. So you get a wave boundary there where things just work very differently, and all of the kinds of similarity arguments based on dimensional analysis that we've made within that wave boundary there fall apart because there are other things going on than things we've accounted for. Yeah, two questions. Is the energy loss of the weight? The energy loss of the wind falling away significant? It is part of the drag. It is a component of the way in which momentum is exchanged into the ocean. The waves eventually grow big enough, they break. Yeah. Okay. And another question. Are you assuming the wave is only generated by the wave on the surface is only generated by the winds? Yeah, there are. Yeah, yeah, there are small ties in aha. Well, let's get very very that's a very subtle question. So those are those are waves um of a very different kind, very different wavelength, very different kind of a fixed period. So so it's not that they are absent, it's just that for this particular discussion, they're not necessarily terribly relevant. Yeah, yeah, so so you can. Yeah. So you can tell apart by the shape of the wavelength. Well, more so the periodicity. The thing about tidal motions is that they have very clearly defined periodicities. Whereas wind-driven waves tend to be quite broadband spectrally. Even we'll talk later on about this notion of swell, which is a sort of relatively uniform wave fields you get away from their generation regions. But even then, it's not. Regions, but even then, it's not like a delta function peak in the power spectrum. Are there, you know, how there's ocean spectra? And there's a lot of different ocean spectra models, right? Is there something similar when it comes to wind as well? Because it seems like the surface wind should be correlated to some degree with the wave. That's an interesting question. With the wave, that's an interesting question. So, I'm not familiar with that literature. I know, like, when people are, for example, modeling flow around turbines, they will use like a chimel spectrum or something like that. They have a sort of empirical wind spectra that they make use of. But you're right. You know, when you have a wave field, you would expect there'd be some sort of interaction. Now, the thing is, that's not going to be so relevant for wind power because by the time you're 150 meters up, if Time you're 150 meters up, if you're still in the wave boundary, there, you've got bigger problems. But no, I mean, these are important questions, right? Because we know that the characteristics of the turbulence are being influenced. And there's another factor, right, which is something we haven't talked about at all, which is that the turbulence, right, and all the theories of turbulence we've talked about at this point, we tend to think about the most turbulent part being the very bottom of the atmosphere, and then it gets weaker as you go up. But if you've got clouds, that's not necessarily the case. That's not necessarily the case. And in particular, these low stratus decks, you know, so the kinds of clouds that are not what we have today, but living on the West Coast, we have all the time. When you go out and it feels like the clouds are about 500 meters up and it's just a uniform dark cloud over top of you as far as the eye can see, those kinds of low stratus decks, they get warmed from below because of infrared radiation coming from the surface. They get cooled from above because of infrared. Get cooled from above because of infrared radiation being radiated away by the top of the cloud, the cooling on the top and the warming at the bottom actually generates convective instabilities within the cloud. As you generate turbulence at the top of the boundary layer associated with interactions with clouds. That's the last I'm going to say about that. But it does introduce yet another complication when we're thinking about what is controlling turbulence properties within the boundary layer. Within the boundary layer. And we know that turbulence is playing a fundamental role in moving stuff around, particularly in the vertebrae. Moving energy, moving momentum, moving water, moving carbon dioxide, whatever it is you're interested in. And so just by way of a couple of schematics, we have here illustrated, just samples of what an unstable convective boundary layer might look like over the over. Over the over the water, and what a stable boundary layer might look like over the water. In both cases, we have kind of a characteristic turbine, which is illustrated, which has a hub height at about 120 meters under conditions where the surface has a higher potential temperature than the air above. So it's convectively unstable, right? We tend to mix up, we get a relatively deep boundary layer. Properties are. Properties are more or less horizontal or homogeneous than the vertical. They're homogenized by the stirring. And so we have relatively uniform potential temperature profiles outside of that very lowest most surface engine of boundary layer. And typically the boundary layer is deeper than the entire turbine apparatus. And so the turbine and the blades sit entirely within the boundary layer. Under stable conditions where potential temperature increases with altitude, as we've seen, that tends to suppress turbulent and turbulent mixing. So we can get quite strong gradients of potential temperature, and as we'll see later, strong gradients of the wind speed. And the boundary layer tends to be relatively shallow. And so it can actually happen that the turbine sits partly within and partly outside of the boundary layer. And that can have important implications. Have important implications in terms of, you know, if you have active turbulence, if the blades are feeling turbulent flow when they're in the bottommost part of their motion, but not when they're in the uppermost part of their motion, that's going to have some influence for the instrument. And also right around the top of the boundary layer here, we can produce what we call low-level jets, which are regions of quite high wind speed that also can have a lot of power associated with them, but then also can be responsible. With them, but then also can be responsible with generating strong mechanical shears on the instrument because the speed changes a lot in the vertical. So if we start looking at sort of global observations, so what we know, and this is in this case from a reanalysis product, what statistics of winds look like over the ocean, what I'm showing here on the left-hand side are maps of the mean standard deviation and skewness of And skewness of the 10-meter wind speeds. So, again, if people are not familiar with non-Gaussian statistics, the skewness of some variable x is just the expectation of the variable minus its mean divided by the standard deviation, all to the third power. It's a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. What we see, if we look at the mean wind speed, is that we tend to have relatively strong wind speeds. Relatively strong wind speeds in the middle latitudes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. We get sort of secondary maxima and our mean wind speeds in the subtropics. And then right along the equator and in the sort of band between the subtropics and the mid-latitudes, we have regions of relatively low wind speeds, the doldrums and the horse latitudes. Again, these are things that Again, these are things that mariners in the 15th century would have been very familiar with. Anytime you actually try to get around the world by sail, you become very well aware of where there's wind and where there isn't on average. If we look at the variability, the standard deviation, it has really an even easier distribution. Standard deviation of the wind speeds is very large in the middle latitudes and it's relatively weak in subtropical. In subtropics and tropics. And what do we have in the middle latitudes over the ocean that makes this variability? We have storms. We have high and low pressure systems, synoptic scale variability. And so these are very weather-dominated parts of the world. Just a lot of weather going on. Oh, what about Lorida? Isn't that great? Well, that's interesting. So. Well, that's interesting. So, if we think about the fact that we get these occasional, very high wind speed events associated with tropical cyclones, those don't really show up here in any substantial way. They're so rare. Whereas in the wintertime, if you go into the subpolar North Atlantic or subpolar North Pacific or you go to the Southern Ocean, it is stormy. It is just stormy. And we know from living in the middle latitudes, right, that in the wintertime, you can get a storm every several days, something like that. That's kind of a typical repeat period for a storm. It's not periodic, right? But it's sort of on the order of sort of five to seven days. That's not an unusual repeat time for the stars that we can. In terms of the symmetry of the distribution, it's quite interesting. Symmetry of the distribution, it's quite interesting that in most parts of the ocean, wind speed distributions, which remember, speed is a non-negative definite variable, it's bounded below by zero. Most parts of the ocean, the wind speeds are positively skewed. But through most of the tropics, they're actually negatively skewed. They have distributions that look like that. We'll come back. We'll come back, and in fact, we'll come up with a physical model for it. Um, right. Um, so one of the ways that we often model the distribution of wind speeds is using something called the Weibull distribution. So just to emphasize again, there is no first principles physical reason why we would use this distribution. It's just really convenient. And it's a unimodal distribution. It's a unimodal distribution, very simple probability density function. It turns out that, and we can argue later about why this is, it turns out that it must be the case that for the Weibel distribution, its skewness is some function of the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation. If I know the mean and the standard deviation, that ratio will tell me what the skewness has to be. Now, what is that function? Well, it is what it is, but there has to be some function. And so something you can do is you can then look from object. Do is you can then look from observations again. Now this is using 39 years of observations from reanalysis. You can look at what observations tell us about the relationship between the skewness of the wind speed and the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation. And we can do an estimate of the distribution of that relationship, where this is now I'm sampling over spatial points. So this is going to think about this as like a spatial probability density function. And we see that. And we see that for this ratio low, when the mean is relatively small compared to the segregation, the skewness is positive. And as that ratio increases, the skewness systematically decreases. And I can do this calculation for the Weibel distribution. Pretty simple. I just drop down this red curve, and you see it kind of runs through the middle of those, the scatter of that data, which is kind of suggestive. Which is kind of suggestive as to why people have historically found this is a useful distribution to use. Question? So I was wondering why, how come did we have this functionality assumption between scripts and mean and standard deviation? I couldn't quite understand. Because I didn't tell you. You can just show this, right? You can show, you can write down the formulas for the mean standard. For the mean standard deviation and skewness, in terms of the two parameters of the Weibel distribution: there's a shape parameter and a scale parameter. And you can show that when you take this ratio, the mean to the standard deviation, that the scale parameter vanishes, and you're left only with the shape parameter, and the skewness only depends on the shape parameter. So that's a simple way of showing it, just by direct calculation. If you want to be more subtle, you can make arguments based on dimensions, dimensionality, and that. This is a non-dimensional rate. And that this is a non-dimensional ratio. This is a non-dimensional quantity. And for this particular system, there has to be a functional relationship between those two. And we'll come back to this question. The model parameters are these A, B, and A. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Which one is which? Right. So A here is what they call the scale parameter. And the mean is very closely related to that. In fact, all of the moments depend on both A and B. The moments depend on both A and B. But we can think about A as being most related to the mean. And B is the shaped parameter. And you can see that as you change B, you're changing the exponents of these quantities and essentially changing the character of the tilt of that distribution. I'm worried that I'm going to be saying something different than you when I'm talking about approximate PDFs for wind speeds on the For wind speeds on the window for wind approximation, and it's what I think I did in MRI surge, it's a Raleigh distribution, but that's a variant of a label distribution. A Raleigh distribution is what you get when B is equal to 2. Thank you. Yep. Okay, so we're not getting that too far away. And the thing is, it turns out that, yeah, over land, B doesn't vary quite as much. Over the ocean, B varies a lot. Yeah. Yeah. That's a very nice segue, actually, because the Raleigh distribution is what you get if you have a bivariate Gaussian of mean zero and isotropic variance, and you look at the distribution of the magnitude. So you go to polar coordinates and you look at the radial distribution, you get the Raleigh distribution. The Raleigh distribution. Now, if we do the same calculation where instead of bivariate distributions, like the U and V components, right, the components of the wind, if I assume that they're bivariate Gaussian with isotropic fluctuations, but non-zero mean, then what you get is something called the rice distribution. And so, this, the existence of this functional relation. The existence of this functional relationship also exists for the rice distribution, but it will not give you negatively skewed wind speeds. It cannot. And I won't go into this a lot more. I'll touch more on it, I guess, tomorrow. But what this means is that the negative skewness of the observed wind speeds is a consequence of non-Gaussianity in the components. It turns out that the components, the horizontal components of the wind over the ocean, are horizontal components of the wind over the ocean are strongly skewed the components so if we think about like the east-west component of the wind and the north-south component if we think about the distributions of those separately those distributions have strong skewness in fact some of the strongest skewness i've seen in any atmospheric variable which is not you know like precipitation or wind speed that you're below right so I'm confused with what you said, but about that dimensional argument. It's that mean over standard deviation, that's non-dimensional. It's Q. But then wouldn't that relationship hold for any distribution? Any distribution for which that is the only non-dimensional combination you can make. Yes. Combination you can make. Yes. So if there were, if there were other distinct non-dimensional, yes, maybe that we maybe that argument is weaker than I thought. So let's, I'll retract that. I can show this by brute force calculation. It's got to be the case. Always happy to resort to brute force calculation when it's a okay. Can I ask a question about your last comment about these non-Gaussian behavior of the components? Components. To me, that the simple explanation is: well, the earth spins a certain way. Is that a dumb physical intuition as to why that's the case? It factors sort of into the explanation, but the explanation I have, and I'll talk more about it tomorrow, is more based on the fact that I'll get to that in a second, if I can, because the next slide is the relevant fact. Okay. So, thinking about the exchange of momentum between the ocean and the atmosphere, right, last day we talked about this notion that if we know how the wind speed profile is determined by that surface momentum flux, I can turn that around and say, if I know the wind's at some altitude, I can predict what the surface momentum flux should be. And I can do that in terms of something called the drag coefficient, right? So, this is the rate at which So, this is the rate at which momentum is being exchanged between the atmosphere and the underlying surface, in this case, the ocean. And I can express this in terms of this drag on the winds at a given altitude. Where here I've denoted this ZA, the so-called anemometer height, which is conventionally 10 meters when we're thinking about air-sea interaction. So, your question. The fact that the surface momentum exchange is quadratic in the speed at a given altitude in some very, very informal sense, which you can make more formal, means that it's easier to slow the wind down than it is to speed it up. And so if the meteorological perturbations that are driving variations in the wind, though, if they're symmetric, those which are trying to speed the wind up. Those which are trying to speed the wind up give a smaller response than those which try to slow it down. And it produces a characteristically skewed distribution of the wind components. And what's even more important, we'll talk about this in more detail tomorrow, is that the sine and magnitude of that asymmetry is actually determined by the mean of the component. So if you look at a map of the mean zonal wind and you look at a map of the skew. Wind and you look at a map of the skewness of the zonal wind, they are mirror images of each other, and that is not something which is required by the mathematics, so it must be imposed by the physics. Any questions? I think we might see something similar, like smallest ailments. If you suck air into your mouth, right, the speed The speed as the air travels from here to here varies quickly, right? It's like one over distance. Whereas if I blow out, the speed drops quite, it drops quadratically. Because you're generating a jet. Because I'm generating a jet, right? And so if you look at a vacuum cleaner and you put your hand next to the vacuum cleaner, you don't feel anything until you get really close. Anything until you get really close, right? Whereas if you turn the net container in reverse and you push out, like that jet can go quite a long way. I think that's more or less the same thing as what you're saying, right? I'd have to think about that. I'd have to think about that. Okay. I don't want to say anything off the cuff. Question. Yeah. I'm trying to understand why the skunk matters. Like, why an asymmetric shape? What asymmetric shapes? Shapes and couples? Well, if you're interested in understanding the variability, if you assume distributions are symmetric, then you're going to get both sides wrong, right? Your tails are going to be wrong. You're going to make different conclusions about gustiness in one direction as opposed to another. So, I mean, it's interesting in that regard. It also, I think, the distribution of the Distribution of the speed is itself also important when you're interested in, for example, if you want to compute an average power production, and this is the function through which you have to pass your wind speed before you compute an average, then you kind of want to know something about a bunch of moments of the wind speed. So there's a number of reasons. It's also scientifically just fun. It's also scientifically just fun. Okay, so reminding ourselves that when we express our surface momentum flux in terms of a drag coefficient, that drag coefficient depends on its gratification, but it depends on the roughness of the surface as well. And as we've talked about over the ocean, that roughness is dependent on the wind to some extent. The ocean surface roughness is determined by the sea state. Surface roughness is determined by the sea state, and the sea state is the technical term that gets used to basically just say how wavy the surface is. The wave field is influenced by the winds, so there's a coupling there. And so people have tried to think about how to represent this in the past, and again, using dimensional arguments, but also understanding the characteristics of viscous boundary layers, people have. People have proposed these so-called sort of hybrid charnok parameterizations. Chernock is just a name, it's not anything fancy, it's just someone's name. Where we have a term which describes essentially the surface when it's really wavy. We have a term which describes the surface when it's really smooth. So, like on a really still morning, you go out and you look at a nice lake, and that lake is like a mirror, it's completely flat. Flat then this term here, the second term would characterize the roughness. But then the wind starts howling and the wave gets surface gets wavy and this first term starts to dominate. And then we have these parameters alpha and beta, which are just kind of there to blend the one state into the other smoothly. The viscosity is the air or C viscosity. That's air, air viscosity. And that is a really key point. New there is the molecular viscosity of air. That is the real. Viscosity of air. That is the real molecular viscosity associated with transport, diffusion of momentum by random molecular motion. So, your coefficients alpha and beta shouldn't be constant, they should be dependent on wind speed. No, the wind speed, ah, the wind speed is coming in here through U star. Oh, yeah. Oh, exactly. Yeah. This is actually a real pain to deal with because it means you have to calculate C D iteratively, but that's. Iteratively, but that's fine. If you had a fitting result, you have a quadratic term for the first term, you have first order on the denominator. No, this term comes from understanding in extensive physical detail of molecular boundary layers. This term comes from dimensional analysis. And then basically, we're just blending them together. So, this is, there is hand waviness here. So, this is there's hand waviness here. The hand waviness that Richard had described yesterday, lots of waving of hands here. The second term is the more robust. Also, it's probably the least relevant. Because no pan intended. The ocean surface is rarely that smooth. So, if spa is more, then you have like this kind of surface? So, I'll get to that in a second. I'll get to that in a second. It means you have a non-monotonic dependence of the drag coefficient on the wind speed. Just to give you a sense of what the sea states look like, we can have situations where the wind is actively interacting with the wave field. Extremely irregular, wave breaking, spray production. This is what we would call like a fully developed sea or a wind sea, where you have some sort of statistical equilibrium between the winds and the waves. Between the winds and the waves. But then the storm ends, and these waves just propagate happily across the ocean for thousands of kilometers. And because different wavelengths propagate at different speeds, they kind of separate out. And when you get away from the region of the disturbance where the waves are produced, you get these quite regular wave patterns that we call swell. And you might have seen these if you've ever been in the subtropics, places like Hawaii, for example, where when there's not a storm coming through, the wave. Storm coming through, the waves are very regular. Very, the relations that we just saw, that Charnock relation, is really designed for more of a wind sea. Breaks down a little bit when we have swell. In particular, what can happen is if you have very, very light winds. So when you have swell, the waves are there not because of the local winds, but because of the winds some other place some time ago. And so if these waves propagate into a region where the winds are very weak, A region where the winds are very weak, you can actually have a situation which we really never see on land where the momentum flux is not into the surface but it's out of the surface. The winds actually accelerate the air, or the waves actually accelerate the air. So yeah, we would technically have a negative drag coefficient. It can happen, it's observed. So we have this net result that the drag coefficient depends on wind speed. That the dry coefficient depends on wind speed, and we can look at this in observations. This is not easy because you have to go out and estimate turbulent fluxes at sea on a platform, which is dealing with wind speeds of 10 to 20 or 20, 25 meters per second in waves. So this platform is moving around. These are not easy measurements to take. Thus, the large error bars in the observations around these dots. Observations around these dots. But the observations do show that, typically speaking, as the winds get stronger, the drag coefficient goes up. And then we have a few different parameterizations that have been developed over the years to essentially fit these data. And again, other data as well. This is not the only data set here. And you see that we actually have most of them as kind of non-monotonic behavior at low wind speeds in the drag coefficient. Here at low wind speeds in the drag coefficient. This is still a subject of active research. Okay. So as I indicated earlier, stratification also matters over the ocean, but it's not the mechanisms for producing stratification are generally different than over land. It's not the diurnal cycle of surface heating and cooling. It's bringing a bring cold air over warm surface or warm air over cold surface. And so, as an example, this is these results from a numerical simulation that a graduate student I worked with several years ago had done. And this was looking at, in fact, if you cast your mind back to that distribution of the pheno towers, this was a high-resolution. Hours. This was a high-resolution simulation of the flow over the Western Baltic. So it had, you know, Germany, Denmark, Sweden. And this was a situation in which there was flow coming from Scandinavia over the Baltic Sea, so from land towards the ocean in the summertime during the day, when the land was nice and warm. When the land was nice and warm, and the ocean was relatively cool. And so these profiles are, we can think about them, they're intended to represent the same air mass at different times as it moves offshore. This is an approximation, but it's pretty good. At noon, UTC, so that is, what is that? That is one hour away in Europe. When you're in Europe, most of Europe. The air mass is over the land, and we have a very well-mixed. I should tell you what I'm showing, right? Always tell people what the axes are in a plot. Horizontal axis, potential temperature, vertical axis is altitude. At noon, over land, we have a very well-mixed boundary layer, of a convective boundary layer indicative of being warmed from below. And then there's what we call. And then there's what we call an inversion where the potential temperature changes rapidly with altitude. And then above that, we just have sort of the background free tropospheric increase of potential temperature. And then this air mass gets blown offshore over a cold ocean, cold seawater. And so three hours later, this is the temperature profile, potential temperature profile. So you see there's been a dramatic surface cooling. A dramatic surface cooling, right? Five Kelvin in that three hours. Not as much has happened aloft because, really, what we're seeing is the effect of the cooling of the surface. The air up here changes a little bit, but not a lot. Then, you know, it continues to be affected offshore, and the surface cools more and more. So that by nine o'clock, so this is now getting into the night, our offshore, our air mass offshore has a very, very strong. Air mass offshore has a very, very strong stratification, and that's just produced by blowing that warm air over from land over a cold ocean. It's not always the case that the ocean is colder than the land. This just happened to be that case that day. So that's one of the ways that we can generate stratification. When we do that, it matters because it changes everything. It changes the drag coefficient. When we have unstable stratification and vigorous turbulence, we have more. And vigorous turbulence, we have more efficient exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and the surface, the drag coefficient goes up. If we have stable stratification, the drag coefficient goes down. And that's what this plot shows in terms of, and this is really unfortunate, I should not have done this, the stratification measure I've used here is the inverse Abuchoff length. Don't worry about that. This over here is unstable. And this is stable. And this is neutral. We don't have to. where we don't have to worry about stratification. And all that you really meant to take away from this image is that when you have unstable stratification, so the effects of buoyancy are increasing the intensity of turbulence, the drag gets stronger because you're more efficiently moving momentum in the vertical. When you have stable stratification, it gets weaker. So that exchange, that frictional coupling or that drag coupling between the atmosphere and the atmosphere. Between the atmosphere and the underlying surface, is profoundly changed by the presence of this stratification. And one of the things that happens is you get these dramatic changes in the shear. So if we look, now this is from LiDAR observations from, I think, off of New Jersey. Quite long, I think, FLIDAR observations off of New Jersey. These are wind speed profiles. Horizontal axis is wind speed, vertical axis is altitude going from zero to 200 meters. And what's happening? Emitters. And what's happened is they've taken all their observations and produced an average over that whole set. And that produces this black wind speed profile, right? Wind speed increases with altitude, like we expect. It is what it is. But then what they've done is they've broken it down into different stratification cases. So situations where I have unstable stratification. And cases where I have stable stratification and different degrees of it. Yeah, so delta T is the change in the difference in temperature. Delta T is the difference between the air temperature at two meters and sea surface temperature. I see. Yeah. And so what we see is that in the unstable stability classes, we have this orange curve and this blue curve. Have this orange curve and this blue curve, which once you get high enough up, particularly for the very unstable case, our shears are very weak, very well mixed. You're really stirring the atmosphere up, and the wind speed doesn't change much with altitude. In contrast, on our very stable stratification, this profile just goes up and up and up and up. Very strong shears. So, again, we see that influence of the stratification on how the wind. On how the wind changes with altitude. And in the plots that you showed us in the previous slide with the temperatures in not this one, but the latency here. So was this unstable stratification that we saw here? So we started off over land with evidence of unstable stratification because we have. Unstable stratification because we have a lot of mixing at a uniform potential temperature. But then, when the air mass moved offshore from a warm surface to a cold surface, then you have this cold seawater under relatively warm air, and that produces stable stratification. And it also then influences the shear of the wind. I'm not showing that from this run simulation, but we also found that. You know, I'm sure looks a lot like what we call conventionally neutral boundary layers. Is that fair to say, or is that correct? Okay, so it's okay, fair enough. There is a zero potential gradient, potential temperature gradient here. So there are no buoyant forces in this part of the atmosphere. Yeah. But you're only looking from, this is not showing the bottommost part. So what happens is typically when you have strong surface heating over land, the surface is Land, the surface is unstable. And then that generates these convective motions, which are these large buoyant plumes, which extend up to the top of the boundary layer. And they mix everything up above that surface region. And so the bulk of the boundary layer is typically neutrally stratified because of that effect of steroid. Could you go back to the large? No, no, no, the large. Yeah, I'm sorry, there's a latency here, so there's a weird delay. For instance, the green and the blue code, they start at different heights. So what's happening is we... Oh, their don't see is different. I'm sorry. Yeah, their don't see is different. And also remember, on top of all of what we're seeing here, there's also weather. And so the wind speed down. The wind speed down near the bottom. And note this is going to zero here. So we're clearly missing something down here because the wind speed at zero is not nine meters per second. So there's some slight offset here in how this is being displayed. But it turns out that that set of observations where we have strongly stable stratification also tend to have strong winds near the surface. Now, why is that? Surface. Now, why is that? I'd have to look at the data in more detail to understand, right? But that just happens to be the case here. In contrast, our strongly unstable stratification cases, these blue, well, actually, the strongly unstable stratification also has strong winds near the surface for whatever reason associated with the meteorology and oceanography of the Jersey shoreline. Whatever reason that is. Is it always a case that this speaker that this speed curve against that, I don't know, against that height is relatively very smooth. No, nor is it the case that it's always monotonic. And here's an example. So this shows an example of something called a low-level jet. I'm not going to go into the details, but if I focus on these uppermost panels here, this is again from LiDAR observations. This is again from LiDAR observations showing the winds at a bunch of different measuring altitudes. The dark blue lines are relatively high, the light blue lines are relatively low. Early on, we see there's not a big difference between them, so there's a relatively weak shear. As time goes on in this particular period, the shear increases. What that means is that the light blue line, which is the low altitude wind speed, is much smaller than the dark blue line, which is the higher altitude wind speed. And then when we get to this period here, we actually get a reverse. Here we actually get a reversal where that dark blue line is not at the top but it's now somewhere in the middle. And when you average the wind speed profiles over this period of time, you get this structure where you have a localized jet with a nose at about 120 meters. Okay, you have the two different height all rare, sorry. Right, so this box corresponds to averaging over this period, this is over this period, and so we're And so, what we see is, in this particular case, a situation where we have a region of a localized wind speed maximum just over 100 meters above the surface. Now, the factors that influence our profiles are partially the characteristics of turbulent transports, but also, like Richard had talked about the other day, horizontal temperature gradients can also have an effect. So, there's multiple things happening here, but you can get these so-called But you can get these so-called low-level jets. And so, if you think about this from a wind resource perspective, I mean, this is a region where there's a lot of energy, but it's also quite variable. So, and it's, and that jet's not always there. And when I say it's not always there, I mean, here's a profile. It's clear no jet. And there's other times where the jet might be at some other altitude. Well, if you know how this jet is correct. How is this jet creative physically? Maybe you can manually create it. That would probably take more energy than you could harvest. So it would not be an economically viable solution. Okay. So I realize I have gone five minutes over time and I'm just about at the end here, but I can pick up again tomorrow. I just have a few slides talking about wake effects and that can actually lead into the next. Lead into the next material, which actually relates quite a bit to what Sophie was talking about earlier today, where we can use sort of thinking about idealized stochastic systems as a way of trying to understand these phenomena. If there are any other questions, I can take them. We've had lots. So, yeah. So on the right on the overall maximum, this is like in terms of height, the overall maximum occurs around like which I do not in this figure here? Yeah, generally, I mean at the so that's the thing, is that the actual altitude at which a low-level jet occurs could be quite. Altitude at which a low-level jet occurs can be quite variable. I mean, they're typically between, say, one and 300 meters, but it depends on the characteristics of the boundary layer. So it can actually vary. It can depend on where you are and the characteristics locally, but it can also depend on the weather. So in some places, these jets are very predictable, other places less so. So, you know, this is now going over land, but you've got the Great Plains jet. But you've got the Great Plains jet, which is quite predictable on the eastern side of the Rockies in the U.S. You actually get a jet, the California coastal jet, along Northern California, which is quite predictable. Both of those are much more driven by horizontal temperature gradients. But these kind of localized, low-level jets, they can be very sensitive just to how things were the day before and what that night looks like. So, not necessarily easy to predict and not necessarily always the same. Any questions from Zoom? Well, no, there's no chat showing up. I'm not seeing this will pop up normally, but that would come up. Okay. Okay, well, thank you all. And if questions do arise, just let me know. We'll have more opportunity to ask questions tomorrow.
