Dynamic multiscaling when the stochastically forced bulkous turbulence. Before beginning, I would like to thank my collaborators Dhruvaita Mitro from Nordita Stockholm, Sweden, and my PhD advisor, Professor Rahul Pandit, for their useful insights and suggestions. I would like to thank the organizers of the workshop for giving me this opportunity to present our work. And I would like to acknowledge the support of the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship, the Science, Engineering, and Research Board, and the National Supercomputing Mission. Supercomputing mission. Before beginning, we know that randomly forced hydrodynamical equations are essential to understanding the physics of turbulence. Now, in 1979, D. Dominicis and Martin had shown by the renormalization group study that randomly forced turbulence does exhibit a Kolmogorov-type energy spectrum, which henceforth we'll be referring to as K41. For the power of forcing, which is shown over here, F had K going as K to the power minus T, where D is the embedding dimension. To the power minus t, where d is the embedding dimension of the space. But now, from numerical simulations and experiments, we all know that turbulence does not exhibit simple scaling but multi-scaling. So, there should be certain corrections to the K41 energy spectrum. However, the renormalization group is unable to capture these corrections properly. In 1998, direct numerical simulations of the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation by Shai Manu and Pandit were successfully able to capture multi-scaling in the randomly forced Navier-Stokes. Scaling in the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation. And this figure which you see over here is taken from their paper only, where they have plotted the ordered p structure function, ordered p exponents of the velocity structure functions as a function of p. And this structure function exponent scales as a non-linear increasing function of p, which is a manifestation of the multi-scaling of the velocity fluctuations. And this was subsequently confirmed by high-resolution direct numerical simulations by Bifferelet and others. So we conclude that the So, we conclude that the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation shows the same multiscaling behavior as the deterministically forced Navier-Stokes equation, which is a quite interesting result. Now, let me give a brief introduction on dynamic multiscaling in turbulence. We know that for equilibrium systems near criticality, the relaxation time of the fluctuations scales as a function of the correlation length as a power law, given by tau going as chi to the power of z, where z is the dynamic scaling exponent. Z is the dynamic scaling exponent. Now, turbulent systems are non-equilibrium systems. However, in 1997, Lvov, Podvilov, and Prokashia had observed that decorrelation times extracted from eddy velocity correlation functions also scale as a power law of the eddy size. And not only do they scale as a power law, they also found out that multiple decorrelation times extracted from various correlation functions have multiple scaling exponents associated with them. So they concluded that turbulence. Them so they concluded that turbulence not only exhibits dynamic scaling, it does exhibit dynamic multi-scaling. Now, the dynamic multi-scaling exponents depends on the definition of the time scales. It depends on the way we extract the time scales from the turbulent flow. Now, a time scale can be extracted in various ways. And it was shown by Dhrubai Tomitra and Rahul Pandit in 2004 that depending on the definition of time scales, we can have a variety of dynamic exponents from their direct numerical. From their direct numerical simulations of the shell model. Now, for the Navier-Stokes equation, such extraction of dynamic multi-scaling exponents is slightly non-trivial. Why? Because of the non-linear interaction between the eddies, what happens is that the smaller eddies get advected by the large-scale flow. As a result of these advection of the small-scale eddies by the large-scale flow, which is also known as sweeping effects, what happens is that the decorrelation times of the small eddies. Correlation times of the small eddies, they all scale linearly with the eddy size, which leads to dynamic multi-scale, which leads to simple scaling, mass, I mean, dynamic multi-scaling being masqueraded as simple scaling. Now, a way to get around these sweeping effects is to look at the velocities from the quasi-Lagrangian frame of reference, which is to visualize the flow from the reference frame of a Lagrangian tracer, which gets advected by it. And it was shown by Shombriti Shankaraya and others in 2011. And others in 2011 that such a quasi-Lagrangian transformation indeed suppresses sweeping effects, and using this quasi-Lagrangian transformation, they were successfully able to extract the dynamic multi-scaling properties of the incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence. So, this figure on the right-hand side is taken from Shamridi's paper on D. So, on the y-axis, they have plotted the integral time scales which they had extracted from the time-dependent structure functions as a function of the separation r. And as you Separation R. And as you can see, it scales as a power law. And the exponent chi P they are shown in the inset. So you can see different chi p's for different values of p. So this is a manifestation of the dynamic multi-scaling properties of the incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equation. Now, all of these examples have been that have been carried out till date have been done for the incompressible flows. The point is that till date, I mean, there has not been any study of dynamic multi-scaling properties of compressed. Dynamic multi-scaling properties of compressible turbulence. Now, a good starting point for this might be the Burgers equation. The randomly forced Wandi-Burgers equation is shown by this beach colored box over here, where U is the flow velocity and mu is the coefficient of viscosity. F is a Gaussian white in time stochastic force having the covariance given by this peach colored box. The covariance scales as k to the power of beta. This beta is an important parameter because it determines. Important parameter because it determines the scaling of the velocity fluctuations in the steady state. Now, Berger's equation has been long used as a testing ground for the statistical theories of turbulence, and they can develop shocks, which is why they can also be interpreted as a very simplified model of a highly compressible 1D fluid. Now, as I said earlier, the steady scaling of the velocity fluctuations is determined by this power law of the forcing. Now, one loop perturbative renormalization group expansion. Perturbative renormalization group expansion of the stochastically forced Burgers equation for beta equal to minus one demonstrated that it has a K41 energy spectrum, EK going as K to the power minus five thirds. And then subsequently, Ayyava and Jayaprakash explored the Burger's equation for a wide range of the parameter beta, going from minus two to plus two. And they observed for different values of beta, the velocity fluctuations scale differently. For some, they do not break scale ingredients, for some, they do. And so they had concluded. They do, and so they had concluded that for different values of beta, the Burgers equation velocity fluctuations can exhibit multi-scaling. Later on, Dhrubaitamitro and others had carried out simulations of the Burgers equation at very high resolutions for beta equal to minus one, and they concluded that the multi-scaling, in fact, might be a finite resolution artifact. In fact, the scaling might be bifractal, which again is an extreme case of multifractality. So, this figure on the right-hand side has actually been taken. On the right-hand side has actually been taken from this particular paper. Over here, you can see the red-colored dots as well as the blue diamonds are the exponents which they had extracted from the DNS. And the black line here is the bifractor prediction. So, as you can see, they deviate slightly from the bifractal prediction, which may lead to one interpreting this as multifractality. On the other hand, they had explained that no, this is not multifractal. This might be a consequence of the finite resolution. So, the take. So, the takeaway message is that the Burger's turbulence with beta equal to minus one exhibits a statistically steady state with a Kolmogorov energy spectrum and possibly bifractal scaling of velocity fluctuations. Now, this leads us to ask, like 3D turbulence, does 1D Burger's turbulence also exhibit multi-scaling for beta equal to minus one? Well, earlier studies on similar things, I mean, Burger's turbulence itself had shown that no, it exhibits only a single. That no, it exhibits only a single dynamic exponent. Czech lov and Yakur had quantified this as two-thirds from the renormalization group arguments, and later on, Hayman Jey Brakash had said that this exponent is unity because of sweeping effects which dominate the flow. Now, the multi-scaling of spatial velocity fluctuations in burgers is almost similar to that what we see in turbulence. And so, this leads us to intuitively ask that why not, why can't we not get multiple dynamic exponents in burgers as well? Well, we can try the question. As well. Well, we can try the quasi-Lagrangian approach for that matter. But there is a subtle problem with the quasi-Lagrangian approach: the flow is compressible, it can have shocks, and the Lagrangian freezer can get trapped in a shock, which might lead to the failure of the quasi-Lagrangian approach. We will come to this point in detail later. But what I've shown on the right-hand side over here are the particle trajectories, which are marked in colors on a space-time plot. So, as you can see, the various particle trajectories gradually merge into one another, they collide with each other and stick together. Collide with each other and stick together. Once a particle falls into a shock, it remains stuck in that shock forever. So it's natural to ask: what is the time taken for a given pair of Lagrangian traces separated by a certain distance to merge with each other? So this is a natural way of defining a time scale in the Burger's flow. And then we can see that can these time scales, I mean, the time taken for a given pair of Lagrangian fracis freezes to merge. So can these time scales be used to extract the dynamic? Scales we use to extract the dynamic multi-scaling behavior. Well, for that, we carry out numerical simulations of the stochastically forced Burgers equation with the forcing covariance given over here, where k goes to the power of f, where the covariance of the force goes as k to the power of minus one. We have used a pseudo-spectral algorithm with two by three DLISINC, and we use the Euler-Mariama method to integrate the stochastic force. And then we find in the steady state that the energy spectrum is consistent with what has been observed by you. What has been observed by Kolmogorov, I mean, what has been conjectured by Kolmogorov that k goes to power minus five-thirds. So, in figure A, we have shown a snapshot of a steady-state velocity profile. As you can see, there are shocks here and there. And in figure B, we have shown the compensated energy spectrum, EK, which has been compensated by K to the power five-thirds. And we observed that there exhibits an inertial range spanning over nearly two decades in the wave number. And in figure C, we have plotted the. And in figure C, we have plotted the large-scale probability distribution of the large-scale velocity fluctuations, which is almost Gaussian. We have performed the simulations at very high resolutions so as to get a large enough inertial range as well as a well-reserved dissipation range for a finite viscosity. So now I explain what we have done to extract the collapse time statistics. So what we do is that we load n number of traces in the steady state, n equi-space traces in the steady state, which we denote as t equal to 0. The steady state, which we denote as t equal to zero, and we define a Lagrangian interval as the separation between a given pair of traces. And then we define the interval collapse time as the time taken for a Lagrangian interval of length L to collapse at a shock. And this is synonymous to saying the time taken for a pair of traces separated by a length L to collapse at a shock. Now, this time T call, tau call, it depends on two factors. One, it's the size of the interval L and two, the velocity difference across the ends of the interval. Velocity difference across the ends of the interval, which is delta u of l. Now we ask what is the probability distribution function of this time tau call for different interval sizes L and in particular how do these probability distributions depend on the length of the interval L? So in order to do that, we calculate the moments of tau call for different L. And from these moments, we extract a hierarchy of time scales, which we denote as TP call as a function of R, the length scale. Of R, the length scale. So these time scales are defined as in the speech color box. And from our simulations, we observe that TP call scales as a power law in R. You can see this in figure A over here, where the log of, we have plotted log of TP call as a function of log of R. And we can observe this clean power law regime in this shaded portion. And the different colored graphs over here, they are drawn for different values of P. So this is for P equal to 1, P equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 3, 4, 5, and 6. And so from these power law scalings, we are able to extract certain exponents, the dynamic multi-scaling exponents, ZP call, which we call the collapse time exponents or the interval collapse exponents. So once we extract these exponents from TP call, we plot them in figure B, where you can see we've plotted Z p call as a function of T. So it is again a convex non-linear increasing function of T, which seems to saturate at unity. To saturate at unity. So, this graph tells us that Berger's equation indeed exhibits dynamic multi-scaling, and our way of extracting time scales is able to capture this multi-scaling behavior efficiently. So, now that we have observed multiscaling in Berger's equation, we seek an explanation for this sort of behavior. I mean, why does TP call scale as the way it does? So, for that, we need to look at the collapse of the intervals on a case-by-case basis. intervals on a case-by-case basis. We know that the velocity difference across interval of length x scales as delta u of x going as x to the power of h, where h is equal to 0 if there is a shock in the interval, if there is no shock in the interval, then h is equal to one third for beta equal to minus one. Now at the initial position at t equal to zero, when we just load the tracers, there can be two situations depending on the position of the shocks and the position of the tracers. What are those situations? Well one What are those situations? Well, one is that the interval, case one, might have one or more shocks at t equal to zero, the collapsing interval, that is. So over here at t equal to zero, we have this collapsing interval and there is a shock over here. And at t equal to tau call, this particular interval collapses into this shock. And similarly, we also can have a case when the collapsing interval might not have a shock at t equal to zero. So that is given by these six figures. Now, in the panel one, we have the shock appearing at some Of the shock appearing at some time tau start and in between the two tracers, and finally they collapse at that shock at time t equal to tau call. And secondly, what can happen is that one end of the interval can get wrapped at the shock at t equal to tau start. And then finally, the interval can again collapse at the shock at t equal to tau call. So, based on these two cases, we can extract a scaling theory for the moments of the collapse times. The collapse times. So, when we define the collapse time in this manner, tau going as an integral over dy by delta u of r minus y from zero to r, where y represents the relative displacement of the tracer at one end of the collapsing interval with respect to the tracer at the other end. So, when we examine this quantity on the case-by-case basis, which I just mentioned, we get the following things. So, what happens when the interval does not have a shock at t equal to zero? At that time, this velocity difference, delta. The this velocity difference delta u of r is independent of the separation between the tracers and the probability of finding such intervals p of r is proportional to r. So, in that case, the contribution from this interval t p equal 1 scales as r to the power of p plus 1. Similarly, for the other case, that is when the interval is initially smooth and the shock appears at t equal to tau star. In the initial case, delta u of r scales is r to the power one-thirds. And we can break this down into two subcases. Can break this down into two sub-cases: one, when the time of appearance of the shock is very close to that of the collapse, and two, the time of appearance of the shock is much, much smaller than that of collapse. So, in the former case, this is how the collapse times of those intervals would scale, going as r to the power 2p by 3. And in the latter case, when the time of appearance of the shock is much less than the collapse times, that is when this is how the collapse time of those particular intervals will scale, and so the overall. And so the overall collapse times, I mean, overall time scale is actually a weighted sum of these three contributions over here. And we finally end up with this equation from which we can extract the dynamic exponents, assuming that R is very small. So the dynamic exponents that we get over here are ZP call going as 2p by 3 for p less than equal to 3 by 2 and equal to 1 for p greater than 3 by 2. So when we plot this exponential So, when we plot these exponents from our theoretical understanding and overlay the plot on the earlier plot which I had shown, then we get this particular figure. Now, in this figure, the black line is actually this particular exponent, Zp called the theoretical one. So, this is 2p by 3 and this is equal to 1. And as you can see, our theoretically evaluated exponents are in close agreement with the numerical ones. There is a slight deviation of the numerics from the theory. Of the numerics from the theory in this regime. And we attribute that to a correction due to higher-order terms of negative signs, which can lead to a lower value of the exponent than what is observed. And so from a similar case-by-case basis, we also derive an analytic form of the probability distribution function of tau, which is phi of tau, which I won't be showing over here, but I can explain it to you during the discussion session. And if we calculate the moments of phi of tau, then we again get. Phi of tau, then we again get back the exponent z picol over here, which acts as a self-consistency check of our scaling theory. Now, as just an aside, I can show you the asymptotics of properties of phi of tau. So phi of tau in the small tau limit scales like this, and the large tau limit it scales like this. And from this, we can also define the cumulative PDFs q of s in the small tau limit and q of l in the large tau limit, and their scaling. limit and their scaling behavior in those two limits are shown over here and over here. And in figure A, we have plotted the scaling behavior of the CPDSQ of S in the small time limit. So you can see the curves for different values of R, they collapse onto each other on scaling tau by r to the power two thirds. And similarly, in the large tau limit, they again scale collapse on scaling tau by r to the power two thirds. And so this again shows the agreement between our numerics. Agreement between our numerics as well as our theory. Now, coming back to the quasi-Lagrangian thing, which I had mentioned earlier, that the quasi-Lagrangian approximation might not work for the Burger's turbulence. Now, here we show explicitly that it does not. Well, we calculate the structure functions, the time-dependent structure functions that Drubaito and Rahul had done earlier during their exploration of dynamic multi-scaling in the shell model, which denote them as F of U and F of QL as saw already in under quasi-level. F of QL as the Eulerian and the quasi-Lagrangian structure functions. From these, we extract the integral time scales which we have shown over here and here, the Eulerian and the quasi-Lagrangian time scales. And these time scales are delineated by a cutoff time, which is T of C. Now, T of C is defined as the time at which the structure function, the time-dependent structure function reduces to a certain fraction lambda of its initial value. So we plot these time scales for different values of lambda, one for a large lambda and one for a small lambda. One for a large lambda and one for a small lambda as a function of r on the log-log plot. So these are the Eulerian time scales and these are the quasi-Lagrangian time scales and the shaded regions are the regions over which we do our local slope analysis. So what we find is that for small value of lambda, these are the exponents we get: the blue lines, blue triangles, and the violet colored triangles. The blue corresponding to the Eulerian ones and the violet corresponding to the Pasi-Lagrangian ones. To the Poissy-Lagrangian ones. So at small values of lambda, that is lambda equal to 0.9, sorry, large values of lambda, lambda equal to 0.92, which corresponds to a small cutoff time Tc, we find that the quasi-Lagrangian as well as the Eulerian exponents closely match with the bridge relation prediction, which is shown by the shaded region over here. On the other hand, at smaller lambda, that is at larger values of the cutoff time, we observe the Eulerian, which is the red, and the quasi-Lagrangian exponent, the green. The quasi-Lagrangian exponent, the green, or it might be the other way around. Sorry, the Eulerian is the green one, and the quasi-Lagrangian is a red one. In either case, both of them saturate at unity for all values of P, which shows that the quasi-Lagrangian treatment is unable to suppress beeping effects over large time scales. And we believe that the same will be observed in compressible turbulence flows as well, since they also develop shocks and can have similar dynamics. Now, this leads us to extend our. To extend our, we propose extension of our methodology for higher-dimensional turbulence. So we simulate the dynamics of the 2D Burger's equation, the 2D stochastically forced Burger's equation, where the force covariance is given by k to the power minus 2, delta k plus k prime, delta t minus t prime, delta ab. And this kind of force covariance again gives us a Kolmogorov energy spectrum where EK scales has k to the power minus 5 thirds. We apply this particular projection operator on the forcing in order to. Operator on the forcing in order to make it curl-free, since Berger's equation is curl-free. And then we the shocks here in this case are linear structures with rich dynamics, and here also the tracer cluster are the shocks. So let me show you a movie over here where the color bar represents the divergence of you. Blue represents deep blue color represents the regions of large negative divergence, which are shocks. And the red represents the regions of high positive divergence. So as you can see, the black dots in You can see the black dots in this movie are the tracer particles. So, as time progresses, these traces they gradually cluster at the shocks and they merge into the shocks. And as you can see in the flow, they slowly, slowly, all of the traces which were there in the smooth regions come into the shocks. Now, since the dynamics of two dimensions are much more richer than that in 1D, there are also multiple ways of defining collapse times in 2D. A simplex in D equal to 1 is a straight line, a simplex in D equal to 2 is a triangle. Simplex in D equal to 2 is a triangle. So we can also define collapse times as the time taken for a triangle to collapse to a point, or in other words, time taken for the area of a triangle to reduce to zero. Now, the area of a triangle can reduce to zero in three possible ways. One is that all three vertices can merge at a point. Two vertices merge at a point and it becomes collinear. And three is that none of the vertices merge, but they all The vertices merge, but they all come into a straight line and the triangle and they become collinear. So the area of the triangle goes to zero. Now, by studying the collapse of triangles formed by triplets of traces, we can extract multiple different types of collapse time exponents. One collapse time exponent from each of these three cases and four more from a combination of all three. So what we do is that at t equal to zero, as in 1D, we load a trace. As in 1D, we load a tracer at each and every Eulerian grid point, and we consider all those triangles which are isosceles and right angle with base and height equal to R. Now, the case C1, which I had shown earlier, that is the collapse of all the three points at a single point, is a very rare case. So its contribution is negligible, and most of the contribution comes from cases C2 and C3. So on the figure on the right-hand side, we have plotted the moments which we derive from. At the moments which we derive from cases, uh, sorry, uh, C2 and C3. The moments of cases C2 are shown by the blue dots, and those from cases C3 are shown by the red triangles. And as you can see, the collapse time moments for these two cases are different. And from the figure in the panel below, you can see the collapse time exponents shown by the blue dots for C2 and the red triangles for C3 are different in two cases. So, this again brings us back. So, this again brings us back to our previous claim that the dynamic scaling exponent depends on the way we define the time scale. So, we define the time scale in C2 in one way, in C3 in another way, and each of them gives us separate dynamical exponents. Similarly, in D equal to 3, we can get even richer dynamics because a simplex in D equal to 3 is a tetrahedral in case of a triangle, for which we can get even more number of collapse time exponents. So, here are the summary of our results. Summary of our results: We present the first successful study of dynamic multi-scaling properties of the 1D stochastically forced Burgers equation. As you saw, our theoretical understanding agrees closely with our simulations, and the interval collapse times also lend useful insight into the dynamics of the flow. We have shown explicitly that the quasi-Lagrangian transformation indeed does not suppress sleeping effects in the present shocks, which is why the quasi-Lagrangian transformation might also fail when one tries to extract export. When one tries to extract exports from compressible flows. And then we extend our methodology to D equal to two, which shows Russia dynamics. We can define collapse times in multiple different ways, and each of them can have multiple different exponents. And similarly, in D equal to three, we can define collapse times in even more number of ways. And finally, we say that our methodology of particles collapsing at shocks is Taylor-made for compressible flows, and we soon seek to apply it to the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Navier-Stokes equations. With that, I would like to end my talk. Thank you for your attention. Hello. So I can hear you. Alexei, are you there? Lexi, are you there? Hello. Hello. I can hear you. I can hear you, Ariel. Okay, okay, good. Alexey is muted. Oh, Alexey is muted. I was not. No. Okay, yeah. You are the chair, Alexei. So you have to handle questions again.

So John, you can share your screen. How does that look? It looks good. How does that look? Perfect. Good. Good. So do you want me to begin now? Yes, sure. You can do that. I guess everybody who's attending is here. You're five minutes early, but okay, so. Okay, well, I'm very much aware I'm the last talk of the morning and people are wanting their lunch. Lunch, and here it's the last talk of the evening, and I'm wanting my dinner. So, I'll shoot through this as quickly as I can without any delay. So, good afternoon and good evening. The aim of this talk is to discuss the effect of blending the multifractal model of Frisch and Parisi with the Navier-Stokes equations. Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic box, and it's worked joint with Beringer Dubruel and myself. And we wrote this up in this very beautiful double volume that the many of you who are the editors who put this together with very hard work together as a double volume.
