Yes, perfect. Okay, so when you're ready to record, and so we have Valentini Poccetti talking about vacuum entanglement harvesting with the localized matter. Good morning and good evening, good day, everyone. Thanks for. Good evening, good day, everyone. Thanks for coming to see my talk. And yes, so today I'm going to talk about what Laura said. And this is a results that we have obtained with these people. This is the collaboration. Let me do this so I guess you can see the screen. So, yes, one person. So, yes, one person involved is Laura, who is chairing the section. Hakeem, who spoke yesterday, Nadine, who finished her PhD last year, and these people are all in Canada, and Nick Mekuchi, who is in Melbourne at RMIT, where I am as well. And so, before getting into the full swing of the project, I wanna first of all I want to first of all tell you what I guess is going. Yes, sorry. I switched to PDF five seconds ago and I don't know what it's doing. Anyway, I'm going to tell you what we are doing and why we are doing it. So trying to give you the big pictures and the explanation before going into the details. Explanation before going into the details. So, what we're doing is we are trying to, we try, we did, we harvest entanglement from the vacuum using all-the-weak detectors that now are coherently delocalized. And what we wanted to check is we wanted to understand how the ability of these detectors to actually harvest entanglement from the vacuum is affected by the fact that now we are giving them some extra degrees of freedom that are quantum. Degrees of freedom that are quantum. And the reason why we are doing this, I guess I gotta do this. Okay, yes. The reason why we're gonna do that is that basically for the people maybe are not that familiar with entanglement harvesting is that entanglement harvesting from the vacuum or whatever system can be considered as a resource. And the reason for And the reason for this, and maybe we're going to briefly see why this is true, is that the harvested entanglement from, for instance, to Uru-De-Wick detectors is very sensitive to the topology of, for instance, the space-time we are considering, or how the detectors are moving, or the boundary conditions of the field we are considering. And therefore, this is like makes it very useful. Very useful as a resource. For instance, I wrote down some examples how it can be used, but one example is entanglement farming, meaning that the extracted entanglement, like the entanglement would be extracted from a field, can be used, for instance, as a quantum resource for quantum channels and so on. And there are other examples, but I don't want to dwell on those. And why is this important? And this is very important. This is very important if one takes an operational approach to physics, meaning that what we want to do is try to understand physics through what we can measure. So we do measurements and like we develop a theory regarding it. And for this reason, the harvest entanglement can be considered as a probing device. And so it's sort of like a useful device to having this operational approach. Having this operational approach, as I was telling you. And because of this, and because of in, like, for instance, we do experiments, like we use as detectors, atoms, ion traps, and molecules. When we developed a mathematical model that described these detectors, we want these mathematical models to capture as many characteristics of the actual devices as possible. Well, not as many, but the relevant characteristics of the. Relevant characteristics of the actual devices. And yeah, this. So now I'm going to go over what we mean with the weed detectors and why it is important that we capture the relevant characteristics. So this model was developed to model light-matter interaction in a quote simplified way. So on one side, we have matter that is modeled like Have matter that is modeled like the center of mass is modeled classically. And what we call the internal degrees of freedom are basically a two-level system, like a ground state and an excited state. And those are there to represent basically the orbitals of an atom, for instance. And the interaction happens like with this interaction Hamiltonian. I mean, here is in the interaction picture, and it's linear both in the field and. And the light field, like the photons are actually substituted with a scalar field to simplify things. And what we have, like instead of having the dipole, oopsie, and it's going to be all like that. So we have, instead of having a dipole momentum operator, we have a monopole one, and it's of this kind. So omega is the energy gap of the detectors. And we're going to consider it like that throughout the paper. Like that throughout the paper, sorry, throughout the talk. And we also have a switching function. So what one can decide to do is to switch on and off the interaction instead of keeping it always on. And in general, what happens is that what people have noticed doing in Tangleman harvesting with this sort of detector is that. Sort of detector is that the entanglement harvested in this case is very dependent on the configuration that one is considering. One thing that I forgot to say is that the interactions between the field and matter happens at the center of mass of the detector. And the detectors may be following like different word lines and so on. And because of the sensitivity. Of the sensitivity of the Urdu detectors on the configuration of the detectors itself. So, meaning that it depends on the switching function and on the state of motion, and we see also on the spatial profile later on. What we wanted to do when we developed the mathematical model is that make these models as relevant as experimentally relevant as possible. And how do we do that? So, in between So in between one could say, what we have at the top here, I think you can see my mouse, is that one can consider, for instance, a very like sharply peaked initial configuration of a detector, meaning that the detector is point-like. But what happens is that if we consider atom as molecules, these have a like, even if quite small, they have a spatial width. Have a spatial width, so they're specially finite. And so, in order to sort of like add this feature to the detector, one could what has been done mainly is adding like a Smirium profile that, for instance, like here reporting an example, like you can actually, you can have a Gaussian Smirium profile. So, what you see here sort of like it's a very schematic representation of the shape of the center of the spatial configuration and he in here. Configuration and in here, what we call the internal degrees of freedom, so the orbitals. What one could do is go like a step further and consider instead that the center of mass degrees of freedom are quantum as well and therefore contribute to the dynamics of the system. There are several ways in which one could do that, but we're going to focus on a specific one. Before going into that, though, what I'm going to do in the next few slides is sort of like define what we consider in our paper and our work as a baseline that we will use to compare, that we're going to use to compare the results to. So it's sort of like, you know, the comparison, like the classical limit that we can consider. So what we have here, you see it here up on the right, we have two detectors. Up on the right, we have two detectors that are certain to have this entanglement. It may be probably trivial for everyone, but you need two detectors. What you have is that these two detectors are separated by their center of mass by a distance S, capital S here, and they're both in the ground state, meaning that their initial state is what you guys see up here. And the system. Um, the system, we let the system evolve. So, uh, what we do is that the system has this configuration. So, we have introduced here is this mirroring function, meaning that now the detector is not just a point, but has like a spatial profile of the width L that you see up here. So, we gave it a Gaussian profile. And what we have considered is And what we have considered is a switching function that it's of a particular kind, and we're going to understand why later when we talk about the quantum bit. But basically, what we're doing, like we're putting these two detectors, like they are going along their world line, they're not doing anything, they're not accelerating, they're just stationary there. We switch interaction on, we let them interact for a limited amount of time. We switch the interaction off, and they, at that point, we consider. Point: We consider how entangled they are, and yes. So, basically, because we want to consider the entanglement between the internal degrees of freedom, what we do, we trace off the field's degrees of freedom, and here we get this density matrix at time t, like when we switch off the interaction. So, we're not actually considering how the entanglement is changing throughout the interaction time. And this is a And this is a, oh yeah, sorry, lambda is, of course, the coupling constant and this density matrix is like up to lambda squared. Like we have ignore higher terms. And what we see here is that we're gonna the the interesting, the relevant factors that we're gonna talk about are basically this, what we call PC. Are basically this what we call PC. They are classical because we are considering the classical case, like for the center of mass. And these are the probabilities that one detector gets excited. And these are local. So this happens just like for one detector. And they are the same for both detectors because of the configuration. We have just they have the same spatial pro, the smearing function, they have the same energy gap and so on. Well, these terms here at the end. Well, these terms here, the M's, these are actually what we call the entangling terms. These are the non-local terms. And the measure that we've used, like the quantity that we used to measure the entanglement is the negativity. And we could have used other quantities, like, for instance, concurrence, but in the case we are considering the equivalent. Equivalent. And as you guys can notice, like the ability of a detector to have this entanglement depends on how these two factors, our entanglement terms and the local noise, the excitation, the local excitation probability play with each other. Like how they, yeah, which one is bigger than the other. And so on the left here, there is a plot. We have plotted the We have plotted the negativity for a pointlite detector. So the width basically of this main function gets to zero and becomes a delta. And the case where the two detectors actually specialists need. And we see two things. First of all, is that the point-like detectors seem to be able to have essentially entanglement high up in terms of energy gap. And this is due to the fact that when one introduces, like, intuitive speaking, it's that it's. Like, intuitively speaking, is that if one introduces a sort of a like a width for this mirroring function, it's like introducing a cutoff in the momentum. So it's harder to excite certain, like to access higher energies. While the specialist needs one, if we look at down here, seems to be able to harvest entanglement at a bigger separation, like S, the separation between the two centers of mass. And this is due to the fact that I don't know if you can see my hand. that I don't know if you can see my hands but basically the tails of the the this the this mirroring function like they tend to the they're closer they tend to to overlap okay so this is the baseline what do we do next what are we done next okay so the idea is that introducing quantum degrees of freedom for the center of mass and as i said as i briefly said before there are many ways well there are several ways one could could do that the way we are chosen is through the model Is through the model that Nadine and Hakeem, Nadine Switzerland, I hope I said her last name properly. They developed, I think, last year, two years ago. That basically works in the following way. So what we have is that this is for two detectors, but the idea is that we have our internal degrees of freedom. In that case, I have considered first the rate of emission. Of emission, not the rate of excitation. But the idea is now to give to basically give the center of mass some dynamics. So they associated like a now we have a state for the center of mass that is quantum and that follows this free Hamiltonian. Well, M is now the mass of the detector. The mass of the detectors and P is the momentum operator for the center of mass of the detectors, and there is an associated position operator as well. So this is the Freya-Miltonian. And in our case, what happens is that the systems, now we have two detectors that are defined that way. So the system now evolves using this interaction. This interaction, Hamilton, and I'm going to go into the details in a second. Where basically, like, the form appears to be the same. Landa again is the coupling constant. We have a switching function, we have a monopole moment operator. But now, what happens is that the field, because the coupling still happens at the center of mass of the system, the field now is an operated value function of another operator. And to make sense of this, both Nadine and Hakim used a spectral theorem of functional calculus. But basically, what you do if you have an operator function of another operator, what you do is you take the operator is the argument, you write it in terms of its spaces and the eigenvalues, and you apply the function to the eigenvalues. The function to the eigenvalue. It's basically hidden in here because it's written in terms of the interaction picture, but it's what is going on in what we wrote here. Okay, so we use this interaction Hamiltonian, unlike there is two of them, because we have two detectors. Again, the interaction happens at the center of mass. And these are the states for the center of mass that we can write in terms of the wave function, in terms of like position. Of the wave function in terms of like position or momentum, it doesn't want to do. Again, as before, what we do is we switch the interaction on at a specific time. We can see that to be t equals zero. We let the two detectors. So what we do here, you want to be as localized as they are going to be at the time when they start interacting. And what happens because of the quantity? What happens because of the quantum behavior, they tend to delocalize and they interact with the field and through them. And this reach the interaction of, and we get like this density matrix for the final set, where again, now what we have done, we have traced out both the fields degrees of freedom, but also the center of mass degrees of freedom. Because remember, we want to understand how the entanglement among the internal degrees of freedom is affected by the new. By the new degrees of freedom of the center of mass. Cool. Again, if we do perturbation theory up to lambda squared, we get that the density metric has this force. Because we haven't specified the initial state of the center of mass, the two local, the two excitation probabilities could be different. Could be different. So we have left them unexpressed here, but we can say the following thing. So, as you guys can see here, let me do this: is that for the probabilities, these depend just on the momentum probability distribution. So they're local, while the entangling terms depend on the phases of the center of mass wave function. And therefore, what's happening. And therefore, what's happening there is that these guys, they carry the information of the position of the two detectors. And therefore, I think I wrote it. Yes. So M depends on the properties of both detectors still, while the probability, the local, the excitation probability is just probability of one detector. Okay, so now we're going to go into a little bit more into the details of. Bit more into the details of the wave functions that we have picked, the switching, why we picked a specific switching function and that specific switching function, and so on. So, what we have done here, we said, okay, let's pick a Gaussian profile, like a momentum probability, quantum probability distribution that is a Gaussian one. Okay, and so the initial delocalization with, I haven't reported yet, but the idea is that that is L. Idea is that that is L. Okay, and we pick the same thing for both detectors. Obviously, there is a difference in the position of the center of mass, but the excitation probabilities are the same. And this greatly simplifies the expression of the negativity. As before, you can see that basically summarizing this expression is that what you have is that you manage to have best entanglement when the entangling terms are bigger than. The entangling terms are bigger than the noise that you get at the single detectors. Okay, thanks, Laura. The other thing is regarding the switching function, why we have picked one with, we say, compact support that is of this kind, and it's because of the wave function we have picked. So basically, when this wave function freely evolves, it means that the center of mass state is completely delocalized. State is completely delocalized at t minus or plus infinity, but it's the most localized at t equals zero. From what I said before, we want the two detectors to be localized, like as localized that they will ever be at t equals zero when they start interacting. And this is the reason why we picked this switching function. If we had like Richard Gaussian one, it would be like meaning that we have the interaction always on and this wouldn't work. The other thing is that I The other thing is that because we are, this is the free Hamiltonian and the system, the center of mass degrees of freedom are now evolving using the Schrodinger equation. We want to see, we want the, when the detectors emit, for instance, a quantum of the field and they recoil. We want that motion virtually or whatever it is. We want the velocity of that recoil to be non-relativist. And basically, we're saying, like, we want a motion to be 1.5%. We want almost to be one percent the speed of light because we are in vacuum, and for the choice, I'm not going to go into details of why we have this expression here, but because of the choice of the wave function that we are considering, this puts the limit on, we have like sort of a lower bound of the product of the width of the initial delocalization, the mass of the detectors, and C. And okay, so what about in terms like how do that? About in terms, like how does this affect the local excitations and the entanglement terms? So, what we're plotting here, we see that the excitation probability, so the local noise, decreases both with increasing energy gap, so red is more energy gap and yellow is big, but also it decreases as the mass of the detector decreases. And the reason is that basically what happens is that when you introduce some quantum degrees of freedom, Degrees of freedom, you are introducing extra degrees of freedom in the dynamics of the system. So, when you have a small mass, basically the kinetic energy of, for instance, that it expects with small mass is quite big. So, part of the energy would go in there. And also, what happens is that, of course, it's harder to excite states that like systems that have a higher energy gap. Gap. So, intuitively speaking, that is the explanation. What about the entangling term? The one that basically is going to tell us if we can have this entanglement or not. So, here, one thing, the dashed line in here and in the previous plot, those are the point-like UNRUDEWIT detectors. So, that's the limit. And so, what happens is that for the entanglement time, we see that because we want to keep the m time. The m times l ratio to be greater than the number that I showed you before. Basically, we see that as m increases, it seems that it's easier to have like an entanglement. So for smaller m's and bigger l, what we have is that this entangling term is suppressed. And the reason is like it's very similar to the plot that I showed you before, the smear function, that basically, when you have some sort of width. When you have some sort of width, you sort of like you introduce a cutoff, and it's harder to get like higher energies, very roughly speaking. But we can talk about it in the discussion. So the other thing that we have tried to do is understanding if in what sort of regime we managed to recover the classical Unudewig detector. And basically, the way one can do is, for instance, by sending the mass of the detector. Is by sending the mass of the detector to infinity because basically what happens is that the system tends to delocalize really, really slowly until it doesn't delocalize anymore. But what we have found is basically that the excitation terms are so the local noise when we take this limit, preserving of course this bound, tend to go to the point like the point like case, while the entangling term tends to While the entangling term tends to go, as C for Espoor for classical, to the smear case. And the reason for this is the following. So, what we have is that the negativity doesn't go to neither of either of cases. And the reason is that the excitation probabilities are local and they are not affected by the position of the detectors while the entanglement terms are. While the entanglement terms are. And so we said, okay, we cannot actually recover the classical UNU the weak detector at least with a smearing function that is like a smear profile. So the way one actually recover at least a point like classical detector is by using by sending m to infinity and the initial And the initial delocalization to zero. And write it, and we wrote it in this way so that we could keep the small m and l finite, so we can still preserve this bound that we put here. And the way you obtain the limit is just any disfactor gamma. It's just a factor. It doesn't have any relativistic meaning to zero. And what we got, and I'm going to show you just the plots, is that so we have that gamma goes to zero from right to left. Right to sorry, left to right, top to bottom. And so basically, what we're doing, we are increasing the mass as we go down, and we are decreasing the DDL. And the thing that I want to show you is the following, that basically when we get very big mass and very small initial delocalization, the negativity starts to look similar to what it is for a point-like detector. So at least we recover that case. Detector. So at least we recover that case. And I'm gonna finish here saying the following thing. So it seems that by introducing some quantum degrees of freedom, the capacity of the internal degrees of freedom for the center of mass, the capacity of the internal degrees of freedom to harvest the entanglement for the vacuum is highly suppressed. And also we have found that basically when we try and go back to the classical UNRDAW detector limit, we managed to recover just the point. Manage to recover just the point-like detector, not the spatially smeared one. And this seems to suggest that basically this mirroring function, this mirroring profile can be used mainly to describe the spatial profile of the internal degrees of freedom, not of the center of mass. And the other thing is that this may also be due to the fact that there may be entanglement that is forming between also the central. Is forming between also the center of mass degrees of freedom that we are discussing, and this is like sort of taking entanglement away from the internal degrees of freedom and because we have traced the center of mass degrees of freedom out. And it could also be the problem due to the fact that the system that we use doesn't proper doesn't completely capture the light-matter interaction. And maybe we should be considering extra term. Exiter and I'm done. Sorry, I think I went over time. Okay, that's a thank Valentina. And I think we have time for maybe one quick question. Yes, let me put Magdoida? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I it's making more comments. So if I understood correctly, the initial thought was that in a limit of Was that in a limit of a detector that initially has some Gaussian wave function, one will recover a smeared, like the usual smearing of the detector in the non-latin, the high mass limit. Is that correct? Did I understand correctly? Right. So I think there is an easy way to understand why that cannot be. And it's simply because one starts with the property of a state that is not an eigenstate in position. Not an eigenstate in position, while meeting is the property of the interaction, so where the dynamical degrees of freedom couple to each other. And so these are two different aspects. One is kinematics and the other is dynamics. So I actually think one shouldn't expect that this will be recovered. And the way you did the recovering the classical limit, I think it's exactly how one should expect it to be. So yeah, just okay. Yeah, just okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks, yep, yeah, yeah, yeah. We should talk about it. Thanks, thanks, Magdalena. Okay, so let's thank Valentina again. And why don't we, so Flamini has posted the link to the gather space, why don't we reconvene?
