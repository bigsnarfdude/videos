Oh no, the button. Uh and then I'll follow follow by the cuttings. In the chemistry parts repartment we basically uh partition space space into compartments. So it's a compartment-based model. The compartment length scales, think of them as doxos or cubes in 3D. So the compartment length scale and scale, we've done models on 50 nanometers and 500 nanometers.  Rate of the jump, we can reproduce the diffusion coefficient of the species. In addition to diffusion, we also have chemical processes, the most important being, for example, polymerization processes, that if you have a filament, then another new monomer could bind to it and the filament can grow. Or vice versa, the the final filament monomer could decolymerize. Would depolymerize. But then, in addition to that, we also have things like capping proteins, can cap and un-cap, or they cap, they start polarization. And then we have, for example, branching proteins, there's R23 that can come and bind to a side of the filament, and they can spawn a daughter filament at an angle, at the right angle. And then there are things like linkers, you can see them in the green color, that this linker, it diffuses around. It diffuses around and jumps in compartments, but at some point, if there is geometric compatibility, then this link will stochastically bind, and by that we'll see in a minute that it will mechanically couple to filaments. In the current version, the molecular motors are implemented in a relatively simple way. They are like cross-linkers, except that their heads can move. So that would lead to things like shearing motions. Mortions. So that was the chemistry part. The mechanics part, actin filaments have extremely high, large persistence length. So computationally, it's advantageous to model them as cylinders, actually. So I'll tell you about another model a little bit later. But right now, we'll have this cylindrical elements, think of them as thin, slender, long cylinders that are quite rigid, and then they are connected. And then they are connected at the hinges. And then the cylinders themselves are stretchable actually. They are not completely rigid cylinders, so that gives us the longitudinal compressive modulus. And then we have bending potential we can see there that allows us then to get bending and persistence land correctly. Also we have mechanical potentials for avoiding crossing and and and that's important because this uh if if we didn't have that right, then If we didn't have that right, then the filaments would cross each other and we wouldn't get the right topology of the networks and mechanics. Also, we have force transfer that cross-land present motors. This slide shows now the integration of the previous two slides, meaning that we have this chemistry, the compartments, you can see it now in 3D, the cubes, and with jumping. And with jumping of species between compartments, that's diffusion. And then, for example, if a molecular motor absorbs a filament, it could start walking, so that would be the active transport, and then it could unwind in another filament. And then this allows us to have a large collection of complex processes from, as you can see, from polymerization, depolymerization. Polymerization, depolymerization, severeing, branching. So, all these processes are here. Plus, we have mechanical components. And also, everything is local. So, it's local, spatio, temporal, chemistry, and it's stochastic. This is a slide that shows that, just to say that there are quite a few parameters in the model, and we try our best for those. We try our best for those parameters that we can to extract them from various experiments and estimates, or maybe more detailed simulations and so on. And not everything we can get this way because there are some parameters that there is no data. And in that case, we try our best to take some range of parameters that's reasonable and we usually scan that parameter range when we do our simulations. The final The final element that we need to do these simulations is actually the time evolution on Z. And maybe a more natural way to think about this is to do Langevin dynamics, for example, on the mechanical part. But it turns out that for these kind of scaleful networks, there is quite a large actually time-scale separation between, if you think of a short scale, like if you think for example at a bot about this box compartment. About this compartment box that's 500 by 500 by 500 nanometers, then the chemistry that happens in that box is: if you were to restrict the boundaries of the box mechanically and perturb it, it would be microseconds for that local small network to come back to equilibrium. But chemical processes like motor working or polymerization and so on, they are more in milliseconds or tens or hundreds of milliseconds time scales. Of milliseconds timescales. So then in the model, basically the system mechanically adiabatically follows chemistry. So imagine that you start with a mechanically cool bright model where all forces are zero everywhere, and then molecular motors start working slowly, 100 milliseconds here, 10 milliseconds there. And then every time that happens, locally, in some small part of the network, the network goes out of equilibrium, we equilibrate it. So you'll see in a Colibrated, so you'll see in a movie what it will look like. So, this is the movie, so it shows that, and let's see if I can actually catch this. So, you can see that this is a 3 micron by 3 micron by 3 micron box. We start with short steps of actin elements randomly oriented. There is also actin and myosin in solution that you don't see here. And you can see that right in the beginning, it quickly, all actin filaments quickly grow to the network, to the volume. To the network, so to the box size, and then the blue things here are myosins, so they start to walk. It's all chemical dynamics, the chemical master equation pushing this. There is no thermodynamics here, so the chemical temperature is much higher than the ambient thermal temperature. You can see that in the time course of about 2,000 seconds, there's this, initially it's quite homogeneous, and then it starts to coarsen into bundles, and then there's this then further. Further compaction and contraction of the network into a very corrolike structure. So, this shows the network dynamics. Then the snapshot here shows the chemical or molecular intricacies of the simulation. So, this is just one snapshot of that movie, and from here you can see that we get very interesting. We get very interesting geometric normal structures as part of the network evolution. The green things are cross-linkers, and the cross-linkers come in and out all the time, so they're very dynamic. And the same thing with the blue sticks, which are molecular motors, they also come in and out, but they also, because their heads move, they slide filaments, and you'll see the result of that. I'd like to show you both a few applications of this software and model. Of this software and model, and also show where we are going with this. So, one is: this is a work that was a collaboration with Yi Jeng's group at Georgia State University. And Chin Ni, who was a student in my group and is now a postdoc at Johns Hopkins, he did all this work. So, they were using AFM to pull actually from the cell body and look, do experiments where they measure the alignment of. Where they measure the alignment of cytoskeletal fibers as they pull. And Chin, you can see actually that experiment on the left bottom corner of this graph. So Chin came up with simulations that would basically mimic the experiment. So he came up with an AFM-like tip model that would locally link up with the actin' cytoskeleton. And the cytoskeleton at the bottom. So these are medians of medians. So these are median simulations and you can see that in the case of new tool, then actually you do pull some fibrous-like structure out of this body of the cytoskeleton. And indeed, when we compute the alignment of the fibers that you pull, we see things that seem also to be present in the experiment, which is that when you pull, that instantaneously orients actin filament. Act in filaments to a certain degree, but then also there's this chemical relaxation after that. So if you pull and weight, then there's going to be a chemical annealing where the cross-linkers code in and out. So there's almost like this chemical maturation phase that then follows the mechanical pooling step. And then we sort of thought of this as the slow against slow chemistry follows fast mechanics here. Mechanics here. Now, another direction where we have applied this model has been with regard to the so-called cytoquakes. And there are these very interesting experiments where two, three types of experiments, where people have seen that the cytoskeleton sometimes has, it has this heavy tail of jumps, for example, that indicates that it sort of That it sort of, even when you look at the detailed statistics, it seems to be similar to earthquakes, to the earthquake statistics. And we've done a number of papers on this, and the last one that summarized two, three years of work, came out in PNIS this week, or last week. And Carol Floyd is, I think, the plan is for him to talk in a lot more detail about this work on Friday, and in particular, Friday. And in particular, I'll just say two things: that one, Carol figured out how to measure energy dissipation and entropy production in these median simulations. And it's actually part of the interface of median that one could ask a question, how much entropy is generated by diffusion or by the mechanical subsystem or by various chemical reactions. And in those simulations and measurements, he saw that there are these bursts of entropy with our. Burst of entropy production or burst of dissipation that was a clue that there are these avalanches. And then, in this new paper, he still continued that line, but also did Hessian analysis to find that there are these interesting soft modes and so on that help us to understand better what are these avalanches. In terms of the model itself, one direction where it went the last three years is Is bringing a new membrane model to it. So, everything I told you so far was simply if you take this cytoskeleton and the chemistry that comes with it and put it in a box, before that we could have not just a box, but maybe a sphere and so on. But we wanted to have a system where the boundary is the moving boundary, a flexible deformable boundary. So that's how our needs work. Again, a long work, but the idea is that we are going to discretize. We are going to discretize a membrane surface and then have terms like the health-rich free energy and so on that describe, for example, bending penalty locally for the membrane, but also as a term for the surface tension, and also a volumetric term. And that volumetric term allows us to model the osmotic pressure difference between the cells inside and the outside. And plus volume exclusion, again, because we want the filament to poke the membrane, and we have to have. Membrane, and we have to have and remember or note that here the membrane elements are triangles, so we want the triangle elements to interact with the membrane with the filament tips, so we can have steric interactions or even maybe tethering interactions between the membrane and the siloskeleton. There were lots of small details or complications there that before when we had this nice rectangular grid, there's no problem with this, but now There's no problem with this, but now when we have a flexible membrane, these grid elements get cut, and we have to, even in terms of chemistry, now the volume changes of this one box got cut. So we have to recalibrate and recalculate things on the fly to deal with these moving boundaries, just small technical things like that. And this is a movie that shows such a simulation that inside is a psychoskeletal system with Side is a psychoskeletal system with, as you can see, it's very dynamic. It has lots of chemistry, not just mechanics. And the reason it's pushing is actually, in some sense, chemical, is that it polymerizes, and because of that, it pushes and makes protrusions. And you can see that we can, this sort of the idea is that we start to have now some maybe very early ingredients for how we could model the whole cell from this more molecular perspective. This is another simulation where different initial conditions. Simulation where different initial conditions, and you can see that we can have with this initial condition, just fill the space with the siloskeleton and still have it interact with the membrane. This paper again also actually just came out this month, two, three weeks ago, and it was on the cover of the journal Physical Chemistry B. And we can see actually a very nice image that Hara made for the cover. At high resolution, actually, it shows some nice. Shows some nice geometry of the simulation. And two things that we, in terms of the application, two things that we focused there, or refocused there, was one, for example, when we think about something like a philopodial emergence from or philopodial-like structures emerging from the membrane. And interestingly, for example, one question on the top right figure, you can see that depending on the angle of incidence, so if you have a fiber coming from So if you have a fiber coming from underneath the membrane and pushing, if it comes perpendicular, it's easier to push, but then if it comes at an inclined angle, then it might get deflected, right? Like it might not be able to make the protrusion. So in this work, we, for example, looked at that angle dependence of the protrusion and indeed sort of see that there are some critical angles where, after which you cannot make a protrusion. Also, we looked at other things, for example, how thick is the bundle that comes. How thick is the bundle that comes and makes protrusions? So there are some interesting questions of that type. One way, some very recent work that Paran did, was also to do to, if you look at the membrane itself, it itself is comprised of compartments, similar to the 3D thing, except that compartments on the membrane are 2D elements, right? Think maybe we can think of them either eleva be the triangle, so maybe these were nine cells. Or maybe these VRNI cells. So then, because there are compartments and you can have membrane receptors and other proteins that are bound to the membrane, those proteins can then again jump between the membrane compartments. So we can then model membrane reaction diffusion that separates from the volumetric 3D reaction diffusion, but then have absorption and desorption that couples the two. And simultaneously, we have mechanical interactions, like the filaments pull up the membrane and make it. The membrane and make it protrusion, and so on. So, this allows us then to do receptor clustering, receptor signaling, and for example, we can have curvature-dependent proteins that aggregate, and because of that, the bending term that would lead to spontaneous curvature formation. So, this opens up some new directions in terms of that kind of work. And in terms of the uh in terms of the filament model, a two-year collaboration with Radek Erbon at um Oxford University uh in 2019 for a semester I was a Verton Fellow visiting him there on Mike Sabetago. And there are two major works coming out under collaboration that we'll soon we'll submit. And in almost all filament models that are used in the field, including Rs and Median, we basically We basically were just looking at vending deformation, and it was basically they were models that were influenced by thin, if you'd like. And this is a model that now is a thick model. It's almost like think of it as a tube, like a telephone. And if it's a thick model, then it allows shearing, twisting, stretching, and bending. And the most interesting for us here is twisting, actually. We know that the actin filaments are double helices and they are chiral and And they are chiral, and there are interesting twist-band couplings there. So, we have a new working model that has these kind of much detailed mechanics of a filament and what is possible to work. And then these models, for example, if you take now multiple filaments and couple them in this, you can see the geometry on the right, then, for example, Then, for example, when you pull, if it's just a simple rod, and you pull, you're just gonna have the tensile forces. But here, because actin filaments are double helical, when you pull, they also twist. So you get this interesting potential interesting chiral symmetry breaking in. And that has been, again, known for a long time that there are these rotational phases, and even in cells, where there are these like micro-scale vortices. Like micro-scale vortices and so on. So, we are trying to see if this kind of models that have chiral symmetry breaking in them, whether that's sufficient to understand those phases. And another technical interesting thing is that now the cross-linkers, they connect not to the filament centers as it used to be the case, but they connect to the filament surface. And so even just a cross-linker pushing or angular motor pushing. Our angular motor pushing could then generate torques and lead to rotational movements. And this is actually a simulation where we can now do, these are much slower models at the moment, but we hope to speed them up. But you can see a simulation where we just again do ectomyosin and cross-center simulations. But now, because we have this chiral symmetry in the problem, now we actually see that the individual filaments they rotate back and Individual filaments they rotate back and forth, and you can see that there's this, the variance of the angle is shown on the right, and you can see that we basically get rotational diffusion out of this. And then when we, at the bottom, this is again primarily worked by Kel Floyd, also with Haram Ni. So we see that when we change the number of myosins, then this rotational motion gets more rigorous. Rotational motion gets more vigorous. You can see it from the bottom picture. So, in that sense, the molecular models then set the rotational temperature in the system. So, this is still really work in that direction, but it helps us to start to understand what happens with the rotational torque-induced motions of acne filaments, and what it leads actually to larger scale, the micro-scale, and before. Than before. Another work that, again, this is coming from a collaboration with Radek Gerban, is primarily now done by his graduate student, Ravinda. It's a two-scale, or called multi-scale, it's a two-scale model where, in addition to that model, COSAR drug model that I showed, we can, for some short of segments, we can model active. We can model individual actin monomers as detailed ellipsoids with lots of connections between them. And this allows us to enter out in the same simulation a coarse grain and a fine grain model. So for example, if you have a kink or some feature where the elastic model might be inadequate, even in a linear one, then we can go to this almost molecular representation and have those features descriptive. That those features described in a lot more detail. And of course, it's a complicated matter to how to connect these two scales so in the boundary we don't get any defects and so that's why it's sort it took so long to figure this out and maybe one the last project is is a collaboration that I'll tell you about now it's an application is with the laboratory of our Peter Bataya who is my colleague here at the US of Maryland they do lots of Of Verland. They do lots of interesting experimental work. In particular, we got interested in the question of actin drings. They do work on B cells and T cells when they spread. You always see this ectin drink and then myosin ring behind it. And we were interested in understanding what's the origin of them. And we basically found that this is Chin Ni's work, and Chin Ni, as I said, is in Jan Swampkin's era. So Chin found that actually So Chin found that actually even without branching, even without nucleating activity at the boundary, there's this tug of war between basically the mice and trying to condense everything to collapse. And then the filaments and if there's polymerization, then we can actually get dreams of the boundary spontaneous under certain conditions. And I'll just show you this space diagram that he constructed. That if the vertical axis is the excess is the is the actin concentration in solution and it is actually the myosin to actin ratio so it's the more vertically we go the more myosin activity is more vigorous and then the horizontal axis is treadmilling so you can see that if if we are on the left half corner then there is this collapse to the center because of myosin activity but you can see that there are conditions where we form a ring so so if there Where we can form a ring. So if there's this nice interplay between treadmilling and myosin activity, we actually get a ring at the boundary. Where, other than boundary being there, it's not special chemically. And I'll just say that we just maybe one more minute if we have. Yeah, that the myosin, when we started digging, why is it forming, we found that actually, and if you think about it, And if you think about it, it makes sense that at the boundary is the least curvature. So, from the mechanical viewpoint, the filaments want to be on the boundary and be aligned on the boundary, but then myosin wants to grab them and crumples them into some sort of condensed network. So that's the tango war between the two. And so, if the mechanical energy of filaments wins, then basically the mechanical ground state of the system is to have filaments on. Of the system is to have filaments aligned on the boundary because that's the least bending energy you can get. And this is the last slide I have. I'll just show you that we are looking at multiple experiments that they are doing. And in particular, for example, they up-regulate myosin activity and so on. And we can see how up-regulating myosin activity leads to this dynamical constriction of the ring that we observe in simulations. And with that, With that, lots of. I actually, including here, I've collaborated over Median with lots of people, lots of exciting work. I'm sorry I didn't get to cover some of that. But in this talk, these are the people who did the actual work. So James was at the beginning of Median in terms of implementing it, and Arvind is now at UCSD. I'm going to talk about his work, but he also played a critical role in implementing. Played a critical role in implementing media. I talked about Chini, our own, and Cal. And with Dradek and Arpita, we collaborate again on various projects that I talked about. Thank you for your attention. Thank you so much, Garek. I guess we'll give a round of applause both in person and online. Thank you. Those were lovely examples of applications of Median. So now we're going to open up for questions from Open up for questions from Zoom virtual participants first. So feel free to directly unmute yourself or raise your hand. Hi, thank you. Very nice talk. I have a question. So this morning we heard about things sort of upstream of actin, like grow and all those gaps. So would it be easy to Would it be easy to put some reaction diffusion models showing diffusion of things upstream of active into here, or is it not feasible? No, it would be trivial. It's something we haven't done ourselves. I've had this long interest in raw proteins and the raw network upstream, but we were sort of building it up from the bottom. But at this point, as you said, everything is ready. If someone is interested in that, just taking the SARS-scale. That just taking the cytoskeleton networks that, for example, already are being produced or modeled in median and putting on top of it a reaction diffusion. And as you can see, actually, with this new stuff, it's already, although that's not yet available yet, but for example, we can also do reaction diffusion on a membrane. So you can actually have membrane receptors that are moving around, reacting, and then they are signaling downstream, and that's signaling to actin. So all that is actually. So, all that is actually ready to grow. So it's just we just don't have bandwidth at the moment to do it ourselves, but the apparatus, the instrument is ready to be used, I think. Thank you. I have a quick question. That was a really beautiful talk. Thanks. Maybe you said this and I miss it. How long does it take to run simulations to this type? So it depends on the size of the simulation. I think I have, I don't think I actually kept that slide, but if when we look at systems of about 3 to 5 micron length, so when we go to about from let's say between between ten to one hundred cubic micron, and we have actin concentrations of about twenty micro, because that's what is a limiting factor actually. That's what is a limiting factor actually, because there's lots of actin. On a single CPU, so these are not parallel simulations. On a single CPU, I think these simulations probably would take about one to two weeks. And the biological time scale that they cover would be about two thousand seconds, which is about thirty minutes. And because there is a single CPU, this allows you, if you have a the computer, to have Computer to have multiple runs with different conditions and so on. So, roughly speaking, that's we've pushed simulations up to like cylinders that are 10 micron long and maybe 2 micron in diameter, trying to model neuronal exons, for example. But drastically, that's where we are. We are putting major effort to push that further. With in particular parallelization and GPUs could be one way to go. So that's Ready to go. So that's, but roughly that's where we are. Yes. And I can attest as a user of Median and having worked with some of the students you have on the slides, for smaller spatial scale simulations, your improvements on Median have gotten from days to a few hours kind of things for the types of things we've worked on. So I think it's getting better with version. That's for us. For us, it's actually better. For us, it's actually very high priority because, at the end, we want to simulate the whole cell. And we are not there yet in terms of volumes, but we are not orders of magnitude away. We are maybe one order of magnitude away. Excellent. So, we have a couple of minutes left, and I do want to open it up to in-person participants. Any questions from you all? Yeah, hi. Can you see me? Hello? No, you probably can't. Nice talk, thanks. I had a question about the immune synapse actin clearing out there. Because if you talk to an immunologist about this thing, the reason that it clears out is to make space for delivery of payload to whatever the cell is sticking to, and also downregulation of signaling. Also, down-regulation of signaling receptors on the surface. So, there's a lot of activity which is microtubule-influenced in the middle. So, I'm just curious, like when you talk to Arpita, does she think that this mechanism clears out the actin to allow for the various bits of machinery to get in there? Or is it more that those bits of machinery come in and sort of squeeze the actin out or there's some kind of signaling thing? Some kind of signaling thing. So we were more focused on the biophysical side of it, just to understand how you make rings. And clearly, there are lots of, in vivo, there are lots of factors, including signaling and other things that go on. We were just trying to see what are the minimal factors that could produce a ring and then try to regulate the ring. And in new work that Arpita has done, they've shown that, for example, if you up-regulate myosin activity, Upregulate myosin activity, then similar to the simulation that I showed you at the end, that the ring actually constricts. So there are clearly some levers that you can play and push the system to move in certain directions, like constricting the ring, or the ring could completely disappear, for example, if you start to play with ectin and maracin. But we are maybe at the moment less sort of biologically. At the moment, less sort of biologically focused and more physical, looking at the front viewpoint of physics, just what are the ingredients that make the ring? This is a dynamic ring, right? And its stability, its radius, and things like that. So we've been more focusing on questions of that type. What experimental accomplishments, like how could you play with that ring by changing the conditions? But yeah, I think that longer term biological implications are also extremely interesting. Logical implications are also interesting. Hi, I've got a question. This is Bill Holmes. Do you have the ability in your framework to include structures inside the cell, the nucleus, vesicles, these sorts of things? So that's where we are going with this. That nucleus, we have the ingredients. Let me put it this way: that we have the ingredients for including them. For example, you can imagine that the For example, you could imagine that the nucleus we could model as a mini cell. So, using the same membrane model that I showed, but for example with much larger elastic moduli, we can actually have a model of the nucleus that's the inner membrane and then have the outer membrane that's more floppy as the outer membrane. We actually have incorporated things like vesicles in some simple way, that the vesicles occupy some space and they push away filaments. I don't remember if we've done chemistry with vesicles. Uh I don't remember if we've done chemistry with vesicles, because you could imagine that vesicles could have an internal chemistry and we could we but shouldn't be hard to do if we haven't done it. And the same thing with nucleus, that we could have an internal nuclear chemistry and a separate cytoplasmic chemistry coupled near the surface. So all these things, I think with the main ingredients that we need for them are already there. Just we need some engineering to put some of these things together. Thanks. You're welcome. Thank you, Derek. Thank you, Derek. Do we have time for more? I think we can go maybe one more minute. Is there one in person, Derek? Okay. Thank you for a great talk. This is Leah. Are there insights you get from these models that you wouldn't be able to get from more coarse-grained models? Sometimes at the end of the, at the, I tell I tell it to my graduates: like, if you have like sometimes this model or the system is so complicated that at the end, if you've got, for example, some simple insight, that you could maybe put together a simpler model based on that, that would be maybe as good. But the problem is how to, out of this hundred of things you could have chosen as assumptions and so on, how to come up with that particular assumption. How to come up with that particular assumption. So I think that it depends on the complexity of the system. In particular, when we get to more and more complex systems with more ingredients, I think it's pretty hard to right away write the right mean field description, for example, for systems like that. So we find that, yeah, that analyzing simulations think sense, that we get qualitative insights and it makes sense. But I don't know if I could have easily come up. I could have easily come up with quantitative models that could be right. So that's yeah, so I mean I don't think that these models in any way negate or diminish the role of analytical model or mid-field models. I think they are as important or maybe even more important over time. But they definitely can compose. For example, the geometry, like this complicated 3D geometry of fibers and so on, is very hard. Libraries and so on. It's very hard to do them analytically, it's with Pope, as you know. Thank you. All right, thank you so much, Garrick. I think I have a couple more questions. Sam Isaacson has a question, so maybe we'll catch you in a Gather Town meeting at some point. Thank you so much for the lovely talk. So now we'll set up for our next speaker. Is AJ here? Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I'm here. Excellent. You can, you can, yeah, great.
