My pleasure to introduce Professor Dana Tol Azahala from University of Glennada. He will talk about the fractional Yamabi problem with the singularities of maximum dimension. Please. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you also the organizer. It's my pleasure to give. It's my pleasure to give a talk today and to be able to do some mathematics in the circumstance we are living. So today I'm going to talk about the fractional geometrical problem and I'm going to focus in the case when we allow the presence of singularities and in particular when we have a singularity of maximum dimension. This is a work that I have done in collaboration with Hardichan. Before going to my probably, I want to give Into my problem, I want to give some motivation of why do we study this problem. So, the conformal geometry is the branch of the mathematics that study the angle-personal transformation in a manifold in order to understand the geometry of the given space. It was developed to deal with the study of the scalar curvature. And why? Because if we go to the dimension two, we have the uniformization theorem that classifies all the simplest. That classifies all the simply connected Riemannian surfaces. And indeed, we know that they have to be conformally equivalent to the Riemannian sphere, the complex plane, or the open unit D. That means they have a constant curvature, positive zero or minus one. And if we combine it with the cosmonaut theorem, we have a conformant invariance and we get the relation between the geometry and the topology. But what happens when we go to higher dimensions? Happens when we go to higher dimensions? Well, if we go to the dimension four, there is a parallel theory that instead of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, it has the chair-Gauss-Bonet theorem. And it gives us the definition of the Q-Panett's curvature defined by Alice-Jan. But what happens when we go to any dimension bigger or equal than three, and we want to classify the manifold, checking the scalar curvature. Checking the scalar curvature. So, the classical geometry problem trying to find the uniformization for any Riemannian manifold, compact Riemannian manifold, when we have a manifold with a given metric, we ask for a metric which is conformal to the given one, but that has constant scalar curvature. This, when we go to the analytic part of the problem, what we find is that we have to solve this PD that we have here, where in the left-hand side, Have here where in the left-hand side we have the conformal Laplacian and in the right-hand side we have the critical sovereign exponent. In the case that the manifold we start with is the Euclidean manifold, then it's known that the only smooth solution are the so-called bubble. It's well known, the theorem of Xing and Zhao, that said that if we allow the presence of singularity under the assumption. Singularity under the assumption of scalar curvature positive in the given manifold, we can find a conformal metric which has constant scalar curvature if and only if the dimension of the submanifold we are removing is smaller or equal than n minus 2 over 2. The system was proven by then and they have been constructed. But what happened? What happened is that they need scalar curvature positive. And as we have seen, this is a really strong assumption that it's That it's good if we can make it a little bit bigger. So, recently, it has been developed a whole theory about a non-local curvature, which is a called fractional curvature. And generalized, it's a whole family that generalizes some of the non-curvature. In the case that we have the gamma function, this gamma here, that usually is going to be a fraction equal to one. Then we have the scalar curvature in the case equal to. curvature in the case equal to two we have the q curvature and in the case equal to one half we can say that we could recover the mean curvature let's not say more about this but what is the how do we arrive to this fractional curvature so we need to compute the conformal fractional appliances of the given manifold and there is a lot of theory behind this i don't have time to recover all of this but i most of you This, but most of you know, and for us, the importance is like: okay, in the case that we have gamma equal to one, we will recover the conformal Laplacian that we have in the equation we needed to solve to find the metric for the classical case, that there are no explicit formulas in general, but using the scattering theory developed by Rahan Forski and Fefirman Graham, Alice Chang in collaboration with Mariel Margonzares, and later with. Later with the Jeffrey case, they develop an extension problem that led us to define this conformal fractional Laplacian in any conformity instant manifold. In the case that we have the Euclidean manifold, then this conformal fractional Laplacian is just the fractional Laplacian. And of course, there is an important conformal property because if not, it would not be called conformal fractional Laplacian. And that means if we have two metrics which are conformal. We have two metrics which are conformal, and we are going to use always this conformal factor, it has to be positive. Then we can compute the conformal fractional Laplacian in one manifold using the conformal fractional Laplacian in the manifold conformal to it. And this conformal fractional Laplacian is going to give us the fractional curvature when we applied it to the function constantly equal to one. So this is the definition or the fractional applied. The definition of the fractional applied of the fractional curvature of a manifold. And if we substitute this f equal to one here, we will find this equation here that let us compute the curvature of a conformal metric to a given one. By imposing that this curvature is constant, we arrive to the fractional problem. And this is the problem we are going to study. So we have a manifold of dimension. So we have a manifold of dimension bigger than two gamma, and we want to find a metric which is conformal to the given one that has constant fractional curvature. We have seen that this is equivalent to solve this PD here when we were imposing that this curvature is equal to constant. So we get a constant here. And we want to solve this PD in order to find this. order to find this conformal metric with constant fractional curvature. Well, in the case, this has been studied from a lot of people, and in the case of the Euclidean metric, when we have the Euclidean space with the Euclidean metric, it's known that the only possible solutions, most solutions, are the so-called bubble. And when we allowed the presence of singularities under different assumptions, but important. Assumption, but the important one is that we need to assume only fractional curvature positive and not scalar curvature positive, which is a little bit bigger. Then we know that the problem can be solved only if this is necessary that this condition is satisfied in order for the problem to be solved. And in particular, it is satisfied when the dimension of the soft manifold we are subtracting is smaller than n minus 2 gamma over 2. To gamma over two. So here's where my main work plays take place, and I want to find solutions that are singular along this sub-manifold of dimension k. So I've been working a lot in this problem. In the case that we have a zero-dimensional similarity, this means one point or a finite number of points, we could construct a solution. First, we did some OD approach. First, we did some OD approach, a little with variational method, and we were able to solve it. So, we were happy. What happened if we have a finite number of points? Then, we could develop a non-local gluing method in order to construct the solution for the problem. And the last work we did in this line is what to do when we have a known zero-dimensional manifold, but which Dimensional manifold, but which satisfies this condition to be smaller than a minus two, gamma over two. And here we were able to construct it, developing a non-local Mazeo-Pakart program. But what happened in the case that the manifold we are subtracting has critical maximal dimension n minus 2 gamma over 2? This we are, we so at the beginning we didn't know idea if there were solution or not, and we have been working on. And we have been working on that, and this is what I'm going to present. So, I will do that, but before I want to just give some ideas of what we do when we have a dimension not critical and why it doesn't work. So, I will just say a couple of words, and it's like in this case, non-critical dimension, what we use is we go back to the geometric meaning of our problem. We want to find a metric, a manifold which is conformal to the one. Manifold which is conformal to the one we have and that has constant curvature, right? So we can find another conformal manifold which is conformal to this one because we can go from one conformal to another conformal. So basically what we do is since we could not solve the PD with the fractional Laplacian, we go to the conformal fractional Laplacian in the cylinder. And this is because when we have Rn minus manifold, so imagine that OF manifold is something like that. OF manifold is something like that, we can locally do a tubular neighborhood around this singularity. And when you see in the co-dimension, what you see is something like a cylinder with a singularity in the middle. So this is much more complex, but we can reduce the problem to this study. So locally around the singularity, we are able to transform. Singularity, we are able to transfer the problem in the problem in the cylinder. This is because the cylindrical metric is conformal to the Euclidean 1, which we divide by the factor of R squared, which is the polar, the radius, the polar coordinates. So this is what we do in the non-critical dimensional case, but it doesn't work for the case k equal to a minus 2 gamma over 2. Why? What's happening with that? Our two. Why? What's happening with this dimension? Why it's so critical? Well, we are gonna see it. So, the idea that I was trying to explain with this picture is where we have this PV to solve on Rn minus the singular set. And what we do is we want to find a solution which is singular of Singular of the along the submanifold of dimension k. So we do this trick and we pass from the singularity in the space to a reduction in the exponent of the PD. And locally, when we are close to the singularity, what we have to study is this PD that we have here. Where the P is going to be this exponent that we have here. Exponent that we have here. So, higher is the singularity, smaller is the exponent. So, when we are in the case that we have non-zero but no maximal dimension, then our exponent is going to be in this range. So, it's going to be between the soft critical and the serine critical. What happened when we have the k equal to this n minus 2 over 2? Then we will have the serine exponent. And what happened in the case that the exponent is not critical from below, we can find Critical form below, we can find a fast decay radial solution, which is always radial and has fast decay and close to the singularity, has the scaling invariant power. But what happened in this critical case? What happened is that if we're trying to find the pure power solution that has the scaling invariant power, then we find the fundamental solution. So this is not good enough. We need a logarithmic correction. Moreover, this is not the only problem. Not the only problem. The most important problem we have is that with the problem, we were solving it using the conformal geometry and passing to the cylinder. But in this case, all the theory and Professor Gonzales, we talked about how to get this conformal fractional Laplace in this symbol and how to use it. We need the symbol of the operator and we need to invert the symbol to prove that it's invertible using the symbol. That is invertible using the symbol, and in this case, the symbol constant we get: you have to take the formal limit and it disappears to get zero. So, you cannot do the same, you need something new. So, let's go to the local case. Usually go to the local case to see what happened and what can you do to get the functional k, right? So, the Arves in 83, he solved this equation and he found the profile of the solution for this equation. Of the solution for this equation with in the ball, which have singular at the center. And he did it using the ODE method, and he asked for a more analytic proof. He didn't want the proof using ODE. So we said, okay, let's try to solve not using ODE because of course we do not do ODE because we have a PD. So we have a fractional equation and it's a PD. ODE method usually don't work so well. We did it for the not critical dimensional. Not critical dimensional case, but it was not workful in this case. So we also check it's something done for Picard, not only in the for the for Jamal, sorry, not only the PD in the ball. Picard surface in 93. But the problem is that he was using green method in LP. And this is quite hard. I mean, green method in the non-local setting is quite hard. Is quite hard. The formulas you get are horrible, let's say, and if they are really difficult when you have a just polyhomogeneous functional, when you go to polyhomogeneous with law, then it's even worse. So let's try to find, even for the local case, let's try to simplify the way to find the solution for the Jamaica problem. So what we were able using the stability, so we found a radial approximate, an approximate radial solution using this law. The solution using this log correction, and using Harting inequality, we were able to prove that the linearized operator around this approximate solution is stable. And then we were able to develop all the theory in a tubular neighborhood around our singularity. And the most important thing is that we do all this theory in L infinity. L infinity spaces, which are much easier to generalize when we go to the non-local setting. And the only thing we use is always asymptotic analysis, which is good for the non-local setting, because you need to contour everywhere. So you can do it with asymptotic analysis. So, how do we do it in the fractional case generalizing this result that we did for the local case? Well, the first is to find. Well, the first thing is to find this radial solution close to the singularity, right? So in this case, the problem that we need to solve is the fractional aberration with this critical exponent when we are in the ball in the nature Rn. So remember that we are working in the co-dimension of the singular submanifold. Well, we are able to prove that there is a smooth positive solution. A smooth positive solution for this problem, and also we provide the behavior of the solution around the solution. So, when around the singular point, it's going to behave with this, it's going to have these behaviors that we have here. So, we see that here we have the scaling invariant, the one that should be the scaling invariant forward. We have the logarithmic correction, and later we see that we need some log-lock term where the Some log-lock term. Well, this is just a technical problem in order to be able to develop the green method. We need to add a log-lock correction because, if not, so just with the lock, the error was too big and increasing the power, the error were cancelling. So, we need to add a law correction in order to be able to develop the theory. And of course, when I am talking about the And of course, when I am talking about the solution of this problem, we have to understand them in a really weak sense because we have a singularity. So you really need to think about solution in the very weak sense. Okay, so as I said, the approximate solution that we use is going to have the decay we were expecting. This represents the log. I'm going to use this fee to just to denote the fair. Just to denote the first subscript, denote the power of the radius, and the second one, the one of the law. This is in order to have a formula that fit in this side. And I have to add this block-lock correction. So with this approximate solution, we want to find an exact solution. This is what is called the Luigi method. So we linearize the equation around this approximate solution, and we want to find the perturbation that make it. Perturbation that make this operator invertible. Because if we so if we so we want to find this the perturbation that make it exact solution. If we find an equation that we have to solve in phi, and if this operator is invertible, then we are done. And if we have chosen the approximate solution good enough, then we can apply fixed point and construction on the space. On the space. So we are done, we have the solution, and moreover, it's positive because of construction and because we have that is a canva superharmonic, the tubular neighborhood. So it needs to be, it kind of has to be positive. So the only thing is, okay, how do we prove that this is invertible? Which are these spaces? And for that, we need to check which is the error that we have when we are approximating with over-approximate solution. Approximate solution. And an important thing to take into account is even our approximate solution is an approximate solution close to the singular point, we have to control what is happening in the boundary of the world. We have a non-local problem. It's not enough to control the singularity. This for local is okay here, no. So we will need to add a term that controls what is happening close to the boundary of the ball. So we control, we are able to compute the We are able to compute the error, then we have the space in which the linearized operator is going to arrive, and later we are able to invert it using the stability because we are able to find a super solution thanks to the Harding inequality and the stability. And this gives us that using some a priori estimate and some method of continuation, we can invert the operator so we can solve. The operator, so we can solve the problem. So, how do we go for the Jamaica problem? So, for the Jamaica problem, we have that k has to be an integer. So, the only important case is gamma equal to one and in odd. So, we have to solve this problem. And the important thing, so we are able to find a solution which, close to the singularity, behaves like the approximate solution we had, had fast decay and is smooth in the rest of the places. We use In the rest of the places, we use this tubular neighborhood I was talking about, and the main thing here to pass from the disk to the whole minus the singularity is that we have an approximate solution, which is exact solution in the disk. But remember that we are passing from little n to capital N. Our solution was in the ball in capital N. So we have to control which is the error that we are having when we pass from Uh, having when we pass from the fractional Laplacian in our little n to the capital n. And then we have to find the exact solution. So we compute the error using this comparison with the fractional appliances. And this gives us the weight for the infinity space that we need to use in order to invert the problem. So these are not the only results we got. So this is how we construct. We got so. This is how we construct the solution for the fractional GMABE. But while we were doing this, we got some important results that are also important by themselves. So one of them is like, okay, we are always saying when we pass to R capital A, we are always working in a small ball. Why? Because we have Liouville theory. So you can, if you do the Kelvin, you go to the Kelvin, you go to the exterior problem outside the ball, and there we are able to prove a Lubial theorem. So you know that if you have a solution for the fractional Laplacian, which is positive in the interior, then you will get that the only possible solution is the zero solution. So you have to restrict to the ball and you cannot take it outside. So this GRI is a non-resolved because we don't need to impose. Result because we don't need to impose a lot of things that were imposed before in order to get this UV theorem. But this is not the only one. We were also able to generalize another result in the subcritical exponent. So that regards the multiplicity of solutions. So it's not only the resolution, is it unique? No. Well, and also can we get solutions that are more singular? More singular. So, this was done for the local case and for the fractional case when it was stable. And we proved that this can extend to the case where we have the dimension of the critical dimension of the singularity equal to n over n minus 2 gamma. So we are able to prove that there exist two different sequence of solution, positive solution, which are solution of this problem and that are And that are they explode, they are singular of in a closed set. So, what is the point that we are with the critical dimension? So, if you go above this, we will not get complete metrics. So, this for smaller dimension in the singular set is useful for the maverick, but for us, it will not give us complete metric because the singular set will be too big. But we are able to prove the multiple. But we are able to prove the multiplicity of solution in this case. And finally, the last result we prove is the classification of solution. So for the previous cases, when we have this exponent is a critical sober left or it's between the two critical, we knew which was the behavior of the radial solution around the singularity. But in this case, so for the local case, it was known. For the local case, it was no. For the non-local case, we didn't know it was no, we realized this was a proof a couple of days ago. But we give a different proof of the that it's not only that our solution is in this way, but that all the solutions really need to behave in this way when we are close to the singularity or the singularity is removable. And the most important and nice thing, let's see, is that the way. Nice thing, let's see, is that the way we prove this is, I think, it's new for non-local stats. And what we do is that we are able to translate from a non-local 1D equation to a first-order OD problem. And then we are able to prove the solution. And my time is over. So I will just give some open questions. We are currently working in this space here. So we want to. This space here. So, we want to know if it makes sense to study the intermediate region or not. And if it doesn't make sense, we are closed the classification of Sheng and Jiao in the non-local case. If not, we need to work with this space. And this is all I wanted to say. Thanks, Professor Dalatoli. Are there any questions? Yeah, I have one. Yeah, I have one question. Yeah, as a very nice talk and nice result. And in particular, in this pandemic, you work so well. I want to ask one question. So do you have the existence of this fast, this singular solution in the whole space? So you are now using the solution. Uh, you are now using the solution in a in B1, right? B1 minus zero to construct the solution. You have a solution in the whole space, yes. So, this the solution for the Jamabe, okay, what I did for Jamabe, we did it for just one gamma equal to one half. Let me find it here. So, the solution we construct, so it has the you can glue it later to a fast decay solution. So, when you are close to infinity, you are able to. You are able to glue it to the metric to the radial outside. So you cannot solve this one, the behavior with this one is not possible in the whole space for this thing I was saying about Lu B. But you glue it to zero here. So to the tubular neighborhood, and later you glue the solution to the fast decay outside. No, I will just talk about the radio solution. Just talk about the video solution. Just the video. Do you have a video special solution in Rn minus zero? Not here you are like problem, right? Sorry, can't you repeat the worst? Do you have a radio symmetric solution? Entire radio is symmetrical solution, singular solution. You cannot have it because of Euroville. Cannot have it because of Luvier. No, I mean, it's singular, right? Rm minus zero. But if you have it in the whole so if you have it in the whole Rn minus the minus just its solution of your equation. It's the solution of your equation in the whole Rn minus V1 minus one point. When you apply Lubil, you will get that it's equal to zero because just use the Kelvin transform. Oh, okay. Okay. So did you get that you cannot impose the positivity because in the whole space, at least not positive, maybe sign changing. But when you apply curvature stone, you is not the same equation, you change it. The same equation, you change the equation, yes. But when you apply the so, actually, when you when you so do you have that here, this inequality that is the one that satisfies your function u, when you pass to the Kelvin transform, you get another inequality. So let's call V, the Kelvin transform, which is that actually is the one that gives you the gives you the so I said Kelvin's transform because when you do it you get that the Kelvin satisfies an equation in the vault and then you will but you have you have a weight it's a different one with the Kevin transform you have so you think this it will be possible to solve in the whole yeah The whole yeah, because because Ave has constructed the solution in the whole space, yeah, yeah, of course, but what we were doing is just using this one and later gluing to the to the fast decay. Okay, but the point is that when you, so this is for little N. So the point is that I don't think we are able when we are working in capital N, which When we are working in capital N, which is the condimension. But when you come back to your fractional germinal problem, then you are working in little n, and then lubil is not giving you any trouble there because the exponent is not the critical one. So when you you are able to construct it in the whole little n, but not in the capital N, which is the codimension space. Which is the codimension space? I don't know if I so when okay, we can discuss later, okay? Perfect, dude. Okay, sorry, yeah, due to time. So we thank Professor Dalatori again. So and uh
