This Shin Li is going to talk about angle group points, topological pool groups, algebraic K-theory spectra, and infinite loose cases. First of all, thanks a lot for the invitation. Thanks to the organizers for the invitation to speak. It's great to be in Ben. And also, thanks to Marcelo for giving me this blackboard. So, yeah, I realized that maybe. So yeah, I realized that maybe a more chair-friendly type would be more like topological food groups, because that's what Scott will be about. So we've seen topological food groups this morning already. So let me just briefly recall. So the class of groups we construct from group points. And more precisely, so we take an ample group point. So it's a topological group point which has a basis of compact open bisections. Based on bisections, or if you want an entire group point whose unit space is totally disconnected. And yeah, and we assume that the unit space is Hausdorff, but we don't need the full group point to be Hausdorff. And then we look at the topological full group, which we can define to be the group of global bisections, where the group operations is given by the Yeah, the group operations is given by the multiplication in the group point, where you form the product of subsets of the group point. And as we learned this morning, so this is not quite correct if your unit space is not compact. And if in general you would, or one way to define the full group would be to take an inductive limit, compact over subsets of the space. So there is a definition, but if you want, you can just think about compact in the. Think about compact unit space. Okay, and yeah, so I mean, I won't really go into many examples, but so this is a class of groups that turns out to have interesting properties. So it's basically giving you a machine to construct many, many infinite simple groups out of group points. And then you can control properties of these groups by controlling properties of the underlying group point. Okay, and then as Okay, and then, as I said, so the question that I wanted to address in this talk is: how do you compute, or how do you understand group homology of this class of groups? So, yeah, group homology is sort of a basic invariant for groups. So, it's natural if you construct a new class of groups, you would like to try to understand group homology. But I think, I mean, as usual, when you ask this kind of question, I mean, the This kind of question. I mean, the final computation of homology is one thing, but we hope that sort of in the process of studying this kind of question, you will learn something about the group itself and also about the analytic group for it in our case. Okay, so let me, before I go into the question, tell you a bit about previous work that has been done related to this. And this will sort of be motivation for us. Motivation for us. So, first thing I want to mention is the work of Matui. So, Matui worked a lot on these topological food groups. Homology is one aspect he covered. And so for that, he formulated what you call the AH conjecture. So this is a short exact sequence, which looks like this. So in the middle, you have the first homology group H1, which is for any group that's the beyonization of the group. So that's sort of a basic. Of the group, so that's sort of a basic invariant. And the short exact sequence allows you to study, to analyze this venialization in terms of what's called a groupoid homology. So on the left and right, page 0 and H1 is groupoid homology. And yeah, so I mean, I won't say really anything about how to define esomology theories, but let me just say that there are many ways to think about That there are many ways to think about this: group automology and also group homology. So, you can, for example, write down a very concrete chain complex called the bar complex, concrete homology in that way. You can also view it from the perspective of topology, so this is tomology of certain classifying spaces, or you can use tomological algebra to understand this type of topology. And yeah, and the reason this is interesting, I mean, the reason why you want to have such an exact sequence is because, generally speaking, the group or homology is something that's quite accessible. So there are many examples where you know how to compute it, and so then you can use your knowledge to say something about the first homology of the Foucault. Okay, and yeah, so there have been quite a bit of work, so many positive results. Work, so many positive results verifying this conjecture by various authors. And yeah, maybe I should say, so it's not, I mean, the conjecture says more so there's some conditions, first of all, otherwise you won't expect this to be true. And also, it's not just existence of a short exact sequence, but Matui actually constructs maps, specific maps, that give you this sequence. Okay, so that's the Okay, so that's the first item I wanted to mention. And sort of the nice strategy or general strategy is that you try to relate homology of the full group, which is sort of mysterious you want to understand, to homology of the groupoid, which is something we understand much better. Now there's a second result I want to mention, which maybe at first sight it's not clear what it's the relation to what we're discussing. So this is a result of Schiming. So, this is a result of Schimick and Wall, who proved that Thomson's group B2, which we saw this morning, that it has vanishing homology. So it's acyclic, there's no homology in any degree. And yeah, so what's the relation here? Well, we learned this V2 is a particular topological foot group for the graph group point, the graph one vertex of two groups. Well, for us, the, well, our. Or for us, the well, our favorite model, maybe one favorite model for the Kuhn's algebra O2. And so, from that point of view, this is interesting. So, this, if you want, is one of the first complete computations of group homology for topological Fulbright. But it's even more interesting or intriguing because if you think about writing V2 as the Fulbright of this Kuntz algebra group. This Kuntz algebra group point, well, we know that for that group point, the homology vanishes in all degrees. And so we get a feeling that there should be some connection between groupoid homology and group homology in the spirit of Matu's conjecture, but this time even in all degrees. So this is a very, very nice result. It answered the question of Brown, and I mean, And I mean, not only the result is interesting, but also the methods the two use. So they use tools from topology, and you will see those in a minute. Okay, so yeah, so these are two sources of motivation or inspiration for us. So to summarize, so we're interested in this question, and then the strategy we sort of want to develop is that we want to try. To develop is that we want to try to relate and express this group homology of full group to group homo homology of the underlying groupoid. Reason being that the groupoid homology is usually much more computable. So we have many tools and no a lot more. And just to make that last point, I just list a couple of group points where you can compute homology, or there's some results. No. Okay. So. So, yeah. So now we have a strategy. Now let's go do it. So it turns out that there's actually, I mean, the strategy is sort of very natural, but it turns out to be, require quite a bit of work to relate the two. And so here's on a slide the summary what to do to make this. What to do to make this happen. So, the general strategy is: so, we have an ample group point G, that's the starting data, and we construct the topological foot group. And that's the group we want to understand the homology of. Now, we don't go directly from left to right, but we do several constructions. So, from the ample viewpoint, first step is you construct this permutative. This permutative category. So it's a small category which has a direct sum operation. And I'll save it, if I have time, how to construct it, but it will be based on the compact open bisections of your point. Okay, and why are we interested in such a category? Well, so topologists, they take such categories and then, because you have a direct sum, you can talk about algebraic k-theory for these. So, what you get from applying the algebraic k-theory. Applying the algebraic K-theory machinery, you get a spectrum, so the kind of spectra that describe generalized homology theories. So you get that spectrum, so this is a sequence of spaces with connecting maps. And then, because it is sort of a nice spectrum, the same data, so the sequence and the connecting maps, the same data is encoded by a single topological space, which is called the infinite loop space. Is called Infra-Duke space. And you can imagine because it's a single space encoding all this data, it will be sort of more complicated, but it's just a space. Okay, and then, so once I go to that corner of the diagram, I've indicated this question mark, because now, well, you ask, why are we doing all this, right? So why, how does this help us understand our initial question, which was just about homology for topological food. Homology for topological groups. So I owe you an explanation, and let me offer you the following results. So on the left-hand side of the diagram, we had our groupoid. And it turns out that, in general, for every ampere groupoid, the groupoid homology is always the reduced stable homology of this algebraic K-theory spectrum. By K-theory spectrum. So that's the first ingredient to explain this diagram that the homology of the glucoid can be expressed using that spectrum. So this is true in general. And then the second result, which completes the picture, it requires some conditions. So let me explain the conditions in a minute. But the result then says that the homology of the full group, what we're interested in, is the homology of this infinite group space. Is the homology of the silver group space. Right, and so the point now is: I mean, you want to, so the strategy is to relate or express homology of the full group in terms of homology of the group oil, but now you have translated this problem into the problem of relating this homology of the infinite loop space in terms of homology of the K-3 spectrum. Now, you might say this is even worse because there's all these objects popping up, but the point is that. Up. But the point is that in topology, people have studied these kinds of questions a lot and they've developed lots of machinery that allow to say many interesting things about this comparison or these spaces and spectra. And so this is what we can use then. So I'll show you some consequences in a minute. Okay, but let me just say a few words about these conditions. So minimality for group points just means that. For group hoise just means that every orbit of the group extends. So, similar is for usual dynamical systems. And what is comparison? So, that's a very interesting property in itself. And it comes up in classification of these algebras. So, the statement is this: your group voice comparison: if whenever you have two non-empty compact open sets of the unit space. Of the unit space, and for all non-trivial invariant measures, one subset has always smaller measures than the other. Then comparison says this inequality, there must be a dynamical reason for that. So you can transport your smaller, your and measure smaller set into the bigger one using the dynamics, using the coupon. This is what comparison says. And yeah, so I think. And yeah, so I think it's I mean, it's an interesting property in itself. So it's actually an open question whether every minimal amplitude always has comparison. So yeah, you will look at questions for open problems later on. Maybe that's a real interesting one. Right, but on the other hand, it's known for many examples that we do have comparison. So there are many positive. So there are many positive results. Two questions. First is: could you say kind of briefly how I should think about this infinite loop space? Yes, very roughly. Yes. So, I mean, yes, so loop space, loop space essentially means maps from the circle into your space. Right? And then, so this infinite loop space comes up because in the spectrum, Because in the spectrum, so you have a sequence of spaces, and the connect maps are actually from not the space, one space to itself, but it goes from a suspension of the space to itself. And so, in that sequence, so what you need to encode the sequence in the Himalayaspace is what's called an omega spectrum, and that relates sort of these individual spaces sort of in a sense that one space is the Luke space of the other. One space is a group space of the other. So there's a sequence, an infinite sequence of groups, and that sort of gives the name of that space. Okay. Did you have a second question? Yeah, but you don't have to answer it. I'm just wondering if the name comparison is because when you get the reduced algebra of this group way, does it have strict comparison with positive elements or is it strictly different? Okay. Okay. Yes, so okay, so this explains the conditions. And yeah, I said why this is useful. Now let me show you some actual results, what you can do with these two theorems. So let's assume we have all these conditions. So I should say in particular, if your group point is purely infinite minimal, then it will satisfy these conditions. It will satisfy these conditions. So, this is a particular special case of the setup. Okay, so one corollary you can get is these kind of vanishing results. So, if the group hold homology vanishes, say, up to a certain degree, then you have the same behavior for the group homology of the full group. And you have isomorphism and topic. So, this explains now this vanishing result of Shimmykin-Wah, that some systems group E2 has no group homology. Has no group homology. Because this is now the explanation, it's just that the underlying groupoid, the Kunzalge group point, has trivial groupoid homology. But immediately you get all sorts of other examples of topological food groups where you can say it's integrally acyclic, has no homology, because what you can do, you can take this Kunz algebra group point and take the product with any other minimal anti-coupoid, and that will have banished group points. So you get also. Group by property. So you get all sorts of other groups with that property. Okay, so that's one application. Second application is really the ideal thing you want to do. So you would like to have a formula where your input, what's accessible, the group odomology, and the output would be the group homology. So unfortunately, integrally, it's very complicated. But turns out if you worked over rational numbers, But turns out if you work over rational numbers, there is such a formula. So, yeah, there are some terms which don't really matter what exactly they are, some algebraic constructions you can do with a group or homology, and then you just get the group homology ratio. Okay, and last application is you get such exact sequences in low degrees. So the last few terms. So, the last few terms precisely are the ones that came up in Matuis-H conjecture. So, this in particular implies that conjecture. And it gives you a bit more, so it tells you you can extend a bit to the left, giving you an obstruction when this map from H0 to H1 is injective. Okay. So yeah, so these are the consequences. Consequences. Now, maybe in the remaining time I can just say something about the idea behind all this. And so, I guess one thing I would like to explain a little bit is this construction of this primitive category, because that's sort of at this part of the story. So, how do we construct this category? What's the idea behind it? This category, what's the idea behind it? And I already indicated that this is a category which is built out of compact open bisections, which are sort of the crucial building blocks for these ample group points. And more precisely, what we want to do is we want to say every bisection should give me a morphism and error in my category. So I want the objects in my category to be copyright with subsets, like a subset. Come back over the subsets, like the source and the range, and then every bisection just gives me an arrow, a morphism in my category from the source to the range. So, yeah, this is very natural. This is in a way how we think about bisections. But the crucial thing is then we want the category, but we want also a direct sum operation. So, what should be the direct sum? And there is also an initial idea which is natural, and the initial idea is that direct sum should. The initial idea is that direct sum should be given by disjoint unions of compact open sets or by sections. Because, yeah, in a way, if you think about in particular zerosport homology, that distributed union will give you the addition. And this is what this direct sum is supposed to do. It should give you the addition in your ideal K-theory, using K0 in the end. Okay, so that's the initial idea. That's sort of the naive idea. There's a problem, though. There's a problem though. The problem is: if you give me two compact open sets or compact bisections, there's no reason that they should be disjoint, right? And so we need to, in a sense, create more space to have this, at least be able to find a distrained copy. So, what we do is amplify. And what I mean by that is you take your unit space and you just create infinite many copies of the And you just create infinite many copies of that saving space. This is what you do with cross-natural numbers. And then the group of it, you replace that by R cross G. So you take the full coefficient solution on N and take the product with G. So, I mean, from our point of view of C-star address, this is a very natural construction. I mean, this R is just the group on model for the compact operators. So, what you do is just tender with compacts. Use is tender with compacts. This is what we do if you want to look at k-theory. So, this is very natural. But the useful, or the reason this is useful for us is because what we can now do is if we now have two compact open subsets, which will be tuples, because I've taken cosmos n, then what I can do, I want to form the disjoint union. They're not disjoint, but I can take the second tuple and I just move it far out to the right, and eventually it will become disjoint by compact. And eventually it will become disjointed by compactness. So this is sort of the idea how you resolve this problem. And then, so this is for objects, how you define direct sound, and then for morphisms for bisections, you do a very similar procedure. Okay, yeah, so that was a very brief indication or the idea behind this construction. And yeah, I think I'll stop here. Yeah, I think I'll stop here. Thanks. Are there any questions?
