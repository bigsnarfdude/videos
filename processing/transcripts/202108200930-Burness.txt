Well, actually, about something I do know that I do know the definition of what's in the title there, the base of a permutation group. So that's already up on this one, ready to start. Okay, thanks, Tim. Okay, thanks, Donna. Thanks for the invitation to give a talk at this conference. So as the title indicates, I'm going to talk about some recent results on bases for primitive permutation groups, where we impose some structural condition on the stabilizers of the group. And sort of one of the motivations. Of the group. And sort of one of the motivations for the work is to try and extend some well-known results about bases for finite permutation groups where there's a condition on the whole group. And now we just want to assume some condition, some local condition on the point stabilisers, and see to what extent these previous results extend to this, in some sense, more general situation. Okay, so there's been two or three talks this week which have looked at basis for permutation groups. In particular, Maria Pia and Melissa did a really good job of introducing the concept and motivating it and explaining. The concept and motivating it, and explaining connections and some of the history. So, I'm not going to really say much about that. I really want to sort of get into the details, but let me just set the notation up. So, I'll just give the definition and just set the notation up. Okay, so G is going to be a permutation group on a set omega. I think throughout the entire talk, everything's going to be finite. I won't always say that, but we're thinking of a finite group acting on a finite set. And let me just remind you of the definition of a base. So, this is a classical invariant in permutation group theory. And the definition is as follows. And the definition is as follows. So, a base is just a subset of omega, so that the with the property that its point-wise stabilizer is trivial. Okay, so only the identity element fixes each element in a base. And so, what that immediately means is that leads to the fact that two elements of G are distinguished by their action on a base, which is a bit like if you think about a basis for a vector space in a linear map, it's a similar sort of concept. Okay, a nice way to think about this base concept is the following. Is the following. So, well, let me just say what the base size is. The base size is the smallest size of a base. That's the invariant that we're interested in here. Okay. And bases always exist. G is acting faithfully on omega. So omega itself is a base. And the idea is that we should be able to hopefully try and find a much smaller subset that has this base property. And in particular, we're interested in the smallest possible size. Okay, now in this talk, we're going to be looking at primitive groups, which I'll say something about in a second. But in the more general transitive setting, General, in the more general transitive setting, so this is the situation where all the point stabilizers are conjugate. There's another way to think about the base size which might be quite useful to sort of think of it this way. So if you have a transitive group, as I say, the point stabilizers are all conjugate. And because G is acting faithfully on omega, the point stabilizer is a core-free subgroup. So if you take the intersection of all the conjugates of H, it's the identity element. And so you might ask, well, how many conjugates do you need so that when you take the intersection? Many conjugates do you need so that when you take the intersection, you get the identity element, and the smallest number of conjugates that you need is exactly the base size of the group. So, you can think of it this way, which doesn't talk about permutation group theory, this is sort of an abstract way to think about the concept. Okay, so that's the definition. So, baselize is what we're interested in. And let me just give a couple of quick examples. I think we saw these ones earlier in the week. So, for example, if you take the symmetric group of degree n in its natural action, then the base size is as low. Action, then the base size is as large as it can possibly be. It's n minus one, simply because if you take a subset with n minus two or fewer points, there's going to be a transposition that fixes that set point wise, and so it's not a base. Okay, another example again, which sort of goes back to sort of thinking about this as being a generalization of basis in linear algebra, is if you take the general linear group on a, say, a finite dimensional vector space, so just the usual linear action, then here it's pretty easy to see that a subset of V. And here it's pretty easy to see that a subset of V is a base if and only if it contains a basis in the usual sense. And so the base size is just the dimension of the space. Okay, so those are two nice easy examples where you can actually compute this base size precisely. They're a little bit misleading because in general, if you pick up a permutation group, it's actually a rather hard problem to try and determine the base size precisely. And that can be made into a precise statement in the language of complexity theory, which Melissa talked a little bit about in her. About in her talk. Okay, so what can you say in general? Well, let me just give an easy lemma. There's some bounds which come out immediately from the definition. So here's the easy lemma. So we've got a finite permutation group of degree at least two. Then you can bound the base size between these two logarithms here. So log to the base n, where n is the degree, the number of points that we're permuting. And here we've got the log 2. So how does this come out? Well, it's really easy. So let me just give the argument. Me just give the argument. So, take a base of minimal size. Remember, BG is the minimal size of a base, so I've just chosen a base of minimal size. And we just choose some arbitrary ordering of those points, and then we define a stabilizer chain which comes from that base of minimal size. So G0 is just the full group, G1 is the stabilizer of alpha 1, G2 is the stabilizer of alpha 1 and alpha 2, and so on. And of course, when you get down to the stabilizer of all of the points, by definition of a base, that's trivial. Definition of a base, that's trivial. Okay, now since this is a base of minimal size, all of these inclusions have to be proper, otherwise, you'd find a base of smaller size. So, the index, if you look at the indices between at each inclusion here, is at least two. But of course, if you look at this index here, this is the length of an orbit of GI. Okay, so the length of that orbit is, of course, at most n, because n is the total number of points that we're acting on. So, this bound comes out very, very easily, and that obviously. Very very easily, and that obviously leads to the following bound on the order of g. And from that, by taking logarithms, you get the bound on B of G. So it comes out pretty easily. And it's not hard to construct examples of transitive permutation groups that have base size at both ends of this spectrum. Okay, so let me just give an example of a transitive group which is close to the upper bound, okay, log two of the order of the group. So a nice, easy way to do that is to look at this reference. Nice, easy way to do that is to look at this wreath product. So, just an implimitive transitive group. So, the cycle group of order 2 with this cycle group of order n over 2 acting, just permuting around the n over 2 copies of C2, in its natural action on n points. Then here, it's an easy exercise to show that the base size is half n, and half n is close to the logarithm of the order of the group to the base two within a small constant. So you can construct transitive examples at the upper end of that spectrum. Examples at the upper end of that spectrum. Okay, so that's sort of a general sort of bounds that come out. Okay, so in the title of the talk, we're interested in primitive groups. These are, of course, the basic building blocks of all finite permutation groups. So let me say something about primitivity just briefly. Okay, so we know the definition. We've got a transitive permutation group acting on a set omega, and it's primitive if there's no non-trivial G-invariant partition of omega. Of omega. Okay, so that's the definition. So it's some sort of irreducibility condition. And a nice way to sort of think about this in terms of the point stabilizer: remember, we're in a transitive action, so all the point stabilizers are conjugate. And a transitive action will be primitive if and only if the point stabilizer is a maximal subgroup. Okay, so that's an equivalent definition. Now, the main results about primitive permutation groups, which plays a key role in what I'm going to talk about today, Today is the Oaknat-Scott theorem, so proved about 40 years ago now, which describes the structure of the finite primitive permutation groups and breaks them up into various families. I don't really want to go into lots of the details about the different types of families that arise, but I'll just highlight two of them in particular. So one of the things that comes out when you have a primitive permutation group is the fact that it imposes structural conditions on the group itself, so abstract group theoretic conditions on G. And that's manifested in particular. G and that's manifested in particular in the structure of the soccle of the group. So the soccle of the group is just the group, the subgroup generated by its minimal normal subgroups. And it turns out if you have a primitive permutation group, then that soccle has to be isomorphic to a direct product of isomorphic simple groups. Okay, so it's not true in general for a finite group, but it is if you've got a finite primitive group. Okay, so there's two extreme cases that arise. The soccle could be abelian. Okay, so then you've got Abelian. Okay, so then you've got a direct product of isomorphic abelian simple groups. So you've just got a vector space. You've got an elementary abelian p group. And that's what leads to the affine case. Okay, so this is described here. You've got this normal subgroup V, it's just an elementary abelian p group. H is acting on V in a natural way. And the condition for primitivity is that H acts irreducibly. Okay, the other extreme would be the situation where the soccle is non-abelian and it's just a single simple group. And it's just a single simple group. And that's what leads to the almost simple case, which is going to feature perhaps most prominently in this talk. And if you're in the almost simple case, and that just means your group is between a simple group and its full automorphism group. Okay, so there are two extremes that come up in the O'Nan-Scott theorem, and then there's three other, there's different ways in which you can describe the theorem. Let's not worry about the details here. There's a diagonal type, there's something called the product type groups, and then we've got twisted wreath products as well. Product type will come in, so let me just say something very Will come in, so let me just say something very quickly about that one. So, this is where you blow up one of the almost simple or diagonal type primitive groups. So, there's a blow-up construction involving the product action of a wreath product, and this is a way to build new primitive groups from old. So, product-type groups come from almost simple and diagonal-type primitive groups through this blow-up construction. Okay, so that's the Orion and Scott theme, and that sort of is a key tool for working with these primitive permutation groups. Right. Right, okay, so let me remind you again of the bounds that we just saw on the previous slide. So, this is a general situation where you've got a finite permutation group, then the base size is bounded by these two logs. And as I showed you with that example, there are transitive groups where the base size is close to the upper bound. Okay, but maybe it's a natural question to ask, well, what happens if you impose some extra conditions on the group? For example, primitivity. And this leads to Piever's conjecture. Pievers conjecture. Okay, so this also has featured in one or two of the talks earlier this week. And this was probably the most influential open problem in the field for about 25 years. So it generated a huge amount of interest and a lot of people worked on this problem. And it's a very nice conjecture. So what it says is, well, as stated here, what it's really saying is that the base size of a primitive group is rather small in general. If you think about this range that we've got here, then what this is saying is that there's some absolute constant C independent of the group. Constant C independent of the group, so the base size is in some sense within a constant of the lower bound. So they've all got small base sizes. Okay, and the example I showed you before certainly shows that primitivity is essential to have such a bound. Okay, so making progress on this conjecture was pretty tough. The main tool was the O'Neill-Scott theorem that provided a framework for the proof. Various cases were considered by various authors over a 25-year period. Over a 25-year period. And that culminated in some brilliant work from Doyan Halassi and Maroti, who finished this off in 2018 and finished off in a strong form in the sense that they got, in some sense, an explicit version of the bound. They could show that the base size in this situation is at most, as you can see here, 45 times the log plus some constant, absolute constant. Okay, so it was pretty hard. None of the primitive families that I mentioned on the previous slide are easy. Families that I mentioned on the previous slide are easy for this conjecture. They all require some work and different tools and techniques. Okay, so that was 2018, and then sort of the state of the art result on this was due to Halassi, Liebeck and Marotti 2019, where they strengthened the bound, completely explicit now, two times the log plus 24. As Melissa, I think it was mentioned in her presentation, that the multiplicative constant two here is best possible. Here is best possible. Probably there's maybe a little bit of room for improvement on the 24, but it's a great achievement, especially to have such an explicit bound which proves Pieber in a strong form. Okay, so that's Pieber's conjecture. It generated a lot of interest in bases over this period. What I want to talk about is actually the first step towards proving Pieber's conjecture, which was done by Akol Cheres 25 years ago. So, this is the soluble case. So, Cherez So Cherez attacked Pieber's conjecture by thinking about: well, what can we say about soluble primitive permutation groups? What sort of base sizes do those groups have? And he proved a beautiful result. So very, very clean statement. There's no exceptions. If you have a finite soluble primitive group, then not only does Piever's conjecture hold, but the base size is actually just bounded by a constant, and that constant is four. Okay, so a lovely, a lovely result by Akos Cherez. Let me make some comments on that. Let me make some comments on that. So, firstly, what do soluble primitive groups look like? Well, if you're soluble and primitive, then the soccle is going to have to be abelian. Remember, the soccle is the direct product of simple groups, all of which are isomorphic. So, this is putting us immediately in the affine case. So, all of these soluble primitive groups come into the affine family. And remember that we've got our point stabilizer H, we think of as the point stabilizer of the zero vector, and that's an irreducible subgroup of GLV. GLV. Okay, so that's the groups that we're interested in here. I'll just point out that his bound is best possible. It can't be beaten. Four is optimal. There are infinitely many examples where it's equal to four. One way to see that is to use this work of Palfi and Wolf, I think, independently, who showed that there's infinitely many soluble primitive groups where this logarithm, remember n is the degree of G, this logarithm is actually strictly bigger than 3. Remember that this is always a lower bound for the base size. So for all of these groups, the base Size. So for all of these groups, the base size is at least four, and Showas tells us it's at most four, so we get equality. And in the same paper, he actually also looks at some special cases: like if the order of the group is odd, then the base size is at most three, and again, it's infinitely many words equal to three. So it's a really nice result, an optimal statement. Okay, so that's Cherez's theorem. Let me comment on the proof just briefly. I don't want to say too much about it, it's quite technical in places, but there's a definite Technical in places, but there's a definition that comes in which is going to appear and be important to us later, which is perhaps the reason why I want to just say a few words about how he goes about this. Okay, so what have we got then? So here's the setup again. So we've got a primitive affine group, and we're assuming the group is soluble. So of course, V is soluble, and this forces H, the point stabilizer, to be soluble as well. So H is the stabilizer of the zero vector. And so if you want to show that the base size of G is at most four, it suffices to show that the base size of H is at most. Suffices to show that the base size of H is at most three with respect to its linear action on V. Okay, so that's what we've got to do. Right, first observation. Again, this came up in Melissa's talk. So in some cases, H may actually have a regular orbit on V. So what does that mean? It means that there's a non-zero vector in V so that the point stabilizer in H is actually trivial. So what does that mean if the point stabilizer in H of V is trivial? That means that there's a non-zero vector V, which is not fixed by any. Which is not fixed by any non-identity element of H. So, if you translate that, that gives you this expression over here. If you take all of these one-eigen spaces, these are the fixed spaces of X on V, and you run over all non-identity elements. So each one of these is a subspace and take the union, that's not the whole vector space. There's some non-zero vector outside of that union. Okay, so that gives you a way to try and attack the base size problem for affine groups by thinking about these fixed spaces. About these fixed spaces, can you estimate the sizes of these fixed spaces and do some estimates on the size of that union? If you can force that union to have size less than v, you've shown that h has got a regular orbit. And that's basically what Cherez does, at least in half of the argument. So there's two cases that come up here, and this is often the case when you work with affine primitive groups. There's the so-called primitive case and the imprimitive case. There's two types of primitivity going on here. When I say H is primitive, I mean H is primitive as a Is primitive, I mean H is primitive as a linear group. H is a subgroup of GLV, and we say that it's primitive as a linear group if it doesn't preserve a non-trivial direct sum decomposition of V. Okay, so that's in some sense the slightly easy, this is the easier case to work with for this particular problem. And what he does is he uses work of Gluck and Mance, who studied soluble primitive subgroups of general linear groups. They made some estimates on the sizes of these spaces, and with some work, you can force not necessarily BHs. Force not necessarily bh's the base size to be one, but you can get the base size to be at most three, and in fact, most of the time it is one in that situation. Okay, so that was using that work of Bluck and Mance. The harder case is to handle the situation where H is acting imprimitively. So again, what does that mean? That just means that H is now preserving a direct sum decomposition of V into equidimensional pieces. And because H is acting irreducibly on V, because G is primitive, that must mean that H is also. Primitive, that must mean that H is also transitively permuting the sum ends of that direct sum decomposition. So you get a transitive permutation group arising in the imprimitive case. And that's what causes some complications. Okay, so what you end up with here is if you choose, you can choose a sort of a refine, you can keep refining such a direct sum decomposition until you can refine it no more. And in that situation, what you end up with is you embed H inside a wreath product, where L is acting primitively on. L is acting primitively on, say, the first somand, and P is some permutation group which is transitively permuting the surmands which are being induced by H. Okay, so both L and P are induced from H, H is soluble, so L and P are both soluble as well. Okay, so that's the imprimative case. And then what Cherez does, this is a really nice result which finds lots of applications, is he studies what's called the distinguishing number of P, which is another invariant which is related in some way. Invariant, which is related in some sense to the base size, and it comes in here and it crops up quite a bit in the literature on bases whenever we're in the presence of a wreath product. And so, what it proves is that if you have a soluble transitive permutation group, then the distinguishing number is at most five. That bound is also best possible. It gives examples to show that it can equal five. And what is the distinguishing number? So, this is just well, one way to say that, one way to translate this bound dp at most five is to say that there's a partition. To say that there's a partition of the set on which P is acting, P is acting on, say, the numbers one to K. There's K sum n's in this direct sum decomposition. And it's saying that there's a partition of that set into at most five parts so that no non-identity element in P fixes setwise all of the parts in that partition. Okay, so it's a bit like base size, but it's a sort of like a setwise version rather than a pointwise version, if you like. Okay, so he proves that, and that's really quite a non-trivial argument. And that's a really quite a non-trivial argument, very clever combinatorial argument to show that bound that the distinguishing number is at most five. And then, using that, that's really the key tool. And then you can now do a little bit more work using the fact that we know that the base size of L on V1 is at most three by the first part of the argument. L is acting primitively on V1. And then using this distinguishing partition in a clever way to construct vectors, you can force the base size of the full Wreath product to be at most three. Full wreath product to be at most three, and because H is sitting inside this wreath product, the base size of H is at most three. Okay, so I haven't really gone into too many details there. I suppose the main thing to take away is the fact that the argument splits into primitive versus imprimitive, and for the imprimitive case, there's this distinguishing number result which comes in, which plays a key role. Okay, so that's Akosh's theorem and some words about the proof. Okay, so I started thinking a bit about this. So I started thinking a bit about this. I mean, I've worked with showers as results before, and I started thinking about: well, what can we say if we relax the condition on the group being soluble and could we impose the condition just on the pre-stabilizers? What can we say? Okay, so of course, if you have a soluble, if G is soluble, then of course all the stabilizers are soluble, but this would be a more general problem. Is there still a bound on the base size? Is there a constant? What's the situation? And so, yeah, the paper which has So, yeah, in a paper, which hasn't appeared just yet, but it was finished last year, I proved the following theorem. So, if you take a finite primitive group and just impose solubility on the point stabilizers, then there is a bound on the base size. It's a constant and it's actually at most five. So, it's four if G soluble. If you relax that condition, you can prove the base size at most five. So, I want to spend some time talking about this result and some of the ingredients that go into the proof. Okay, first, let me point out that this bound is also optimal. Let me point out that this bound is also optimal, so there's infinitely many groups where the bound is realized. So, one way you can construct infinitely many examples is to take a product-type construction. So, you here, you start with the natural action of S5 on five points. So, the point stabilizer is S4. Now, that base size, if you remember from the first slide, is base size 4. It's not 5, it's 4. But if you form this product type, so you form the wreath product and you make it act on 5 to the K points of the product action, so you take. Product action, so you take k here to be at least two, then you can prove that the base size is exactly five in those cases. Okay, and of course, this does satisfy the condition that the point stabilizer is a soluble group. Okay, there's other ways you can construct examples where the bound is achieved. And for almost simple groups, we prove quite a bit more, actually. So, for almost simple groups, we can show, for example, that if you take a sequence of almost simple primitive groups with this property on point-stabilized. Groups with this property on point stabilizers, where the order tends to infinity, then the probability that you just choose four random elements, they form a base, that probability tends to one as the size of the group tends to infinity. So almost any four points will form a base in the almost simple setting. In fact, we did more than this, and we needed some of these results for handling the product type case, which is going to come later. We actually worked out the exact base size for all almost simple groups with. For all almost simple groups with soluble stabilizers, not just that the base size is at most five, but exactly what is it, two, three, or four. Okay, and what's going to be important later is there are examples where the base size is five in this almost simple setting, but it happens very, very rarely. In fact, there's only essentially three examples. So the first example is just this action of S8 on the cosets of this wreath product. So that's just acting on a set of partitions. And then there's a couple of actions of classical groups acting on a pro. Of actions of classical groups acting on appropriate parabolic subgroups, and that's it. Okay, and the fact that we know these examples where the base size is five, actually, we do need that for the proof of this theorem when we come to the product type case. So I'll explain that shortly. Okay, so that's soluble stabilizers. Let me just make a quick connection to an open problem of Evgeny-Dovid, which this is related to in some sense, although it wasn't really the motivation for working on this. Okay, so I worked with. Okay, so I worked with primitive groups and we showed the base size is at most five. Dovin conjectures, I think this has been open for about 20 years, that if you take a transitive permutation group and you assume the point stabilizers are soluble, then the same conclusion holds. Okay, so it's more general. So this is related to a conjecture of Babai, Goodman, and Pieber from a paper in 1997, phrased in a slightly different way, but essentially they were making the same conjecture with base size at most seven. Dobbin conjectures base size at most five. Base size at most five. Okay, so my theorem that I mentioned on the previous slide proves the conjecture for primitive groups, but the transitive case is open. Okay, so this is still an open problem. Dovin's done some nice work on this. So there is a reduction in some sense to almost simple groups, but you need a little bit more. So it's one of those reductions where it's not sufficient to simply establish the conjecture for almost simple groups. You need to establish a stronger form of the conjecture for almost. Form of the conjecture for almost simple groups in order to prove this result in general. What you need to do is actually take a transitive almost simple group on a set omega, and what you do is you need to look at the action of G on this Cartesian product of five copies of omega. Okay, now if the base size is at most five, that means that G has at least one regular orbit on that Cartesian product. And what Dovin proves is if you can prove a stronger result, namely that there's at least five different regular orbits on that Cartesian orbit. Different regular orbits on that Cartesian product, then that's good enough to get out this general conclusion. So that's what you need. So it's a stronger condition. But it automatically holds if you can show the base size is at most four. That comes out quite easily. So it's quite actually pretty tough conjecture, this, I think, to extend from primitive to the general transitive case. Even though in some sense, you might think, well, for the primitive case, the stabilizer is as large as it can possibly be. So maybe that should be. large as it can possibly be so maybe that should be the hardest case to prove but it's not because you could have a non-maximal soluble subgroup which is not contained in a let me get it right not contained in a soluble maximal subgroup right it could just be contained in an insoluble maximal subgroup which has a very large base size so for example you could have in a classical group some soluble subgroup that embeds in a parabolic then you've got to start thinking about how does that embed in uh what are the what's the structure of these soluble groups it becomes pretty difficult but there has been some progress I'll just But there has been some progress, I'll just mention very briefly. So, Anton Bakalov, who's a PhD student in Auckland, wrote a very nice paper where he handled the alternating group case. So, he established Dovin's stronger condition in the alternating group case. And his PhD thesis is looking at, he's done quite a lot of nice work in extending this to certain classical groups under certain conditions. But there's still quite a bit more work to do. And I wrote a paper earlier this year where we looked at the sporadic groups and also established. Groups and also established Dovin's condition in a strong form. In fact, the base size is at most three always if you take an almost simple sporadic group. There's still quite a bit more work to be done on that. Okay, so that's Dolvin's conjecture. Let me go back to the theorem. So I want to say a little bit about the proof and some of the ideas that go into it. Okay, so the first thing to do is like we did with Scherez's theorem. What are the primitive groups that arise here? What primitive groups have soluble stabilizers? So if the group's soluble, that forces the group. So, if the group's soluble, that forces the group to be affine, but now we've got a weaker condition, and so extra families arise. So, it's quite easy to see by the Onan-Scott theorem that if you've got a primitive group with soluble point stabilizers, then either you're affine, you're almost simple, or you're a certain type of product type group. Okay, we saw this one in the S5 example I talked about before. Remember, the product type groups are blow-ups of diagonal or almost simple groups. And here, the only ones that could come up. Simple groups. And here, the only ones that could come up would be a blow-up of an almost simple primitive group, which itself has a soluble point stabilizer. Okay, so there's sort of three cases to look at here if you're going to try and prove this theorem. But one of them we get for free, of course, right? So of course, if you're in the affine case and we're assuming the point stabilizer is soluble, that means H is soluble. But V is, of course, soluble. V is the soccle. It's just elementary abelian. So the whole group G is soluble and therefore Cherez's bound applies. Show as is bound applies. So the affine case is completely done. So it's really about looking at almost simple and product type. And as I said, the product type groups are built from almost simple groups. And so really, you need to look at the almost simple groups first and then apply that work to handle the product type group, the groups that arise. And so most of the work here goes into the almost simple groups. Right. Okay, so let me say a little bit about how that works out then. So take an almost simple group. So it's a primitive. Simple group. So it's a primitive, so it's a primitive almost simple group. So as I said before, it's got subtle T's. This is a non-abelian simple group. And G lives between T and the automorphism group. And remember, H is our point stabilizer in the group, and that's assuming that's a soluble maximal subgroup of G. Okay, so firstly, what are the possibilities for H? Well, they're all known by the vast literature that we've got on maximal subgroups of simple and almost simple groups. We certainly know all the soluble maximal subgroups, and they were written down explicitly. Maximal subgroups, and they were written down explicitly in the paper by Li and Zhang in 2011. So, we know all of them up to conjugacy, so that's a good starting point. Okay, so now we're going to consider them soccle by soccle. So, for the sporadic groups, there's really nothing, there's not really much to do here because in earlier work with Eamon O'Brien and Rob Wilson, we worked out the exact base size for all primitive groups with soccolar sporadic group, whether or not the, regardless of whether or not the stabilizer is soluble. Okay, so we know all of that, so simple to read off. Similarly, for the To read off. Similarly, for the case where the soccer is an alternating group, there's work by me, Bob, and Jan from 2011, where we studied, we didn't quite study the general case where the soccle is an alternating group. We were assuming that the point stabilizer H acts primitively on the numbers one to D. So there's still what are called the standard actions of alternating in symmetric groups to think about where you're acting on case sets or you're acting on partitions. But if you think about it, for example, if you have a situation like I said, For example, if you have a situation like a symmetric group and you've got a soluble maximal subgroup, and if you see that soluble maximal subgroup is acting intransitively on the numbers 1 to D, well, what does this subgroup look like? Well, it's a direct product of two symmetric groups, which is very, rarely soluble. Okay, that puts a very, you know, I think if D is at least nine, then it can't be soluble. So you're only looking at some very, very small degree groups, which can be handled very, very easily. Okay, so that's what I'm saying. Okay, so that's what I'm saying here. The soluble hypothesis severely restricts the cases where H is intransitive or in primitive. And as I say, in the case where it's primitive, that's where the work with Bob and Yam comes into play. So that case is also relatively straightforward. And for the direct computations where we have to do some calculations, we tend to use magma to do those calculations. And it is very useful to be able to use computational methods to handle small cases. And just I just wrote down here. And I just wrote down here something that comes out, that sort of came out up in this work, as a technique for trying to compute the base size computationally, which I sort of come to the conclusion is probably the most efficient way to try and do these sort of computations. See, what can be quite difficult if you're trying to work out the exact base size is to determine is it two or is it three? It can be, you get questions like this, which can be quite awkward to answer, especially if the index, if the degree of the group is large, 100 million points, for example, this can be computationally very challenging. Can be computationally very challenging. And it turns out there's machinery to work with double coset representatives, which is actually quite effective and quite efficient. And I've just noted here sort of a trivial observation that the base size is at least three if and only if you run over a set of double coset representatives, you look at the size of the double coset, it's never equal to the size of h squared. Okay, remember this: the size of this double coset here is the order of h squared divided by h intersect. divided by h intersect h to the g. Okay, so if it's never equal to the order of h squared, that intersection is never one, so there's not a base of size two. Okay, so this double coset machinery is quite convenient to work with computationally. Right, okay, so that's sporadic and alternating groups. Let me say something briefly about exceptional groups. We've got a look at that. So we prove a stronger result here. Here the soluble hypothesis is very restrictive. There are not so many soluble maximal subgroups when you're in a Soluble maximal subgroups when you're in an exceptional group. And in fact, we could show the base size is at most three. And in fact, it's two pretty much always, unless you're over a field of very small characteristic, and H is a parabolic subgroup, essentially a Borel subgroup, in fact. Okay, so I'll just make a couple of comments on this. So this goes as follows. If your point stabilizer is non-parabolic and Q is not absolutely tiny, like two or three, then in fact, H has to be the normalizer of some maximal torus. Has to be the normalizer of some maximal torus, and this is where the work which Adam talked about in his talk yesterday on extremely primitive groups we established quite a lot of new base size results in that extremely primitive project, and they apply very nicely here. In particular, we showed that if you have the normalizer of a maximal torus, the base size is always two. Okay, now for when Q is two or three, you get some weird examples which shouldn't really be soluble, but just they are soluble because Su32 is a soluble. Soluble because SU32 is a soluble group. It shouldn't be, but it is. So they also have to be handled in some way. So there's some special cases that crop up for very small values of Q. Okay. And if H is parabolic and Q is at least four, then you're really in one of these very low rank groups. And H has got to be a Borel subgroup. So for example, if you're in G2, you've got to be in characteristic three. There's got to be a graph automorphism present so that the Borel subgroup becomes maximal. And so you have to handle those cases. And so, you have to handle those cases as well. And so, for those ones, we use a probabilistic approach, which has been a very useful tool in many of these results on basis, particularly in the almost simple setting. So, let me just quickly remind you or show you what this probabilistic method is. So, it's very simple. This was introduced by Liebeck and Shalev in the paper of 1999. So, it's based on simple counting, but it's very effective. So, what you do is you look at this number here, QG of C. This number here, qg of c. So c is some positive integer. And you're just basically counting tuples. So you're counting tuples of elements in the set we're acting on, omega, with the property that the point y stabilizer is non-trivial. Okay, so sort of thinking of this with the uniform distribution, this is just the probability that a random C-tuple is not a base. Okay, remember for a base, we want the point Y stabilizer to be trivial. Here we're seeing it's not trivial. Okay, but it turns out to be better to work with this complementary probability. Work with this complementary probability. Okay, so if you're in that situation, then if you have a tuple that's not a base, then it's fixed by some element x. And so what's the probability that a random C tuple is fixed by some given element x? Well, it's just this thing called the fixed point ratio of the element to the power c. Okay, so it's just again, just straightforward counting. What is the fixed point ratio? Well, it's as the name suggests, it's just the ratio of fixed points. So just count the number of points. Fixed points, so just count the number of points in omega fixed by x divided by the size of omega. And you can interpret this in terms of the permutation character, if you like. That can be useful. And I think, as Scott mentioned in his talk just recently, if you're in a situation which we are where the group is acting transitively, then the fixed point ratio is a very easy argument. It's just this given by this ratio here, where you intercept the conjugacy class of x with the point stabilizer divided by the size of the class. Of the class. Okay, so that would be the probability that x fixes a random element of Omega. And so a random C tuple is fixed by X. You just take this thing to the power C. All right, so I guess thinking about this, if you have a tuple, a C tuple that's not fixed, sorry, that doesn't form a base, then it must be fixed by an element of prime order, because this is a subgroup and it's going to be non-trivial, so it'll have a prime order element inside of it. So that very quickly. Of it. So that very quickly leads to this rather crude upper bound on this probability where you just sum over all prime order elements and take this fixed point ratio to the power c. Okay, and then fixed point ratio is a constant on conjugacy classes, so you can express this in this form. And we call that thing q hat. So q hat is an upper bound on q. Q itself is going to be rather difficult to compute, but q hat is something that you might be able to at least estimate because we have a lot of information about Because we have a lot of information about conjugacy classes. Okay, and you've got to study these intersections, but that's a problem that is actually doable in some sense. And the point of all of this is the fact that if you can show that this Q hat is less than one, then that must mean that Q is less than one. So this probability is less than one. So the complementary probability is positive, and you've just proved the existence of a base of size C without actually constructing one. Okay, so that's the. One. Okay, so that's really the crux of the matter. If you can bound this probability sufficiently well, you could force the base size to be at most C. Right, okay, so that's the probabilistic method. Let me just do, let me just show you a quick example. So I'll just show you very quickly the G2 example acting on the cosets of a Borel. Okay, so here's G2, the soccle. Remember, we're in an almost simple group, so there could be fields and graphs and so on floating around. The Borel subgroup in the simple group has this. Subgroup in the simple group has this structure, the unipotent radical and the levy. And the claim is here is that the base size is exactly three. So, how do you do that? Okay, well, in order for H to be maximal, we're going to have to have graph automorphisms present, otherwise it would be contained in one of the maximal parabolic subgroups. So Q is a power of three, G contains graph automorphisms. First, we generate a lower bound very easily, just using that trivial lower bound we saw before. You can look at the degree here, take the logarithm. Look at the degree here, take the logarithm, it's strictly bigger than two. The base size is therefore at least three. So now we need to show the base size is at most three. And we do that using the probabilistic method. The aim is to show that that q hat function we saw when you evaluate at c equals three is strictly less than one. All right, so to do that, you need to estimate fixed point ratios. And in this setting, there's various ways in which you can proceed. A nice way here is actually to use character theory. So H0 is a Borel subgroup. So you can look at the potential. Subgroup. So you can look at the corresponding permutation character, remembering that the fixed point ratio is just the number of fixed points divided by the degree. And so there's a very sophisticated theory around these permutation characters in groups of Lie type where you're inducing from a Borel subgroup or a parabolic subgroup. You can use the Deli-Mielustic theory. There's a formula for working out the character values of this permutation character, which you can work with. And this allows you to compute the exact fixed point ratios for all elements in T. For all elements in T of prime order. Okay, that comes out pretty easily. And then, of course, you've got to worry about the elements in G that are not in T. For example, this does contain a graph automorphism, so you've got to worry about that. But they can be handled in a more direct fashion, just thinking about the intersection of the class with the subgroup. I won't go into the details here, but this is what you would get, for example, if you take X to be an involutory graph automorphism. Okay, the centralizer in T is going to be the twisted G2. The twisted G2, and then here you've got the Borel subgroup of G2, and this is just the Borel subgroup of twisted G2. That's what comes out. So you can compute Q hat exactly, and then you get some sort of big polynomial in Q. You've got to check that this is less than 1. Okay, that's what you do to get the conclusion that the base size is at most 3, therefore equal to 3. Right, okay, so that's exceptional groups. Classical groups, I won't say much about it. It's a similar sort of approach. Of approach, probabilistics, using maybe some character theory when we're in a situation like PSL3 with a graph automorphism where the Borel subgroup is going to be soluble. You have to sort of do something similar like we did with G2. Computational methods come into play. Again, there's some special cases that have to be looked at. You know, this is like a, this is a geometric maximal subgroup, but it's soluble because this group is soluble, O4 plus of three elements. So there's some special cases that cop up which require some attention. Require some attention. And the groups with the two-dimensional linear groups require special attention. So, this is where the probabilistic method is less effective, in particular, when you take H to be the normalizer of a maximal torus in that situation. So, there's either the split torus or the non-split torus. You take the normalizer, so you get these dihedral subgroups. And here, you actually find if you want to pin down the exact base size, the probabilistic method isn't good enough. You need to do a direct construction to actually build small bases to establish the result. To establish the result. Okay, so for example, here, you know, if you take the split torus, then it's what I would describe as a subgroup of type GL1Q REF S2. And here you can identify the set you're acting on with a in a geometric way. So it's just a set of PERS of one spaces. And so you can try and build a basis by fixing a basis and selecting these PERS of one spaces in an appropriate way to find a small basis. And it's quite subtle. The base size, if you want to pin it down precisely, it's Size, if you want to pin it down precisely, it's always in this case either two or three. But if you want to determine when is it two, when is it three? Well, this is the condition in that particular case. So you have it's a little bit delicate. At some point, as you move into the automorphism group, the base size will jump from two to three. So you have to sort of try and detect that. So there's a bit of work involved for those linear groups. Right, okay. So that's for the classical groups. All right, so we've done the affine groups. I've now sort of explained almost. I've now sort of explained all my simple groups, so that just leaves the product type. So, I'm going to say something briefly about the product type groups. Okay, so there's the setup again. This is going to be a blow-up of a primitive group L. Okay, now what's the notation here? So, this is our group G, we've got L and P. So K is at least 2. What is L? L is just an almost simple primitive group acting on a set gamma. The set that G is acting on is just the Cartesian product of gamma with itself K times. The action is the product. With itself, k times. The action is the product action. And what is S? S is just the soccle of L, and we'll say that J is the point stabilizer of L acting on gamma. That's going to be a soluble group. Okay, and what is P? Well, P is the group that G induces by conjugation on the K factors of its soccer. Okay, it's a minimal normal subgroup, so G is going to act transitively on those K factors. That induces this group P. Okay, so that's what we've got. So that's what we've got. That's the setup. And then one thing to note here, which is important, is that G is the product of the soccer with H. Okay, H is a maximal subgroup. So you get this decomposition. And so if G induces P, then actually H induces P as well. And H is soluble. That's our assumption. So that means that what you might call this top group, this permutation group P, is also a soluble group. All right. And then we can let DP be the distinguishing number of P, as in Scherez's argument. As in Scherez's argument of affine groups. Okay, remember, this is the minimal number of parts in a partition of the numbers 1 to k, so that the stabilizer of that partition is trivial in P. Okay, then there's a lemma that is not too difficult to prove. I won't go into the details of this. It's not too difficult to show that you can bound the base size of this product type group here in terms of the base size of L acting on gamma, which we know, right? Which we know, right? Remember, L is an almost simple group with a soluble point stabilizer, so we know that this is at most five. And then you've got this ceiling term here, which involves the distinguishing number of p, where you take the logarithm to the size of gamma. Okay, I won't go into how that's proved. It's not too difficult to show that, but it's, you know, it turns out to be a really useful way to get some control on the base size of the product type group. Right, okay. So, how does this come out then? So, how does this come out then? So, by the result for almost simple groups, we know the base size of L is at most 5. We've got Scherez's result on the distinguishing number of P. And we also know that, remember, gamma is the set on which this almost simple group is acting primitively, and that has to have at least five points in it. It's an almost simple group. Okay, so if you assume that the base size of L is at most four, then the bound which we're looking for, remember we're looking for BG at most five, comes out immediately from that lemma, because this is at most, this is going to be. Because this is at most, this is going to be equal to one, and this is receiving the base size of L is at most four. Okay, because gamma is at least five and dp is at most five. Okay, so you get five, which comes out. So the thing you have to do a little bit of work on here is how do you handle the case where the base size of L is five? And there are examples, but there's only really three examples which come out in the classification. And so here there's a nice result of Bailey and Cameron, which we can use, which gives you some control on the base size of this product type group. Product type group in terms of the number of regular orbits of the almost simple group on this Cartesian product. So, this is a bit like Dovin's condition in Dovin's conjecture and his reduction. So, it's sort of a similar thing, really. So, if you can show that the number of regular orbits of L on this Cartesian product is at least the distinguishing number of P, then you get this bound. As I say, because you know that the base size of L is M, this number is at least one, but the distinguishing number of P But the distinguishing number of p could be five, it's at most five, so you need to prove that this number is at least five, and then you're done. Okay, so this was where I guess the analysis, I guess, I was quite lucky in the argument here because it turns out that when BL is equal to five, the degree of L is rather small and actually allows you to attack this problem computationally. If there were examples where the degree of L is large, this would actually could become quite a difficult problem to force the number of regular orbits to be sufficiently large. Orbits to be sufficiently large. But here it's not a problem, and the result comes out quite easily, actually. So it's a computation to check that this number here is at least five. Right, okay, so I think I'm pretty much out of time here, so I think that's a good place to stop. So thanks very much. Thank you, Tim. Thank you. Are there questions? Are there questions? Tim, in that last argument, why can't you so you only get that four plus one if dp is five and gamma is five? And if gamma is five, taking a ceiling, I'm taking a ceiling there, though, aren't I? Oh, a ceiling, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, okay, I give up. I give up. Okay. Other questions, comments? I never know when to, you know, I have to give everyone an opportunity. Okay, let's say no, maybe not, but I guess Tim is still there if there are some more, if someone wants to chime in. Okay, thanks very much, Tim. It was, as usual, a very nice talk. Thanks, Donald.
