From Sapienza, Rome, and she also got critical lane and insistence. Okay, thank you, Robert. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to talk here. It would be great to stay all together, but the situation is still complicated. So I will speak about this problem. This is a system, there is no time. There is no time, this is the stationary system. Minus delta u equals v the power p minus one v plus this perturbation time equal to u to the q minus one u you know with a perturbation time. Okay, let me take the time. Sorry. I have 30 minutes if I remember, no? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry. 35, in fact? 30 minutes. 35. You have 35 minutes? Okay, that's fine. Okay, so here omega is a smooth bounded domain in Rn. Epsilon is a positive small parameter. This alpha, beta 1, beta 2 are real numbers. And here the exponent p and exponent q are. And exponent q are positive numbers which lie on this critical epipola. Okay, the name critical will be clear in a moment. Let me stress two special cases. When p is equal to q, the system is nothing but the single equation. Minus delta u equal u to this critical exponent plus epsilon beta u with the Diracle boundary condition on the ultimate ultimate Boundary condition on omega. And this is the first case, the first limit case. And the second interesting case when q is equal to 1. In this case, p is equal to m plus 4 over n minus 4. And here we require that the dimension of the space is a greater report than five, and the system reduced to the fourth linear perturbation term. Perturbation term. Okay, so having in mind this that when in at least when p is equal to q, the problem reduced to this single equation, which is well known, everybody has seen this equation in this live at least once. So I will focus on the equation in the blue box, which is known as the classical British Negro. It is well known that the existence of solution to this problem strongly depends on the geometry of omega and also on the sine of beta. Remember, I remind you that epsilon is a positive and the sign depends on the this perturbation term depends on the and it is well known that when the domain minister When the domain is shaped and beta is less or equal than zero, there are no solutions. This is due to the classical Poisson identity. And on the other hand, we can find a positive solution as soon as the epsilon beta is positive and less than lambda one of omega, which is the first second value of minor delta with the homogeneous Diracle condition on the context. Okay, this is true at Okay, this is true at least of an NS criteria more than four. Now, having in mind this kind of result, which is very well known, let me come back to the system. And something similar happens. Indeed, if the domain is shaped, then there are no solutions when the matrix here, the matrix which is related to the perturbation term, is negative semi-print. And this is similar. And this is similar to what Gladys Niedenberg proved for the problem. This can be obtained via generalized positive identity. And in particular, if P and Q are greater than one, here P and Q are on this critical polarity problem is critical. So in particular, if P and Q are greater than one, alpha is zero, and the beta one and beta two are negative, there are no solutions. Negative, there are no solutions in shape domains. On the other hand, as in the classical Bertis Dian vertical simulation, when beta one and beta two are positive and this epsilon square beta one beta two is less than capital lambda one square, which is the first eigenvalue of minus delta with the recreate condition, then you can find the solution. Okay, here there are some extra conditions on the dimension which depends on P and Q. The dimension which depends on P and Q, but this is not very important for what I want to tell you. Okay, so let me say something about the existence of this solution. Well, solution to this system, to this red system. Here I have to take alpha equals zero. This is what the method Olshof and Van der Vost assume. Was assumed. Okay. So, solution to the red critical system are critical points of this functional, which is strongly indefinite because of this the presence of this thermal gradient G of gradient V. Well, in the subcritical regime, I mean when P and Q are below the critical hyperbola, one can use some functional theory, indefinite functional theorem due to Ben. Theorem due to Benjelabinovis or some topological models, methods to find solutions to this, to find critical points of this J. Well, this approach requires the compactness of the gradient of the non-quadratic part, this one, which fails in the critical case. So it is not a good idea to use a devariational point of view and And Mitigieri, Ulshoff, and van der Post used this dual formulation due to Clark integral. In the scalar case, this problem does not happen. Okay, another idea to find a solution to this system is due to come back to Kierillon, where in 85 studied this red system. Here you see there is no alpha, no, but our. There is no alpha, no beta one, there is also only one beta two. What indeed was the following? Look at the first equation, okay? From the first equation, formally we can derive v and we write v like delta u Laplace 1 minus p over p times delta u. This is nothing but v. We take v from the first equation, we put in the second equation, and we get a single. A single order single equation. Okay. And so, what can we say is: if I find a solution to this blue equation, then I can get the solution to the red system. Now, the equation, as a variational formulation, been seeing in since the solution to this equation are critical points of this end. Are critical points of this energy functional, which is defined in this space. Well, in the subcritical regime, mean when P and Q are below the critical, this point of view has been used to produce solutions, positive and fan changes solutions by Boner, Moreto, Santos, Seranos, and Ugota Paras. Well, in the critical regime, as usual, since the problem is critical, The problem is critical, it is not clear if there exists a solution or not. Well, but what we can prove, as in the British-Nied case, is that a solution exists when epsilon is small enough. And the solution can be found by minimizing the energy J on the sphere in L on the unit sphere in LQ plus one. Okay? And so we can find a least energy cost. Find a least energy positive solution. And as you can imagine, it is interesting to understand which is the profile of this least energy solution when the parameter epsilon is approaching zero. And this was done by Gnacio Guerra in 2008, and he studied the asymptotic profile of the list energy positive solution. And what he found was the following: both the components. But the components u epsilon and minus the Laplacian of U epsilon to the power one over P, it means the P epsilon, blow up at the same point, X star in America. And the shape of the solution around the blow-up point is nothing but this guy here, this pink function u mu C V mu C, which is the bubble. Is the bubble. I thought this is the bubble, and this is a solution to the system in the wall space Rn. I wrote the system in red in the blue box. Okay, so this system has a unique positive radial solution, which at the point zero takes the value one. There is an invariance by scaling and by translation. I'll show you in a moment. Show you in a moment. And what Kinashogeda proved is that the shape of the least energy solution around the point where it blows up, around the maximum point, let us say in this way, is nothing but the bubble scale it, translated and scaled. Okay, here you see that this profile is going to zero. Is going to zero everywhere except at the point xc where it blows up at the plus infinity. The concentration parameter mu is going to zero and the concentration point is going to the blow-up point x is done. Okay, now having in mind this fact which is very important and also comparing this fact with what happens in the Berdisni-ReML problem, we can do something. Let me tell you. Do something about it. Let me tell you. Okay, now let's come back to the precise problem. Anne Ray, many years ago, studied the profile of the least energy solution found by British and Niremberg for this equation. Okay, and what they discovered was the following. This is well known. The solution rose up at the point X star, which lies in Omega. Star, which lies in omega, and the shape around the whole point is nothing but the bubble, where the bubble now solves the equation, the limit equation in Rn minus delta W is equal to the physical exponent. And the profile around the blow point is the same. I mean, you take the bubble, you do it the bubble at the point where it achieves the maximum, and then you scale and you get. And then you scale, and you get. Now, this profile is extremely important. Understanding the profile of the solution around the broad point is important because one can say, can I build the solution to the z-I-M-E-p problem to find the solution with the prescribed probability? Let me tell you another fact. Sorry, the point X star where the blows up occurs is nothing but the critical point of the Robin function. To be more precise, this. Robin function to be more precise. This is the maximum point of the Robin function. Okay, now, having in mind this, now a lot of work has been done in order to use the BOWA profile to build the solution to the resisting problem. For example, you take this problem here, and if you want to build the positive and so change the solution. You can use the classical Lyapunov procedure and you can build as many solutions as you want. This has been done in this paper with Monica. We have the first result and then there are something which can be extended to a more general situation. Okay, what is important in this paper, many of you know this very well, is that what we do is we What we do is we prescribe the profile of the solution we want to build in this way. We use the bubble, the bubble, the solution to the limit problem. This is S i is equal plus one if the solution is positive around the blow-up point XI and it goes to plus infinity, blow-up positivity, or i is minus one and it means that. Minus one, and it means that the solution around the blow-up point XCI is going to minus minus infinity. So, in this way, we can produce same-changing solution or positive. So, the idea is to look for positive or negative solution to this problem, which blows up at the k different points in omega. And as many of you know very well, You know very well what the main point in order to perform this reduction is to find the concentration parameters mu i, which are going, which depends on epsilon and which goes to zero as epsilon goes to zero, and the concentration point Ci, which depends on epsilon, in which converges to some point XCI star and the And these concentration parameters, mu i star and concentration point c i star has to be critical point of the well the so-called reduced energy. I wrote the reduced energy here. This is very well known. Let me stress the fact that if k is equal to one, it means that I am looking for solution which blows up at only one point. At only one point, then I can find the solution if I can find the critical point of this function here: mu to the power n minus 2 r of c minus epsilon mu squared. Now, this r of c is the robbing function. This is very well known. The robin function is defined as follows. You take the green function. take the green function, you decompose the green function of minor delta with the reclaimed boundary condition into its singular part 1 over x minus y to the power n minus 2 minus a regular part. And if you evaluate the regular part after the diagonal, what you get is the robin function. In any domain, the robin function has always the maximum point. Always the maximum point. If you take domains which are geometrically or topologically more complicated, you get many critical points and you get many solutions. This is very well known. Now, having in mind this kind of results, we ask if it is possible to find positive and sign-changing solutions to this system. Okay, the initial system. The initial system when P and Q below to the critical hyperbola. The idea is to find the solution which blows up at the different points in omega where the shape around each blow-up point is nothing but plus or minus the bubble, this capital U, capital G, which is the solution to the limit system. I will be back to this in. I will be back to this in one. Here, the concentration parameter mu i star and the concentration point x i star should be a stable critical point of a suitable reduced energy. Okay, stable critical point in my is uh, for example, a strict minimum point, a strict maximum point, or more in general, a non-degenerate medium critical point, okay. The critical point, okay. This is not important. So, the idea is if I can do something similar for this system. Well, the answer is positive and we gave a positive answer with Shen Shu Kim from Nankai University in South Korea. And let me tell you the result. This is a technical area. This is a technical, I don't know if it can be, it could be clear. Okay, so this is the system. What we proved is the following. So, this is the general system with alpha, beta one, beta two. Okay, well, if epsilon is small enough, this system has a solution which goes up at one point in omega, provided one of the following conditions is satisfied. Well, better one. Well, beta one is positive, or beta one is zero and alpha is positive, or beta one and alpha are zero and beta two is positive. Okay, this is the result. Moreover, what is important is the shape of the solution we built around the block point is x star is nothing but this bubble. Is nothing but this bubble, U mu C V mu C and mu is like mu star, c is like c star, and mu star, c star is a stable critical point of this green reduced energy. Okay, this is the generalization of what I showed you before for the single equation. Okay, look, here, there are two terms. There are two terms. There are terms with epsilon, which depends on the perturbation here. Okay, so this is easy. This is really easy, nothing to say. But what is important is the first part. The first part. Remember that RC is the robin function related to the minus Laplacian with the recreate boundary condition. Okay, now look, when p is Look, when p is, I would say, close to the critical exponent, but not very close. I mean, it is between n over n minus 2 and n plus 2 over n minus 2. Then the critical energy looks like the energy for the single equation. Here you see the Raving function. And indeed, it is that the critical, there are the critical points of the Raving function which gives you the concept. Function, which gives you the concentration points of the solution I want to okay. When P, on the other hand, when P is close to one, close in this sense, then the main term here is not the Robbing function anymore, but it is a different function, R tilde. And I'll tell you the definition of R tilde in a moment because this is quite important. Tilde in a moment because this is quite important. Oh, now you see that there is a gap when p is between n minus one over n minus two and n over n minus two. And this gap is related to the regularity of our genes. So we cannot say which is the right the right reduced energy when p is a bit. Energy when P is between these two numbers. Okay, so the theory tells you the following: take a stable critical point of the reduced energy, then you can build the solution. This is the idea. And let me tell you that in any domain, this function has always a minimum point. That's important. Okay. Another comment I want to tell you is the following: the choice. Following the choice of P of N, I mean the choice of N depends on P and Q. This is not true for any N. Okay, for example, when P is very close to one, this is true when N is greater equal than something. Okay, but this is not important at this stage. Okay, let me tell you a few words about the proof. The proof, okay, no, okay, maybe we stay in. Okay, no, okay, maybe we're saying, um, okay, this is a comment that we the theorem I tell you, I give you only deals with the positive solution, which goes up at one point. And because we can write the reduced energy, okay? We can do, we can give a reduced energy for a more general set in this solution which blows up positively or negatively. Positively or negatively at different points, and when the we are, we don't know how to find critical points of the reduced energy. It is extremely difficult, even if I only take one blow-up point, positive or negative. Okay, I mean, it is difficult even if I consider only one positive blow-up point and one negative blow-up. Okay, that's okay. Let me tell you something about the proof. Okay, let me tell you something about the proof. The proof because I want to tell you some comments about this article. Okay, the proof relies on the fine-dimensional Diaponosh introduction. And as everybody here more or less knows, there are three steps. So the Daponos introduction relies on three different steps. First of all, we have to find the good answers of the solution. The second step is to prove, since the profile of the solution are this. File of the solution are these bubbles. We need the non-degeneracy of these bubbles, and finally, okay, in this case, we have to choose the right functional space to carry out the Lyapunov method. Okay, predictive. Okay, let me tell you something about the non-degeneracy, which is not a trivial at all. And okay, this is the system, this in pink, this pink here. Yes. This thing here is the system. This is oh, sorry. This system has only one positive. Okay, let me tell you, Per Pebbulon found a ground state solution, I mean the infinite which can be found using this approach that I told you before. I told you before. So, from the first equation, you derive V, you put V into the second equation, and you have to work with a single equation. So you reduce the system to a single equation. Now, to find the solution to the single equation, you find the solution by minimizing. You find the ground state. Well, this ground state is This ground state is positive, radially symmetric, and unique up to dilations and translations. Okay, so these are the solutions to our system. The invariance under dilations and translations gives you a natural solution to the linear system, okay? Because this is well known. I mean, you derive. No, I mean, you derive by the concentration parameter μ and you get zeta zero. You derive with respect to the parameter C, which is the point in Rn, and you get n plus one derivatives. And all these functions solve this linear system. Okay, now they are linearly independent. Linearly independent, what we say that the solution is non-degenerate if any of the solution is a linear combination of these zetais. Okay, the question is, is our bubble non degenerate? And the answer is yes. In this case, the only solution to this linear system is a linear combination of the Z i's. The Z i's. This is the result to be obtained in collaboration with Rupert Frankish. Okay, the proof relies on the Liquid OD technique. So we perform an angular momentum decomposition of psi and phi, and then we... This is technical, nothing to say. I don't have time to discuss about this. It is difficult, but the strategy is more or less clear. Okay, let me tell you now the strategy. Okay, let me tell you now the second step of the Lyapunov introduction, which consists in finding a good answer. This is the point. Well, let me tell you, in the case of the single equation, the case of the single equation, remember that the profile of the solution is nothing but the bubble, the solution to this problem in the world space. Now, this is not a very good answer. Is not a very good answer because of the zero boundary condition. The solution I'm looking for is zero on the boundary. So in order to get a good answer, so what I have to do is to project the bubble in this way, in this blue way. This is very well known, okay? And this P of W is a good answer because it has the same Laplacian of W, but it is zero on the boundary. But it is zero on the boundary of X. Remember that we have to find the solution which is zero on the boundary. Okay, now look, when I take a P of W instead of W, I get an error which can be estimated in this way. This is very easy to understand because if I decompose a G like what I told you before. Like what I told you before, like the singular part minus the regular part, the regular part is harmonic. Well, you see that the Laplacian of Pw minus W is zero, so this is harmonic. And on the boundary, as mu is going to zero, it looks like mu to the power n minus two over two divided by x minus c to the power n minus two. I mean, To the power n minus two. I mean, this is nothing but the singular part of the refitting function. So at the limit, p w minus w looks like h. Okay, now in order to get this green estimate, what we use is the profile, is the asymptotic behavior of the bubble as x goes to plus infinity. It is well known that the bubble. I mean, it is well known that the bubble has this decay at plus infinity. Okay. Now, what happens for the system? For the system, the situation is not so easy. It's not so clear. I mean, because look, take the system. This is the system on the worst phase. Okay? Now, this is not a very good answer because UV does not satisfy the V does not satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition. So, what I have to do, I have to project in some sense. But when I project this bubble, I cannot use a linear projection because here the operator is non-linear. Look, from the first equation, I take V, I plug V in the second equation. This is the idea by Gabriel Jans, and what I get is And you want to get this non-linear problem. Okay, now, in order to get a good approximation, what I have to do is to take the solution to this problem. And here you see that this problem is not linear in that in P of U. Okay. And now when we have each distinguished case. We have each distinguished two cases when P is above n of n minus two. Since the solution to the system u and v, both the components have the same decay at the infinity, like in the case of the single equation, the good answer for the solution is just the linear projection. Okay, so nothing to say more. But if p is below this number, n over n minus 2, the profile of the The profile of the two components U and D are different. And in order to be good linear projection, okay, yeah, you see, V has the same rate of the bubble of the fragilization. And if I go back to V, what I get, the error is like H. H is the regular part of the green function. The regular part of the green function. But if I project U here, U, what I get is that the error is the red error, and the red error comes from the solution of this red g tilde is the solution to minus delta g tilde is equal to g to the p, and g tilde can be decomposite into the singular part. Be the composite into the singular part and the regular part, and the regular part is nothing but the function which appears in the reduction. Okay, I am to stop here because this is really technical and I think this is this more or less the idea. Just a final comment, you see that when p is less than this number, this are tilde, which is the regular part. Which is the regular part at the diagonal, this is a smooth function, this is C1. But when P is above this number, this is only the continuous and we don't know how to proceed. Okay, and that's all. So thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Thank you for the Verneso. Are there any questions? Any questions? Did you show us R tilde when P is greater than N over N minus 2? When P is greater than N over N minus 2, did you show us? Yeah, I show you just one. When P here? Yeah, uh, you showed Artilla when P is you had these two cases. Yes, larger than okay, there it is. Okay, in this, in this case, show you the resistive energy. Okay, this so the gap is when P is between these two numbers. I can define L tilde, I can do, but I don't know. I can do, but I don't know how much regular is altitude. And that's a problem because we cannot make our computation. Maybe it is a technical problem, I don't know. Okay. Did you say something in the chat? Yeah, please feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question if you have one. If you uh have one monica, we cannot hear you catch the problem. Sorry, Monica. Can you hear me? Yes, now yes. Okay. In fact, I was talking, but nobody was listening to me. Yeah. Thank you very much for your talk. Very nice result. Do you know about the Morse index? The Morse index of the bubble, you proved the solution we found. Yes, I mean, no, no, of the bubble. You proved the non-degeneracy. I was wondering whether you have information on more syntax of those objects if there are negative eigenvalues. Values like in the case in the of the bubble, you have maybe we can say something similar to the case of the question happens, but I don't know. I would say something similar, at least for some P and Q. Because you see, when P and Q are sorry, when P and Q sorry when p and q sorry sorry i will be back when p and q are close to the critical when p is close to the critical exponent the u and v have the same decay and i suppose that what is true for the single equation can be repeat for the for this system something different happens when we are in this situation because the two components have different Components have different behavior. And indeed, the study of the linear theory is different. This is more difficult. This is really more difficult. Okay, Monica, thank you. I will think about it. No, no, thank you. Okay, questions? Any more questions?
