Okay, so are you ready to go, Sophia? Yes. Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce the final speaker for this conference, Sophia Turvasi from Stockholm University. She's going to tell us about the Brouwer group of biolliptic surfaces, and we're very happy to have gotten you because we know. You because we know scheduling is not easy virtually from Europe and with everything else going on. So, thank you. Thank you. And so, first, I would like to thank the organizer to organize this nice workshop and to commute it from old-fashioned pre-COVID workshop in an online event. And I think it has been really enormous effort on your side. Your side, so I think we should give the organizer a round of applause. I don't know how this is done, but probably we should clark. Okay, and then thank you for having me and thank you for everyone to having decided to sit and hear my talk instead of having other interesting activity, doing other activities. Activities. Okay, first, a little bit of advertising. I'm hiring a postdoc starting July 1st, 2021 for two years. The job posting is not out yet. I was hoping to be out before today, but it will be soon and I will put right on eager about it. But so you know that I'm hiring. Okay, so let's start with the fun. So it's this. So, this is the general question we are going to look today. Suppose we have a smooth variety over a field that today would be just the complex number. Then we have the homological Brauer group, and every morphism of projective variety induces a group homomorphism in the other direction between the Brauer groups. And we call this group homomorphisms the Brauer map associated to The Brouwer map associated to F. And then one might wonder what can one say about F, this Brouwer map. And so to give an idea, so Beauville studied this problem in the case of the universal cover of an Erica surface. So there is an Erica surface, there is a 2 to 1 cover, this is a K3 cover. And then Boville completely gives Bovil completely gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the Brouwer map to be trivial. And since the Brouwer group of an Erika surface is Z mod 2Z, then this completely describes the behavior of the Brouwer map. And it was able to see that the locus where this map is trivial is a countable union of devices. And so it's And so it's a contemporary unit of divaso. So today we are going to study the same problem but for a balitic surface. And we are going to take, there are two kinds of maps from a like natural map from a ballitic surface. So every ballitic surface admits a cyclic cover, pi, where the Where the upstairs is an ambelian variety, and this is a canonical cover, and then some biolytic surface admits another secret cover where the upstairs is another biolytic surface. And we are going to say like completely characterize the behavior of this of the brower map associated to this morphism. And here we also And here we I'm sorry, can I ask? Is this still the just intermediate between S and S hat? Yes, so it's when the so it's I will so this is just the introduction. I will be I will be saying more on biletic surface afterward, but so when the so biletic surface are quotient of product of biletic curves by some sort of group action and Action and the abil variety is not necessarily this product of the elliptic curve. When the group in which you make the quotient is not cyclic, then instead of going to like you have intermediate quotient on one side, let's use so if here yeah, no, not the No, not here. Yes. Okay, so it's so you have this A times B and you quotient by a group G and you get S. But there are two intermediate quotients. And one is exactly this S hat. If G is not cyclic, that is an abelian variety. But if we quotient in. But if we portion in another way, we will have a tilde, and this is a bilitic surface. I will give more examples in what follow, but yeah, so this is the situation. And we, I don't know if you see, but okay, so. Okay, so the we in question, oh yes, that is why you don't see. The we in question is me, Eugenia Ferrari, Magnus Godrup, and there is an appendix with myself and Jonas Bergson. So and one of the things it's so I like biolitic surface a lot because most of the time like they are like the pure relative of Enrique surface like what someone proves something Like what someone proves something for Erica surface, and it's just kind of assumed that it's going to work also for bilictisurface. And most of the time, it is true. But with one of my co-authors, sometimes we were joking that bilicti surface are always the bridesmaid and never the bride, because they are usually a paragraph in a Rico surface paper. Okay, so why this talking? Why write this talk in a conference on the right categories? So Adventon, Nick, and Ray used Boviv paper in order to show that Enrique surface do not have any non-trivial Fourier Mukai partner. And Bodrup, like my PhD student, is doing the same for biliftisurface. And thanks to this paper, now And thanks to this paper, now like we can say that there are no twisted, untwisted, non-trivial for your Mukai partner, and we are making progress on the twisted, twister. We were hoping to like speak, like when I got the invitation, just like two days after I give birth to this workshop, and we were thinking, oh, maybe I can speak about that, but then Corona. Corona happened and things got a little bit delayed. Okay, so this is a plan of today. So we have ballitis, I will speak about balitic surface. I will tell what our results are. And like spoiler alert, they are not neat. So there are like some of them are really neatly stated. Neatly stated, the other are a bit involved, and I will make a lot of examples. And then, in the last part, I will try to bore you with the proof or part, like at least a strategy. Okay, so let's start with bilicky surface. So, if we follow Enrique Scotara classification of surface, Rick's Codara classification of surface, a biolitic surface is a surface with Codara dimension zero and irregularity equal one. The canonical bundle is always trivial, it's always torsion, but not trivial, and it's in pic knot, different from what happened with the Rickey surface. And they are always constructed, as I said before, as a quotient of two elliptic curves. So let's see. curve. So let's see the matter of every example. We take two random elliptic curves, you choose your two favorite elliptic curves, and then you choose a point of order two in the first one. And you consider this involution of the product in which basically you translate the first component and you invert the second component. Then the surface that you obtain, if you quotient by this involution, If you quotient by this involution, it's a smooth surface. And we can see there are two bilateral vibration. The first one is to the curve, the first curve quotient by the translation points, and this is going to be another elliptic curve. And this is the Albanese variety of the biolytic surface. So this irregularity is one. Irregularity is one. The other surface, and this, the Albanese map is a trivial. The other surface is, the other vibration is on P1, as in this case, four double fiber. And one can use the canonical bundle formula in order to compute the canonical bundle. And one sees that the canonical bundle is of order 2. That the canonical bundle is of order 2. So, in particular, the Codaria dimension of S is 0, and so we know that this is a bilateral surface. And this is more or less what happens all the time. We have a group, and there are like not any group can work, and it acts by translation on the first factor of the product, and it acts in another way on the second factor. On the second factor on the product, and one makes the quotient, and one has the bilittic surface. And thanks to Enrique's classification, like there are seven type of them. And so, and you see some of them the group is cyclic, other than the group is not cyclic. And for some fun fact about ballet surface, so the Valetty surface. So the Brouwer group is non-canonically isomorphic to the torsion of the 2a of the second homology group with integral coefficient. So type 4, 6, and 7 are not useful for the purpose of the talk, and so we're going to eliminate them. And in order to construct 3 and 5, type 3 and type 5, well, it's the Well, there is needed that the curve, the second elliptic curve, has a non-trivial automorphism. And so there are just so in you cannot choose a curve randomly anymore. So the J invariant, in the first case, the J invariant of B is 1728, and in the other is zero. These are the two numbers that are hated, but everyone, the studies, elliptic curve. Elliptic curve. Okay, so let's speak about covers of elliptic curve. I'm going too fast, so please stop me if you want to ask questions. So as I said before, we have this biolytic surface and we have the canonical distortion. We can take the tile cover induced by. Take the tile cover induced by the canonical bundle, and we get an abelian variety. And this is a canonical cover of the bilitic surface. And we know also this abelian variety is constructed as an intermediate quotient, as I was saying before, of the product of the product of the initial product of elliptic curves. And this is, as I said, is going to be an abelian variety because it's basically you're just quotienting the product of a elliptic curve by translation. So, what happened, for example, in case, let's go why is no okay. So, let's for the type 2 case for the type 2 case, what's happened? For the type two case, what's happened is so you have sig yes so you have sigma one that is like in type one so you choose a point of order two and and it's uh translation by this point of order two in the first component i'm sorry yes what is sigma one so What is sigma one? So it's I'm so I'm I'm I'm explaining what happened how you get this when the group is not cyclic because when the group is cyclic then the this is just H is zero and the canonical cover is just A times P. But when the group is not cyclic, it's a quotient of A times P. So what's happened? So, what's happened? So, in the type, so if you remember the type 1, the type 2 cases, we are quotienting by Z mod 2 Z times Z mod 2 Z. So, how we generate this group? How this group is, like, what are the generators of this group? So, we have to give like two information. Two involution of A times B. And the first one is sigma one, is the same as type two. You translate one component and you invert the other component by a point of order. So you translate by a point of order two and you invert the other component. For sigma two, what you do is you translate. So you choose a pony. So you choose a point of order 2 in each of the two components. And the first point has to be different from the one for sigma 1. And so you basically have sigma 2 of AB will be equal to sigma A plus tau 1 B plus tau 2. So it's a translation. So it's a translation. And so if you portion an abelian surface by translation, you get another abelian variety, and this is going to be it. So this is what happened for the type 2 biletic surface. Okay, so there are other covers that are not so widely used of biletic surface that come naturally with that. They come naturally They come naturally. So when we have, when G is not cyclic or it's cyclic of non-prime order, then we have another secret cover, P tilde from S tilde to S, where S tilde, instead of being an abelian surface, is another biolytic surface. So let's see what's happening in the two cases that interest us. So if we have So, if we have a validity surface of type 3, if we go back to the table, type 3, the group is Z4, and the order of the canonical bundle in peak S is 4. Okay, so instead of taking the cover associated to the canonical bundle, we take the cover associated to twice the canonical bundle. And what we do, what we get is a Do what we get is a bilitti surface of type 1. Instead, if we have the type 2 bilitti surface, the one I was speaking before, so the group is isomorphic to Z mod 2Z times Z mod 2Z. And so we start from A times B, and instead of quotienting by all the group, we just take the intermediate quotient. Just to take the intermediate quotient by the one translation and the involution, we get a balliptic surface of type one. And again, we have this, like the original surface is a quotient of this by another Z mod to Z action. And so we have a two to one etal cover here. Okay, so and Okay, so any questions so far? Okay, we can go. We can go. Okay, so now that we know a little bit on bilitting surface, we can start with the result. And there are those that are easy to state. And I have to say, these were surprising. So, especially the first one. So, a little bit of background. bit of background when we if you look at boville paper on um on enrique surface one of the things um that one seems to infer is that the peakard rank matters and it's almost like and and so one and one one of the things one was i was thinking when i was I was thinking when I was reading the paper is that if upstairs and downstairs you have the same Picard rank, then the Brower map should be injective. And also these, when we started to study the problem for the canonical cover, it seemed to be the same situation. Like if you look at the second If you look at the second, like one of the results we have is that if the two elliptic curves do not have isogeny between them, then the Brouwer map is injective. And we got, this was the first result chronologically that we got. And it seems to confirm that the pick I drank was what was the crux of the matter. But so initially, But it so initially I really thought that uh the brower map for the two different balletic covers should behave this in the same way and it should be injected. And this was not the case. In fact, for surface of type two, this is always trivial. And for surface of type three, this is always injective, no matter what. And then, oh, yeah, here I just do do there is a mistake here. So, what the second theorem should be is that if there are no not isogeny between the two, okay, so let's copy and paste failed me. So, let's do this. Do these okay? So, what so here this statement should be that if there is no isogeny between the two elliptic curves, then the Brouwer map map is injective. Okay, so let's go back to the slides. So the brow so and so the brow map is injecting. Okay, those that are not easily stated, and I need, and here I will just speak of type 1 bilictive surface, and I have to introduce a little bit more background on bilictic surface. So now we are supposing we have a type 1 biolytic surface and we have the two curves A and B are isogeneous. And there are two main subcase when you do have complex multiplication in one of them and so both and when they are not of complex multiplication. And the naive story that I was believing after before the ballet the Before the finding the different behavior of the validity surface is that basically, so here, so for type 1 validity surface, if you don't remember, let's go back to the table. The Brouwer group is Z2 mod Z2. So the Brouwer map can be injective, trivial, neither. And what I saw was going to be injective when Going to be injective when the two curves are not isogeneous, trivial when the two curves are isogeneous and they have complex multiplication, neither when the two curves were not, were isogeneous and they didn't have complex multiplication. But it turned out that the story was a bit more complicated. So there are still the two sub cases and I And I need this notation. So remember that you're translating by a point and inverting on the other. And we identify the dual of A with A by using the theta divisor, the symmetric theta divisor. And we will denote by P tau the topological detrival line bundle associated to tau with using this isomorphism. And here is And here, if you have a question, there is a whiteboard. But so the non-CM case, so the two curves are isogeneous and they are not complex multiplication. So the homomorphism, the home of B and A, is a free Z model of rank 1. And so we take a generator of this model and we look Model, and we look at the pullback of the generator of PTAL, this line bundle PTAL, through this generator. If it's trivial, then the Brower map is going not to be, is not injective, so is not injective, and the kernel will be isomorphic to Z mod 2Z. So it's not so this is the case, it's neither trivial and injective. And in the complex multiplication case, then if they and this is the only is the only so if if this is not trivial, then the map is injective. So it is an if and only if. So if this line bundle, if this line bundle here Line bundle here. Why is it not working? If this line bundle here is not trivial, then the map is injective. If it's trivial, then it's not injective. In the other case, so we have, since we have over the complex number, that the homomorphisms, the lattice of The lattice of isogenies between B and A is a Z model of frank 2. And then we take a choice of generator, for any choice of generator, we look at these pullbacks here. If one is trivial, then the map is just one is trivial, then the map is not, so if they are not all, okay, if null is trivial, the map is injective. The map is injective. If one is trivial, then the map is neither injective nor trivial. If two and then all are trivial, then the map is trivial. Okay, so example before, like if you are still with me and not escape it, you can be rewarded with some example. So if A is isomorphic to B, Isomorphic to B, then the homomorphism lattice between B and it's not complex multiplication. Then the homomorphism lattice between A and B is generated by an automorphism. And so we have that this pullback is never trivial. And so the map is injective. So we have a case in which the two curves are isogenous, but the map is injective. On the other side, we take again A isomorphic to B, but now we take A and B to be with complex multiplication. Actually, we take this specific curve A, and B. Now the endomorphism of A is isomorphic to the Gaussian integers. Gaussian integers. And then we have an automorphism of order four given by the complex multiplication. And we can, there is a fixed point, like you can also like write it, this morph is as a fixed point. And then we have that this line bundle is zero. And so the map is not injective. But it's never trivial. But it's never trivial because the other line bundles that one have, if you go back, then we will have omega star p tau is non-trivial and the identity star p tau, of course, is non-trivial. So there are just one of these three-line bundles that. one of these three line bundles that is just one of these three line bundles is trivial and so we have that the map is the the map is injective but it's not trivial. So there is a case of complex multiplication and the map is not trivial. And then we can construct uncountably many type 1 biolitic surface with a non- Surface with a non-injective brower map in a similar way, like I don't want to go too in detail. And then we can also give one in which the map is zero. So if we take A to be this specific elliptic curve and B to be the quotient of A. To be the quotient of a by a point of order, this specific point of order two, then it it can be it can be shown then the isogeny lattice between B and A can be generated by these two isogeny. And then one compute what happened, and all the three line. Happen and all the three-line bundle who are the characters of this story are trivial. And so this map, this ballitic surface will have a trivial Brower map. And then we can have a bit of moduli picture, so it's not, it's underput. Under quotation mark because it's not rigorous. It's in the work in progress, I would really like to describe the loss, the laws are in the moduli space where this map behave differently. Of course, the generic is always injective. But if you think what is happening, so when we construct a bilateral surface of type 2, we choose two random. We choose two random elliptic curves and a torsion point, two torsion points in one of them. So you can think that the moduli space should have like the deformation space has dimension two because you have two deformation, two dimensions for the deformation space and one for the and then just finite choice of the point of order two. So two Of order choose. So choose one dimension for each curves and a finite number of choices for the point. Now, so the generic map, the generic two curves are not going to be injected. But if you impose that the two curves are isogenous, you have a divisor. And so you have, and we showed that there are uncountably many, and I don't think it's going to be a And I don't think it's going to be a divisor because if you have A times B that are not isomorphic, but you deform them to be isomorphic, like in a direction that they end up to be isomorphic and without complex multiplication, then we know that the map is injective. So I don't think it's going to be closed, the locus where the map is neither trivial nor injective. But there are uncountably many. And the locus where it is where it is trivial, it's finitely many because it's it corresponds to the one with complex multiplication. And so you choose one curve with complex multiplication and then you choose no countably many, sorry. You choose a curve with complex multiplication, there are countably many of them. You choose one isogenous to these, there are finitely many of them, and you choose a point in one of the two. A point in one of the two, and so again, finitely many of them. So, so, and these it's another question that is still open: is um this is countably many or it's just finitely many? So, this is a question. And for the other type, we have a similar picture. So, for type two, again, we have a two-dimensional deformation space, but the map can just be injective or non-injective. Can just be injective or non-injective, and because it's the brow group is Z mode choosing. And in this case, we have that again, it's going to be a subspace. It's dimension one, the locus in which they are not injective. And for type three and type five, we know that now the model is space at just dimension one, and there are just finitely many curves. Many curves in which the map is injective. So at least the moduli pictures look like in similar to what happened for Enrique surface. So now how did we do it? So it's a lot of classical geometry. Actually, I really like this result because finally I can see. Result because finally I can say that I am an Italian algebraic geometer because it's really classical in some way. So the core of our strategy is what Boville found in this paper with the Enrique surface. So basically, if you have a finitely locally free morphism of projective variety of degree n. Of degree n. Then there is a norm homomorphism going in the same direction with the in the respective Picard group. And Boville found that there is a canonical isomorphism between the kernel of the Brouwer map and the kernel of the norm of pi over 1 minus sigma peak x, whereas sigma is, so here we are in a italic sigma. So here we are in an ethyl cyclic cover, and sigma is the generator of the group. Like you have an etal cyclic cover, so it means there is a cyclic group acting on a variety by automorphism, and this group is generated by some sigma. So this is the generator, the Galois group of pi. And we have this, we have that the We have these isomorphism between these two objects that are very different in nature. Because if you think about this one is an object that lives downstairs because it is a subspace of is a subspace. of is a subspace of of of this so lives downstairs but these the other one lives upstairs like it's a it's some it's a kernel like the norm up is it's a quotient of something that lives here and so it's uh and and So it's, and these make it in some way easier to study the browser map. So the general strategy that we followed, okay, is to like really, so instead of studying the kernel by itself, we studied the right-hand side. And the outline of our strategy is the first step. Is the first step we give some numerical condition for a line bundle to be in the kernel of the norm map? And this can be done like the norm map follows some computational rules. So it's not always easy to compute, but it's easy to compute the pullback of the norm map. Like if we go back, so we have Have so if we have a morphism in this direction. So the norm, if you have a line bundle here, if you have a line bundle here, then you can take the norm up and you get a line bundle here on Y and what you can do, you can now pull it back. And this is really easy to compute. It's by Grottendig, it's just it's it's what happened, it's L tensor sigma star, L tensor, sigma square star, L blah blah blah, up to when you reach the order. The order by Grottendig. And another nice feature: it's really easy to compute the norm map or the pullback of something is just m to the order of the cyclic cover. And by using these computational rules, let's go back to the By using this computation rule, we are able to find some numerical, it's easier to work numerically, and we are able to find some numerical constraint to force a line bundle to be in the kernel of the norm map. And example of what I'm talking about is if no, I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to do this. Okay, sorry. Okay, so if the upstare and downstairs have the same Picard rank, then the norm up is a line bundle is in the kernel of the norm up if and only if it's numerically trivial. And this seems to work always. Like it's working, we don't have a general argument, but the argument in the two cases. But the argument in the two cases is really similar in both in the canonical cover and the piletic cover, and we really think it should work in any case, but we haven't checked it yet. But the other one is if the group is cyclic and we have the canonical, and so the canonical cover is given by just the product of the two-electric curve, then the Q elliptic curve, then the numerical map is trivial if and only if the numerical class of L is in home AB. So what I mean here is that the neuron severity of the product of two bellitic curve is generated by a class of one curve plus a class. Plus a class of the other curve plus home and either B A or A B. Let's let's home B A. So now you have a line bundle that is in the kernel of the Norm app. What I'm saying is it's What I'm saying, it's its numerical class lives here. So again, if the two, and this, it's if you see it for it's it gives you in some it's like a special case of above in the case if the two curves are not isogenous because this is zero and what it says is the two curves are not isogenous so upstairs and downstairs have the same picard rank then Drunk then the line bundle is numerically trivial. Okay, so once we have, so this is an example of like we get some numerical constraint and then we study this quotient that is not really the quotient we are looking for, it's bigger, and but with that we get some numerical calculations. But with that, we get some numerical candidate. And I have to say that here is the point in which we have to use the appendix. Because, in order to study how sigma star acts on this, so if you think we have, we have for the valitive case, for the canonical cover case, like in the cyclic case, we have so we know that the line bundle The line bundle, a potential element of the kernel of the norm map, lives in OMBA. And then from what we have to see how sigma star act on HOMBA. And in order to do that, we need to find some clever generator that in some way commute with sigma and allows us to Allows us to explicitly write this action of sigma star. And in order to do that, we had to find some, to prove some result about the structure of home BA for elliptic curve using like field theory and elliptic curve stuff. And okay, so once we have the numerical candidates, then the numerical candidates then we go into the numerical class and see if really these are really candidates or do not get elected and they are not in the kernel of the norm app and i will make it more clear with uh oh before like one of the way to construct element of the kernel of the norm map Of the kernel of the norm up is to use the picknuff trick. And this we use over and over for the old paper. It's basically we show that, and this is general, like if something is in the kernel of the norm up, if something is like if a line bundle, the norm up of a line bundle, the norm of a line bundle is in pick naught, then it might not be zero, but you can tweak it in order to be. In order to make it trivial. And this is how the proof goes. So you can see a little bit of norm calculus that we use. So by norm calculus, you have the pullback. The norm of the pullback is just the power of the original line bundle. And picknot is an abelian variety, so it's a divisible group, and so you can find. Divisible group, and so you can find a beta in pick note of y such that beta to the n is the inverse of the norm map that you were, the norm of the original line bundle. And then you have the norm of L times, the norm is a group homomorphism, and so the norm of L times the pullback of beta. The pullback of beta is trivial. And the other things that we notice, there are two things: like the pick naught is so if the norm is not in pick naught, there is no tweaking possible. Like the norm of something that is in peak naught stays in peak naught in all our cases. And I don't know if this is really general, but in all our cases, the norm of something in the peak naught is in peak naught. In the peak naught is in peak naught. And so if you have something and the norm is not in peak naught, you cannot use the peak naught in order to make it zero. So it's in some cases an if and only if. If it's in the peak naught, then you can move it around. If it's not, you cannot use the peak knot to move it around. And the philosophy that we have in all the results is that the peak knot then Result is that the pick not, then after that, it doesn't really matter, it doesn't change the class in the kernel of the norm quotient by one minus sigma. So this is like whenever something, so when you when you something that's happen, when you modify something by tensoring by something in the picnot, it doesn't really affect. The computation you are having. So, what's happened is, okay, so for balletic, so if we have a surface, it is a ballitic cover of type 2 or as is type 2 or 3, and so we have a type 1 that covers it, and that is some signal. That is some sigma tilde over sigma, S tilde over sigma tilde, where sigma tilde is an involution. So we had the, if you remember, we have a ballitic surface of pipe one and two eballitic vibration. And I told you that the one on P1 have four multiple fibers of multiplicity two that we call D1, D4, and we have we And we call tau ij the line bundle OS di minus dj. So one of the results we have is that the torsion of the two H2S tilde Z is generated by these classes. And these actually we in the paper we describe all like we find generator of the torsion. We find generators of the torsion of the integral cohomology of all types of biolitic surface we look into. And it's funny because the result we find are really similar to like same statement as other result on bilithic vibration by Serrano, really old result. But Serrano hypotheses do not work in our case. So we had to find we had to find a way around it and we have this another piece of classical geometry in in the paper like this is a more classical piece of the paper like we described the old torsion and what happened is it's really easy to show that the norm of tau one three is in pick naught but it's never in this image. Never in this image. And so we have an element that is like an element that is a non-trivial element in the right, in the quotient we had in the right-hand side. And since the valetic cover of type 2, valetic surface, the Bravo group is Z mod 2, then we have that the map is always trivial because the kernel is not trivial. So what's happened? Why? Why they are different. And the main reason is the different behavior of the involution sigma on the multiple fiber of the vibration to P1. So what's happened in the type 1 case is the involution Exchange the divisor two by two. So, for example, it is exchanged one and two and three and four. But in the type three cases, it's exchanged two divisor and leave fixed other two. And these affect the computation of the norm map. In fact, we have this. In fact, we have this lemma and then a proposition that the lemma tells you that the norm of this line bundle is of time 1, 3 cross time 1, 4 to the n and to the m is zero if and only if they have the same n and m have the same parity, otherwise it's not in peak naught. In pick naught. And then we know that if L is in the kernel of the norm up, then it's a torsion line bundle. So what we did is, okay, so L is in the kernel of the norm up, is torsion. So it's a product of this time. It's so let's see. No, let's see. Yes, so I have this. This space here. So we have that the so we have so L in the kernel of the norm up is we know the distortion so L we know it's going to be some to the n times To the n times T one four to the n times alpha with alpha in peak naught of S tilde. But now if the lemma tells you that if these two have different parity, then this object is never in peak node. So if n not so if if n and n have the same parity then this object is not in peak naught so in particular can the norm of this object is not in pick naught and so it cannot be zero so if we cannot be in this uh in In this case. So we have that N and M have the same parity. And when they have the same parity, we show that actually if N and M have the like congruent to mod two, let's change pen, then we show that the L is in is in image of one minus sigma star. And so it doesn't give a trivial object, a trivial element in the, it doesn't give a non-trivial element in the quotient, in the Bouville quotient. And this is and so and so this is so this is why they are different and this is how we proved this thing. And okay there are five minutes to go so I Okay, there are five minutes to go, so I will just stop here and don't write things about the canonical cover. Okay, let's thank Sophia. We can also thank her in the chat. Um are there any questions? So, Sophia, can you tell me a little bit what the strategy would be to classify Fourier Mukai partners of twisted Fourier Mukai partners using these maps? So it's at the So it's Antoni, this is used, for example, in the so for exam, one of the things that is useful is so we know that the map, for example, from type now I let's see, for from type two to type, no type two, from type three to type one, the canonical, the bilitic cover. The biletic cover is always trivial. And this cover is given by a power of the canonical bundle. So, what happened is that, so now for this, for twisted, so okay, so one of the things is the first thing that, so for the twisted untwisted case, Untwisted case. The first result that we got is that, so for in the Addington gray paper, it's like a one-liner to show that an Erika surface cannot have untwisted Fourier Mukai partner, like untwisted twisted, because basically they have a different torsion of the Grotendi group, if I remember correctly. If I remember correctly. But in our case, this was not the case because, like, you could, since you have more variety in biolytic surface, it was not a one-liner. So the first thing is if you have a twisted partner of an untwisted Fourier muca of an untwisted biletic surface, then they have to be of different type. Okay, then I'm sorry, is it automatic? They both have to be by elliptics or something? Yes, this is a one. It's the standard because the order of the canonical bundle is preserved. So there are two surfaces, they are both minimal, they have the same code already mentioned, and plus, you have And plus, you have the same Betty numbers because they are surface. And so with the mix and match of the Fourier, there is not much odd and even. So you know exactly what the irregularity is. And so you biliting surface pop. And then, okay, so the easy thing is in that case, so they can be of different type, but then. But then it's we like we use this by pulling up to the to the canonical cover and see what's up what's happened like trying to deform. And then for the twisted twisted, then this paper gives automatically the case of type, what I say, three. Because as I was saying, if As I was saying, now if for the twisted twisted, they have to be ballictic surface and they have to be of the same type. Then you have a Fourier-Mukai transform of two twisted, twisted, ballitic surface of type three. But this lift upstairs, because it's the cover, is given by the canonical bundle, not the canonical, but a power of the canonical bundle. So Lombardian Popa. Lombardian Popa tells you that you have a Fourier-Mukai transform upsir, but the map is trivial. So it's a real Fourier-Mukai transform. And so what Bridgeland and Machocha says is that you have an equivariant, like you basically they are isomorphic, and then you have an equivariant isomorphism, and then you go downstairs, it passes downstairs, and you get the isomorphism. You get the isomorphisms of the two by Likesoface. And in the other case, it's really in some way the problem. And now we are trying to get the complete twisted twisted by deforming, like by studying how these laws, like if the Addington gray paper really use. Gray paper really use Boville divisor and how is this like Boville union of countable union of divisor and it's it's really one one way to get the result is that you put you put yourself in a in a position in which you know that the map is trivial and you try to so there are no non-trivial for your Mukai partner for what I said before and you try to deform and see Try to deform and see what happens. But for that, you have to describe a little better the locus and see how the map deform. Okay, thank you. So, so if I understood correctly, just to make sure, you're saying in, I think it was the type 3. Saying in, I think it was the type 3 case when the map was trivial or something like that. Then you know the Brouwer class pulls back to the trivial class. You have an honest on S tilde, which is billiptic. So you have an honest equivalence of billiptic surfaces, which is an isomorphism. Yeah. Okay. Okay, great. And then when that map is non-trivial, you have to do something else. Yeah. Yes. Okay, great. Are there any other questions? Okay, let us thank Sophia again. And I suppose that concludes our conference. So I think. So thank you to Sophia and everyone else for all your participation, all the great talks that were given. And hopefully next year we'll be able to see and enjoy animals and not just listen to talks in our basement. So also enjoying Canadian temperatures at the Canadian temperature that yeah, yeah, actually, the so actually it was really nice. Like, I think Burr's was something like 17 degrees Celsius or something on Monday. This week was really warm. So it would have been, it would have been perfect. Yeah. And I would have got plenty of daylight because here it's already it's four seven seven thirty to like Seven seven thirty to like eight, seven thirty to four the daylight is that I mean there's not much here. There's not much here either. Yeah, but the six hour in December are the worst. Okay, agree. All right. Thanks to you again, and that's it, I guess. Okay, see you. Have a nice continuance of the day. Okay, bye. Bye.
