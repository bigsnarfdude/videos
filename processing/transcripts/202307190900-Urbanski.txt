Thank you very much, Devin, for this meeting. And I would like to thank very much all the organizers for inviting me here and giving the opportunity to speak today. So I'm speaking about open dynamical systems. Okay, part of this big topic and part of it. Essentially, it divides into two parts, open dynamical systems, just and thermodynamic. Just and thermodynamic formalities of them, just doing directly or by perturbation method. So I will be actually only speaking about perturbation method, not mentioning others. Actually, up to some moment, the perturbation will be not important, but at some moment, perturbations will play a very important role. So this is what we'll be talking about. So let's start with the So let's start with some idea of open systems. So what it is, usually we have a map, a space, could be a metric space, actually, and a continuous map. And then you look at the set of points which omit a ball centered at some point psi and with radius epsilon. So this is the set KTB psi psi is a closed forward invariant and therefore invariant and therefore it defines its own dynamical systems. And we are looking what's going on with actually epsilon Luvari. Okay. And you can do it even more generally. Instead of having a hole being a ball, it could be just an open set. And you look at the set of points that avoid the set U either through all the time or up to some time. Okay, these two cases will be important. two cases will be important. So and then we have the questions about what is say geometry of this sets Ku and surviving sets and maybe also what kind features of the original dynamical systems from X to X preserves if you just do this open system avoiding a hole. So let me speak about some maybe really prehistory. Maybe Ready Pre-history in 1991, I proved that if we have some smooth expanding map of a finite-dimensional compact manifold, and you look at this set of points avoiding a ball of radius epsilon, then Hausdorff dimension of the surviving set is always strictly smaller than the dimension of the manifold. And in addition, if the ball shrinks down to a point, then Hausdorff dimension converges to the dimension of the Converges to the dimension of the manifold. And even in some more remote prehistory, I looked at just the, okay, the maps of the circle Z goes to Z D or equivalent to the maps of the interval X goes to the X mod 1. And to look at the so as a whole, it was either say zero, epsilon. zero uh epsilon or you can think it on uh uh on the on the circle as as this one and then uh i looked at the hausdale dimension of the surviving set and it happened that the function which ascribed to the parameter epsilon the hausdale dimension of the surviving set is continuous and decreasing not strictly decreasing and it looks like some And it looks like somehow the state device graph. So it has almost everywhere Lockely constant. And at points of no constantness, the set of these points where this function is not constant has Lebesgue measure zero, Hausdorff dimension one, and moreover, it has kind of some similarity between similarity between Similarity between similarity between the set and the parameter space. If you look at this local dimension, then the local dimension of points where the function is not locally constant is equal to the Hausdorff dimension of actual set. So more about this in the quantify equations has been done relatively recently, some few years ago, by Caraminatti and Giulio Tiosso, who will be also speaking here, I think, tomorrow, but a different topic. And but a different topic, and uh, I will come back to this uh later on, probably at the very end of the talk. So, uh, so maybe some concepts that are that will be important for me when doing the open systems are the escape rates. So, now you look at the set of points that avoid the hole up to time n, and you look what is the measure of this, of the set of points, and how fast they decay exponentially. And this is measured by a lower and By lower and upper escape rates. And if these two quantities are equal, we just speak about escape rates. Another significant concept is the Piagignani-York measure, conditional invariant measure. So conditional invariant measure is a measure which is supported on the complement of the whole, and it has the property that if you take the pullback of the set A, then the measure. Then the measure actually decreases, decreases by a constant factor, namely alpha. Okay, if alpha is one, this measure is just invariant, but if alpha is, if the whole is non-trivial, then this number is smaller than one. Another question is that if you have such a dynamical system and it has some good properties, like the existence of some uniqueness of equilibrium states. Uniqueness of equilibrium states. We can look also at the potential restricted to the full surviving sets, so KT of U, and check whether this dynamical system also has equilibrium states, uniqueness, and how good they are. So let me here bring up some relevant questions here, which I'll be dealing with. These are not by the, by no means all the questions. These are not by no means all the questions one could ask. These are just some questions we are interested in. So, this is, for example, what is the limit of the escape rates if the ball shrinks to a point and with respect to the in the ratio with respect to the measure. This is the question number one. Then a subtract question is what happens if a hole actually a if a hole actually approaches if a sequence of holes approaches a hole approach a hole what's going on then this is the question uh this is the question number two then um then also uh question number three uh which uh will be actually the source of knowledge for one and two and other what about the equilibrium states if you have if your regional system has actually a spectral gap i will talk about it more and whether the good spectral properties Spectral properties continue. So, also for conformal systems, not only for conformal, but first for particularly for conformal systems, it is really relevant to ask about the Hausdorff dimension of this. So, how it does change Hausdorff dimension of the surviving set with respect to the original one. So, Hausdorff dimension of the X, and also what's going on with the difference of Hausdorff dimensions if a whole approach. If a whole approaches a whole. This problem number four. So let me now bring up some history of some selected history of open systems. So I already mentioned this work of Carminati and Tioso, for holder exponents, then, okay, and then many other works. And so here. Other works. And so here I put in blue: this is the book I will be talking about. So, actually, essentially, all results which I'll be talking about are the topic on this book, which is still in progress, but will appear in the Gruiter. So, other history goes here. There are, okay, several excellent papers by Mark Demers. And in the blue is indicated the paper by Andrew. Is indicated by paper by Andrew Ferguson and Mark Polycott, which is one our work also stems from. So, this is where they introduce especially the Banach space we'll be working with. And the further history, okay, I would like to point out the paper by Gerfer Keller Carl Angelo Liverani, the blue one, where they said I just introduced the right functional analytic tool. Functional analytic tools and methods to do singular perturbation of operators, and they fit very well to dynamical systems. They had that in mind, in the having had in my dynamical systems, they put it in completely purely functional analytics setting. Okay, and also the last one, number 20, is actually my book with Mark Polycott, which is maybe direct, okay, it's kind of the most direct. Kind of the most direct father of the current one with Julio Tuscher and Anna. So, okay, so I'll be talking, so my primary talk here will be about symbol dynamical systems. We know that a symbol dynamical system is actually kind of universal tool to study many other systems via primary Markov partitions or via first return time. So doing the simple So doing simple dynamical systems will permit us to get applications for other so-called real dynamical systems. And here's just, okay, so this is, I think, really maybe known for you. So the alphabet is cantable. I really emphasize the word infinite. Usually you should think about it infinite, but not always. We'll be dealing with finite Markov partitions. And here is just two concepts that are slightly, which are actually a little bit different than in the finite. Different than in the finite alphabet case. The metric is finitely primitive if there is a set of words of the same length, such that any two other words, any two other letters in the alphabet can be joined by the word from this collection of sets. And if you do not insist, if you insist only that this set is finite, finite set of words, but not necessarily of the same length, then they just call it finitely irreducible. In the finite case, finite alphabet is just irreducibility. But there's just irreducibility and primitivity. Okay, and they appear naturally in Markov partitions and during inducing. And this omega h tau is just, as you can guess, the longest initial segment common for both omega and tau. And in bar, it's its length. So now to do thermodynamic formalism, first I need to have a potential. So the potential is assumed to be held one cylinder helder continues. So this really, so this helder continues on each cylinder of length one, each initial cylinder. And the second hypothesis is that it is sum above. So this series converges. So if the alphabet is infinite, So, if the alphabet is infinite and you have some potential, then this potential is always unbounded, is unbounded from below. It converges. If the alpha, the letters converge to infinity, then it converges to negative infinity. It's bounded above, but unbounded below, and define topological pressure in the standard way as do it in the subshifts of finite type with finite alphabet. And then with Manfred, with that. With Manfred, with Dan Molden, we proved the existence of Gibbs measures. As you see, this definition is exactly the same as in the classical book of Bowen on subshifts. Nothing changed. And we have also the variational principle. The only difference here is that to speak meaningfully about variational principle, I need to assume that the integral of phi against the measure mu is negative because it's unbounded above, so that the sum. Bounded above, so that the sum, if entropy could be somehow infinite and potential in negative infinity would make no sense. So let's see. So then also actually this concept already relevant. Omri Saek proved that if you have one cylinder summable potential which has a Gibbs state, then the matrix must be actually finitely irreducible. And let's see. So now let me briefly bring up the Me briefly bring up the concept of quasi-compactness. So, operator is quasi-compact if you can perturb it by a compact or what is equivalently finite rank operator and the spectral values decreases. And then this operator is, I say spectral gap, I assume that these properties in particular, you have a positive spectral radius, so R of lambda is a spectral radius, it is cooked down, cooked. is it is cooked down cooked down for dynamical system and is simple and then we have such nice decomposition. So in the dynamics, the operator actually we deal with in thermodynamic formalism is the transfer operator, which is here defined the same way as for finite countable alphabet. And it preserves Banach space, Cb of infinity is the Banach space. C B of A infinity is the Banach space of bounded continuous functions and H theta B E A infinite is the Banach space of Helder continuous bounded functions. So this, if you take H theta B, I mean Helder continuous bounded, not only one cylinder, but really bounded. So actually one cylinder inbounded. This means this Helder continues here. Helder continues here. So this is so potentials are one cylinder Helder and they act on Helder and they act on the space of bounded Helder continuous functions. And then actually, okay, we've proved done more than also just spectral decomposition of the operator. So the existence of eigenvalues for the dual operator, L phi star mu, and spectral gap and the projection is given by just m phi of g this rho phi. Of GDS row file. And okay, so now for our perturbations, we need some more refined or further banner spaces. So I call it bounded mean oscillation banner space, which actually traces back probably to the work of Gerard Keller on potentials with bounded p-variation and was really revived in the paper by Andrew Fernandez. In the paper by Andrew Ferguson and Mark Polycott. And so you defined, so now this not, this looks like holder, but only in the middle. And we get a Banach space. And so now the nice feature is here that these functions that belong to the Banach space B theta of mu. B theta of mu have bounded S initial supremum and okay, this last one actually should not appear. And the space of Helder functions is contained in them. And we had this Banach algebra, we have inequality with the factor two. So, okay, important theorem, but if you look at the ball at the closed, actually closed bounded set in the space B theta of set in the space B theta of mu and treated as a subset of L1 mu fung space, then it is compact. And this is our proposition that the parallel for Benius operator preserves this Banach space. And we have actually this last inequality is kind of Uh, inequality is kind of uh, what people called either Ionescuturcia Marinescu or uh La Sota York inequality in this context, okay? And uh, for this banner space, and again, uh, uh this paron, so no far so far no perturbations, this parallel from venues has such a spectral uh decomposition, like for uh like for uh helder continuous functions. So, now if we have a hole, if we have a hole, now perturbation. Hole, if we have a hole, now perturbation starts. If we have a hole, one defines associated with the whole operator alpha u. By definition, L phi of u is just you look at alpha, the operate, the transfer operator by the function g is multiplied by the complement of the whole. So you do, if you iterate permanence operator, you just look only at the inverse images that all avoid the whole, as one should suspect. So to get the format. So, to get the formal thermodynamic formalism. And again, if we know, so if U is, for example, a union of cylinders of the same length, then we have such inclusions. And we have this factor 2 happens if the norm is held there. If the norm is supremum, then the factor 2 should not appear. If the norm is from the space beta, then the factor should appear. So, but most sets are not. But most sets are not unions of, open sets are not unions of finite cylinders. In fact, a set is a union of cylinders with finitely many lengths if and only if characteristic function is held there. So in our book, we provided, we suggest a sufficient condition, a quite general sufficient condition, which ensures that the complement of the whole has Of the hole has is in this paper in the space B theta of m phi. And then, if it is in the space, then the operator alpha u is actually well defined and we can continue doing thermodynamic formalism. So, the important issue is to have a whole such that a characteristic function of its complement or just of this whole belongs to this balance space. Okay, and we're looking for such holes that are not dynamically defined. Okay, so they're not necessarily defined, defined, not unions of cylinders. So then the operator is bounded and this is one reason for which this space was important, but not only the one, the one which is even earlier is that for. Even earlier, is that without it we would not get actually sufficiently small singular perturbations. So now, okay, coming trying to, okay, I'm trying to formulate now this sufficient condition. So it takes a little bit of time. So first of all, if you have a subset of consisting of finite words, so the set F, then you look at the corresponding cylinders. At the corresponding cylinders. So, and you look at the set of points such that the cylinder is contained in D and intersects its complement. And all these words are mutually incomparable. And U is the union of the sets E and U. So, pointwise, characteristic function is the union of characteristic functions over this sets E and U. But since the That's ENU. But since the B the B theta norm of even one cylinder is always big, at least one, then there is no hope to have this equality to hold in the Banach space. This may be annoying, but possible to overcome. So now the nth boundary of a set is just like a boundary, but you look only at the cylinder of length n. Of length n. And if the set is open, then okay, this boundary is by definition the same as the boundary of a complement. If the set is open, then the boundary of the closure is contained in the boundary of it, and it has some natural properties like ordinary boundary. So, okay, the concept to deal with such holes is the boundary size of you. So, pick a number alpha, look at the measure M fe. measure m few m phi of the uh of the uh of the boundary and multiply b to alpha n and look at the supremum. So the whole, the ball is set to be to a thin boundary if this boundary size is finite. So this means that the measure of the boundary of nth boundary of the ball is actually it goes to zero exponentially fast. And okay now Now, the theorem which permits us to do this thermodynamic formulas here and go ahead is to notice that if theta is large enough, but smaller than one, and I have a whole within boundary, then characteristic function is in the space B theta of m phi, the mean oscillation space. And okay, and so the proof is like this: but if you look at the oscillation, then it happens actually, it's the characteristic function of the boundary. And then we have this, let's see, then we have the calculation here and is bounded by eventually by this factor. Now, since theta was e to the power minus alpha one, this is bigger than one. one this is bigger than one so the whole thing is less than or equal to one and we have and uh we have the norm uh b theta m phi norm of the whole is finite so i say that we can assume that theta is as close to one as possible because if something is held continuous exponent theta then it's also held their continuous uh let's see um uh with any exponent uh bigger than Uh bigger than it's smaller than one. So so this is the idea to get this the idea to get this. So now this property is robust. So if I have a if I protect my potential by a bounded potential, then still the affinity boundary preserve preserves, but with maybe different exponent. And okay, the the most natural the The most natural example is that if you take a wall, infinite work, and you truncate, and you look at the cylinders of consecutive lengths, and then this is a sequence of holes, and they have thin boundaries. And the supreme moment is uniformly bounded independently of n, which will be, okay, which will be used. I'm using here, yes, okay, I'm using here the fact that actually. I'm using here the fact that actually measures of cylinders goes to zero exponentially fast for these keep states. So another example is that if you just look at the whole which consists of all letters from some point on, so this you can think about it, but you have a Gauss map and you just keep only the first n letters and this is where you do your surviving set and the whole is from say from somehow Epsom. From somehow epsilon through one. And okay, so now the standard construction, which gives really robust examples of holes, suppose that I have a helder continuous functions from a metric from the space alpha to the X. So you should think about F as being actually projection from a Markov partition, from the coding of Markov partition, or you have some graph-directed Markov system. And most the best way to be to think and The best way to be to think, and this will be an application where F is actually a projection from the counting space induced by a Markov partition for some expanding map. So then one can do this, introduce such a measure which actually measures the size of the ceiling of annuli, metric annuli or balls. And ah, okay, so the theorem is this: if I have such a just abstract helder-continuous function and I have some constant and a measure as before, and if this measure behaves well at the origin, so measure of the inverse image of a small ball is less than or equal c times r to some power, then there exists a border set in the interval 0, r such that it has the Lebesgue measure almost. The Lebesgue measure almost as big as the interval zero R, and zero is the Lebesgue density point, precisely meaning that this equality holds. And then every such a hole is actually a thin boundary hole. A thin one is a thin boundary hole with respect to the measure m phi. So this gives a really large collection of thin boundary holes in the sense of Lebesgue measure that are actually geometrically. That are actually geometrically defined, not dynamically. And moreover, and this is important, but if you take the supremum over all these R's, then the supremum is finite. This will be needed when I be speaking about the concept of perturbative schemes. And so here is just to say a calculation showing that if you do perturbations, even by the simplest holes, namely cylinders, namely cylinders of some length, then the perturbation in the Of some length, then the perturbation in this B theta space are large. So, this means that the space B theta mu is not itself enough to do actual thermodynamics to do perturbation theory. Perturbations are big. We need some another tool, some another way to handle this. And this is given. Okay, these are just calculations that this small. So, this is given. So, okay, what to do? This is given, so okay, what to do? One could look at the space operating acting on L1 space, but then we know what the spectrum is to be actually the full disks, no way. So another thing is to introduce here, okay, sorry, a moment, see, to introduce another Banach space, this which I call here star, and consider the operator from B theta M to this another Banach space. And I will define in a moment. And I will define in a moment this banner space, but first, say we are now landing at the actual work of Keller and Liverani. So they provided such a such a setting for perturbations. You have banner space and another actually another norm space and okay and a family of operator acting on this. Of operator acting on this on both of the spaces. You have topological space and one marked element. Usually, this element is maybe zero or infinity in the case of infinity. And we have family of bounded linear operators, which has the following familiar-to-as conditions. The first condition actually essentially means that the suprema of these operators k epsilon are uniformly bounded. So the second condition is a kind of Jonescuit junction, Marinescu or Our last note Ivaranik inequality, but note, however, here is m to the power n, it's not a constant. This is a different than in the classical version of Junescuturjo-Marinescu Marinescu theorem. And we have a family of operators, this P epsilon. So, okay, look, this norm, this triple norm is going to zero. Remember, this triple norm is the norm that you take a set in the Of a set in B with this double norm less than or equal to one, and then you look at the image with the weaker norm, QF. So, this one is going to be zero. And this will have for dynamical systems. And then, okay, these are just Keller-Di-Parani frame. These are their hypothesis. There is also this hypothesis about not residual spectrum, which is actually implied by the implied by the fact that the ball is ball is compact, as I already said. And two and three also ensure, and this is the real perturbation result, but the essential spectral radius is less than or equal to beta. So, okay, so now assume in addition that we have spectral gap, and then I'm speaking about say strong Keller Diverani family and And have the spectrum is the spectrum is well inside. So this is this, and here in this region, there is no spectrum. It's just the picture. And see, so then Terra Riverani gives, but actually. Teller Riverani gives that actually this spectral decomposition preserves further. We have a family of operators, like that they are still, they have a spectral gap. Although I said put spectral gap in quasi because we do not know at this moment that the eigenvalues actually lambda epsilon are real numbers. So in such a setting. And also there is some continuity result, right? So there is So, this is if we put up, and we actually proved here some small contribution that if the stripo norms converges to zero, then this epsilon is such a actually continuity point. And so now, going back to somehow to symbol setting, I introduce this weak norm and the banner space with the weak norm, which is actually stems from the work of The work of Andrew Ferguson and Mark Polycott. And you just look, it is technical. It's technical. It's actually time was crafted for the Yonescu-Turcha-Marinescu theorem to be able to be proved. Yes? Sorry to interrupt, but why not just take L1? I mean, L1 is weak enough, certainly, for your... Sorry? Why not just take L1 for your weak norm? No, no, L1, L1 does not suffice. One does not suffice because if you will not get in a if you if you if you calculate if you calc if you do UNESCO Tulja-Marinesku theorem in this setting then then this term this other term this m to the power n times a norm comes not just L1 but but you have to do a bigger term yes this is what I this is the real reason to introduce this this balance space right this is Space, right? This really L1 is not sufficient here in this context. It's too weak, it's too weak. Norm, the bar is too weak, right? The L1 norm is too weak, exactly. Okay. So this is why if you try to prove the Jonescu tool Chamarinescu, and I think this is what Mark can say, but probably Andrew and Mark did. In the finite alphabet case, they came to this. They came to this kind of definition, which here is somewhat modified, but stems from their work. Okay, and here actually is the proof that this is really the norm actually weaker than the original one, right? But this is what you need. And let's see. So this defines this weak norm. So, and then, okay, so here, okay, here is. Here is just the main, okay, some estimates, and then Yoneskut-Chamarinesko inequality. And here, okay, if you had, if you would like to have here only L1, this what would not would not work. Okay, and this so is invisible, yes, in this place. And then showing the compactness, so you still have compactness. Yes, you still have compactness. You can still have compactness in this model. Yes, if you take bundles. In this ball, if yes, if you take banded ball in a beta, then you have and you treat it as in this, say, um, okay, uh, this, uh, so this is this weak norm, then it is compact. Okay, this also requires proof. Yes, this is compact. So, this is, I mean, there's many technical proofs which I'm, of course, keeping, but it's like that. So, then, okay, then we can define again the strip of norm as in the abstract setting. And here you have actually for us. And here you have actually for us really, I put k, but k equal to one would suffice for here for the so this so that we have really somehow small singular perturbations. Notice that this is this is the square root of m phi of u. And if u shrinks to zero, then the measure shrinks to zero and the triple norm goes to zero. So this is so we have really small perturbation. This Keller-Livarani condition is satisfied. So this is here. So this is here. So this is. Okay. So now I say slightly. So if you have topological space and with a marked element, and we looked at the collection of holes, so u gamma, and then assuming that this supremum is finite. Notice that in this example which I provided of the same, what I said, robust holes, I insisted. Robust holes, I insisted that the supremum is finite. This was part of the proof. And so then this collection of f inverse of big psi epsilon gives us a collection, gives us such perturbation scheme. Okay. So this is, so these are standards, say, okay, so standard examples, natural, so this is two. And the other one is this one which I talked about. This is just our main example. Main example, but you have the function f, and you look at this blue collection of guys and these perturbation schemes. And these perturbation schemes, if you will consider then a corresponding transfer operator, it will give you strong Terra Liberali family and the perturbation result will hold. Okay, so this is our main example. So this is really essentially in a sense, almost every ball is good to pertarb for. Every ball is good to perturb from some point on, in the sense of Lebanon. So, okay, so the weak norm, so we have just such inequality, and now that the Vanach space is defined with respect like with one ball, but now this was the supremum over all balls. And here again, we have this inequality showing. So this is here Jonesko Tulcha. So, this is here Jones Cotulcha, and here is small perturbations. And this family is then the main, as I said, strong color liver strong color liver anni family. And okay, and this gives rise to such a perturbation result. We have this operation. We have these operators furthermore. And let's see. And so here is more. So this is continuity and see this consequences of the spectral decomposition, continuity results. And okay, so now I need some. Okay, I've been talking about equilibrium states. So I need some analysis results. So I look at more general potential of complex type. General potential of complex type. So we need, okay, in this context, if you do the different potential, you do not have unique Banach space to work with. Handler space is not good. So we need to really somehow cook up a good Banach space in a good setting. So having one potential, we need some, having a collection of potential, we need some other potential which dominates all of them in such a setting. And then if you do the pertar potentials, Pertar potentials, they also preserved the space, and we have this function is holomorphic. Notice this function is holomorphic, although even this equality does not hold in the sense of Banach space. Okay, the perturbations in Banach space are good. So this is, but still they hold point-wise, and then you can use just Morera's theorem to get analystity, showing that this potenti function psi to xi is just continuous. To xi is just continuous. Okay. So from point-wise up to the up to the operator. And okay, this is some pre-analytic. So then you get some bigger Banach space and the eigenvalues are holomorphic. This is just really cut already. So then this looked the operators, per tarp operators by the ball hole and The hole and corresponding to this parameter L xi2. So, so okay, so also maybe say, let me say, let me bring up again the definition of for a moment of conditional invariant measures that I already had. And we get actually now a good result, good characterizations of such conditionally invalid measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the measure. Absolutely continuous with respect to the measure. And that, and there is our theorem that in this context, if epsilon is sufficiently small to the marked element to zero, then there is actually a unique conditional measure whose random nicodem derivative belongs to the Banach space beta mu. And in general, we know that there is no unique conditional invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to such. Continues with respect to such merit is the result of Mark Demers, Lei Sank Young, who proved that there is a bunch of such results actually and contributing in general. So there is no, we cannot do better, okay, only in such this particular monarch space. So then, okay, then I'm looking at then I'm looking at at the last oh beta. Beta in the last oh, beta in the last phase, okay. Uh, beta, let's see, uh, beta is this parameter, okay. This contraction of contraction of conditional invariant measures. So, in the statement of the theorem, we said beta equals something else in the next slide, yes, in addition, let's in addition, equals veta equals all lambda tilde epsilon, right. lambda tilde epsilon right oh lambda tilde epsilon these are this i actually it should uh these are these eigenvalues uh but if you really perturb not original operator but operator normalized twice so that uh the number the function identity equal one is preserved by the operator so subtract the pressure add logarithm of the randomly coded derivative take away logarithm of the random nicodem derivative Of the randomly code and derivative composed with the with sigma. Okay, so this is better to express this in such language. Could we express in the original language, but would be more accurate? So, okay, so now I'm looking at the full surviving set. Okay, I'm coming to equilibrium state. So, full surviving set, so the set of points that avoid the fall all the time. And this set is, as I said already, forward, invariant, and so on, and closed and doesn't. And closed and it doesn't have to be compact. Usually it's not. And we look at the space of invariant probability of measures supported on Q epsilon and such invariant measures. And then have variation on principle. So if you have such perturbation scheme, then if epsilon is sufficiently small, then you have exactly. Sufficiently small, then you have exactly and this condition holds. Okay, this integral is phi, positive, it's greater than mice, this very mighty condition. It usually holds. It's very easy to say that this is, for example, if the function, if the potential phi multiplied by some factor smaller than one is sum above, then this condition holds. Okay, so just so just this is easy. So, and then we have unique equilibrium state. Uh, then you have unique equilibrium state. So, I will be give some outline of how to prove the uniqueness of equilibrium state and maybe some construction. So, first about some inequality. So, this inequality and uniqueness, so that there are no more than one equilibrium state. The proof goes for some time the same way. So, you look at this more general SK SKL family where you have such perturbed operators, but now they'll use this H is an element actually of bounded space of Banach space of bounded held continuous functions. You do this one, not only t psi, but this number H. And then this again can be proved as KL family, and it induces its own eigenvalues, eigenfunctions. Eigen functions too, but we are primarily eigenvalues. And because of this, because of this analysis condition result, which I was talking about, this function is actually differentiable and its logarithm is also differentiable. And if you do now this extended family, and in the case 0 epsilon, so if h is 0, then you get the original one, alpha epsilon. Original one, alpha epsilon, and then the eigenvalues coincide because this, if you take h equals zero, you get a sub scheme. So, okay, so now we have here, we have to do, put hands, we need to work some approximations. So, approximations from below and they give rise to another actual perturbative scheme, and for them, And for them, one can do calculations, okay, like in the variational principle. And in this calculation, it's important that the cylinders involved here are of the same length. And then we get this inequality. Oh, sorry. Let's see. We get this inequality, which is here. And this is still L. And then you can go with L to infinity. And because of the continuity results. And because of the continuity results of eigenvalues, not only at zero, but at any parameter, so here h epsilon, we get such an inequality. And then if take take h equals zero, you get just variational inequality. So now, just to if you now going to show that there's no more than one equilibrium state, suppose that you have one equilibrium state, but 11 holds, then subtract from 11 in a subtract. In a subtract from 10, 11, then you get such an inequality like here. And this means that all surviving acrid are supporting functionals for this differentiable map. Since we know that this map is differentiable and it's supporting and equilibria are supporting functionals, we know that they must agree on this banache. agree on this banach on this banach space at least on this ball so but if the the two measures agree on such ball then they are uh then they are equal okay so this is actually one way also functionality to prove uniqueness of equilibrium state just by showing that the pressure is differentiable on some uh with the gato derivative with some uh sufficiently large uh sibana space okay this functional uh there's many ways of proving so dant has one and Of proving so, Dan has one, and there are many other ways of proving, but this one is particularly good if you have if you start with functional analysis. So, then now, what about, so now I'm going to provide a way to how to construct equilibrium states. So, you do, so you do, you look at, okay, you look at Banach space, beta m psi, then q epsilon, you know, this projector, a survived projector. This projector, a survived projector, and this projector is one-dimensional. So its value is given by some new psi of new epsilon of g times rho epsilon. This is this eigenfunction, rho epsilon. So because it is this projector is its rank, its range is generated by rho epsilon. It must such a function exist. So this is the way. So, and likewise here, the similar way. So this gives us this. So this gives us rise to two positive linear functionals, mu epsilon and mu epsilon. And we can do it slightly more generally in a uniform way, having some gamma epsilon, which is in the application either equal to one or rho epsilon. So now, okay, this actually this new epsilon of G would be our good candidate for equilibrium states. For equilibrium states. But notice that these are functionals on space on B theta M of psi. And this space is actually, this space is within the Lebesgue L1 space. And the equilibrium states that are going to live on the surviving sets will be certainly singular with respect to the measure. To the to the measure you start with. So it seems that this is actually no, this is actually what I say, bad space to do. We cannot use this to create a measure. So we need to do some other procedure. First, we say that this functional on this banner space extends to a positive linear functional from the bounded continuous functions. And this is done. Functions. And this is done via applying Rhys extension theorem of continuous potential. This theorem, which is different than Han Banach, is a little bit similar in spirit. The proof is also via Sorgemma, but it's different. And it's about cons, and then we get it. So then now. So then, now the most natural way to proceed if we have on such a functional on such a space would be to use Daniel Stone representation theorem. But actually, I see no way to prove this continuity condition. Just the convergence in B theta is too weak to ensure this. So for this, we do ascend this. We do ascend this, let's see, descending approximations. So now, such that the whole is contained in here, and I'm adding by purpose this term, NLC. So this is the complement NLC to the whole. So that then you have with this Banach space belongs, okay, this are cylinder slank one belongs to here and such again scheme. Scheme, and we look at okay, we have this continuity condition here, and okay, and this set is now compact because it is closed and contained in actually in this in the space. And this set and L, these are just all the numbers from one up to L, so it's finite. So then we can prove that if the function is uniformly continuous and vanishes on the surviving. Vanishes on the surviving set, then actually this extended functional is also equal to zero. So in this way, we can take now if we have a function uniformly, okay, we can, if we have a function in this space on k u epsilon plus l plus, then we can define its extension, uniformly continuous extension. A uniformly continuous extension and define the potential via this extension, and it does not depend on the extension. So then this functional now is positive and linear. And therefore, by the classical risk representation theorem, there is actually a finite measure which witnesses to it. And so then both measures, mu tilde epsilon and mu tilde, are probabilistic. And mutilates are probabilistic. This mu epsilon L is shift invariant, and okay, both of them are supported on this surviving sets. So now finally, we prove this sequence. You know, remember, the space of EA infinity is not compact. So the space of function of boreal probability measure is not usually not compact. Measure is not, as usual, it's not compact, but we nevertheless proved that, let's see, that this sequence is tight and therefore defines a measure at epsilon. So, these measures are again probabilistic and supported on Q epsilon and have one is actually eigen kind of preserve. Oh, this should be here lambda epsilon new epsilon, new tilde epsilon energy. This means. epsilon new tilde epsilon of G this missing so should be uh should be new tilde epsilon uh new new tilde epsilon of g here okay so this is and here this this one is this measure is invariant this is our candidate for the for the equilibrium state so now theorem mu epsilon is a unique equilibrium state for the potential so we already know that all we need to prove is That all we need to prove is this inequality, right? Because I proved that there is no more than one potential, and I proved the opposite inequality for every invariant measure. And this is actually now, okay, the main step here was just to construct these potentials. Once we have them constructed, the proof is relatively easy. And okay, this is some natural inequality coming, really coming, let's see. Coming, let's see, from this property after iterating and property number two. And having this, the standard calculations gives you this inequality by taking logarithms and so on. So now I have also stochastic laws generated by generated by spectral gap. So central limit theorem. But both functions need to be unlike in the original case. Need to be unlike in the original case, I need to have both functions to be in this to be really in the space, held their continuous functions on that. I cannot do really better because on bet theta, this space is really and this is mu epsilon and mu phi, mu epsilon say, or mu epsilon and mu phi and mu phi or are usually singular. Singular. And also, if you do calculations, you need to get rid of Twilders and get to the actual functionals. And this is what you need. So then this gives also a mixing of alternatives, in particular, ergodic. And we have standard weight, central limit theorem, and the law of iterated plug-in. And even the almost shoot invariance principle due to action. almost sure invariance principle due to actually the work of Gusel who actually proved that all what we need is basic spectral spectral gap to basically okay to have to have the almost sure invariance principle. So now okay so some further properties of these invariant measures, this equilibria, how they are calculated and they behave And they behave in a nice monotone way. And okay, so now if you have a perturbative scheme, I'm now and some certain additional hypotheses that are not too restrictive. We have we get good actually approximation of perturbed eigenvalues. And the differences of these perturbed eigenvalues are measured. Eigenvalues are measured by the surviving equilibria mu r and mu epsilon of the annuli. Okay, so this is that way. And so this is, so in particular, if you take it at the point zero, if you take such a ball, if u epsilon converges to omega, then we get this one. Then you get this one and that one. So, this is for pertarb eigenvalues. We have such a differentiability condition of them. And so, they give rise to good asymptotic properties of escape rates. Again, escape rates upper and lower, as I already said in the introduction. And let's see. And okay, we have lower and upper equilibrium and. upper equilibrium and if they exist they are equal and so then if we have perturbed scheme then equilibrium state always exists sorry this escape rate always exists if absolutely small enough and this is okay on with no additional assumptions and equilibrium state sorry escape rate is for the ball is then the same as the as the as the unused this because um Part of the analysis subset of this ball, and this is the difference of eigenvalues, and this is the difference of such escape rates. And let's see, right, and under additional assumptions, we have this. this at at the point at the point if epsilon converges if epsilon converges to R. So this is so this escape rates at balls, the differences are really measured asymptotics is given by the measures of the annuli of the or the measures of the of the holes. So this so this is you have to do calculation once you have so once you have this Once you have so once you have this equality, and then you can actually prove that. So then again, in the special case, if you have a point and a shrinking ball, or if you have canonical perturbative scheme and the holes are F inverse of balls. So now, okay, so now. Okay, so now going to more bigger dynamics, I'm looking at the graph-directed Markov system. So you can think about it that you have, for example, Markov martation and you look at inverse branches of holes. This gives rise to the graph-directed Markov system. This is good example. Or you have a Gauss map and you look at the map G L of X is equal to 1 over X plus N. Okay, these are inverse branches of the Okay, these are inverse branches of the Gauss world. This good iterated function system. Gauss-directed Markov system means that there is a matrix which tells you which compositions are allowed consecutively. Okay, so this is just the difference. But here I assume that you have somehow finitely many vertices and infinitely many edges. So this is like the loose, but you have some, maybe here, some, okay, maybe just let me be visible cycle. So you have finitely many. So you have finitely many, so finitely many spaces, you have maps here, contractions here, here, here, okay, here, and you can have infinitely many of them, but only infinite, only finitely many seed spaces. And if just this, if there's only one guy and all maps are into itself and all compositions are allowed, you have iterated function system. So this is so Markov partitions and inverse branches of cells of Markov. Inverse branches of cells of Markov partitions is a good graph-directed Markov system with finite alphabet. Okay. So, and we have such a contractions. So, then one looks at the compositions, and this is the sending set, and we can define the intersection. This intersection must be, therefore, a singleton. And okay, and this is the only family. This is the element pi s omega, which is the projection. Which is the which is the projection. So, and j is the limit set. So, now in the case of irrational of this system, if n is n in n, then the limit set is what is not the interval 0, 1, but what? The set of irrational numbers, right? The set of irrational numbers, but because every irrational number has projection, this projection is given by what? Ps okay, for Gauss map of omega is equal. Of omega is equal to one over omega one plus one over omega two plus, and so on. And this is irrational number. So this is, so other examples are if this is, this map is, this, this map is Helder continuous, and then we can have potential and such a perturbative scheme. So you can feel you can. Perturbative scheme. So you can think about again gamma u to be the set whose Lebeck measure is almost full and zero is density points. And this condition holds for actually almost every point with respect to the measure phi. Okay, almost every point this condition holds. So we are fine. And then we get again such a thing for equilibriums, for asymptotic of eigenvalues and asymptotic. and asymptotic of let's see, of asymptotic of eigenvalues and asymptotic of asymptotic of escape rates, where now are just the holes are despite as inverse of annuli or of holes of balls and you look escape rates for annuli. Escape rates for Adoli. And so now, in particular, if psi is not periodic, then equilibrium, then escape rate is equal to pi minus log lambda of log lambda b, and then the asymptote of escape rate is equal to one. If the point is periodic, it also can be computed, but it will be different number. Will be different temper, okay, depending on the period, depending on the period. So, now, um, let me see, let me go now to conformal graph the red Markov systems. So, so far, this way, so if you still, if you even assume that they are conformal, the maps are conformal, then we look at the now at the set of points that avoids these balls downstairs, okay, if you do projection. If you do projection, so this is this set and denote by the BSR, the Hausdorff dimension of the set. So then this set is given actually by Bowen's formula, this dimension. However, so this is, you look at such a potential, the geometric potential, which we are familiar with here, and there is a unique equilibrium state. There is a unique equilibrium state, but I would like to just to emphasize that here the situation is such that, but look, actually, look at this. This is mu Bsr of R. So this T here is BS of R. So, and this Bs of R depends on R. So the potential actually depends on the perturbation. So actually we do not have really, we have family of potentials and potential depends on the perturbation. And potential depends on the perturbation. And one should be very careful because you may take, if you do take potential, you may, and then the perturbation results hold for small parameters. And this parameters, the moment from which it holds could be too small, that R would not belong to this moment from which actually the result holds. So one should therefore do this for a bigger family and still Bigger family and still ensure that this is really well defined. So, and then we get, let's see, we get asymptotic results. So, under certain additional assumptions, the difference of the Hausdorff dimensions is asymptotic, is given by the geometric measure, or say Bowen measure. measure or say Bowen measure and its value is one over Laponov exponent. And likewise here now, if you take epsilon goes to R and so Holes goes to Holes, then this is also one over here. So and in particular, if epsilon goes to zero, we get a result for the house or the Uh, for the house door dimension at this point. So, here I just want to say that this is different. So, here is even in this case, it's even more subtle because if epsilon goes to zero, we're always looking at the different measures. Here is the same measure, mu B S R, but here we have to look at the different measure. So, okay, so now, so let's say if we have now smooth expanding map and phi is Helder continuous potential. And phi is Helder continuous potential. And this perturbative scheme, so like this, the one generated by Markov partition. So then again, under certain assumptions. And if the manifold is just is one-dimensional, so then this additional assumptions is just that psi, the center of the ball, is not periodic, and the end points of the ball are not periodic, actually do not mix with each other. Okay, so these are this is. Okay, so these are this is this weak condition. So just calculable. So and then again we have asymptotic of eigenvalues and we have asymptotic of we have asymptotic of escape rates. So this is again in the case with M In the case with M again, in the case if the manifold is one-dimensional, then these are just no periodicity hypothesis. But if you had a periodic hole, you can still do, you just adjust the yes, you can. But so this move case, you can do for all holes. You can, I mean, eventually, or if there's still some restriction on okay, okay, okay, okay. So for this move, okay, uh, let's see. This move, okay. Uh, let's see. Uh, for this move, uh, I mean, for completed of all, so for this move, I look okay. So, you have a mark of partition, right? Okay, you look, you look actually, okay, you actually do it for this word. So, uh, B psi epsilon over all epsilon below. Belonging to gamma, where gamma is this set for which, say, gamma contained in some, say, zero r and okay, Lebesgue of gamma is bigger than, say, one minus delta times r and zero is a Lebesgue density point. Density point of the back density point of let's see the back density point of gamma for such a collection of boards. So even if it's smooth in the case, you because here it seems like okay, you okay? What if you don't use symbolic dynamics? What if you don't use some biogenic, right? You can just do this directly. You can get and just surprise that in this case, you still have the same condition that you feel like you can. No, okay, okay, yes, okay, moment. Let me say. Yes, I think you could do this. I think in the expanding case, I think, okay, you would have to introduce. Have to introduce a beta space. You could do it, probably most likely. We know that there is even a classical way there is an approach either directly working with parent providers operator on manifold or doing this symbolically. So many things you could do it on the manifold too, but smooth expanding case is just one of class of functions. Then you would have to do it separately for smooth expanding maps, for part of maps of the interval, for the case where you have. For the case where you have Lysank Young tower, separately for maps of interval, like topological call Eggman, separately for rational functions, separately for conformal repellers, expanding conformal spares, and so on and so on. So therefore, as I said at the beginning, doing this first on the symbolic level gives us a uniform way to get applications for many systems. Yes, but I think, but still, still you get this condition. still you get this condition so so so you i i think that if you do it really direct on the manipulator you will get you will get the you will get the same the same result but what was your surprise mark yes um no just that that that in the special setting maybe you could yeah have a strong like no no okay okay let's see if yes so in this oh i mean more general balls than this one This one probably, yes, but this okay. Uh, you're right, it wouldn't be a general method, it would be something. I mean, periodic points could be treated in this case too, right? I say that periodic points could be treated too, but they are required, okay, different more in more calculations. So, I don't say, okay, I just present it here in this form, but it's good before periodic. And actually, okay, so for. Okay, so for so this would right okay so so this this okay so then okay we get again uh cholera like here that is uh it's not periodic um and so if this point is just if it is periodic also would get but the the formula would be uh would be more uh would be more involved and uh okay so also all this just the remark which i already said but all of this holds with if All of this holds would, if you have just distance expanding map, not merely smooth, could be just this expanding as actually introduced open distance expanding map as introduced by Ruel in his book on thermodynamic formalism and actually is treated at length if actually my book with Palik Chutisky. So, all substance of finite type are distance expanding maps, many are them. So, distance expanding maps means only that you have a You have, say, a map, compact metric space, continuous map, and images slowly expand distances by constant factor. That's all. So this is, and okay. And now if we have C1 expanding map of the circle, then the Hausdorff dimension in particular, In particular, Hausdorff dimension that I will get such asymptotic Hausdorff dimension, the end zero okay, sufficiently close. So this center and the end points are not periodic and limit is equal to that. So and this is also asymptotic. So So I think this we can have something. And then we get as a corollary, we get some actually a sense, extension of the result of Carminatti and Giulio Tioso, that this function is slotted Helder continuous and its Helder exponent is equal to the Hausler. Exponent is equal to the Hausdorff dimension. So, this requires to put more hands on those measures, right? To get to get this color. And actually, comparison of this measure to the radi can be done via this perum from venous equality. So, we get these results. So, maybe some about applications. So, first of all, we can get an application to the Gauss map. We can recover. To the Gauss map, we can recover so that Dark Hensley asymptotic of causal dimension of those functions of those numbers whose digits are only from one to n. We can look just we can just take. We can just take from zero to epsilon and look not on this, but the guy which is by in this part, and we get it's asymptotic. So like Hausdorff dimension. So one minus Hausdorff dimension is essentially, I think, pi squared over six n and so on. To show that I get the right the coefficient? More or less. More or less. Yes. More or less. More or less. Yes. So this is like that. And also subject spending colour ECMAN maps and dynamic regular Meromorphic functions and Lysank Young towers and maybe more if you can think applications. So this is a go here. And actually, okay, this will be all. Thank you. Thank you.
