For the opportunity to come speak here today. Very, very cool to be able to share my research with you all. Right, so I'll be reporting on some joint work with my new supervisor, Jean-Christophe Knaff at McGill University, and his former PhD student, now postdoc at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon, G. Yornier. Alright, okay, so the overarching motivation from this work stems from the simulation of geophysical fluids. Here we have kind of Fluids. Here we have kind of complex multi-scale turbulent fluid phenomena occurring over a large range of spatial scales. So, whether this be for atmospheric flows, such as this pretty picture of Jupiter here, or oceanic flows, the spatial resolution required to capture both the kind of downscale and upscale transfers of energy involved in these types of processes is a fundamental numerical challenge. Alright, so to just kind of contextualize the problematic here a little bit further, we have that, you know, we want to perform DNS of decaying turbulence. And the domain-filling nature of turbulence requires a globally fine-scale resolution. All right, so here and kind of throughout the talk, we'll be considering the incompressible Euler equations, but some of the principles that we're developing kind of extend beyond just these types of flows. Stand beyond just these types of flows. However, in two dimensions, these equations give us a very interesting example of a type of fluid dynamics which exhibits a direct and inverse cascade of energy. So here we have a kind of slightly perturbed solution of Euler's equations. This is the vorticity distribution. You can see that the energy is kind of contained all in a single mode. However, it's starting to develop fine-scale features there. Feature is that over time the solution will transition to a turbulence associated with this kind of forward cascade of energy. And the use of highly resolved spatial refinement will be required to capture these types of processes. And some of the most interesting phenomena associated with these equations is this condensate formation. So this is kind of So, this is kind of an example of the self-organizing behavior that can be exhibited by these turbulent fluid flows. And it's commonly associated with an inverse cascade of energy from small scales into large ones. And types of kind of spatial refinements required to resolve these types of phenomena are both very highly resolved in space and for long time integrations. So, I'd like to kind of explain how we can. So I'd like to kind of explain how we can go about resolving both the direct and inverse cascades of energy without the use of a uniform kind of spatial refinement. So this will be the subject matter of the talk today. We'll talk about this composite discretization technique that we use for diffeomorphism approximation. It's called the characteristic mapping method. Then we'll look at some of its connections with geometric hydrodynamics, subject temperature. Hydrodynamics, subject I'm very fond of. And finally, we'll conclude with some numerical examples and experiments related to ideal turbulence. All right, so the kind of setting we place ourselves in is a general one. We consider a fluid or continuum to be modeled on a compact or manifold M, and we model fluid motions as paths in the space of diffeomorphisms. Paths in the space of diffeomorphisms of n. The fluid velocity here will be denoted u. This generates forwards in time, a Lagrangian flow map, which satisfies this ODE here, 2.1. The inverse of this map satisfies an induction equation here, 2.2. And this is commonly referred to as the fluid particle labels are inducted by the flow. Right, so we consider the inverse. Right. So we consider the inverse map as kind of one of the primary computational quantities of interest. It's because pullback with this map serves as a solution operator to the Lievection equation. So on the left-hand side here, this is a kind of geometric generalization of the conventional transport equation for the transport of more general objects than scalar fields, so vector fields, differential forms. Right, so if we have that F satisfies the If we have that f satisfies the Liad vection equation, then its evolution is governed by the right-hand side here, so pullback of the initial condition under the inverse map. Right. So for example, we have kind of passive advection. So this describes the transport of some scalar field phi and density rho. Here we use V to be the space of densities, kind of indicating that they're volume forms. So it's modeled as some. Forms. So it's modeled as some kind of positive scalar field times the Riemannian volume form. And the Lie abvection equation on the space of scalar fields becomes the conventional transport equation. And on the space of densities, it's the continuity equation here. Right, now then the pullback operator with the inverse map is a solution operator on the product space, acts by composition on the space of functions, and by composition. And by composition times their Jacobian determinant on the space of densities. Alright, so we can also consider active invection equations where the kind of transported field interacts dynamically with the velocity field. Prototypical example is the induction of the vorticity 2 form here for Euler's equations. And the kind of functional form of its evolution is. Evolution is dictated by the dimension of the manifold. So in 2D, we can associate its evolution with the transport vorticity scalar field. And in 3D, we have the vorticity vector field with its additional term in front, which accounts for the vortex stretching term. Right. Okay, so we want to compute the inverse map, the numerical method that we do, that we use. That we do, that we use to do so is called the characteristic mapping method. This is a semi-Lagrangian method developed by my supervisor and collaborators and students throughout the years. It has successfully been applied, I'll show these references at the end, for linear invection and for Euler's equations and recently also to Vlasov-Poisson. And so, to just kind of summarize the conventional STEMI-Lagrangian method here, we have time steps along the We have time steps along the vertical, grid points along the horizontal. If we want to compute the evolution of some transported scalar field phi, we want to know its value at a grid point on a later time step, we can integrate backwards along the characteristics of the velocity field to this red x here, which is the departure point or the foot point. And then we evaluate the solution at this point. This point. Now we can see kind of that in general, this point will not land on a grid point. So this value must be interpolated for it. And the effect of repeated interpolation will kind of degrade fine-scale features developing the solution. Right, so this is kind of one of the impetus for the initial developments of the CM method is to rather than evolve and interpolate this scalar field, you can simply compute this entire deformation map and then transport any quantity. And then transport any quantity via composition. Kind of conveniently, we can directly apply the semi-Lagrangian method to the inverse map since each component satisfies any vector equation. All right. So to kind of put this a little bit more concretely, we have that we can approximate the inverse map with some mapping of the domain, which we can evaluate everywhere in space. And this induces a functional discretization. A functional discretization of the composition operator, yielding a pointwise operation on the space of functions. So, this kind of allows us to transport collections of quantities simply by point evaluation. And importantly, the regularity of the function that we're transporting kind of bears no constraint on its evolution. It's really just the regularity of the velocity field. Right, so this can kind of be amply demonstrated with this. Amply demonstrated with this transport of a fractal set here. So, this is one of these test cases where it deforms, rotates, comes back to itself, and you're meant to compare the initial condition to the final integration for the solution. So this is what we can do. And since we compute a map that you can evaluate everywhere in space, you can kind of zoom in on the solution to be able to compare the two. Right, and so this is what we do. So, on the top is the initial condition, the bottom is the numerical solution. We see as we zoom in to a window width of about 10 to the negative 6 here, we observe a small drift in the solution, or maybe a slight deformation. However, there's no loss of line scale features. Now, this can be associated with a kind of notion of constant. With a kind of notion of conservation that we observe with the numerical method. So, to explain this, we can consider some k-dimensional surface in the manifold and the image of the surface under the forward map. And the Lie objection equation here can be written in integral form as this kind of conservation law. What we see is simply by a change of variables, By a change of variables or a numerical computed f, we have this numerical form of conservation. So, importantly, that if s is the entire manifold and we compute the solution by pullback, that we have conservation of kind of globally conserved quantities simply by a change of variables. However, if this is some kind of local quantity, then we have to accept that there might be the same total mass, but There might be the same total mass, but there's an error in where the set has evolved. So we call this error to be effective in nature in the sense that there exists some diffeomorphism which transports our exact solution into the numerical one, or vice versa. We can actually look at this a little bit more geometrically as well, too. So if we say that we, by discretizing, By discretizing the pullback action rather than the infected quantity directly, this gives us a means of constraining the evolution to this orbit space here, in which the solution is also found. And this is related to kind of preserving a relabeling symmetry of the dynamics, which I'll get back to. Alright, so being able to kind of transport fine-scale features is not the only thing that's going to be able to garner high resolution. Only thing that's going to be able to garner high resolution when it also needs to be able to capture kind of dynamically generated fine-scale features. And we could do this, and this is kind of what the relation of this discretization is to, say, deep learning, is that we, as a backward flow, we can decompose the inverse map as a composition of sub-interval flows, where each of these sub-interval flows satisfies. Each of these sub-integral flows satisfies an advection equation starting from the identity. And we utilize this property as actually a semi-discretization in time. So now if we kind of introduce this generic spatial discretization of C1 maps, so this property being we want to be able to evaluate the map everywhere in space, and C1 ensures that we have a well-defined pullback operation. That we have a well-defined pullback operation, then we have that our kind of numerical approximation lies within this composite discretization here. And yeah, so the kind of use of this discretization allows us to decompose some this like complex multi-scale deformation that could be generated over time into a composition of kind of simpler and hence more accurately computed deformation maps. Formation maps. Alright, so notably here, the approximation space is kind of allowed to grow adaptively as the flow generates finer scale features. However, the degrees of freedom only grow linearly. Right, so one aspect that we'd like to be able to identify is the kind of band limit of this discretization. And we want to relate this kind of composite. Want to relate this kind of composite discretization to some sort of known spatial discretization. So we can relate the kind of resolution properties here. All right, so we'll just kind of, there's no theorem involved, but we can use kind of a simple heuristic argument with the composition of global polynomials. And the argument ends up just being that if you have, you know, m nth degree polynomials and you compose them. Degree polynomials, and you compose them together, you'll have a polynomial of degree n to the power of n. But to be more concrete, we can consider spherical harmonics here, since we're working on a sphere. And if we take this kind of hypothetical discretization space, so we consider the map as an embedding from S2 into R3, and then we restrict the codomain to To map back onto the sphere again via this radial projection. Then we can consider kind of approximating each component of the map as a spherical harmonic up to degree L. And we have that this m times composed space will contain some frequencies up to degree L to the power of m. Right, so and it kind of lies in this larger space here. And then And then, by using a sampling theorem of McKuna and Violet, this tells us that an exact band-limited approximation in kind of each of these spaces would require L to the power of 2m degrees of freedom in the larger ambient space, but however only m times L squared degrees of freedom in this reduced composite space. So we refer to this as a kind of exponential resolution using only a linear increase. Using only a linear increase in the degrees of freedom. All right, in practice, however, we actually use local polynomial splines as a spatial discretization. And this same argument becomes a little bit more complicated in this setting. So, yeah, we use a kind of Hermute interpolation operator defined by a Defined by a collection of linear functionals, which are just evaluation and evaluation of the derivative at some grid points defining a discretization of the domain. And then the kind of algorithm proceeds as follows. So to compute one of these sub-interval flows over a sequence of time steps within the remapping interval, we first transport the map value and derivative information. Value and derivative information using some explicit numerical integration scheme backwards in time. We then evaluate the map from the previous iterations at these points, and then we project onto an interpolation space again. Then we kind of iterate one and two until some sort of remapping criterion, which characterizes the kind of extent of deformation of one of these maps, is fulfilled. Of one of these maps is fulfilled, we store these maps in memory and then we restart this process from the identity. Right, and just to reiterate: when we want to compute this transport scalar field under the velocity, we compose through all of these maps and then evaluate the initial condition. All right, so just a note on the accuracy of the method. In the L infinity norm here, The L infinity norm here, we can say that if we use an integration scheme of local truncation error s plus 1 and interpolation operator with accuracy h to the k plus 1. And using remapping step sizes delta tau, we can bound the area as follows. So it has global accuracy in time, delta t to the s, and in space it's h to the s. And in space, it's h to the power of k, where the kind of spatial truncation error is reduced by these remapping steps since we're computing from the identity. So now that we have this kind of tool for diffeomorphism approximation, we'd like to start studying some of the geometry of flows of diffeomorphisms. And this is kind of And this is kind of with the hope of understanding some of their global properties and relating this to this type of continent-shaped formation. So, the research area that we've been interested in is called geometric hydrodynamics. This is a beautiful field of mathematics which relates infinite-dimensional geometry with fluid mechanics and some other geometric structures involved in optimal mass transport and shape analysis as well. Transport and shape analysis, as Mylan and I talked about yesterday. A kind of seminal work in this field is this paper from Arnold in 1966, who showed that there is a correspondence between geodesics of the L2 metric, restricted to the space of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms here, and solutions of Euler's equations. So, Arnaud actually gave a kind of more general framework for the study of invariant metrics. The study of invariant metrics on possibly infinite-dimensional Lie groups and their geodesics. And something I'd like to just kind of explain here and indicate some of the kind of geometric properties that we're looking to preserve with a numerical method. All right, so proceeds by considering a space of diffeomorphisms, which I'll call diff, as an infinite-dimensional Lie group with the action of composition. Composition. The tangent space at some element is given as follows. So, where we can think of elements of the tangent space as simply the translation under this element phi epsilon vector field. Actually, at the identity, we recover the space of vector fields. And together with the Jacobi-Lie bracket on vector fields. Fields. This space is the rightly algebra of diff, and the associated adjunct actions are given as follows. Right, so now we can define a dual space to the Lie algebra, which is given by space of one forms product with densities. And the pairing here is simply given by the kind of L2 inner product of the Inner product of the one form of the vector field integrated against the density. One then defines an energy defined by this inner product on the Lie algebra, which is kind of defined in terms of this inertia operator, which maps from the algebra to its dual. And this is alluding to the analogy with classical mechanics here. It's called an image operator. Operator. And this is typically taken to be some, I guess, self-adjoint elliptic differential operator. Then what you can do is you extend this inner product to the rest of the group via write translation as follows. And this defines a Riemannian metric over the whole space. And through this construction, we can study kind of geodesics of this metric. However, However, by this kind of symmetry endowed, by this rate invariance, we can reduce the second-order geodesic equation into simply a first-order equation on the dual of the Lie algebra. So this is given by this equation here for the momentum, which we call AU. And this is commonly referred to as an Euler-Arnold equation. Euler-Arnold equation. However, it's an example of the Euler-Point diary equation. If anyone's familiar with those, I'm sure we are. Right, so what this gives you is you can solve this kind of nonlinear PDE here and then reconstruct the geodesics by simply solving this ODV. Now, associated with this right invariance, which is also referred to as a relabeling symmetry. Referred to as a relabeling symmetry since it's with respect to the action of diffeomorphisms. The associated conserved quantity for the variational principle is momentum. And so we can actually rewrite this equation in this form here on the left as a statement of conservation of momentum. So what we end up with kind of by applying an identity here is that the momentum Here is that the momentum actually evolves under what's called the coadjoint action of the inverse map as acting on the initial condition. This is similar to the case of the advection. So an alternative kind of symmetry reduced form here can be written as this nonlinear advection equation for the inverse map rather than this first-order equation for the momentum. And so the evolution is kind of constrained in some sense to this orbit space. And we view this as kind of one of the essential geometric properties that we look to preserve with the numerical method is to constrain the evolution of this orbit space. It's related to a relabeling symmetry of the dynamics. So now just to kind of relate this. Just to kind of relate this to the case of Euler's equations. So, for Euler's equations, the configuration space is the space of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, as mentioned before. The Lie algebra is given by this space of divergent sweet vector fields. And its dual space is given by a space of one forms, modulo, exact forms. Where this quotienting operation is to ensure that you have non-degeneracy in the pairing, simply a statement that divergence-free vector fields are L2 orthogonal to gradient vector fields. Okay, so then the inertia operator can be seen as the assignment of this divergence-free vector field to the coset. Euler's equations can then be. Euler's equations can then be written in this form here. So these are momentum elements. And the momentum is simply just Lie vector. And the coad joint operator restricted to the space of volume preserving diffeomorphisms is given by the pullback. So we can write the evolution of the momentum as follows. As follows, and actually, on a simply connected manifold, this actually just recovers the transport of the velocity. Right, and then to recover the velocity field again, we must invert the inertia operator, which just ends up being something like the Le Ray projection onto divergence-free vector fields. Right, so for 2D ideal So for 2D, ideal fluid flow is known to possess an infinite set of conserved quantities in the form of these Casimir functionals, here, which are like just powers of the vorticity. The Casimirs are actually invariant with respect to the co-adjoint action, which we can see by this simple calculation, which also uses the volume-preserving property. Right, so they're actually conserved along co-adjoint orbits. So that means that if we approximate the inverse map with some volume-preserving diffeomorphism, then the approximated vorticity or momentum remains within the co-adjoint orbit, and this gives us a means of conserving the Casimirs. So, this idea of kind of evolving the momentum using Evolving the momentum using the coad joint action. It's actually not a new idea, and it has been advocated for in a finite-dimensional setting by Engel and Feldenson, and previously also by Marzman, Pukarski, and Schroller. So, I'd like to just preface actually the approximation technique that we use doesn't preserve this property strictly since we don't approximate. Strictly, since we don't approximate with a volume-preserving diffeomorphism, but it still uses this ablation strategy. All right, so to then explain the algorithm for nonlinear induction here, so in the case of geodesics of write-in variant metrics on diff, so we first take our composition of maps. Composition of maps. We compute a momentum element through the coadjoint operation on the initial momentum. We then approximately invert the inertia operator for the velocity field. And then using the previous, say, p time steps for the velocity field, we then extrapolate it in time. And then using the linear vetching algorithm, we compute the inverse. We compute the inverse map on the next iteration and then iterate. So the only difference here is that this requires some sort of elliptic solver to relate the momentum and velocity field and then an extension in time through the velocity. Alright. So we'll consider the application of this algorithm to the motion of an ideal incomparable. To the motion of an ideal incompressible fluid on a rotating sphere. The dynamics here are described by what's called the barotropic vorticity equations. And F here is called the planetary vorticity equations. Can you explain again to point number three? So from the U to the next update of the file, what are you doing there? So, well, we only have the Well, we only have the velocity field up to Tn, and then we want to compute the map up to Tn plus 1. So we use the previous time step velocity fields, and then we construct a Lagrange interpolant in time, and we extend this in time. And then so this is our kind of time-dependent velocity field, which we can then just apply the linear ejection algorithm to. Thanks for your question. For your question. Alright, so these equations can be written in an alternative form for the inverse path as follows. Alright, so I'd like to just kind of, before showing some numerical examples here, I'd like to talk about some of the multi-scale properties involved. So we approximate the vorticity in space. However, we could consider hypothetically Could consider hypothetically expanding this quantity in terms of spherical harmonics to be able to kind of relate what's the type of support and frequency space that we're able to capture. And we'd expect that this actually scales like the number of compositions that we use here. However, during the elliptic solve, During the elliptic solve, simply just the Poisson equation, the velocity is truncated via sampling operation. So although the vorticity might contain exponentially fine scales, we only use some LU of these to drive the evolution. The scales beyond this are simply passively affected by the flow. However, there is a possible mechanism for feedback from the small scales into the large ones. So, if we consider kind of taking one other time step and then projecting on a spherical harmonic of degree L prime, it's not completely obvious to me that this will be non-zero for these L's which are greater than L prime. So, if anyone has some ideas to show. Has some ideas to show something like this, I'd be happy to talk about it. And I think one way of kind of investigating this would be to look at how the composition acts and arranges the energy and frequency space. And I know it acts by a, as, can be represented as a Fourier integral operator, but these are kind of complicated mathematical objects to deal with. Right. Right, so some numerical examples for the barotropic vorticity equations. Thankfully, it's kind of one of these nonlinear PDEs which has some known exact solutions. So we use an interpolation scheme, which is third order, and RK3, which is then just kind of projected to. Which is then just kind of projected to restrict to the sphere. So we'd expect to see second order without the use of remapping. And this is exactly what we see. So we're evaluating the error in the vorticity for these known analytic solutions in the form of a Rosby-Horowitz wave and zonal flows. Right, and we see, and we're also evaluating the conservation of energy and at surface. Conservation of energy and utter P. So we see kind of second order for all of these quantities without the use of remapping. And with the kind of submap decomposition remapping, we see that this kind of gains an extra order of accuracy. And the convergence here is with respect to the refinement of the mesh and also the time steps. All right. Alright. So, now some actual numerical experiments. So, we wanted to be able to kind of showcase the ability of this method to capture these kind of multi-scale dynamics. So, I devised this test case here where it's like two two-stream instabilities that we've slightly perturbed. And then, right, so they'll kind of shed these vortices on each side. And eventually, both of those instabilities will kind of wrap. Both of those instabilities will kind of wrap up within each other and generate this really kind of complicated multi-scale evolution. Here, I'd like to just note that we used, I think, something like 100 map compositions, and the LU truncation for the velocity field was something like L equals 256. So, a relatively coarse grid used to evolve the vorticity here. Now, similarly to the case of the fractal set transport, we can evaluate the vorticity everywhere in space. So we can kind of zoom into the solution, see if we're actually retaining these sub-grid features. And this is what we see. We see that we're kind of able to capture these really dynamically generated fine scales at sub-grid resolution. All right, so one might say pretty pictures. Can we give some sort of quantitative evaluation on whether or not these scales that we observe that we're able to capture actually honor the physics? To do so, we consider these randomly initialized vorticity distributions and carried out the And I carried out the flow with kind of the same parameters as before. We can see here we're kind of able to capture this really long filamentary structure there. All right, so then what one can do is, so the flow is computed on sampling the vorticity up to some spherical harmonics of degree L256, and this is what the flow looks like. But since we can evaluate Flow looks like. But since we can evaluate this everywhere in space, we can kind of upsample the vorticity and see that there's these kind of finer scale features emerging. And what we can do is we can look at the energy spectrum here and compare this with what we'd expect the statistics to observe. So the KLB theory, Christian Leith Bachelor, predicts a kind of K minus 3. A kind of K minus 3, spherical harmonic space is L minus 3, forward cascade of energy. So, what we're plotting here is the energy spectrum in the first thousand modes here. And we see that there's, we reproduce this, this scaling. This is an averaging over time. Here is the error in the energy. I believe what's happening here is you I believe what what's happening here is you can actually see, since it's oscillating, you're seeing a kind of forward and backward flow of energy within these first thousand modes. And kind of one of the most striking features here is that as we upsample the solution up to L equal 4096, we see like a really kind of tight decay with the expected statistics there. Expected statistics there of L to the minus 3. Right, so this kind of indicates that we're able to resolve the forward energy cascade using a coarse rate. All right, and I just wanted to show here to conclude with some numerical experiments related to resolving also the inverse energy cascade. So, this is a non-rotating solution. Is a non-rotating solution. Here, what you'll see is the solution, so this L minus 3, L minus 5 is in green, and then L minus 1. So the solution will first exhibit this L minus 3 cascade as it transitions into turbulence. And then eventually it will hit this kind of noise floor here. And we see that there's a little And we see that there's this kind of emergence of these blob-like structures. And the emergence of four of them or three is also consistent with what's been observed in the literature. Right, so again, we can upsample the solution, and we see that the noise floor is decreasing as we upsample. So lastly, I wanted to show some of the effects of what happens when there's rotation involved. So these are two Rossby-Horritz waves, which have been slightly perturbed differently. And this is to show that, you know, kind of this long-term quasi-periodic behavior can be different based on the initial conditions. So yeah, both of the evolution, both of these vortices will kind of settle into some sort of quasi-periodic motion, which differs qualitatively. And then Just one last simulation to show. So these were vorticities which were kind of spread out through space, but the effect of rotation here can also, so if we consider this two-stream instability, the effect of rotation can kind of, I think this is a really interesting dynamical phenomenon, right? It really kind of contains a lot of the turbulence to maybe like half of the sphere here, but what's happening in the lower half. What's happening in the lower half doesn't exhibit the listed type of turbulent decay. Alright, so that's all that I wanted to show. So I think this approximation technique kind of offers some many interesting avenues for investigation. And we're actively working on extending the numerical method to incorporate other erected quantities. Reactive quantities considering its application to shape analysis and the LDDMM and also for Euler-Prancari equations and magnetohydrodynamics. We're also working on a kind of comprehensive analysis of the approximation properties and also an operator learning strategy for diffeomorphism approximation, which really exploits this composite discretization. Alright, so to summarize, we introduced the characteristic mapping method for flow map approximation. This utilizes a spatio-temporal discretization, which can garner some exponential resolution without relying on a highly resolved mesh. We're able to kind of preserve some relabeling symmetry for infected quantities and And in the case of non-linear invection, the principle here is to be able to approximate this co-adjoint action rather than the momentum directly. And finally, this enables upsampling of the solution with the correct statistics at subgrid scales and a potentially powerful tool to study long-term behavior of 2D territories. Some other different Thank you. We've got a minute or two if anybody wants to ask any questions. This is really interesting. I'm curious, you know, what happens when you make a navigator instead of Euler? Added the viscous diffusion. At a tiny amount. So in that case, because the vorticity won't be exactly Because the vorticity won't be exactly Lieutenant, you know, you have this viscosity term, so you don't get a direct reconstruction of the velocity from the inverse map. So we can't directly apply the method, but there's some ideas like there's these techniques developed for an analytic solution technique developed by Peter Constantine, which considers kind of stochastic paths, right, and you can average over them. And you can average over them. So that might be my technique to apply the method for Navier strokes. I was wondering, and we talked a little bit about this before, also, but if you compare to the approach of Modina and Libiani, so they do something quite differently, but I think they also preserve the semi-discretized version of the quadrant or this probably. But then they are also. But then they also they are also able to to kind of uh get the there is a symplectic form on the quadjoint orbits and and they make also the their approximations to be selective with respect to this particular form. Is that something that you message can do or maybe yeah hopefully maybe by the design of other kind of specialized integrators because I know they had that used a special integrator to isospectral. Integrator to isospectral integrators, right, to be able to preserve this. This is definitely something that we should look into and kind of evaluate these conservation properties a little bit more rigorously. Very simple question. So if you compare to some other, not the modines, but some other technique that is doing the same sort of simulations, would you be? Sort of simulations. Would they be able to do the same structures that you're seeing and the cost? Not at the same computational cost and using way, way higher degrees of freedom to be able to capture these types of processes. These are relatively cheap simulations to run for the extent of the scales that are involved. What do we think? What do we think Seth one more time?
