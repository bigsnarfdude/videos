In our tour of the star around Thomas and the collaboration graph. Oh yeah, that was the theme of that. We're going to get a talk from Petrus Fair, who's going to tell us about conjugation in plenty of isology groups. Thank you, Henry, for the wonderful introduction. So, Anne is in the audience. She's going to answer all the difficult questions. I'm happy to be here and talk about this project. We've recently. And talk about this project we've recently finished and put a pair of papers on the archive. And I would really like to thank the organizers for putting together this conference and inviting me to this wonderful place. Okay, so let's get going with conjugation in Euclidean isometry groups. And I want to quickly tell you how we came up with this question, or how we actually ended up looking at this. Namely, a bunch of years back, we were doing way more complicated things on affine Dinidusi varieties. Where we constructed and computed folded galleries using buildings and cops of complexes. And we were faced with the following task. So we're looking at these triangles here in the equilateral triangle of the plane, which is saying we're looking at certain specific elements in an affine copster to pool, and we wanted to find a fault. A folding of this blue gallery up there, which ends in a conjugate of the element we started with. And we also needed to find an element that actually does the trick. So an element which helps us conjugate the thing to its conjugate. So we needed to not only locate where the conjugates are, we also needed to find the elements. Needed to find the elements that do the trick. Okay, so we really needed for these specific things called standard representatives of Newton points to locate the contribution class in the Coxberg complex. So what do you do? You have to do something, you try and figure out what other people did on that topic and see whether they have something that helps you that is fulfilling your task. That's fulfilling your task. So we looked at the literature, we found a bunch of things on conjugation in finite via groups. This would definitely not help us because we're dealing with the thing in an alpha-in-copseter group. There is some literature on conjugacy classes of involutions. However, these standard representatives of Newton points, whatever they are, they weren't involutions. This would help us either. So you keep looking, you find lots of complicated. You find lots of complicated work on minimal length representatives and the effect of cyclic shifts, is just conjugating by a single generator of your coxeter group, essentially, in both finite coxeter groups and then also later work on affine coxeter groups. But this didn't really help us either because we really needed to find them in the coxeter complex. We needed a geometric understanding of where Understanding of where these things are and not just the algorithm but how to produce them. And then there's a bunch of descriptions of centralizers in various special cases, again with an emphasis on the finite case, which wouldn't help us finding these conjugated elements. So we had to do things ourselves and actually succeeded. So this is the picture of Russia. Of roughly the conjugacy class of this blue element we started with. And all the conjugate elements sit along this blue line, along this green line, and along this pink line. And what these strips on the outside mean, I'll tell you later. So mathematicians are good in delayed gratification. If you wait 20 minutes, you'll burn these strips. Okay, so we were actually able for this specific class. For this specific class of elements to figure out how the contrasty class looks like. So, where is the identity chamber? The identity, yeah, that's a very good question. The identity chamber is here in this triangle of lines sits around the identity chamber. And my pointer, if the pointer is not working, I hope that I think. So, this is the original identity, and then this is some. And then this is some shift of half-sum of positive roots for those who know what I'm speaking about, and then a single two. So here's the question we then ask ourselves. Can we actually, for an arbitrary element x, in a, and I should have said affine cops at find geometric descriptions Geometric descriptions of both its conjugacy class, namely all elements which are conjugated to it, and as well for these kind of sets which we call co-conjugation sets, because they sort of solve the co-problem, namely you fix an x and you take a y in its conjugacy class, then you want to figure out which are the elements in your copsetomou that do conjugate the given x. That do conjugate the given x to z. Okay, so if x equals z, maybe I'm thinking this is just a centralizer of x. Okay, but really I want to emphasize again we want a geometric description, right? Not just an algorithm that computes this. All right, so very quick revision of the groups we're looking at. We're dealing with affine coccidor groups. With affine coxidogroups, which are in dimension to these three irreducible cases, and we can restrict ourselves to the irreducible case because the contribution behaves quite well with respect to the decomposition. So we're dealing with discrete subgroups of the full isometry group of the Euclidean space e to the n, which are generated by reflections on the faces of a complex syntax, compact simplex. Okay, so you can use this definition in our dimension. Definition in all dimensions. And these groups come with a lot of structure. So, first, they split as a semi-direct product between a translation group T and some finite coxeter group. And we've already seen this in the room's talk right before the coffee break. So, again, the origin is here. The translations are all these indicated by these black dots, which together. Dots which together form the co-root lattice, and we get a translation for every vertex in the co-root lattice, which translates our identity element, which is this one, to a bunch of translation elements in the plane. And then the stabilizer of the origin is just the finite vibroup of the same type. And you can write, in fact, every element in your affine Coxeter group as such. Fine-Cox-Educoup as such a product. You translate by something in the cogroup lattice and you multiply it with a spherical element in the corresponding finite concentration. So this shape of all the elements will really play an important role, and just that everybody's on the same page of how conjugation works on this semi-direct product theme. If we might If we multi we need to understand what happens if you multiply on the left, especially with a little thing in your spherical constant, okay? So and then you just have to realize that you can push this past the translation element, you get a new translation element which translates by a different vertex in your cohort lattice, and the spherical part also changes. It's the spherical conjugate. Sorry, it's a U minor, U inverse is in U. Here on the right. Okay, that's the conjugation action on these airplane copy groups. And here's a first lemma we needed to prove in order to tackle this question about that. So you take an element in your affine corpuscular group W, let's call it X. As I said, it's the product of a translation. As I said, it's the product of a translation t to the lambda times an element little w, where little w is in the spherical coxeter group. And then the whole conjugacy class in the entire affine cockseter group ends up sitting in the union over the spherical concentric group, which is nice because this is a finite union of things, of these sets over here. They're translates of the conjugate. Translates of the conjugated circle piece with the translation in a set we can determine, namely this what we used to call transverse space t, which depends on x, of course, is just the lambda shift, where lambda is one of these black dots in the cool wood lattice of the image of the identity minus this error element on entirely to the elements. Okay, so this is a way of Okay, so this is a way of sort of locating where the conjugacy class ends up. And we can actually prove this number, it's not so hard. You essentially sit down and do a little bit of linear algebra computations. You take another y, which is of a similar shape, translation times the spherical element, and you just compute what it does. If you contribute. What it does. If you contribute x by y. Okay, so you have to write out all these elements. t to the mu is the y again, take its inverse here, and then push it to the other side in order to have the form again a translation type. So it's very good thing. And then you have to check what this thing will be here. Unfortunately, my light blue highlighting doesn't show up really well. So the mu. Really well. So the μ together with the uw inverse μ over there, you can show that this is actually in μ times this image. I would claim quite truth. One thing we observed is that this proof does not use that the group we're looking at is a Coxeter book, right? Book, right? So it's just a little bit of linear algebra, maybe with coefficients and the integers, because we have to pay attention to this code that is thing. So it's very natural to ask whether the thing we're actually seeing holds in a more general setting. Going to focus on next. We expand the setting. We expand the setting and expand our view and look at split subgroups of the full isometry group. So let's go to the lemma now again. So what did we use? It was essential that we could write an element that way, right? As a translation times something squared. This is exactly what we also see in the split subgroup. In the split subgroups of the full isometric groups, one of those later. But again, we're asking the same question. We still want geometric descriptions of these two things, conjugacy classes and these co-conjugations. But now in a much wider class of groups. Okay, so the good thing is the full isometry group splits the way we want, right? So the entire isometry group is decomposed asymmetry. Is decomposes as a semi-direct product of translations and things that stabilize the origin. Okay, that's great. This is exactly what the COPSATRA groups do. And we can look at subgroups of G which have the same behavior. Okay, and I say such a subgroup, H in the Fourier isometry group splits if we can write it as a semi-direct product of Direct product of the translations in H and some group H0 which stabilizes the origin and hence is a subgroup of O. In other words, TH is T, which is the full group of translation intersected the group H we're looking at, and H0 is the intersection. This does not always hold. So, there are, for example, a couple of paper groups. Of wall paper groups which do split, others don't. Okay, so it's kind of easy to come up with examples both ways. But we are interested in the ones that split. Crystallographic groups come into play here. Just to remind you, a subgroup of the full isometry group is crystallographic if it's both discrete and active, co-compacting of the two here. And this leads us to a couple of examples. Leads us to a couple of examples. Okay, of course, affine cocceta groups, they're still in the game, right? They're split, they're also post-tenographic, which is not important for us, but they are of this kind, that they split as a translation group. And a subgroup of ON, the translation group is the translations by the colon lattice, and the subgroup of ON is the finite corresponding type. Corresponding type. As I said, some wallpaper books do. There's 17 altogether, 13 of which do split. Crystallographic groups are a finite index in a split crystallographic group, so it's also interesting to look at graphic groups. And then those have a connection with oxidative groups again. So in dimension 2 and 3, every such group is sub. Three, every such group is subgroup of a coxider group, actually, but in dimension four that they want. The four of the 17 wallpaper groups that don't split, is there a common obstruction between them, or is it just kind of... You just check this list and yeah, I don't see a pattern there. All right, so here this class is definitely larger than the class of Hautzita group, and it involves a bunch of nice Involves a bunch of nice books and formats. The main point of this slide. Okay, let me now introduce to you the two main characters which will help us characterize both the conjugacy classes and the co-conjugation sets, namely move sets and fixed sets. And you're nodding, and I kind of expected that. I kind of expected that. So the move set, let's go slow, we'll have examples on the next slide. The move set of an element G, say in the full isometric group, is a set of points in the Euclidean space. It's all points by which something is moved, or in other words, where you can find a different point Q such that the G image of Q is actually the Q is actually the P transit Q. So it's those vectors by which you can do something. There's a more linear algebra way of saying this, namely the image of the G minus the But to have this geometric viewpoint in your head really helps. And then complementary to that, there's the fixed. There's the fixed set. Well, that's kind of obvious, it's all much very fixed. Or, in other words, this is the kernel of the same element. Okay, remember your linear proposed, which is telling you that if this thing you're looking at is in O, then actually the whole space splits, they're perpendicular, and one easily computes that if you're not an ON, but Not an ON, but a translation times something in ON, then the move space is actually just a translate of the move space of this character piece. First example I want to look at because it's the easiest to see what's going on with the smooth space is if you take a reflection along a hyperplane and the hyperplane Then I want to look at is this one over here. And this is, of course, the fixed space of the reflection on it. And the move space is just the line perpendicular to this hyperplane. Because if you have any point, say this one, off of the hyperplane, and you reflect, you end up at a point, well, on the other side, right? But the vector that takes you there is probably So you get this whole green line, or in general, a linear subspace. If your thing is an O n, which this particular reflection I'm looking at here is, so that the move space for the O n elements just end up being general subspaces. Any more involved example is this. Is this pink triangle up there? This represents an element in the affine coxeter group which is not an ON. It's a translation times a reflection where we can take the reflection as before. And the translation is the translation by lambda, which is the spirit of this positive. And then the move space, well, as I Well, as I told you, it's an easy little computation. It's just the lambda translate of the move space of the spherical piece, which is this pink line over there. So not all move spaces are linear subspaces. They can be affine subspaces. More examples, they can be trivial in the following two senses as well. Most spaces can just consist of a single point. Can just consist of a single point. This, for example, happens if you happen to be a translation, right? Exactly then, because then all that can happen is that you're translated by that vector, no surprise. Fixed point set is empty in this case. And then move space can also be everything. Just imagine a rotation around a vertex. And then the further away you get from that vertex, the further you move. So we have higher space or this prints at the cool lattice and the fixed set will be just the point this rotation space. Alright, so these spaces will actually be the main players in the characterization of the contributor class and the co-conjugation z, as we'll know. One first technical thing we have to do, because we're not always looking at the full isometry group, but a strict subgroup possibly, and especially for the Coxeter complex, Coxeter groups, sorry, at these subgroups with the discrete translation groups. We kind of want to also discretize the move space, all right, because Because not every element in this, say, green or pink line we've been seeing in the examples will actually appear as a translator because everything is done in a discrete way, right? The action of the F and post is discrete and we have to account for that. So, what we want to look at, if we're looking at a proper subgroup H, we want to look at this Look at this sort of lattice LH, at least in all this lattice, where we only take those lambda into account such that the translation is in our book, right? And nothing else will happen anyway if you let your book act, right? Then we define the analog of the move set, which we call the mod set, for reasons we will see in a second, to be the image of To be the image of h minus the identity times the spell h. Before we had the image of h minus i when you apply it to the entire OPN, and now I only want it to be applied. Properties, well, by definition it's contained in move space, right? So it must be some subset of. Right, so it must be some subset of the lines we've been seeing. It ends up being a submodule, the name of the LH, and then it shows the same behavior as the mode space did. If you apply it to a translation times a spherical thing, it's the translate of the mode space are also just straightforward computations used by definition and some basic. Here's a theorem which describes the shape of the conjugacy class in any split subgroup. Again, just to remind you, H is any split subgroup of the full isometry group, in particular the full isometry group itself. Any affine concept of group you might wish for, reduce for once. Our elements have this decomposition into translations times. Decomposition into translations times the part. And then we can say that the full contency class is simply the union over the, in the Coxeter case, finitely elements U in the circle and the Coxeter, where we apply all translates by the U image of these mod spaces to the U conjugate of this Hercule piece. So this gives us a nice, in case it's slightly different description of where you first transmit the input. This gives us a nice description only involving finite things, right? So for example, up here, we only need to understand essentially how conjugation in the finite Coxeter group works and how the smooth spaces of the elements in the finite Coxeter group look like, because we know for all the transitions. Like, because we know for all the translates, it's just the translator thoughts. Anne summarized the proof really well in her talk, so I just stole that from her. It really is an exercise, right? So, with the lemma we saw and the definitions I showed you, and knowing the result, you can do this other pitch. Let me show you how this also gives us a new How this also gives us a new algorithmic way of computing on the elements. And let me just explain it on this half of the statement and the other half. Okay, so we want this union over these kind of things. In here, we see all the mod space translates of H. Say H is this big icon up here. First thing we have to do is we have to compute this mod. We have to do is we have to compute this mod space, which in this particular example ends up being these green dots over here. Then we have to translate the age, namely this pink alcohol here, by all these green dots, which gives us all the alcohol sitting in the same local direction at the pink dots. And then we have to rotate those. And then we have to rotate those by applying the spherical conjugation, right? And this is a finite, finitely many steps. Gives you one way. And the other formulation on the right-hand side gives you a similar way. You first translate and then, sorry, where you first take the spherical conjugates and then translate all of them by the way, spectrum into of the proximities. Alright, so I'll say that again. Alright, so let's say that again. Take all those translates, and then we conjugate them around. And those are the three lines we've been seeing on the picture I showed you earlier. Here's two more examples how this can end up looking. This picture in the middle is the exact analog of the picture on the left in the full isometry. Euclidean 2 space. Namely, we start with the glide reflection, what this induction was. And the move space, now the mod space is the same as the move space if we're looking at the full isometric move. It's one of these lines here going through a point which is essentially the analog of this lambda over here. You should think of the origin sitting here in the middle. But now you have to rotate around with four. But now you have to rotate around with full ON, okay? And that's how this circle shape forms. And the conjugacy class sits somehow outside the circle of formed by lambda. And really you should think of this triangle on the left as a discretized version of the circle here in the middle, because of the discreteness of the spherical copset of group. You do not see all of the lines. And you do not see all of the lines tangent to the circle, but only those three and the full coordinates-class circle somehow sits as the maximum circle you can put inside this triangle centered around the origin. And then on the right-hand side, here's an example of several controversy classes in type A22. In type A2 tilde, where we take a rotation and translate it by some lambda, and then anything that has the same color is in the same contradicting class. So here we have several classes of various different elements. As you can see here, the move space will be top-dimensional, and this mod space ends up being a discrete space. Space ends up being a discrete sub-lattice of the point lattice sitting inside the plane here, but explicitly by the same fortune. Okay, so this kind of alter shows you that these various cases for the move space, which can be either full-dimensional, trivial, or of proper sub-dimension, they actually do show up. So the right-hand side would be one where the move space of the spherical piece is the target. The spherical piece is the entire plane, and you actually get some interesting structure because of the discreteness of the properties. One more remark before I go to the next slide, otherwise it won't make much sense. So, what we see here, or if you back here, maybe spices. So, what we see here is that we have this U and What we see here is that we have this union over the elements in the spherical group, and then these sets here in the middle they kind of always look the same, right? It's just a matter of which you can take. And I want to call these pieces components and the one where you is the identity, I want to call this compiece. So actually the conjugacy class as a whole is a union of components. Components. And these components they carry a little bit more structure. So, one thing we prove, for example, is that the conjugation action of the circle piece of the symmetric product on entire group induces the transitive actions on these components, which is not how much a surprise because we take the lu normal in there. And then the conjugation action on the translation bit actually induces a transitive action all. Induces a transitive action on each one of the components. So this nice compatibility behavior here with this different message. Okay, I want to quickly say something about the second question, namely how to find specific y's that conjugate a given x to a given z in its conjugacy class. Now that we know where to find Now that we know where to find the conjugate elements, we also want to know how to get there. And yeah, this is as a reminder of the set. The order matters here, unfortunately, right? So if you want to go from H to H prime, it's different elements than the ones that take a minute. Here's the characterization of that. It's not as clean, but almost. So we take two elements. So we take two elements, again written as translation times spherical piece and h times h prime, and both the translation and the spherical piece get fines. Then we can first solve the problem in the spherical group, which especially in the Coxinter case is much easier because it's finite, and find out which elements conjugate the spherical group. Elements conjugate the spherical part of H to the spherical part of H'. And then there exists a subset we can actually explicitly describe, but it's involved. I don't want to write it down on this slide. So that this second piece of the equal sign somehow jumped up. So the co-conjugation set is equal to the disjoint union of all the U's. Of all the use in this subset where you apply the fixed translate of the translation types. Or in other words, if you want to get from H to H prime, you have to pick something that sits perpendicular to the move space of the translation part of your target. Okay. Okay, so fixed H0 prime, this is the thing where I want to end up in when I complicate. And this fixed space of this spherical piece sits perpendicular to the move space. And this is where I have to look for my complicating elements. Yeah, so there's explicit definitions of this new down here, which involve a little bit of algebra. Exercise again, a little bit more difficult than the first exercise. We now have to actually use, but the few spaces is the same as our garner. Computations get a little longer, but again, this is not too important too. Here's a wallpaper example. This is the group CMM, also known as two star two two, if I'm not mistaken. So it has So it has two perpendicular glide reflections. I have to look it up. It has a error. I'm just drawing the thing. I never can remember how to say it. So you take a grid. Those are actual reflection hyperplanes. And you have glide reflection axes going here in the middle. In the middle. And then you have centers of rotations of order two in all those places. Intersection of actual reflection microplanes. And then also in the centers here, which is the intersection of the light reflection axis. Let me just draw the fundamental domain. Let me just draw the fundamental domain and you will probably see what I mean. That's four shapes. So the actual fundamental domain is this piece, and it comes oriented. That's very fundamental to name. And this is this triangle here, the triangles we see over there. Didn't bother putting all the glide reflection. Putting all the glide reflection axis in. It just shows the reflection hyperplates. So up here, same colour means same conjugacy class, and you again can sort of see that they sit nicely along these smooth spaces. Down here, I've picked one of them, which is the red one, and perpendicular to it is the co-contribution set, which takes Set which takes this element to here using the formulas we have in our theories. Different example, the one from the beginning. So again, same color means same conjugacy class. All the purple ones are conjugate, all the blue ones are conjugate, etc. So you can really see if you apply a translation and don't change the spherical plan. And don't change the spherical piece. Really, the spherical piece kind of dominates where things are going, namely, the smooth space directions. It's just a matter of how far away are you from the origin. This is dictated by the translation part of the element you're looking at. And then again, going from one element x, which is this one probably, to one up here in the same contrasty class, but sitting on a rotated version. Sitting on a rotated version of your move space, you have to be perpendicular to the move space of the target, which is these blue and greenish-looking triangles. Those are the co-conjugation elements. Those are all the ones that take you from x to x prime in this picture on the right hand side. This is where we started, right? Now you kind of know already what these strips mean. Kind of know already what these strips mean. There are the places where you have to look for the pro-conjugated lines. Namely, in this particular picture, everything's centered around this blue guy here. If you want to stay here, which means you're in the centralizer, everything will end up in this blue strip. And then if you want to go to a different place, you have to look in the strip that has the corresponding color. So, for example, again, So, for example, again, if we want to go up here, we need to look into this horizontal stream that has the pink color, and then we have to adjust the spherical direction, which is exactly what we did on the right over there. Horizontal elements, horizontal elements, they take you up here. The ones in these green strips take you up here. The ones in these green strips take you down here and the ones keeping down here were the main two elements. I have one minute and let me use it to let me summarize what we found so far. We can describe geometrically both the contributors and the co-contribution sets. And the co-contribution sets. Our theorems give algorithms to compute them both. Let me go down super quickly, the terrible rabbit hole. If you want to do it fully in the coxatloop space, you also have to determine this mod set. Remember that this was the discretized version of your move space? Okay, and there's one problem. Sometimes you see the entire Entire cone lattice appearing, and sometimes there's jumps. So, here there's holes in between in the wood space, and you kind of have to detect these holes. You have to figure out whether you're actually dealing with everything in the intersection here, to be equality, or whether you're from a subset. We call this property filling, say it fills the move space if it's actually. Space, if it's actually the intersection of the covert lattice with the Morph space, and say it doesn't fit, if you're a proper subset, which definitely does appear. So, you want to classify, right? You want to know which elements do fill and which don't. We can. Here's the theorem. And then you would do a lot of Z linear algebra, prove a bunch of horribly complicated theorems type. But you actually are able to classify an explicit justification for the poster case of when this portion is actually how it's looking and when we're looking at film. Thanks, Cora, for your touch. Questions? For this last part, can you do the exceptional cases? Yeah, using Sage, essentially. Yeah, it's in a spherical group anyway, right? You're dealing with... Let me just go back. You're dealing with a spherical bit because for the for any affine one it's a translate anyway. So you it's a finite problem. And in the exceptional types the we told them. Exceptional types with all the pushforce. There's more to it. These five slides summarize like 100 pages of math, which we're happy to talk about, but not now. That's for sure, yeah. It's on the archive, so if you're really interested, it involves lots of smooth normal form computations, lots of Z linear algebra, I would show. Of say linear algebra, which is yeah, this I would like to know. You would be probably the right person to ask. Or John McCammon. He has versions of spaces for hyperbolic ones. And I would hope that one can use those to generalize at least some of the things.
