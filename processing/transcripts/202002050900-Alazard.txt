Good evening. It's a great pleasure to start today again. So, first speaker of the day will be Toma Alaza. And since it's secretive, you will explain us what the title is. Okay, my title is Identities and Propies. Errorshaw equation. What I would like to explain is how to use methods developed to study water waves, in particular the Hamiltonian properties, some dispersive properties to study the Lossau equation. So the common setting between water wave and electric equation is the following. We want to study the dynamics of the interface separating air and the perfect incompressible ship. So we are considering a fluid domain which is time dependent and at a given time t it is of that form. My assumption, this is a set of points x and y in the torus T n times R such that Y such that y is smaller than h of tx for some function h we denote by sigma of t the boundary of omega and this is the free surface okay so what are the notation x is a horizontal space variable. Y is a vertical one. And you determine the vertical axis. There is a vertical axis because we are taking into account the restoring force of gravity. Okay, another notation. We denote by Nabla. We denote by nabla the derivative with respect to x by nabla xy the full gradient. Given a function f, which is a function of t, x, and y, we use this short notation for the evaluation of f on the free surface. So now what are the unknown of the problem? We have H, the elevation, the free surface elevation. We will need also the velocity defined in the field domain with value in Rn plus 1. This is a vector field. And the pressure. The equation there are four equations. Firstly, an equation for which describes the dynamics of the interface. This equation states that the normal The normal velocity of the freezer phase, the normal velocity of the free surface coincides with the normal component of the fluid velocity on the fluid surface. What does it mean? In our case, where the fluid surface is a graph, it means simply that simply that dt of h is equal to the square root of 1 plus gradient h square times v dot n. Second set of equations is about the velocity field. We assume that it is incompressible and irrotational. It means that the divergence of V is equal to zero, the curve of V is equal to zero, and this is equivalent to say that V is a gradient of some potential function phi, which is Armenic. A third equation is a balance of force forces. Here, we consider the simple case where P is constant on the free surface, and this constant can be chosen to be zero. Eventually, within an equation relating the velocity and the pressure, there are two different cakes. Another equation, dtv plus v gradient v plus gradient f p plus g y is equal to zero. is equal to zero or Darcy equation V plus gradient P plus Gy is equal to zero. If you consider the equations one, two, three, and this one, you have the water wave column. If you consider the same one, two, three plus the second one Plus the single choice, you have the initial equation. In this community, the water wave equations are well known, and you know that the linearized water wave problem writes dt square h plus modulus of d. Plus modulus of dh is equal to zero, where modulus of d is the square root of minus Laplace. This is a dispersive equation. Now, to go from water wave to LO show, you replace acceleration by velocity. You replace the time derivative by one. So here, if you replace one So here, if you replace one of these two time derivatives by one, you obtain the linearized Ella Shaw equation dth plus modulus of dxh is equal to zero. This is a parabolic equation and I would like to mention that it is also an elliptic equation. This is a very elematic observation that is. Observations that seem to be ability. Does it mean that it is elliptic? It is if you look at the symbol of this operator, this is clearly an elliptic symbol. You can also multiply this equation by the operator d t minus modulus of dx and obtain that h is a harmonic function. The harmonic function as a function of TL. Okay, so water wave problem and L-show problem are of very different nature, but there are some similar difficulties and indeed they have been studied by many people. There are many people who study both problems. I can mention Beale, who and Oven wrote. Also David Ambrose. Also David Ambrose, what I find kind of work in this direction. Also Steve Scholar working with Daniel Couton for the wet wave equation, or Shank and Azig or Granier Robinson for the Eloch equation, or Muscat problem. There is also the Spanish root, Andrea Castro, Antonio Cordoba, Diego Cordoba, together with Charles Feferma, Francisco Vancedo, and Javier Gomencerano. Many, many other people, Mathes Gunther and Georg Procker. And the Yellow Show equation has also been studied by many, many, many people. To name a few, we can quote the work of Kim, of Chen, of Mathieu, and Omar Lazar, I think. And I work with Omar. Okay. Recently, together with Nicolas Meunier and Didier Smet and also independently and exactly at the same time by William Bien and the Looposadeir, there has been a new approach of this LSHO equation. New approach of this L-Show equation based on some previous work for the water wave equation using the direct wave to Neumann operator. I recall the definition of this operator. Consider a function H and a function psi. You define the direct eton operator G of H acting on psi by this formula. this formula. Square root of one plus variant I square times the normal derivative of the harmonic extension of psi, which is defined by the unique solution of this problem Now, recall the Erasho equation. We have the Darcy equation. It's an incompressibility assumption. And this equation for P. If you introduce phi, which is p plus gy, let's introduce phi, which is equal to p plus g y. Then you have that v is equal to minus greater than phi. Phi, you have that Laplacian phi is equal to zero. And evaluated on the free surface, phi is equal to the Phi is equal to G, the acceleration of gravity, a constant times the harmonic extension of H. Now the first equation, d T H is equal to 1 plus gradient H square. gradient h square dot n implies that dth is equal to minus g of h h. If you change the time scale, you can assume with our clause of generality that g is equal to one, then you obtain this short equation, compact equation for Soft equation, compact equation for the Electron equation. Okay, this formulation for the electrical equation is not new. It was already introduced or implicit in many works. It was explicitly introduced by Schanglara, Guillen and Schaab recently. What is new? What is new is to use results proof of the water wave problem to study the electro equation. By doing so, with Nicola Menier and Didier Smetz and also Posade obtained the following results. In any dimension, if you consider any. dimension. If you consider an index S larger than 1 plus n over 2, you have the following results. For any initial data in Hs of the tors, there exists a positive time t such that there exists a unique solution h in this space of continuous. of continuous functions with value in hs, which are regular with value in hs minus 1 and also and 2 in times with value in h plus 1 half. And also this function are smooth for positive time. I refer to very recent work by Ian Guyan and Patrick Finn, who studies the same problem where you add surface tension and you consider a small parameter for surface tension and you find a time interval which is uniform with respect to surface tension. Okay. Whenever H is given by this theorem, we say that it is a smooth solution. Let. I will explain the scheme of the proof. The difficulty is that g of h depends nonlinearly on h. It's a non-linear problem. One can think of this classical equation. This classical equation. And to study this classical equation, it might be convenient to introduce v, which is ux, because it solves a quasi-linear equation. Similarly, to study the Lachau equation, it is convenient to quasi-linearize The Lachaud equation. For this equation, it is very natural to introduce this derivative. For the Lachaud equation, there are other derivatives which are natural. They are given by the following lemma. Denote by phi the harmonic extension of H in In the domain, omega and set B equal to d y phi A is equal to 1 minus B is equal to spatial greater than 5 and the 0. Phi and you can also consider y, which is a time derivative of phi evaluated on the x surface. Then, for any of the following unknown, A, B, or Y, you have dTu dtu minus v gradient u plus a g of h u plus gamma divided by a u is equal to zero, where gamma is a coefficient given by a nice formula. The proof is a computation. I'm not going to reproduce the computation. I just give the main argument. I just give the main argument, which is a shape-derivative formula and shape the floor. This formula allows you to differentiate the eclipse and the operator, and then you have to combine them together to form some cancellation in a way which is now classical for the waterway problem. A second result, directly inspired by the work of Sidrewu for the water wave problem, is that the coefficient A coefficient A is positive. This is related to the Taylor. This is related to the Taylor Symph condition. And the proof is the following. You look at the pressure P in the fluid. It vanishes on the top. It goes to plus infinity on the bottom, it is positive in the free. Positive in the fluid. So you look at the normal derivative of P, it will be negative or non-positive. And then you use the off-lemmer to guarantee that indeed the normal derivative is negative. And then it remains only to relate the normal derivative of P to the vertical derivative of P, which is an elementary. Which is an elemental presentation. Okay. You want more details? So this tells you that this coefficient is positive. And now we have quasi-linearized. And now we have quasi-linearized the equation in the sense that this quantity this quantity is smoother than this one. To conclude the proof, it remains only to find something more explicit, and this is given by a lemma that goes back to work with Gimmet G. And also an equilibrium plug-ville. Where we prove that in dimension one, you can replace g of h by modulus of dx up to some reminder. Up to some reminder, which is sub-principle, in the sense that it is of order 1 minus epsilon, provided that h is in hs, where s is larger than 1 plus epsilon plus n over 2. In general, in any dimension, you have the same results, where t lambda is a paradifferential operator, and lambda is a symbol given by 1 plus gradient h square psi squared minus gradient h plus psi squared. So you can replace E, G of H by a body from E, G of H by a par differential operator. This is something explicit. You have a an explicit parabolic evolution equation of order one up to some remainder term of order one minus epsilon. But these are small perturbations that you can handle by easy interpolation arguments. So this completes the proof, the scheme of the proof. Completes the proof, the scheme of the proof, and the well-positive. Okay? And now that we know that smooth solution exists, we would like to understand some qualitative properties of the solution. Inspire by the analysis of many other parabolic free boundary problems, tempting to look for some monotonicity property. We begin with the study of maximum principles. There are no well understood that there are some maximum principles for the Allushaw equation and in particular they have been used by Keem to prove the existence of the viscosity solution. This result states that the maximum The maximum in space of the function at time t is smaller than the same quantity at time zero. And you have a similar result, a result for the data limit. Okay, this is a classical data now. In the study of maximum principle for parabolic evolution equation for mechanics, there is a principle that is often very powerful. Powerful, an inequality due to Antonio Cordoba and Diego Cordoba. They prove the following inequality. Impose the following inequality for the fractional Laplace. It has been used by many people, for example, Peter Konstantin and Mihaila Iniatova. It has been generalized and extended to many different cases by Jew and also recently in a series of papers by Antonio Cordova and Martinez. In particular, In particular, they obtain variance of this inequality, where you replace this by a Laplace-Bertrami operator, or you can have the delta-ton operator G of H that I am considering. In the paper with Nicola Meni and DJ Smith, we complement this by noticing that By noticing that for any convex function, for any convex function phi from R to R, what as phi of f g h of f will be larger than g of h phi Fine. Okay. Okay. And the proof is the following. Denote by U the harmonic extension of F and you want to compare U U you want to compare phi of u and the harmonic extension of phi of f. You just want to compare these two functions. Then the key observation, which is extremely classical in elliptic theory, it is rooted in the work of Des Georges and Is rooted in the work of De Giorgi and many others, Tampa, is that Laplacian of phi of u, which is phi of u prime Laplace U plus this is Laplacian with respect to x and y. And this is zero, this is positive, this is positive. This is positive. So if you consider this quantity, this would be negative. And now you look, this function is equal to zero on the boundary. Minus Laplacian, which is a positive operator, is negative. So this function is negative. And this implies directly that the normal derivative of this quantity will have the appropriate sign to give the inequality. And we use it to prove several monotonicity properties. Firstly, a precise maximum principle which says that The maximum of this, not the modulus, the maximum of this derivative at time t is smaller than the maximum of the same quantity at time zero. And you can have a maximum principle for time derivative. The reversed the reverse case and also something nice. Which is the lower bound for the Taylor coefficient. The last property is interesting because the Taylor coefficient measures how much is the equation is small thing. So the proof is based on identities. It's based on identities again. For the first point, the trick is to consider this normalization. If you do that, you can form an equation on U of that kind, where A is minus B greater than equal to 1. minus V gradient minus one half divergence V plus square root of A J H square root of A plus gamma divided by two. This part is skew symmetric this part This part is self-adjoint and positive. So this is convenient to perform an energy estimate. And we perform an energy estimate in the way of Stampakia. We multiply the equation by the positive part of u, which can be expressed in this way. Phi is this converse. Convex function, the positive part. You perform an L2 energy using the previous convexity inequality for the delta to Neiman operator to have positive there. You apply on one lemma to handle this zero-order perturbation and you can propagate the fact that this quantity is equal to zero at times zero. So u plus will be zero at any time. Will be zero at any time, which means exactly that you have this maximum principle. The proof of the second point is similar, the proof of the third point is trickier. To prove the third point, we prove in fact a series of inequalities. For any p, the integral of one over a to the p. 1 over a to the p is decreasing. Then you let p goes to plus infinity, and in the end, you have an infinity bound for 1 over a, which is this reason. To prove this, you have to perform some computation. And the trick is that there are two tricks. Firstly, you apply the previous convexity inequality to verify that the integral of this quantity has a good sign. Here there is another constellation which is that the integral coming from that term is equal to this one. And it remains only to observe that gamma has the appropriate sign. Gamma as the appropriate sign, gamma is negative. And again, this is a consequence of the posit of the complexity inequality because we remember that gamma is this quantity. Again, we are in a position to apply the convexity. Okay, now I'm going to conclude by discussing some other monotony anyway properties that I am calling strongly opponent functions. Functions a proposition consider a convex function such that its derivative is convex. For example, phi is equal to x. For all phi is equal to tau squared. Then if you consider the integral of phi of h, this is the strong Viapod function. And this is a terminology that means by Terminology that means, by definition, I don't know if it is classical or study elsewhere, but it might be interesting for the illustrative equation. It means that it is a Gapuna function. A quantity that is decaying along the flow, and it decays in a convex manner. It decays in a convex manner. The proof of the fact that it is a Lyapunov functional is straightforward. You multiply the equation by phi prime of h, and you apply again the convexity inequality for the direct vector in the mountain operator that is inspired by or put it in the work of Cordoba. Or rooted in the work of colour by colour. This is the first point. The second point is trickier and is based on an inequality, on identity that might be of independent interest, which says that there is analytic formulation of the non-linear L-Show equation. Very simple formulation. What is B? This is the evaluation on the free surface of the surface. On the free surface of the vertical component of the harmonic extension of saturn. And the star means adjoint with respect to the L2 scalar product. The proof of this lemma, is a computation, based again on the shape-derivative formula of Zakarov, Kreigenland that I have recalled previously. I am not going to explain this. Once you have this lemma, you multiply this formulation of the problem by pi of h, and you integrate by parts. Simply that. You just integrate by part and in the end you will obtain that I of h is a strongly upon a function of space. It says something interesting if you consider the case i which is tau square. It says that if you look at the proof, it says the following. Look at the proof, it says the following. This quantity is a coercive quantity. This is equivalent to H one alpha norm. And you have an exact formula for the dissipation rate. And since you know that A is bounded from below by its value at zero, which is bounded from below by a positive constant, this is something that controls derivative of order one. So this quantity controls this quantity and this. control this quantity, and this means exactly that this quantity is an entropy. An entropy is a Lyapunov functional for which you can have a bound from below of the dissipation rate by the function itself. Okay? So the problem is well posed in HS for s larger than one plus n over two. The energy is the L to normal square. And we also know that we have this quantity which is comparable to this norm which is the Lyapunov function. And it is tempting to see high order Lyapunov function. This is something that we have This is something that we are currently doing with D Debrasch. We are seeking higher the Liabona functional for the Elocha equation and related models from Simchinium equation and so on. For the Ella-Shaw equation, we have the following results. The area function The area functional the area functional is decreasing. And the dissip the first is that the dissipation rate is positive. So this is the area function. So this is the area function and is a Yapon function. And the second result says that in dimension one, uh we are quite sure that the result is true also in higher dimension, but for lack of time n equal one here. The dissipation rate will be also Provided that the initial data is small enough in a very mild way, quantitative and not too small. So the area function is also strong here when a functional false zero equation. Okay? Okay. So this gives the control of first order derivative. And the last quantity, G of H is related to that quantity. H is related to that quantity. The integral of kappa, the mean curve H, times the direct latency man operator. There is a minus sign, so that this is a positive quantity. This is a statement of the theorem. It's not uh obvious, it it's a result of a configuration, which control three half norms by mean of a tracer. This is also an outcome of the proof of this result. An outcome of the proof of this result. So we have the Appuna functional of several orders close to the order at which the problem is well passed. What can I say about the proof? The proof of the first point is based again on an exact identity. It is easy to see that this holds with that definition. And then we prove that g of h is equal to the integral on the free surface of what? Of the normal derivative of the norm of the gradient, which is by mean of a stock series. Which is by mean of a stock theorem equal to this quantity, which can be computed to be equal to this. Which is positive. Eventually, the proof of the last point is not based on an exact identity. There is an inequality there. We did not succeed to find an exact identity along the whole proof. You start with an exact identity. This term will be easy to handle because in kappa you have two space derivatives, you integrate by part in x, and this is give a coercive control of the time derivative of h. The difficulty is to handle that term and to handle term and to under that term we replace HTT by theoretic formulation introduced previously. This term is equal to that term in dimension one, modulus and positive coefficient, and it remains only to handle kappa dh star This quantity. And to do that, we are not able to find an exact identity. We are forced to use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and to estimate separately kappa in L2 and this terminal two. The difficulty to estimate this term in L2 is that there is at some point you have to compute what is G of H of this term. And to do that, you can use the last final exact identity introduced in the study of stabilization for waterways, the relic-type identity, that give you a control of normal elevity in terms of the tangential derivative as a very Tangential derivative as a relic identity does. So this exact identity where B is given explicitly by so thanks to this identity, which is easy to handle because it requires only some Lipschitz bound on H, we are able to obtain the fact that The fact that the perimeter is a strong Yapanov functional under a mild small functional. I am stopping here. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you so much indeed. So any questions? Yes, Jeremy? So the what are you calling an entropy? The control on the A? control on the A quantity that you have, the identity there? We have to have function means that the time derivative of some passive quantity is decaying more. Okay? You call P here the dissipation rate and an entropy means that the dissipation rate will control the Lyapunov functional itself. The Lyapunov functionality itself. This is a very strong definition of an entropy that implies that if it is an entropy, this quantity is decaying exponentially in time. Any kind of control which is quantitative and allow you to have an information about the long-time behavior is called in the literature an entropy. Entropy means that you have some control, lower bound for the dissipation rate. From all of these, can you get From all of these, could you get, let's say, global convergence to flat for small enough data? No, it says that if you have a global solution, then this, you will have this kind of decay, quantitative decay. But you must know in advance that you have global existence. So, what kind of lifespans do you guys have for small data? Hmm? What lifespan do you have for a small data? For small data, you have global existence indeed. Any more questions? Not the case. That's thank you for here. And we resume at 10.30.
