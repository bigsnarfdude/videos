Okay, it's my pleasure to introduce the next speaker, Professor Siri. He's going to talk to us about oscillosis. What the Hi, hi everyone. I thank the organizers for inviting me. This is my first time at band. I've always heard of it. Actually, I'm loving it. I think I'm loving it. I'm logging it from some app somewhere if you know about it. This is one of the recent publications I've had with Paufner and it's about aging. If we are lucky enough, we will get old and hopefully we will celebrate a birthday at banned. Yeah. As we age, one of the hallmarks is the Senesax. The Hallmark is the senescence of our earthly cells. And osteoporosis literally means the bones getting bigger holes. And the hormonic of aging is a formation of semesters. So in this talk, we're going to develop a mathematical model where we design a virtual patient. Design a virtual patient who is aging and because of the aging is developing osteoporosis. We will see that is different in men than in women. And then we will use those virtual patients to assess some drugs called synolytic drugs. And what the synolytic drugs do is to decrease the senescence of our cells. So let's have some biology. From our birth to about 100, there is a phase of natural increase in our bone density, only increase. After some time in our early adulthood, we have some constants, some plateau. Our bone density goes to some plateau before decreasing as we get older. This is the and we will be concerned in this talk about this phase of the bone density. Of the bone density. So after age 50. Osteoposis is a state of bone density loss that is beyond 25%. So someone with the bone density loss, more than 25% of their maximum level of bone density, which is around age 50, is said to be in the state of osteoporosis. And here we can see that in all, I mean. That in all, I mean, the only time the women and the men have the same bone density is at birth. After that, the men bone density is always larger than the women bone density, and we can also see some dramatic decrease around the monopole time in women, which leads to more women being in the state of osteoporosis than men. Women than men. We cannot really see that in numbers. Oh, we celebrated the 80th birthday today. This is coincidence. This paper was already published before the birthday today. Yeah, and I should say, here I'm just summarizing the paper. I encourage everyone to actually download the paper and read the paper, please. Okay, at age 80, compared to the bone density level at age 50, the bone density level. The bone density loss in men is between 13 to 15 percent, while in women is already in the advanced, you can say, state of osteoporosis at age 80. Costeopausis prevalence in women, we can see that at age 60, about one on 10 women are diagnosed with osteoporosis. At age 90, I don't want to say almost every woman, but two out of three that's But two out of three, that's quite high. Osteoporosis, I mean, as the bone gets weakened, there are more risks of natural fractures. And these are some likelihood of natural fractures in men. Between age 50 to 65, likelihood is 1%. It increases quite dramatically around age 90 to 95. And if we think this is high already in men, And if we think this is high already in men, in women, it is way, way so definitely bone density loss seems to be quite more problematic in women than in men. And we are going to model this, design some virtual patients, and see how we can use the synovic drugs to tackle that. So, we're talking of bone density, we're talking of bones, meaning there are some, we need to understand the mechanism of bone formation and bone. Bone formation and bone degradation or resorption. The bone gets formed through the osteoblasts, which are the cells that eventually lead to bone formation, and the osteoblasts are the cells that lead to bone degradation. In omeostasis, these two processes, these two pathways work in balance. When there is bone degradation, a certain signal is sent to the bone formation path to compensate what has just been lost. To compensate what has just been lost. And when there is bone formation, another signal is sent to the osteoclast pathway to balance what has just been formed. And that is done through the RANG, RANG-LOPG signaling. Okay. Sorry, I'm a mathematician, so I will not always be able to say the biological word. Okay, so that's it. This is the basis for the model. Is the basis for the model we are developing, and this is where we build our network from. This is the network we propose. First of all, let's see what happens in homeostasis, and then we will discuss what happens when the patient ages and sinusine cells start to develop. So, let's forget about these notes for now. M is a chemical stem cell. This is the pathway for bone formation and the pathway for bone degradation. For bone formation and the pathway for bone degradation. Let's assume there is some bone degradation happening through the myeloid cells, differentiate into pre-cursor osteoclast, and then differentiate into osteoclast, which lead to bone degradation. When this happens, some signaling is sent to the mesenchemal stem cells in natural case and more enhanced by TGF beta or TGF beta formally. or TGF beta family type of cytokines to say hey engage the formation pathway and then the mesenchemal stem cells differentiate into pre-osteoblast cells which then differentiate into osteoblast cells which then lead to bone formation we mentioned the run L O P G pathway the run L is some ligand expressed on esteoblas as well as OPG and OPG and the rank is some receptors expressing the preosteoclast. So when the formation is going on, this binding occurs to enhance the degradation signaling. And OPG and RANGL also are kind of regulating so that there is not too much of that degradation happening. So this is how the balance is formed. This is how the balance is formed. Now, as we age, our mesenchemal stem cells start to differentiate into sinesan cells. And the sinesan cells produce sinesan specialist cytokines. These are microRNAs, 1835P, microRNA 34, and some special cytokines are represented called SASP that we represent here by IL-6. So those RNAs, these RNAs will encourage more of the mesenchemal stem cells to differentiate into adipocyte. And by doing so, they are decreasing the potential of bone formation. As we move on, the microRNAs are doing pretty much the same kind of job. They are preventing the differentiation from meso. The differentiation from mesenchymal stem cell to pre-osteoblast and from pre-osteoblast to osteoblast, as well as decreasing the bone formation. MicroRNA34 and R6 are blocking the OPG and the OPG binding with the RANG L is blocking the enhancement that will lead to bone resorption. So by blocking OPG, actually this encouraging Are encouraging more of the bone resorption. So, by this mechanism, we are clearly saying that the sinusine cells are encouraging more of bone resorption and discouraging bone formation. And therefore, as we age, we experience more of bone degradation. With this, we will start now to write our system of equations. And luckily, this is a system of ODE. We start with We start with defining how we will process the stem cells. We assume some constant source of mesenchemal stem cells and the stem cells proceed with time. We assume proportion, I mean proportional coefficient with time. We start or we set the Our critical time for the stem cell, I mean for the sinesan cell to start at D50. Chi here will be the average percentage of the sinesan cells occurring at age 50. So if this is the number or density of sinescent cells at age 50 or at each time, this will be the good mesenchemal stem cells that will. Mesenchemal stem cells that will now lead to the bone formation. As time increases, these good cells are decreasing. Let's start the equation for our good answers. They are activated naturally, as we said, through some natural pathway and then enhanced by TGF beta. And interestingly, as they differentiate into pre-osteoblasts, there are a lot of mechanisms trying to block. Are a lot of mechanisms trying to block them. The mechanism for the differentiation to adipocyte, the mechanism through which the microRNA, microRNA 1835P is preventing, and as well as the mechanism through which microRNA 34 is preventing. And of course, when there is no of this, none of this, the mesenchema stem cells naturally differentiate into adipocyte. This is a normal process. So this is our equation for the This is our equation for the mesenchema stem cells. This term we just saw it in the previous equation. The preosteoblasts have to progress into osteoblasts if we must have the bone formation. And also that is prevented right here. That is prevented by the macroRNA 34. RNA 34 and the cell died. And therefore, we have our, I mean, the term there comes there, and there we have our osteoblast, which will then lead to bone formation, which is the equation for bone formation. The equation for the osteoblast follow pretty much the same process, only that here QR will be the binding or the complex rank binding with run L and with all of And all of that involves included into that term. We will call that term G34, and we will use that when we use the drug. You will see in the subsequent slides. Alright, importantly, since we are modeling bone formation or bone density, bone density, our bone density at each time, is made of the bone formation. At each time, it's made of the bone forming and the bone resolving. The bone forming, we saw that the bone resolving in men is quite natural. In women, we include into our model the postmenopausal effect, which will be a dramatic decay from age 50 to a certain time that will take care of that rapid jump. And therefore, our bulk formation, we expect it to be just that. All right. That. Alright, this is our model simulation, and you can imagine that I hide a lot of equations. That means we have a lot of parameters. There is a whole section in the paper that deals with model parameters, but here we are just showing that our target is to really represent our virtual patient, the typical patient, as we actually know is happening. At age 80, the men. At age 80, the men have average density bone loss about 13 to 15 percent, and women that. This is actually what we are seeing in our virtual patient. This is a sign for 80, and we see for men, reduction of H80 is 12.8. I should have just rounded that to 13. And bone results, I mean, in women, 36.8, which is which falls very much in the range, and the shapes are just the same. Shapes are just the same. We mentioned the depletion in the bone, I mean, the function that means effect of menopause. That was just it. And we were able to capture what happens really. Now that we have our virtual patients, let's see, let's do some prediction. For a typical patient, the man will be of state osteo, I mean, will. Be of state, osteoporosis, I mean, will be declared of osteoporosis state between age 19 and 95, somewhere between 1995, while women will be of osteoporosis state right around age 65. Okay, this is natural and this is what is typically saying. Now, let's use some drug to slow down the state of osteoporosis as much as possible. Posteopolysis as much as we can. Synolytic drugs are drugs that slow down or that decrease the proliferation of senescence, which means in some sense they slow down the aging somewhat. So quacetin and ficetin both eliminate sinesensors, in vivo and in vitro. And moreover, physetin reduces the effect of SATs, SAS represented in our model by IL-6. IL6. We had here the density of sinesan cells without drugs. With drugs, we model the effect of the drug by this term, where gamma F and gamma Q are respectively the amount of physetine and quacetin. Physetine additionally reduces the effect of SAS. So we can see here on the function D34 we mentioned, both drugs. We mentioned both drugs affect that function, but physetine affects additionally the effect of IL-6. Right. Let's apply our drugs. In women, okay, in men, we just apply as equipment. In women, um postmenoposal, women usually take uh um ohmon. Ormon replacement therapy, and here we use estrogen, and we are assuming they are taking the estrogen during the time of that dramatic decay of the bone density loss. Now, let's see what will happen. In healthy, by healthy, I should have said, in a typical woman, in a typical virtual woman, under HRT or monal replacement. Of monal replacement therapy. Here we list the initiation time of the drug. We're using physetine on one board and quacetin on the other. So if we start treatment at 60, 65 and others and observed like end time of treatment right here, we will see some interesting features. For example, For example, starting treatment at 60 and stopping treatment at 80 helps reducing the points in bone density loss by almost 4. If no treatment, the patient will be at 30% or 30 more percent. But treatment will reduce the bone density loss by about 4%. About four points, which is we are reducing or we are decreasing our aging by about four points. This is using physetine. Vacetine seems to do better. Now, in men, with faster aging, faster aging, right, I should have mentioned that, please. ETA 1 is our choice for the T. One is our choice for the typical patient. So, increasing eta increases the proliferation of senescent cells, which means increasing aging. Men are really not very interesting. Well, of course, we all want to live longer and women are more interesting. Yeah, well, when I see this, when I show this, in red are the threshold below which everyone will be, yeah, I know, everyone will be declared in the state of osteoporosis. Just in the summary, I will say, in the case of rapid aging, we are able, this is, sorry, I would say blah blah blah, we develop mathematical model and so on, we use the drugs and. Model and so on, we use the drugs and so on. Maybe this is the most important. Of interest, picking up ovonardotherapy and starting early treatment with anolytic drugs can delay stetoposteoposis by about 10 years. And this is mostly seen in the dynamics of the urine. So, yeah, thank you very much for your attention. And this was it. Questions? Yeah, it's a very nice presentation to Richie. So, the core point reduction is equivalent. 4-point reduction is equivalent to 10 years. Yes, about 10 years. That's excellent. That's right. Something. Yeah, but of course, people don't age the same way. When people faster something. Yeah, but it's pretty good. Does it have any side effects, medications? Okay. Daily? The medic daily. The medication are still very experimental. Minutal trials are still going on for the end. I thought I was also going to take a button. Exactly. Any other questions? Luckily, we are eight. Definitely. Okay, let's thank the professor.
