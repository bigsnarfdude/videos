So it is the talk is about quasi-periodic solutions and maybe first I have to explain and to give some motivation. Quasi-periodic functions, they appear very naturally in integrable systems. When you have an integrable system, then the phase space is foliated by Phase space is Fourierated by a lulevial tori, and then if you pass to the so-called action angle coordinates, then on the tori, then you will see then you will straighten the flow. So you will see a usual tori and a vector that is constant. So you will get the constant vector field. So the solution on the covering of the tori will be straight line. But after Line, but after rejecting on the torrent, if the frequencies of the vector are, say, irrationally independent, you will get a curve that is dense. And then the regional variables, the variables that come from the configuration space, say the position coordinates or the momentum, they will be, when restricted to the tory, they will be continued. Restricted to the tori, there will be continuous, even smooth functions. And then the solution, when you go back to the original coordinates, will be such a such a composition of this curve on the tori with the continuous function in general. And this is the and because your curve on the tori is not periodic in general, because we assume the frequencies are independent. Independent of rational numbers, then you see that your solution from the point of view of the curve, from the point of view of the parameter of the curve, will be not periodic. It will be close to periodic, but it will never be periodic. So this is an example of classic periodic function functions. So what I will try to do now now I will try to explain. So the idea was this, how you can see the Rn as the configuration space of the fluid. Of the of the fluid. And then uh we we we define the class of quasi-periodic uh functions. Of course, they will be quasi-periodic functions, not of one variable, they will be of n variable, so they will be on Rn. But essentially I will copy this model that I explained, that comes from the Tor. So the first thing is let's so what I will do because the things they're very simple, I'm We do because the things they're very simple, I will just explain what the spaces are and then we formulate the theorem. So, spaces of classic periodic functions. So, here I want want also to mention that I want also to mention that quasi-periodic functions, they are particular cases for more general notion, the so-called almost periodic functions. The both two notions, they are very popular in the first half of the 20th century. For example, Bochner, von Neumann, and many Bezikovic, they worked on this, but after that, somehow people stopped maybe working so much on this topic. So, the thing here that I want Topic. So, the thing here that I want to mention is that we have this quasi-periodic functions, and this is, as I said, a sub-class of almost periodic functions. Okay, let's describe such a class here. So, I will take Rn. So, my functions will be on Rn, and let's figure out the function. And let's fix here in order to describe the space how we need a linear map from Rn to Rn, where this upper KSM is big enough. So I need a linear map from Rn to Rn, where here we assume that n is less or equal than m. But in general, think of this m as a very big number. So I will, with this linear map, we will. Linear map, we will embed the plane into a very big R. Then here we consider a tori Tm and this will be the kind of canonical projection. Say this is a standard tori of length one of all in all directions. This is the standard projection. And then you can see that this will be commutative. Here diagram can This will be commutative. Here, diagram, consider this mapping. And we call this omega of pi. So what is here the geometry behind this? So let's consider the tori. For the tori, I would denote the coordinates to be angles. So let's denote them theta 1, theta n, theta n. So we have n coordinates on the torrex. Coordinates on the tore. This is the torre. And here, I will need two conditions on the matrix. So the matrix is fixed. So the space will depend on this omega. So the first condition on omega is that the rank is n. So this is a four-rank matrix. And the second condition will be an And the second condition will be a non-degeneracy also mo um non-resonant condition. So we call this NC non-resonant condition and it's a kind of geometrical condition. It says that the image of omega p is dense in the door. Again, I copy. Again, I copy precisely the picture of the one tori when I have one vector. So the analog of the frequencies omega 1, omega 2 of this vector on the torre, this is this matrix here, data B. Okay, with this, maybe let's draw a picture here what we have. So here we have a copy of Rn. This is the plane. Then we have the This is the plane. Then we have the linear map omega. And so here we have this plane in Rn. But this is because this is in Rm and then we project, we have the same senior pictures in the one-dimensional case. So we get this n-dimensional Fourieration in the torque. And then we see that, for example, if I take a continuous function on the torque, A continuous function on the torque and take the pullback of this function with respect to omega, to the linear mapping, I will get a function here. And this function will be not, in general, you will not have periods. This will be the way how these are the so-called functions that we consider. They are positive periodic, and you see this is precisely. Periodic, and you see, this is precisely, I copy the case in finite dimensions. But because we need some to do analysis, so let's do the following. Can we define this space? So here instead of continuous functions, because it's not easy to work with continuous functions, I will take a function in Sobola space that is big enough so it contains continuous functions. So we take s to be greater than m over 2. M over 2. So this will be the regularity exponent. So I need a continuous function at least. And then define the space QS as this initial regularity and omega. So omega, this matrix, as I said, is built into the space. It's fixed. Then if I start changing the omega, I will get different spaces. But at this point, it's fixed. So what is this? So what is this? By definition, this is just the pullback with respect to this mapping and omega p of f of a function f on the tor. And here I read that f is just from the sober f plus hs, so it's at least continuous in its on the tor. Later on, this will be vector fusion. Later on, this will be vector fields. It will be a function from Rn to Rn because we need vector fields there. Okay, so here, maybe let's do the following. Let's look at I will write now something very simple and trivial on the board, but this is just to make connections between this thing. I will write this in terms of the Fourier series. The point is the following: that this is even more general fact: that all mass prototypic functions they have Fourier series. So they have expansions, of course, they don't necessarily converge. Let's look what happens here. This is a more simplified case, so it's easy to look at it. So we fix such function f this is on this big dot. This is on this big torque. S is fixed, omega is fixed. And then let's consider the Fourier expansion. It has, of course, the Fourier expansion. So we have F. And I recall that I use thetas for the coordinates on the torque. So f of theta, yeah I write. This is the sum over m is in z uppercase m. Output case M, the Fourier series. Here we have the Fourier coefficients that will come. And we have E, because I said the torque here, the length is 1, not 2 pi, I write 2 pi i, and here we have m tat, right? And of course, this converges. And of course this converges absolutely because I assume this thing on the exponent that is greater than s m m over 2. Here we have absolute we have convergence, absolute convergence, at least. And now let's take the pullback. So let's take now consider f of omega p of x. So this will be f of x. F of x. Right, so this will be positive periodic function. Because I apply, so this is in Argent. I apply this, I go on the toroid, and then I have composed with F. Let's see what we get. At M in Z M, the Fourier coefficient of the function of the tore. Auditory M. I have the exponent 2 pi i m here instead of omega, I put omega p of x. So here this p I can take out because it's periodic in any case. So you how you get this. And now here, just move. And now here, just move the matrix uh at this point. So we get this is the same as and now I we finish with there will be no more things like that. So here is the the sum, the Fourier coefficient F m the exponent two pi i And here we write this as lambda m x where what is lambda m? Here I write this as the transpose of omega, moving it from here here, applied to m x. So even so here So here lambda m as right lambda m, even I will put 2 pi here, by definition this is 2 pi omega the transpose of it m so this is a mapping from these are the Fourier the Fourier exponents that we get and so now few That we get. And now, few comments about this, and this is the typical thing for classic periodic things that we have. This lambda, Fm, it's a mapping lambda from Z M. So these are the indices in the Fourier series. And the image is in Rn. So these are the Fourier exponents. So the point here is... So the point here is the following: that this is the non-degeneracy condition that I assume, that this matrix satisfies, this is dense. From here, we will follow first that this mapping is injective. That means that for any index, I have a unique Fourier exponent. This is important because I can see that one to consider the Fourier coefficients. That wants to consider the Fourier coefficients as coordinates, right? Otherwise, I will have to add them up. So, this is injective, and this is in fact equivalent to the non-degeneracy condition. And the other remark that is more important is that the image of this thing, of the Fourier exponent, this is a dense set in our head. Let's now compare this with the usual periodic case. In the periodic case, for example, on the on the in the one-dimensional case, In the one-dimensional case, all Fourier exponents there k they are one, two, three, minus one. So these are, say, integer numbers, right? And they're not dense. And here you have dense set. This is the difference. But still, look at this, because this series converges absolutely, this is some continuous function. And this is a function. Continuous function. And this is a fully, it has a Fourier expansion. This is a Fourier expansion of this function. And just a remark that this is a more general, this also holds for almost periodic functions. Of course, as I said, for almost periodic functions, you will have the Fourier expansion, but it will be not necessarily equal to the function if you have formal Fourier expansion. Okay. Okay, another here. So, this is the space. One can say I need a norm in this space. What will be the norm? So, we take the norm from HS. And this will give me isomorphism. In fact, these two spaces, they are isomorphic. The periodic functions on the Tori with the quasi-periodic functions. Of course, these are different representations. So, let's write. So let's write here the norm. If I take a quasi-periodic function, I write the norm this way, Q as omega. Omega is fixed. Let's write here squared. This will be the sum of all indices in Zn we have the Fourier coefficient. And here we have x to the 2s. So this is the usual software of norm on the on the on the torus. And I will take back, I will get a norm here. And as I said, this is an isomorphism. Few remarks here. One that is the first maybe that is more important is the f n I erase this. erased in the following one that the Fourier coefficient, if I'm given a quasi-periodic function like this, then one can recover the Fourier coefficient. The difference will be the following: that the formula for the Fourier coefficient will be the for the end Fourier coefficient. Will be the for the nth Fourier coefficient. So here m is in zn. So this is this. Because the point is now that these functions, we don't have decay at infinity. So the integral, the usual integral, does not exist. But we can average. And this is the main thing. So if we take the limit t goes to infinity and here And here we take the integral of a cube. So I take the center and the cube centered at zero, a flat 2t. So I will take here negative t 2t to the power of n. This is the cube. Then we take f of x. This is the quasi-periodic function, naughty k. And here we have the usual formula for the Fourier coefficient. We will be e. Here coefficient will be E minus I and lambda m x dx. And of course, here I have to divide by this volume. So it will be over 1 2 t to the power of n. This is the volume of this group. So we have a we can take. That's all we average and take the limit. This exists. In our case, it's easy to see that it exists because the series converges absolutely. It's very easy to see that this is true. So this is a formula for the Fourier coefficient. Another thing that will be important later on is that any absolutely any function that is quasi-periodic, this integral exists. I can Exists. I can take the average and the average exists. It's also true as I said for almost periodic functions. This is just particular case where one can see this easy. Okay, so I have to mention one more thing: that this space defined this way is a Banach algebra. For me later, it will be good because it's very easy to work with Banach algebras when you have non-linearities, right? Because when you have non-linearities, right? You see, you multiply, you get into the same space. Okay, so this is the space that I will consider. So you see, it's essentially I copy the definition. Yes, sir. Are they contained in some sublime space for n? No, because they don't. This was the point. So they don't lose in the use of sobre space, they can kind of decay at infinity. I mean if you if you restrict a sober space function to a subspace you usually lose half the codimes of regularity but some yes here I define this way and now the point is that I will need the scale I will need the scale in order to I will need another another parameter that will be responsible for the for the regularity see what's what what's what's the point Here was what what was the point. Here we'll be now I will copy the definition of the subolar space and we'll do the following. So let's d d denote by q s l omega. Again, omega is fixed. So here s is this initial regularity in this space that I discussed. L will be a scale of solar spaces where the regularity will increase. So the definition of this is the following. So I can see the functions in QS omega. So this is the usual quasi-periodic functions. And then here we require that the weak derivatives d alpha F, this is in Q S omega or alpha less we from there as Last week from then L. So this kind of the base space that some usually P L P and here I take it this. And now when the regularity L increases you you can prove different thing. Embedding theorem so it will be in C k plus L, where k is s minus, as you said, m over 2. And this is the space that I will work with. Space that I will work with. Okay? Now let's formulate the theorem and I would most likely not have time to discuss the proof, but we'll try to mention the most important things from my point of view. So the theorem is theorem. Here. So assume, of course, we fix this omega with these two conditions, non-degeneracy plus the rest. So assume that M is greater than one plus M over two. M over 2 L greater or equal than 2. Then for any initial data, U0, this is a vector field now. Now I will consider F to be maps from the toric to Rn, right? So this will be in the space QSL omega, which summary you are in. With some regularity here, L additional. Such that, or maybe let's write here, then for any given row, positive, this will be the radius of the disk centered, as usual, centered at zero. And for any initial data here, divergence free, there exists T, positive, the time of existence, that depends Of existence that depends on this. And here I assume that this initial data QSN omega is inside the bow of radius rho. So take rho, then we get t, and for any initial data in the bow, there exists the time of existence depending on these parameters and a unique solution. A unique solution of the Euler equation incompressible so let's say U is the solution, it will be in C minus T. minus dt in Q S L omega and it will be classical solution. It I will have one derivative it's C1 negative dt and here we decay at least we are in a large space as usual one has here Q s n minus one only so So, the uniqueness, so I say there is a unique solution like this, such that the pressure, let me not write the equation, it was written many times, such that the pressure is clasiperiodic, okay. Otherwise here, because the constants are in my space, one has to be c to be careful with the uniqueness. To be careful with the uniqueness, right? So, under this condition, there exists a unique solution here. The solution depends continuously on the initial data. That means for any u0 in this bow, the data-to-solution mapping in this space is continuous. So, in other words, we see that if I start with initial data, that is even. With initial data that is even quasi-periodic, not necessarily periodic, but quasi-periodic, there exists a solution locally. Solution that depends continuously on the initial data within this class. So it's quasi-periodic function. A few remarks here that maybe are important. So the first remark is is this. So because the solution is quasi-periodic function, it has a Fourier expansion. And I have the Fourier, the Fourier series. So the remark is this that for any m in Zm, that means for any index, for any Fourier coefficients that I fix, for any given By fix for any given m, if we consider the corresponding Fourier coefficient, it will be a function of t and also on the initial data. This function for fixed m is analytic in t and on the initial data. So why this is the why I This is why I mentioned this because the whole solution, if I consider u in the space of quasi-periodic function, is not analytic. We know this for order. If you go to the Lagrangian coordinates, everything is analytic, it's nice. When you go back, because of the composition, it's not even Lipschitz. You lose analyticity. But here, the remark is that you lose the analyticity for the whole solution, but the Fourier coefficients, they are. Solution, but the Fourier coefficients, they're analytic. They're analytic and depend analytically on the initial data. So, this follows easily from if you use this the formula for the Fourier coefficient. I don't have time to go, but you go there, you change the variables, and you can see this easily. So, in other words, one can say that this solution is weakly analytic. So, it's not analytic, but weakly analytic. That is precisely this thing. Is precisely this thing. The second remark is this. See, because I fix the matrix omega, that means here the Fourier exponents, they are fixed numbers. So you, yes, I finished. So I have Rn and I have this dense set of Fourier exponents, right? They are fixed during the whole evolution. During the whole evolution with time. So, therefore, in some sense, these are integrals of motion, right? Because they don't change. Of course, they are dependent. So, one can roughly say that omega is an integral of motion. Because you can imagine this thing, I consider one one I consider the space the union of all omegas. So, this will be a big space of quasi period of all possible quasi periodic functions of these forms. Quasi-periodic functions of this form. And this says that along this space, when I take the initial data in one of these particular spaces, then this omega will be preserved. So this is kind of an integral of motion. That you don't see. You don't see this integral in HS because you don't have this Fourier coefficient. So you can see this just in this case. That's I don't have more time I have just to mention that of course there are other people that worked on this in particular Giga and his school they worked on on Navier Stocks and also Juhas has a paper on honor in two dimensions and some other things. So yes, thank you. So yes, questions? So in 2G, does Guavo exist as Guavo? In 2G, it will hold. It's not proven, but I think we can prove. You can define like all the user things, like for T-Story. Yes, everything is fine. Another thing is that here you have a group of almost periodic diffeomorphisms. So with these vector fields, you can So, with these vector fields, you can. This is the algebra. In other words, you can integrate the algebra. There is a group. And this group is nice. It's a topological group. It has the properties that you mentioned in your talk. And you can apply this the Lagrange picture if you wish to here in this case. So it's very similar with the compact case when you have the group DS with sovereign plus HS. I was not an uniqueness. You imposed the congish priority that it must be in this class, or you have a unique solution and why the collection is not. No, no, the uniqueness is within the class. What do you mean that it is a first integral? You already are from the very beginning you say that we are looking only in the class for a fixed terminal. Then I'm not confused. The point is that you yes, from this point. Yes, from this point you have you are right, Hi, but you have such solution, right? You have such solutions that preserves this. So you can say you have other solutions, but in this way we have a way to select a solution. And so for this selected solution, we have the integral. In the proof, do you need to consider Euler in the big TM or not? TM or not you the big TM I mean TM is the big uh uh torus where we directly work with with with this space but of course this torus comes up so I don't have time it's uh there is some algebra when in order to because here the the the thing that is maybe not not non trivial is that why when you compose these homomorphisms of this class, you are still in this class. Class, you are still within this class. Why if you take different in this class, then the inverse is in this class. And in the proof, it's very simple. And you have some algebra there that I don't have to discuss, but yes, we wanted to mention. I just want to make sure that dimensions are n. Yes. So, okay, if we consider periodic case, the L should be. case that L should be better than n over 2 plus 1. But in this case you can have just 2. Yes, the point here is that I have this initial regularity that comes with S. So you see this is kind of S plus L. Think of this way of the regularity. I mean just A is the price. So you see L, you initially you are in S. You initially, you are in HS. This is your initial thing. And then any other derivative, the field function is within this HS. We can discuss. So this is more the regularity here is not L. It is L plus S minus M over 2. Okay. L plus. So the user. F plus. So the usual one that comes from the suborph is S minus the dimension of a 2 integer, right? From the suborph embedded, plus L. So here you sum the two. That's why you have for L, I get greater or equal than 2. Not, yeah, no more. One more thing. Chapter T only extending on the normal of the introduction. Yes, of course it depends. In this when I fix S, L, and omega, it depends on rho. But in general, one can prove that it can be made made independent on the regularity L. So you have the same, as usual, you have for order. If you have this for one regularity, therefore, the greater regularity if you have it, the same time of existence. Here you have another regularity.  Very nice. So this is a reference place.
