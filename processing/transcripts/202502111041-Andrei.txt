There were so many good talk I I was planning to talk about quantum circuits and time evolution, but there were so many talks good talks given on the subject so I decided to talk about something else. So I will talk about quantum impurities and what I want to understand is how quantum impurities behave when they are Behave when they are in an interacting environment. And I see that there is some global feature which emerges, which is common. It's too early to say universal, but it's common to different systems. For example, the first system that I'll talk about is a quantum impurity in a superconductor. The second is a quantum impurity. Second is a quantum impurity in a dissipative environment. And a third model is when the quantum impurity interacts with the fluctuation of a spin chain. And we'll see that similar at the boundary. Here I've chosen two impurities to make the system PT invariant. And PT invariant or simplification. Okay, so here is the outline of my talk: condo impurity in a one-dimensional superconductor. I will talk about quantum fluctuation, how they destroy what is called YSR states, and how the competition between those fluctuates. Between those fluctuations and the contensate lead to the phase diagram. In a dissipating environment, we'll talk about a non-hermission quantum model, which is a simplification of a model interacting with an environment. And again, there will be a phase diagram emerging which describes competition between this dissipation. Competition between this dissipation and the quantum fluctuation of the impurity. Most likely, I will not have time to talk about this third subject, but a similar phase diagram emerges. Okay, let me just remind you what happens when we put an impurity in a non-interacting system. So, this is a very well-known system called the Condos effect. Here you have a low. Here you have a localized impurity interacting with the gas of electrons. The gas of electron, a metal typically, is just a bath. And the impurity interacts locally via a spin density interaction. So this is the local impurity localized at zero, and there is quantum exchange between the impurity and the gas of electron. Of electron. And the results of this have been studied to great detail over the years. The impurity turns out to be screened by the impurity, screened by a many-body effect. Many body effect that means there is a condo cloud forming around the impurity on a scale. Impurity on a scale which is dynamically generated by the interaction, so that at low temperature the impurity is not seen beyond the scale, the length scale, 1 over TK. So, for example, if you look at the magnetic susceptibility, which is plotted here, you see that at high temperature, it goes to zero. To zero, like one over t, however, with just small logarithmic correction. So, this is the impurity susceptibility. Impurity susceptibility. And when the temperature is lowered, instead of being a free impurity as it is at high temperature, it crosses over and is completely screened. Did I do something? Touch your computer. Maybe now it's no longer mirrored, maybe it's now as an external airframe users is now in an external screen, so So one of the reasons, for example, that I was interested in this model is this crossover from high temperature weak coupling to low temperature strong coupling, which was similar to my thesis of QCD, is an example of a theory that behaves like that. So this crossover is very typical of strongly correlated system at low temperature. Temperature. So, what one finds then is that the theory generates a non-perturbative scale, a condo temperature, which is of the form cutoff times the exponential of one over the coupling, and a local density of states around the impurity given by this scale TK over E squared plus TK squared. So, So, the way to see how this works in the language of renormalization group, we have a model, here is the free model, perturbed by the local interaction, which when we do RG and describe the system at lower and lower energies, it flows to strong coupling, and j equals to infinity. So, at long. So at low energy scales, the effective coupling is strong coupling, and one has to describe the system starting from this point of view. And what is associated with this flow is that also the entropy flows under the renormalization group, starting here at weak cup in the impurity, is described by log 2, while at high At high and low energies, the entropy is low one and is zero. And this is again the crossbow. So this is when there is no interacting environment. Now, the condo effect in BCS superconductor has been studied very early on, and there was. There was great interest in it. So, what now you do, you have the H-metal, free gas of electron, and you add now a pairing interaction. And the question is, what happens to the impurity? So, there is a competition between the screening of the impurity and the Cooper pair formation. And in order to screen the impurity, one has to break this Cooper pair, and there is now infrared. And there is now interesting interplay between these two mechanisms. So, YSR, that is, you, Shiba, and Rusenov studied it in the late 60s and they used mean field theory, which I'm going to describe in a minute. What they did is they took a BCS superconductor. A BCS superconductor and studied what happens if you introduce a classical spin into it. So the classical spin, Sc impurity S C of the electron was regarded as introducing a local magnetic field. The impurity was then studied in the limit where the coupling goes to zero and the impurity coupling goes to infinity. Impurity coupling goes to infinity, so it became classical, and they obtained equations which they could solve. And they show that the boundary energy is now a function of a phase where a here minus delta, so a bound state forms at the position of the equity and screens it locally, unlike the Kondo effect, which screens it as a cloud, a global. It is a cloud in a multiparticle interaction. So the bound state energy is of the form the gap energy times sinus 2 pi alpha j, where alpha is given as pi over 2 minus j s, where js was the parameter which described the interaction. And more recently this was studied by introducing also By introducing also a quantum fluctuation and it re-normalizes this phase. But notice that the full phase diagram in this approximation consists only of this bound state. And there were several applications when people tried to use these YSR states to construct topological. Construct topological modes. I don't want to go into that. What I'm interested in instead is what happens if I put the impurities in a strongly fluctuating superconductor, a one-dimensional superconductor, where I cannot approximate the superconductivity by BCS theory, but have to take it fully into account. Account. And the model that I'm going to be looking at is the following. So I have the interacting, so I have a free Hamiltonian. I have an interaction which is spin density. Spin density. It's a four fermion interaction which opens a gap in the spin uh sector. Sector, leaving the charge sector decoupled. And I have the interaction of the local impurity with the spin density at the position of the impurity. So we have open boundary conditions. We put the impurity at the edge and we then have to impose boundary conditions that a right mover coming in becomes a left mover. In becomes a left mover, and similarly on the other side. So the superconducting bulk now includes strong electron-electron correlation, attractive spin exchange. Still I have spin charge decoupled, I have a gap spin-on appearing, and a quasi-long range superconducting order. Of course, in one dimension, I cannot have a I cannot have a symmetry breaking, but what plays the role is the slowest or the slowest decaying correlation happens. And L and R mean left and right now? Yes, thank you. I should have said more. I should have chiral electrons. The electrons are chiral, yes. Because I am on the energy scales, I linearize around the Fermi surface. Fermi surface. And that's a good approximation because the scales are very large. Okay, so now we have an interesting new Rg behavior. So we have two coupling constants. Probably I should have said that here. I have two coupling constants. G controls the superconductivity. The superconductivity and J is the condocoupling constant. So now G, the beta function, which describes how the capping constant behave if we look at it at different energy scale, goes like minus 2 over pi g squared, and it always grows as you lower the energy scale. The coupling constant of the The coupling constant of the condo now is affected by the coupling constant in the bulk. And it's this behavior of the condo effect in different regimes which is our main interest. What you see if you plot the flow of the coupling constant, so in this direction we have G, and you see the coupling constant always flows to strong coupling. Close to strong coupling. On the other hand, J has different behavior depending on its value. In some parts of the phase diagram, we will still have a Coldo effect with J flowing to infinity. In other parts of the phase diagram, we'll have the coupling constant turn over and flow to zero, and this will be the local moment behavior. And in intermediate, Intermediate is the regime that before I called the YSR. So the phase diagram then has three regimes. When the coupling constant, when the condor coupling constant is very large compared to the bulk coupling constant, we'll have, I showed, has this condor regime. Here, when the coupling constant is small, we'll have the unscreen, the local impurity, and in between, we'll have what was found. Will have what was found earlier as the YSR. But you see, this regime now becomes a very small part of the phase diagram, while before it occupied the whole regime, now the appearance of the fluctuations suppress it to a very small part of the diagram. So, to describe it in an invariant It in an invariant way, it's convenient to introduce an RG invariant, which I label D, which is a combination of the coupling constant J and G. And this coupling constant D does not change while the other two coupling constants flow. So it's an R G invariant. And being an R G invariant, And being an RG invariant, I can use it to label the various regimes. And it measures in an RG invariant way how the different, the relative strengths of the two companies. So let me go through a, I find it amusing calculation where we increase We increase the strength of the various fluctuations. So here I'm redoing the original calculation of YSR. So here is the, instead of talking about the quantum impurity, I turn it into classical. In other words, I make the Catlin constant very small, while the spin very large, so it does not fluctuate. Been very large, so it does not fluctuate. So the impurity is described now by this Hamiltonian, where you have a local spin, spin Z impurity, which in a sense behaves as a local magnetic field at the point zero. The superconductor itself, I'm going to bosonize, and becomes a sign-Gordon model. Becomes a sign-Gordon model. The charged part, which becomes a Latin liquid, now decouples, and I have then to study the sign Godon in the presence of a local magnetic field at the edge. So I can then remove this external field and incorporate it into the boundary conditions. So now the boundary conditions. So now the boundary condition at the position of the impurity is going to be of the form 2π over beta, where beta is related to the coupling constants times n. And doing now the semi-classical calculation. So what is n the density or what is it? N is no, not the density. It's an integer. Integer. Because the coupling of the integer is G? Sorry? In the Z before the one integer. So the coupling constant now becomes a... So I have the coupling constant G, which is related to beta in the box. In the Z before the one G and beta. It should be G. Sorry. So I have a sign cordon. So I have a sign-Gordon equation and I have to, so it has, as we know, it has this new boundary condition imposed by the magnetic field. And Sign Gordon has spectrum of kings and anti-kings. And the energies is given by a king E plus, which is 2M0, which is the mass that appears in the That appears in the sine goddamn over beta square, and it behaves the screening part of the diagram. And here is the anti-a kink, which does not screen the impurity. So, you see, the behavior of the model in this semi-classical mimics exactly the YSR calculation, where the quantum fluctuations were suppressed. Now, I'm going to Now, I'm going to allow the bulk to be fully quantum. So, I'm taking the opposite regime. Before I was taking beta squared going to zero, which produced the solitons. Now, I'm going to take beta squared equals to four pi. The Hamiltonian can be refermionized by the Luther-Emerald old trick. Luther Emery, the old trick to a massive Turing model. And what we have then is a massive Turing model with kind of strange boundary condition imposed by the impurity which is still classical. Then, what I have is to do is to solve the Hamiltonian, find all the eigens. Find all the eigenstates, fill the vacuum by these eigenstates, where the boundary condition tells me that the states have to be scattered at the edge by an amount which is described by the strengths of the interaction, where the amplitudes A lambda and A minor these are the scattering amplitude at the edge are related by this S matrix. S matrix. So I find the ground state, fill all negative energy modes, and then I compute the excitations. What I find then is that there are bound states, but there are also states which are outside the regime, which the fluctuations now are responsible for them. Them and only part of the spectrum now, where the invariant is between half and three halves, is responsible for the local screening. Okay, now I want to look at the model fully a quantum. Both are taking into account the quantum fluctuation of the impurity and the bulk. So here is the model in its full glory. In its full glory, left-right moving kinetic term, a bulk interaction, and impurity, local impurity fluctuation. Okay, so turns out that this model is integrable for arbitrary coupling constant J and G. Here is how one does the beta answers, but I assume everybody knows that. So here are So here are the equations that come out. You have a lambda alpha are what is called the spin momenta. They describe the spin fluctuations of the bulk and the impurity. And the allowed momenta lambda alpha, once I solve the equation, this beta-anzaz equation, I plug it into the The expression which gives me the momenta kj of the electrons, and then I calculate the energy as some of this momenta. So let me go now through term by term. Here is the bulk term, and this would be the term that determines just the opening of the gap in the gas of electron due to the attractive interaction. Due to the attractive interaction, namely, this generates the superconductivity. And it opens, it's characterized by a bulk parameter and opens a gap. And this is the expression for the bulk gap. And D here is given by the cutoff, which is essentially the density, which is sent to infinity to have universal answers. Have universal answers when the coupling constant is set to zero so as to keep this scale invariant. The new term that is now added is the impurity term, which is here in red, in addition to the bulk term. And this describes the full system now, which is this, and you see. And you see, here is the quantity D that I introduced earlier, which is the renormalization group invariant. And according to the values of those renormalization, this invariant, we will have the three regimes that I advertised earlier. Since D can take real and imaginary values, sometimes I use the parameter A when he becomes natural. A when he becomes imaginary. So we will have then three regimes depending on whether the parameter is smaller than one. This is the contour regime. Then there is the YSR regime where here is the moment regime where the bulk interaction is very weak and the condos structure is dominant and here is where both of them compete. Here is where both of them compete. And what we see then, that there is a scale TK that emerges, and the ratio between TK and delta determine the various diagrams. So again, how do we carry out the technical cursion here? So this is the superconducting model with open harmonic conditions and some harmonic conditions. No, at the edge. But you could also make it periodic and periodic. I mean, there was a technical difficulties to do that. When I have the impurity at the edge, then I have electrons coming in and coming out. If it's in the middle, then they can go in, can be scattered back. Scattered back, then I have a more complicated situation. I don't know if it is insuperable. Not that I haven't tried, but. So the ground state now is done in the usual way. I find the density of the lambdas. This if you have done beta answers, this would be a very standard equation. Very standard equations for the density of excitations, which you solve using Fourier transforms, and you obtain the various phases. So here I'm going to go through the various regimes again in more detail. So I have the total spin in the ground state is a sinklet, a many-body sinklet. Density of state, I can A density of state I can obtain from the solution is typical in the bulk, is a density of state of a superconductor, which everybody who learned BCS will recognize. And then the density of the impurity over, density of state of the impurity over the bulb is this very interesting quantity. So we have delta cosh hyperbolic pi over the reminder d is. But the reminder D is the invariant parameter E squared plus delta square since I capable of square pi D from which we can identify a condo scale by demanding that it will be the value where the density of states becomes half of the peak. So you have this kind of expression, and when the density of states obtains half. Of states obtains half its value, I call the scale of energy that emerges Tk, and it's of the form delta square root of one plus Cauchy hyperbolic pi over T. And if you go into the deep condor regime, namely here, it takes the usual form, DE minus phi over J, while if you the Condor regime, the Kondo coupling is Coupling is weakened, it takes other forms. So, the condo, so here it's the condo which is dominant, and then there is a crossover, a smooth crossover from the many-body sink lead screening the impurity to, as we are crossing from D equals to half into the YSR regime, to the bound state where TK takes the value delta. Tk takes the value delta, it cannot go beyond it, and then that occurs when A is equal to half, and then the impurity is screened locally by a bound state at the location of the impurity. So, the wise are then so we have three regimes. In this regime, we have In this regime, we have the local screening of the impurity. If you remember, when we did semi-classically, that was when we had the soliton, and here we have, which screened the impurity, here we have the anti-solitone, which does not screen the impurity, so S is plus minus half. And the ground state has this bound state while when in When in this intermediate regime, and here it has S equals to plus minus L. Now, the last, the third regime is when the parameter is very large. Technically, what we have here is when we solve the beta-anzaz equation, we have what is called wide pair rather than strings. Strings and it's the only solution which is valid in the presence of interaction. It's not the valid state, and therefore here the impurity cannot be screened by the impurity on any energy scale. So there are no YSR states at all, and the impurity is in the local moment regime. So here is the phase diagram. So here is the phase diagram then. Here we have the SHIBA or the YSR phase. So here is the condo behavior screening to a local spin accumulation in the form of a condo cloud. Here is the Shiba or the YSR behavior. Bound state here, the impurity is still Is still screened. Here, the bound state has higher energy and the impurity becomes unscreened, but still it can be screened at some higher energy. While in this regime, it cannot be screened at all. This is the local moment regime, and there is no impurity screening. Is it all for attractive bulk interaction? The attractive bulk that opens a gap in the screen sector. In the screen sector. And for repulsive part contacting, you could still solve that by beta and because it doesn't generate the gap. Yes. Then it's not a superconductor. Then it's very simple. Here, the interesting thing is this competition. Okay, so summarizing what I had before was semi-classically, Classically, without fluctuation, I have just the YSR regime. Here, the regime becomes much, the phase diagram becomes much more interesting. I have the contour regime, YSR regime, which occupies only a small part, and the unscreened part. So the quantum fluctuations destroy YSR over the most of the phase diagram. Okay, now I want to change topics. Now I want to change topics, go on a totally different physics, and I will find very similar phase diagrams. That is why I find it very interesting. So really the subject is what happens if you have two different mechanisms which compete between them. Then you have typically, if one mechanism dominates, you have one behavior. Dominates, you have one behavior, another mechanism dominates, you have another behavior, and in between, when they are of the same order, you have totally new behavior. And this turns out to be quite general. So the model that I'm going to be interested in is the Kondo model again, but now with no remission coupling constant. Now, this is not crazy. Now, this is not crazy. The condom model can be studied under new platforms where we have, for example, ultraviolet atoms, superconducting bits, written vapor atoms. And there are a lot of ways of studying the condo effect where now the environment interferes with the condo screening. And in particular, I'll be describing the non-hermission. Describing the non-hermission terms as being approximate limb blood dynamics. I will explain in the next slide. So for now, I will talk about the condor Hamiltonian. Here is the kinetic energy, the electrons coming in and out, hitting the impurity at point zero. But the coupling constant chain now is complex. So, this was realized, such a model, in an AMO system where you have a gas of ytterbium atoms. We have two fermionic quantum orbitals. So, you have the gas where when the atoms are excited, they become slow and heavy and they interact with. They interact with atoms in the ground state, but the situation is unstable. The system then is of the form a condo system coupled to an environment, but we can lose energy to the environment or gain energy, and then we have to let me skip the experimental part. Then instead Instead, to take into account the environment, you have to study limb blood dynamics, where in addition to the so now you have to study, instead of wave functions eigenstate, you need to study the density matrix, which is coupled to Limblad jump operators in these canonical ways. And this is And this is valid when the environment is Markovian and weakly coupled. There is a big study about that, which I'll assume occurs here. Then introducing various jump operators, I will show how we can obtain our complex Hamiltonian. But looking at this time evolution, this This expression here, I can think about as an effective Hamiltonian where I can add to the Hamiltonian L dagger L terms, this and this, and I will have an effective Hamiltonian which includes this term. But notice that there is I here, which is imaginary, and And what I will so here is the explicit derivation following the work of Nakagawa, Kawakami, and Ueda, where one indeed can show that one can describe the system that I showed earlier by introducing two body loss operators, L plus minus, given by the operators F. By the operators F and C. C are the electrons, and F make up the local impurity. So the impurity can be destroyed or created by local interaction with the gas. So if I drop some operators, and this is valid if I do measurements on sufficiently short. Short time scale, the effective Hamiltonian now becomes complex with real and imaginary parts of the coupling constant, which now include the effects of the two-body loss operators. So the question that I want to study is what happens to the dynamics of a Hamiltonian, which is no longer in a No longer permission. So your disputer is not couple to only other servers, but couple to every point of inside of the system? So impurity is local? Yes, but I'm talking about this feature, this feature. So could you go back to the previous one? So this is So this FMTB Hamiltonian, if I look at this FMTB Hamiltonian, they see that the dispers coupled to every coupled with every it's coupled locally. The F operators are the operators that create and annihilate the impurity. Yes, but uh uh you you wrote the picture of the system and it it seems like that the dissipated recovery only at the surface of the system. So, this is a generic picture. So, I really, the environment and these are the same. But if you have a 1D chain, the question is, I think if you couple either boundaries or to every site in the chain, there will be a boundary. No, no, no. Now I don't have a chain. I have a localized impurity in a gas where the electrons. Which electrons can form the impurity or be destroyed by it. So it's a local interaction, and the original quantum model is not a one-dimensional model, it's a three-dimensional model where you come in and out. And that is the picture that I have seen. But unlike, but now the impurity can decay. That is the important thing. Dissipation couples just to the impurity. To the impurity. Exactly. Yeah, I was just wondering, can you say a little bit more about the justification for dropping the jump short? Of course, you can always say at very short time scales as well. But you're just following basically one sort of quantum trajectory. Exactly. That's what I'm doing. So what is the time scale here? It's going to be essentially one overtake. Okay, so what so now I have to look at the beta function again describes the RG flow and the very interesting RG flow emerges where here you have the real and imaginary Imaginary parts of the diagram, and you see that there is different behavior. You have the behavior here in red, which flows still to strong coupling, and then you have a regime where the Rg turns around and comes again to zero. And then you have here intermediate regime, which is has totally different behaviour. Has totally different behavior. And what about the value pi for the let's say for the phase 5? I mean, usually when you change the coupling, the negative to the thermomagnetic waves. No, no, no, you have no condo effect, right? Yeah, so here I will not have Kondo effect. So the Kondo effect is only in this part of the diarrhea. This part of the dialogue, all those trajectories which are going to flow to strong copy. Conventional this limit. It's still valid in part of the phase diagram. So it's very, in a sense, what I want to argue, it's similar to what happened before. Now, I showed the phase an RG flow earlier, which is not identical, but what is But what is common is that there is part of it which flows to strong cutting, part of it which flows back to weak coupling. Maybe I'll show that if you remember this one here. Totally different system, but the RG behavior is similar. You see here we have again, we Again, in the dissipative system, I have real and imaginary. Here I have two couplings: one which is the bulk interaction and one which is the impurity. And of course, the impurity doesn't affect the bulk. The bulk is going to keep flowing to infinity, but the impurity can either flow to combo, to strong coupling, or it turns over and goes to zero, that is the local. And goes to zero, that is the local moment regime. And in between, we have the y's r. So, surprisingly enough, the same behavior occurs in the dissipative system. The geometry is a bit different, but you will see that we have. See that we have indeed behavior, a similar behavior, and that indicates the competition between different mechanisms. One is the fluctuation and one is dissipation. If the quantum fluctuations dominate, we flow to control. Dissipation dominates, the impurity is going to end up unscreened, and in between we have something that RG is not powerful enough to tell us what it is. And to tell us what it is, we have really to solve the model to understand. Okay, so we have then three regimes. Here is the condo regime, the impurity. The coupling flows to strong coupling. We have here an unscreened regime, and in between, we have the YSR regime where the impurity is still screened by the impurity. Is still screened by the electrons, but now locally rather than so it's a local electron is captured at the impurity site and screened it, rather than have the condo phase where the impurity cloud is formed and screens it non-locally. And then we have again a crossover to the unscreened regime. Screen because I was afraid of that. Okay. I never managed to fit it in time. Okay, so here we have Beta answer to question. The interesting thing is now that we have the That we have the phase, namely the coupling constant, which is C e to the I phi, occurs here. And now we have to be able to solve beta ansatz and look at solutions which are not the canonical solution. Canonical solutions are either real or a complex conjugate pairs, which could be strings or white pairs. But here we have to But here we have to deal with solutions that go off the real lines, and it turns out that we can really control them in a very beautiful way. You see, this term here is not Hermitian, and it drives the lambda, the spin-momenta solution of the beta-Anzatz equation of the real line. But since it's a one-time, Align, but since it's a one over L term, we can control it exactly and find analytic expression to the locus of the solution away from the real line. And these are analytic and numerical control solutions. And okay, so now I have plugging in this solution. I find that I have this face. Have these phases emerging. So let me skip all of that. I have so the condo phase occurs when the coupling alpha, which is the imaginary part, is in this regime. We can compute the energy. Can compute the energy of the ground state, and you find that it has a real and imaginary part, as you expect. In other words, it decays, there is a decay rate due to the two-body loss which we
