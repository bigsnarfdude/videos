My first comment is: this session is called phylogenetics. I think Savi talked about phylogenetics. I am not talking about phylogenetics. I don't think anybody else in the session is talking about phylogenetics. So, I don't know what this session is about, but I'm just going to talk about what I'm going to talk about. And so, what I'm talking about is And so, what I'm talking about is population structure, which is not necessarily phylogenetics. And I'm also talking about Entrobase, which is basically an environment to look at population structure. And I'll tell you where Entrobase came from, what it has in it, and then at the end, I'll start talking about actually using things like this for taxonomy. So if we go on, going back to 2012, this is pre-MySeq. And so the procedure for a lot of us was you sequence short reads with a lot of difficulty. You do bioinformatics, you do all sorts of things, calculating assemblies, calculating pan and core genomes. Core genomes, you do maximum likelihood. Anyway, you do all of these things, and then you go back to step one, you do 25 more genomes from the next study, and then you do it again, you do another 25 more genomes from the next study, and at that point, I got bored. I mean, people kept doing this, but I got bored. And so I decided instead of repeating this forever, to just come up with an alternative that didn't bore me and that would also help me. That didn't bore me, and they would also help people who didn't want to do the same thing again and again. And so, what this was was Entrobase. And who set this up, set up the whole concept with me was German Zao, who's been one of the major developers of Entralbase. And then we got two other people involved, Nabil Ali Khan and Martin Sargent. And over a few years, they set up the basics of Entrobase. So it's gone. Basics of Entrobase. So it's gone public since 2015. And then the last few years, we've developed it to where it has additional unique functionalities that I'll get to in a moment. So right now, and since 2015, you don't have to do what I just described before. You still have to sequence, sequence short reads, any number of bacterial strains, upload the short reads to Androbase, and then go for lunch. And they go for lunch because it's going to take about two hours. And after two hours, Entrobase has done its magic, and your short reads are assembled and annotated and genotyped, and you can start analyzing them. As of next year, you can do it differently. You can get your own entropy base. You can get a local entropy installed locally. Then you go back into sequence short reads, upload the short reads, and I take a coffee break because you can throw as many. Because you can throw as many CPUs at it as you want to dedicate. And then your local entra-base has done all the assemblies for you. If you want to do genotyping, you have to have your local enterbase talk to central entrabase, and then you can get them genotyped as well. So it gives you a bit more flexibility. Going back to 2015, comparative bioinformatics to a lot of people. Informatics to a lot of people consisted of developing pipelines of large numbers of independent programs. And they'd now moved up to higher throughputs. They were downloading up to a few thousand genomes or short reads from NCBI and then using their pipelines to more efficiently create trees and reformat the data for each program and draw cartoons and publish a manuscript. And after they did this two or three times, they could write it. They did this two or three times, they could write a PhD thesis. This is wonderful training for a bioinformatician as a doctoral student. But I'm not a doctoral student anymore. I haven't been in a few decades. And so as far as I was concerned, I wanted to get rid of all of this and just replace order-based. And so we're into stage two now. What does that actually do for you? Firstly, it already contains hundreds of thousands of auto. Hundred thousands of automated assemblies and annotations from public short read archives or that have been uploaded by its users. It does automated genotyping of core genomes. I'm going to get to what MLST is in a moment. So if you don't know what it is, just stay with me. It does automatic maximum likelihood trees of non-repetitive SNPs. We limit it to 200 genomes for our normal use. Genomes for our normal uses, but for us, we can do more. It does automatic minimum spanning or neighbor joining trees of allelic differences of core genes, up to 100,000 genomes. And you can download a limited number of annotated genomes now, but we're moving it onto the cloud, so you should be able to download anything you want it very soon. More important, it has multiple novel tools and pipelines, and it includes hierarchical clusters. And it includes hierarchical clustering, which gives you standard designations and taxonomies. And that's the most exciting thing about what Enterprise is doing now. So these two, I'm not very good at publishing. I've gotten tired and I don't like writing. And so we haven't been publishing very much. But some of the stuff's been coming out recently. And so I'll be showing you grape trees. You grape trees. You saw another example two days ago. Itaki is the back end of Entrobase. It's a standalone program. So it does all these pipelines and assemblies and MLST methodologies and so on for you. And you don't need Entrobase for that. PEPAN is, as far as we're concerned, the state-of-the-art pangenome program for calculating pangenomes and core genomes. And we just recently published. Genomes, and we just recently published papers showing it's better than everything else. Sparse is a very, very good way to work with metagenomics. So, you can just pull short reads out and then combine it with eTalki to get assemblies. And then this lets us include ancient DNA at introbase as well, which we already have. And then this is not published yet, but it's available in bioarchive, BlastFrost. BlastFrost. It's an alternative to BLAST and equivalent programs, and it's faster and it can work on lots and lots of genomes. And so if you haven't got a screenshot, you can just get this once this talk goes public in a few hours or two. So, sorry. This is for people who don't know what MLST is. MLST is, which probably includes most virologists, and there's a lot of you here. So MLST is multi-local sequence typing, and it replaces sequences with allele designations. So each sequence, each unique sequence gets a unique number. And then you have sequence types. So for example, sequence type four might Might consist of alleles 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1 for the seven genes that are involved. And that was seven gene MLST, which we and others developed in the mid-1990s. It's now morphed into a whole genome MLST, which is the entire pangenome. And so, for example, there's 21K genes in the pangenome. Genes in the pan genome of Salmonella, of which the core genome is a subset. So, Salmonella, the core genome, contains 3002 genes. And so we're doing alleles for 3,002 genes in every sequence type for CGMLST. I want to define lineage in a very distorted way. A lineage is what you see. Lineage is what you see in a tree. It may be real, it may be unreal, it may be has support, statistical support, it may not. This is what you would look at a tree and say, oh, look, this is the lineage. This is what most people do, and sometimes they go off and get statistical support as well. What we're doing instead is we're using greedy single-linkage hierarchical clustering to come up with clusters with designations. Come up with clusters with designations that are stable forever. So once you have that designation, you can keep going back to it and getting others in the same cluster. And we're doing this based on CGSTs, on CGMLST. But we're doing it for a number of different internal distances in the clusters. So we set up these distances based on trying everything there was and then chose. Everything there was, and then chose a limited number that we presented are public. And so I'll be talking here about HC5, HC900, and HC2000, and then one more level of these clusters. And so HC900, for example, is where the maximal internal branches in each cluster can be 900 different genes, 900 different alleles out of the 3002. Out of the 3002 lens almonella. And the HC2000 clusters are where it can be up to 2,000 different alleles. And an HC5 is where it's only up to five different alleles within a cluster. Let's start shifting over to data instead of these descriptions. What you look, I'm trying to show you here the stability of this hierarchical clustering. As you do more and more genomes, these are Do more and more genomes, these are rarefaction curves. As you do more and more genomes, the number of clusters keeps going up and up and up. So, part A at 100,000 salmonella genomes, we're up to 1,550 AC900 clusters. We're up to 928 AC2000 clusters. But if you look at big clusters with at least At least 0.1% of all data. They go stable almost immediately. After a few hundred genomes, you've already got all your big clusters. And in all Salmonella, we're seeing only 96 HC900 clusters and only 81 HC2000 clusters. And then the rest is smaller stuff. And those big clusters account for more than 93%. More than 93% of all salmonella genomes at the level of AC2000, and about 90% at the level of AC900. So most of the salmonella genomes belong to a limited number of large clusters, and then there's a lot of smaller ones. And those large clusters are what most of epidemiology is about. This shows you a grape tree, I mentioned that before, on 33,000 genomes based on, it's a ninja and J tree based on core genome MLST. And here you're seeing these lineages. So I would say, for example, if you look at this stuff at about three o'clock, then Then you can. I'm trying to get a pointer. Here we go. Over here. If you look over here, this would be a lineage. It's an enteridious lineage. It contains multiple HC900 groups in here. This is another lineage, a type of murium lineage. It contains multiple HC9000s. It contains multiple HC900 groups. Each HC900 group tends to be a servar. So these are things that people have known about for 100 years. But the uniformity of these has not been as clear until now. So what this is showing you is ST complexes in Salmonella equate to cerevars and can be seen by these HG Manhunter designations. But maybe more But maybe more interesting, you can just, you don't need a tree. You can just look at within an intro base at the experimental data. And you can take, these are five different salmonella genomes. Salmonella genomes, and you look at their HC numbers. This is what we're showing everybody: we're showing HC0, which is indistinguishable, up to HC2850, which is a subspecies level. And you can see that these typhumurians, for example, have joined completely at the HC900 level, but stayed separate from these anatoms up to the HC2600. The HC2600 level. So, and anytime you want, you just do a right-click on this, you get everything at that level. And so, this is just a cartoon showing you how you can do a tree without doing a tree. These are numbers. We've got six genera, which are among the most common causes of bacterial disease, and it's shown. And it's showing you how many genomes we have in them. So, for Salmonella, it's currently 270,000. The smallest of these is Yersinia. The number of whole genome MLST loci streptococcus is particularly diverse. Vibrio is mad. All Vibrio is 150K on genes in the pan genome. This is the number of CGMLST loci where you're. CGMLST loci we're using for these population structures. HC5 is being used for epidemiology. Single source outbreaks of foodborne poisoning are usually or often marked as AC5 clusters. And so this is offering people in Europe, for example, and elsewhere, a chance to see where their latest outbreak of foodborne poisoning is. Outbreak of foodborne poisoning has been coming from, and who's closely related. But it also goes international. These are the things I've just been talking about: AC900. So this is the number of these complexes or AC900 or 1100 or whatever. The number is different in different genera. And I'll get to this later. This is the number of species and subspecies. In some of these genera, there's many, many more. In some, there's less. Um so let's start looking how well this works. This is a minimum spanning tree of 9,500 genomes of Escherichia representing all the diversity in the whole genus. And it's the same tree in both of them. It's based on the 2512 core genes in Eschericia. And we've gotten rid of the branches in between that are. Rid of the branches in between that are longer, so all you're seeing is local clusters. In our original description of MST for Escherishia, these were the ST complexes that were assigned. And what you can see here is, for example, there's lots of white stuff. They're white because the system didn't last. We couldn't keep adding to it because we started having the potential. Potential uncertainty about which of these nodes things will belong to. They were intermediate. These are the colors on the AC1100 clustering, and everything gets assigned because it's a greedy scheme. They're largely congruent because these are natural populations. But in some cases, for example, here, this sort of For example, here, this sort of looks different from that because there's been a lot of recombination going on here. The statistical support is very high for the two different systems. I'm almost finished. I can see I'm running out of time as well. This is now going up to a taxonomic level. These are taxonomic designations: Esharisha, Shigella, and so on, clades. clades. These are ANI 95% designations, hierarchical clustering of ANI average nucleotide identity. And this is hierarchical clustering. And so these are almost identical. The only differences are here. There's a minor discrepancy here. And other than that, you can replace A and I totally with hierarchical clustering in this level. You can also do something which I had not anticipated. This is all Yersinia now. This is hierarchical clustering HC1490, which is the subspecies level. But this is amazing. This is presence-absence of the pangenome, of individual genes in the pan genome, and the topologies are almost identical. Are almost identical. The only exceptions between genetic diversity topology and presence-absence of the accessory genome are this arrow here versus that one there, and this arrow here versus that one there. And the rest of it has the same topology. It doesn't matter if it's the pan genome and content, gene content, or sequence diversity, you get the same topology. And that's what we're getting. Topology, and that's what we're getting on all these different genera, on top of which, we're also getting all sorts of new species from these stars and so on. So, we're saying that basically you can just replace A and I and classical taxonomy with hierarchical clustering. This is my final slide. So, Entrabase gives you public access, state-of-the-art tools, people have been involved recently. People have been involved, recent work, Germans out, Nina Luma, and Jane Charlesworth. And thanks for listening. Sorry, I went on so long. Thank you very much, Mark. We have time for one quick question, because then you'll have a question for Mark. I have a very quick one. The public version of Entrabase that you suggested, is that something that other groups could have a version? Have a version of that they put on they make a public database of their data, or would that just be a private repository for them? So, what we're doing now is I'm retiring in a year and a half from now. And so I want to give this away. And to do this, we're looking for members. To do this, we're looking for members to join a federation. And the other thing is we want to expand this to additional organisms. So if anybody who's working with viruses would like to get involved in this, we will be overjoyed to set up intro base for, for example, COVID or for. For example, COVID or for flu, and then have other people curate it and just have them get in touch with me. However, there has to be one central entrobase for genotyping, otherwise you end up with confusion. So we're going to give people free access. So local enterbase does all the pipelines and so on. But if you want a genotype, like it's hierarchical clustering, that is going to have to communicate. That is going to have to communicate with central interbase and make all of the data public. Thank you.
