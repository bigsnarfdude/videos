University in France, too. So, the context and motivation of her work is the flow of non-Brulean suspensions, which are mixtures of hard particles larger than a micron, so that they're not so affected by Brunei and motion in fruit. And these are systems that you can encounter in many industrial or natural setups. And here I just And here I just show two rather catastrophic settings for suspensions, which are a landslide occurring in Switzerland in 2017. So it's a large flow of suspension. And in 2018, a tsunami which was probably due to a submarine avalanche on the bottom of the ocean near the coast of Indonesia. And in both natural And in both natural and also many industrial setups, the volume of the particle phase in the suspension is not conserved, and rather, some sort of pressure on the particle phase is imposed. So, for example, in natural setups, often gravity plays a role. And so, particle sediment, and it's rather the pressure that is imposed by gravity that governs the flow than some sort of fixed volume. And another important aspect of these systems is that the flow is often unsteady. Unsteady. They do not have time constraint to reach their steady flow, and the transients are crucial. So, for example, here in the case of the tsunami, as you can see in this kind of sketch, so this paper, for example, by Nekata et al., I explained that most probably the very initial stage of the tsunami sets the deformation of the surface of the water, which later on will lead to a propagation through the form of a tsunami. So, here, understanding the very early So, here understanding the very early motion of these suspensions is crucial. So, that's our main motivation, which is to understand now the transient rheology of suspension under constant pressure or fixed imposed pressure. But before turning to transient, let me just recall a bit of rheology of the steady state of these systems. So, if you consider a very idealized situation of a simple shear, we have a suspension. Situation of a simple shear where you have a suspension between two walls, and the bottom wall is fixed and not permeable to neither particles nor fruit. And the top wall is mobile, but is permeable to fruit only and not to the particles. And on top of this wall, you apply an external pressure that you call PP, and you shear this wall with a velocity such that the shear rate in the cell is gamma dot. And to do this, you have to impose a stress which is tau. Now, Star. Now, dimensional analysis for non-Boolean suspension tells you that the only non-dimensional parameter in the system is the ratio of the viscous stresses, eta F, where eta F is the viscosity of the fruit times gamma naught over the typical stress scale for the particles, Pp. And then the two rheological laws, so the volume fraction and the ratio of And the ratio of shear stress over normal stresses in the suspension are function of this non-dimensional shear rate only, J. And these two neurological laws can be measured. So these are experiments by Boy et al., famous experiment by Boy et al. showing both mu of J and phi as a function of J. So this is for the steady state rheology, which is then pretty simple. But the transits have a bit more phenomenology to them. Phenomenology to them. In particular, they show dilation. So, if you imagine you start from a system which is not in a steady state, and same thing, you apply pressure px and you shear the top wall with a such that you apply a shear rate gamma dot. If you're not in steady state, then the pressure in the particle pressure in the bulk is not equal to px, and so the wall will move either up and down, but the system dilates to go towards its steady state at phi of j. Day. And in doing so, so the world goes, but also the particles, the particle phase moves up. And because you have volume conservation, then the frit phase has to be sucked in and to move down. And then the relative motion, this very relative motion of particle phase and frit phase is what calls for a two-phase description of the system, where you consider separately the velocity of the frit phase and the velocity of the particle phase. The particle phase, the incompressibility of the overall mixture, the conservation of the mass of the particle phase, and then the two-momentum equation, one for the fruit phase and one for the particle phase. So in this description, this two-phase description here, in this talk, I will really focus on the effect of two terms, the green and red terms here. So the green term being the interface drag, which so the really the force. Which, so the really the force that the particle phase applies locally on the fruit phase, or inversely, the force that the fruit applies on the particles, which is usually often modeled by some sort of suspension balance model, which states that this drag is proportional to the velocity difference between the two phases multiplied by a resistance function that depends only on the volume fraction. And the other important piece in this two-phase description is the particle phase stress. The particle phase stress sigma p. And here the question is whether we can describe a transient flow with only the steady state rheology, just stating well, mu of j and phi of j, or whether we need some kind of extension to account for transients in the system. So to address these questions, we performed discrete elements method simulations, where we consider a two-dimensional system made of disks, and they are sheared between the two walls. They are sheared between the two walls made of particles. Again, the bottom wall is fixed, you know, setup. The top wall moves freely. We apply a pressure px and a velocity such that we have a shear rate gamma dot. The total height of the system is h. And so that we control the actually the JX, so the applied viscous number, which is defined here as eta f gamma over px. And we run the simulations in the Stokes regime, so we neglect all inertia on the. So, we neglect all inertia on the freedom of the particles. And the particles are subject to forces, which are frictional contacts, lubrication forces between nearby particles, and Stokes drag with respect to background velocity Vf, which is simply assumed to go horizontally as gamma dot times y and vertically as zero. So, here this choice, so okay, we prescribe Vf, we don't compute the velocity field in the fluid phase, and this may sound odd with what. And this may sound odd with what I just said, which is that in these direct and flows, the relative motion of the fruit phase and the particle phase is important. So it may sound as a node choice to fix VF. But actually, in this setup, because we have perdic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction, nothing very interesting. There's no gradient in this direction, and all the non-trivial features happen in the vertical direction, so that the flow is actually quasi-1D. Is actually quasi-1D, and you can show easily that the permeation flow, so the fluid that goes down through the grain matrix during dilation, ends up acting like a drag which is proportional to the vertical velocity of the particle phase and in the opposite direction. And it's actually the exact same property that has the Stokes drag that we're using. So just in this setup that we're using, so it's a simple shear where the top wall moves up, the Stokes drag. Where the top wall moves up, the stokes ride is qualitatively right and is, of course, much simpler to simulate than the actual flow field through the proverb space, especially 2D. So with this, we run simulations where we have a protocol to explore transients, which is the following, which is step in J. We start at the given J, so here at the low J value, Gi tends to the minus 4. We wait for long enough time so that we're in steady state. Long enough time so that we are in steady state, and then suddenly we switch J to a larger value. So, in this case, if we switch J to a larger value, what happens is that the pressure that we apply externally is transiently smaller than the pressure that the grains apply on the top wall. And as a consequence, the top wall moves up and you have dilation of the system. So, this is what you see here: that the height of the system goes up. And because of the dilation, the particle phase moves up, and because of the drag on the particle phase, then the pressure on Particle phase, then the pressure on the bottom of the cell is much larger than the pressure on the top. And this is what you can see here by measuring the pressure at the bottom divided by px. In steady state, of course, px is uniformly verified in the system, so you have at the pressure at the bottom is the same than px. So this ratio is one. But then when you switch up the x and all j, you have an overshoot in the pressure compared to the pressure you apply on the top. The pressure you apply on the top due to the drag of the field on the particle phase. And this also has a consequence on the shear stress that you have to apply on the top wall. Same thing, if you measure the shear stress divided by the steady stress that you would expect in steady condition, then this is one before changing J because you're in steady state. But because of the large pressure at the bottom of the cell, you also have a large stress at the bottom of the cell and a large stress actually everywhere in the sample and including on the top wall. Sample and including on the top wall. And this leads to the stress that you have to apply in the top wall being 20 times larger than what you would evaluate by simple steady state rheology. So what it says here is that interface drag during dilation makes dilation extremely, well, dilatant system extremely hard to shear. And we can also see, well, these are global quantities, say, but we can also look at local quantities. And here I Quantities and here I show the pressure field along the height of the system, and so you see again at the bottom of the cell, the pressure is much smaller than at the top of the cell. And this is during the transient. And if you increase the strain, so this is at early strain, but if you increase the strain, you will see that the profile will progressively go back to something uniform in the system. And this is translated also on the right, in the this mirror on the right by the volume fraction field. The volume fraction field, which shows how dilatancy happens in the system. You start initially at very large volume fraction, very uniform. You end up at the end of this in the new steady state at a uniform system at low volume fraction. But in between, you dilate. And the interesting thing here is that you dilate non-uniformly. You dilate faster at the top than at the bottom. Okay, so that's for the local phenomenology. And now I'd like to turn to the constitutive model that you. The constitutive model that you have to use to account for this phenomenology. So, come back to the two-phase flow that we were describing earlier, except that here we have massive simplifications because we have this quasi-1D setup where everything interesting happens in the y direction. We also neglect inertia, so we don't have any inertial terms in the momentum equations. And we also prescribe the fruit velocity, so we don't have anything to say about the So, we don't have anything to say about the momentum equation about the field velocity. So, we end up with only two simple equations on the particle phase: it's mass conservation on the particle phase and momentum conservation on the particle phase. And this momentum conservation, you see that everything it says is that the gradient of pressure is here to compensate the drag from the freedom on the particles. So, now I could just couple these equations together by noting that V appears in both, and I end up with one single P D looking equation. PD looking equation, which involves the volume fraction and the pressure. Of course, this is not close because you need a constitutive model to go further here. But before doing that, I just non-dimensionalize this by using gamma dot for the inverse time unit, for instance. And you end up here instead of a time derivative, you have the strain derivative, and here instead of the pressure, you have the inverse of the viscous number. So, again, to close this equation, you need a constituent model. Question: You need a constitutive model, and here there are two routes in the literature. Most works we would assume that we can use even in this results the steady rheology, or at least that's the first assumption we can make, and this is often done. So, here you would say, well, phi is at any time the steady state, is at any time its steady state value. So, I can replace phi here, and I would end up with a diffusive equation for j, so for the stress, with a time derivative here of the stress, and here two spatial derivatives. Spatial derivatives. But there is another route that's been explored by Paya and Pulika, where they proposed actually that they proposed a local dialect in C-Low, which you can think of as, you know, by contrast to the steady philology, where you say, well, at any time I track the steady state philology. Bayan Polycarp proposed at any time I relax towards the steady state philology, and I do so with the typical strength scale gamma naught. So if you want the steady phiology, it's just the Want the steady availology is just the limit of the pi-and polygammod when gamma naught tends to zero. So you relax instantaneously fast towards the steady state. So this looks like a benign extension of the steady aerology, except that it has a very important consequence in our case, because t gamma phi is also what appears in the mass conservation here. And so you can equate the right-hand side of these two equations, and if you do so, you end up with an ODE on the stress. So you, in the SELI model, you have a PDE on the stress, a diffusive PD, but in the bion. The stress, a diffusive PDE, but in the Paya and Polyca, you have an ODE on the stress, and of course, this has completely different behavior. In particular, if in this ODE, that means that I know, or there's some form of locality in the sense that if I change anything in the boundary condition here, part of the bulk will know about it instantaneously because it's not a PD, but I don't know if how much of the bulk will know it. Well, then you can extract a length scale out of this equation. For example, if you linearize this equation, you have a If you linearize this equation, you have a typical length scale for the non-locality, which here would read it is proportional to gamma naught divided by j squared times the derivative of the rheological law. And just to make things clear, in our case, what this would mean is in our case of type of J, so again, if you start at small J and you increase suddenly a GF, if you measure the pressure in the system, what you expect to see is that in the case of the steady relog, you have a diffusive behavior. So instantaneously, well, if you just after the step of AFJ, Well, if you just after the step of AFJ, instantaneously the bird doesn't know anything about the change of boundary condition at the top, except at a very small layer here. Whereas, if you look, if you use the Payan polycam model because of DODE, you have knowledge, the bulk has instantaneous knowledge of the change of the boundary condition on the length scale of order L. So, well, we can check this in our case. And indeed, here is the pressure profile. So, in Pressure profiles in continuous lines, or the pressure profiles that we obtain for a given J in our simulations at a very early strains after changing J. Indeed, we see that these continuous profiles are very far from the dashed profiles which correspond to the diffusive behavior of the steady U of J realology and actually much closer to the dashed profiles of the Paya and Pulikan model with a given gamma node. And this is true. Okay, here I showed two different Here show two different J's, but this is true for all the cases that we could test. So that means in our simulations, the statyology is not able to capture the profiles, whereas the Pi and Polycan gives a reasonably good agreement. So it seems that there is indeed this local lay latency effect at play, and that this local layout effect induces non-locality in the stress. So this non-locality, I should, well, is well. Should well is well, once you agree that the non-locality, we could characterize it as a function of the parameters of the problem. And again, if I write the non-locality length scale associated to the linearized equation, we see that close to janning, so close to j equals zero, when we reach phi c, if gamma naught is constant, we expect that actually this non-locality length scale diverges. In practice, if we measure gamma naught in a In practice, if we measure gamma naught in our simulations, so if we fit the stress profiles like I just showed you for every single J that we tested, we see that at large J the gamma load is constant, but at low j actually gamma decreases. However, it decreases in such a way that the slope here is such that we still expect that the L diverges when J goes to zero. And on top of that, here this decrease of that here this decrease of gamma naught i should stress that um in our case it's possibly attributed to uh can possibly be attributed to a finite size effect because um if we look at h to the height of the system over l as a function of j you see that the region for which gamma node decreases here which are for j smaller than 10 to the minus 3 say corresponds to regions for which the non-locality length scale reaches the size of the system so probably there is a finite size effect There is a finite size effect here. Okay, so with this, I'd just like to conclude. So we showed two things. The interface drag, say, which is here to, which comes from the pore pressure gradient flow of the fluid permeating through the particle matrix, leads to an excess in macroscopic friction. So you have an overshoot of the stress when you dilate. We also showed that there is a local dilatancy law at play in our system. So we cannot use the steady U of J regime. We need to extend it to this bay and polycarlo. And this local dilatancy dynamics also induces some non-locality in the stress. And this non-locality in turn also increases the resistance to dilatancy. So this has probably important effects on the impacts. The impacts, the situations of impacts on suspension. So, the effect of drag on the particle phase is known on the impacts where you would look at the suspension and look at the effect of an impactor on the surface of the suspension. However, the effect of the non-locality, I think, has not been explored. And I think this will be worth trying to see whether these non-locality effects could dominate the physics there or so. And one also, another important Another important system where it could matter a lot is systems where you are close to Phi C or at Phi C, just like for example sediments, which are just j equals zero and startup of flow of sediment, startup flow of sediments, for example, could be strongly influenced by the fact that distant locality diverges. And finally, I'd like to conclude by pointing to this possibility that opens coming from the fact that the local From the fact that the local dilatancy law that we use, the PI and Polycarn law, is very similar to the dilatancy as you could describe it above Phi C, so the Reynolds dilatancy. And this opens the possibility that there is actually a unified description of dilatancy below and above 5. So, with this, I'd like to thank you, and I'm happy to take any questions. Thank you. Good. Thank you, Romain. There are a few questions. I'd like to start. There are a few questions. I'd like to start with one. The solid phase and the liquid phase are both incompressible. So, in order to have an expansion of the total volume... Yes. Do you mean the particles themselves are incompressible or the solid phase as a phase? Sorry, I think. There must be a source or a sink of fluid. Or a sink of fluid somewhere. Yes. Does it enter uniformly over the flow domain, or does it, how is it brought in? Yes, so here, so in our case, the fluid velocity is assumed to be zero. So, I mean, it's not a realistic description in the sense that in an actual setup, what we want to limit is a flow that comes from the top here. So, we want to take the flow. The top here. So, we want to take the fluid on top and say the top wall is permeable to the fluid. So, when the top wall moves up, the fluid goes through the wall and then permeates through the particle matrix. In our case, we don't actually simulate the fluid velocity, so we just assume a fictitious, if you want, background flow. But the fictitious background flow is taken such that its effect on the momentum conservation for the particle is exactly the same, then, well, exactly the same. Exactly the same, and then well, exactly the same. It's qualitatively the same than what you would have if you were considering the full flow of rate. Thank you. There are two questions, both asking about the drag. And Monica asks, do you couple this first phase with the background flow with a Stokes drag? And then Abby had a question also about Stokes flow. So I think I'll let Abby come in and ask his question and incorporate Monica's question there. Monica's question there. Javi, you want to uh talk? Yeah, yeah, thanks, thanks, Mark. Hey, Roman, that's great, great, great talk. So, I had a few questions. So, the system you're simulating is still a Stokes flow, right? Sure, yes, it is. So, where does the time scale or the strain scale come from in the system? I mean, why the transfer is not instantaneous? Like, that would you would assume from the store's flow? From the stored flow? Yes, so the time scale here comes from the resistance of the system to dilation. So if you want to dilate, you need to take some fruit up. Well, okay, no simulations, actually, you need to move the particles through the system, and you have a Stokes rug that resists this upward motion. And so this Stokes rug actually gives you Give you a time scale. So, if you want to go from this height to twice the height with a given pressure, then that gives you a time scale to do this just based on the resistance that the freedom pose to the particles. So, it's related to the initial panic fraction? Yes, yeah, entirely, yes. So, indeed, so if you look at how fast it goes, well, maybe I can show you this. So, here you see this is dilation case. So, it's very slow, and actually, you need a few hundred. Very slow, and actually, you need a few hundred strain units to get to get back to steady state. Now, let me show you on the same scale. Sorry, I skip a lot, but on the same scale, this is a case where you compact. So, this is a case where you start from a large J and you go to a low J. So, in this case, you don't dilate, you do the opposite, you can get more compact. And you see that everything is much faster. And this is indeed the effect of, I mean, it all depends on the pressure that you apply on the top wall here. You apply on the top wall, yeah. And it's is it a strain or a time scale? Um, it is a well, okay, uh it is a time scale, uh, but because of the dimensionality of well, the fact that J is still the only dimensionless parameter in the problem, you can easily convert it to a strain scale here. So, I mean, I would, I would, I would think of it as a, as a, as a time scale because it's really the time scale. I mean, if you don't share, that's really the time scale, you need to compress the system from. You need to compress the system from one density to another through the resistance provided by the stocks rack. But once you shear the given gamma dot, you can convert this time to a strength scale. Thank you. Thank you. I'll let maybe Marco ask his question. We should move on. Marco asked how you define the Stokes drag with which viscosity? Yes, so here we use a 3D-like Stokes rag. 3D like Stokes-Rag, so 6πf, the velocity of the particles times the radius. And eta f, again, the viscousity of the field disappears in the non-dimensionalization rate. So it enters the viscous number. So nothing depends at the end on this. Once you've done this non-dimensionalization, nothing depends on this viscosity. Ian, you want to come in? And that looks more like a statement than a question, so I'll let you make it. Question, so I'll let you make it. Well, I was just trying to, after that initial step, so the long decay, is that because basically all that's there in that model that you wrote down is sort of the shear-induced migration stuff that you would have left from the long time scale there, is that just because all you've got in there is All you've got in there is pretty relaxing to the sort of shear-induced migration to a new steady. Yeah, indeed. And so here it's very long because you're going to a very large GF, which means if you want a very small pressure. So at the end of the relaxation here, the balance between the bulk pressure and the external pressure is giving a resultant pressure which is pretty small on the wall. And so because of this pretty small resultant pressure, Of the pretty small resistant pressure, the system moves, the wall moves very slowly, right? And that's why you have this very slow relaxation. Whereas, in the other case that I showed, the compaction, you actually apply a very large pressure, so everything goes very fast because essentially the strength scale that you see is set by the ratio between the pressure and the resistance you put in the stokes rack. Okay, I guess it wasn't that clear later whether you were fitting gamma zero from the simulation or gamma zero was the input. Or gamma zero was the input to give. So gamma zero doesn't enter the simulations, right? I mean, it's only when we bother this, we do fit indeed gamma zero on the simulations, but it doesn't enter the simulations. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Very interesting talk. So the next talk is a shift from little rigid spheres.
