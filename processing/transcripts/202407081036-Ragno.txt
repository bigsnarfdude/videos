To be here, and also would be glad to receive your information and also some suggestions to our work going on with my professor, that is Marco Tubino, that we are carrying on for some years about river loops. And here there are some pictures about the river loose. Here is the Debo River, this one, but a little bit dancing. And this is a picture that I took from the plane coming here. So the long trip world. World review of Iceland, for example. You can see a stream here, there is a flat length and a river that decides to divide into branches that then rejoin in a single trunk, they proceed downwards. But what is a loop? A loop for us is a morphological unit. So I work in river morphology. And the river morphology studies why rivers look and behave the way they do. And sometimes they They do. And sometimes they decide to make these patterns. Okay? And the loops for us are morphological units that are composed essentially by two main features. One is the bifurcation, where the river splits and the fluxes are distributed, and are fluxes not just by water, as was Sanemika introduced, but also by sediments. So we have water and sediment that are distributed downstream. And then when the branches rejoin at the confluence, they proceed downwards. Okay? So some Sometimes we have this kind of loop as the Paraguay River. So you can see the two branches are open, okay? So both combine water and sediment, but then you can have like in the Varidana there, where the system changes a lot from each year, each year, okay? And sometimes there is a branch that crosses off. So we're trying to understand why they do this. But remember, so we are talking about rivers. So, we are talking about rivers, and the rivers they construct their own channels because they are able to rework, transport, and eventually deposited their own sediment. So, the channel co-evolves over time due to the fact that water shakes the river, but in turn, the shapes of the river changes the hydrodynamic field. So, there is this kind of field. But in this kind of meetings, I think that we will see a lot of I think that we will see a lot of talks about the networks, okay? And looping networks, and also rivers, often made the looping networks. I provide you some examples. There is again, I also choose the Nigeria Delta. So it's also a nice example of a looping network. But then you have also some nice pictures of greater rivers, like the Taramento River, close from where I live, and the Rio Negro in Brazil. And so you have seen all these patterns of loops that they Patterns of loops that they interact over each other. But other times, loops appear as individual morphological units. This is the topic of this talk. And here I draw a summary example, and I use this dichotomy. So with the fluvial or coastal looks, because they are radically different. So I won't talk about coastal looks here, but I just concentrated on fluvial environments. So there is no sea or there is no lake. No sea, or there is no lake downstream or upstream, this kind of feature. So they are embedded in, I don't know, in the Amazon or in the Amazonia rainforest or whatever. And the loops can be formed by different and several kind of mechanism. So here I just want to give you some hints about the mechanism that can form this loop. That can be different. So, and if a mechanism is different, also the shape that is created should be different. Okay, so for example, Should be different. Okay, so for example, here you have these kind of loops that form from a sediment that is deposited in stream of a river channel and eventually grow to this sediment and form an island. And an island is formed when the sediment raises the level of the floodplain. So eventually the vegetation grows, so the river splits and the rejoin. But other times the river forms like this kind of process that we call a varsion because the river decides to jump, usually it's triggered by a flood. Usually is triggered by a flood, for example, the river choose another path. And usually, these branches rejoin, dancing, and they form a loop. And not always, the two branches, one of them closes off. So they remain open, like this kind of loops that is open from since 60, 70 years. And in the middle, there are this process that is called cutoff. So it is usual of Sinos kind of rivers. And the Sinos river usually they have this. Ripper usually they have these side branches that are formed usually at the apex of each of my underbands. But loops are not only a prerogative of natural environments, let's say, but they are also created artificially by man. It is a very common engineering technique nowadays of these river restoration techniques that in straighten rivers, now side branches are reopened, okay. Branches are reopened, okay? But they are reopened nowadays, currently without any, let's say, kind of directed. For example, what is the spatial state that we have to create? This kind of side branches. So if we reopen, for example, here on the Drow River, secondary branches, it will remain open in the next future or not. And so this drives also to the main basic question of our work: that somehow we try. That somehow we try to understand if there is a characteristic spatial scale of river loops, okay, and how this spatial scale is somehow related to the morphodynamic processes that drive their evolution in time. Because it cannot be taken for granted that this kind of shape persists over time, because somehow they return to a single theory, but decide to return to a single tribe morphologies. Okay? And what we And what also we ask to ourselves at the beginning is: okay, we have rivers that are very different, that can be created with very different formative mechanisms. We can find them in very different climates, as we are in the Diave River, we are again close to Vera River in the Padana plain in Italy, in the north of Italy. So, this is a gravel, quite steep gravel bed rivers, and you see a nice look here. But here, we have in the Amazon rainforest, there is a tropical climate, so they are very different. Climate. So they are very different, but at the first sight they look quite similar. Okay, but how similar are they? So we have investigated the spatial structure of these roots. And when we are dealing with rivers, again, we have water and sediment. But when we decide to, for example, to compare different kinds of rivers, we have to choose a representative state of a river, because it is quite intuitive the fact that the water discharge of a river changes. That the water discharge of a river changes depending on the climate. So you can have low flow, you can have floods. And usually, what is done in rivers is to refer to what is called the bank flow condition. The back-through condition is when the discharge of a river is on the verge to spill onto the flood. So it essentially section is full of water. And you can see there, so it has a characteristic: a bank full depth, it has a width, but the river has. Width, but a river has also a sediment size, grain size. So you can characterize the geometry of a river in this kind of bankful condition, okay, in terms of a bankful desert and of a characteristic grain size of a river. So we have collected hundreds of data of this bankful geometry of different rivers for different sources in the territory. So we have information about the bankful discharge, the median grain size, that are our drivers. Insights that are our drivers and are associated to a width, a bandful depth, and a channel slope. And here you can see that we have measured the length of the branches, so hundreds of loops from different kinds of rivers. And here what you can see is the mean length, okay, so it's the average length of the era branches against the you can see from the okay, so I can. Okay, so I can move. Okay. Against the Bankful discharge that spans over five orders of magnitude. And you can see here that there is this nice power law where this mean length scale approximately with the square root of the Bankful discharge. So we have a sort of this kind of dimensional power law relationship. When we have a power law relationship, this is, let's say, this is a signature of a cell similarity. And again, I stress that we are studying individual loops, not networks, for now and not personal loops. So we perform, we scale our variables, so we have scaled our discharge with the gravity acceleration and the medium grain size, and our length by means of the geometry variables that we have. So the width and the depth of the river. And the depth of the river. And what we found is that our data collapse nicely on almost a single line. Here, these are 15 order of magnitudes of water discharge. Why there is 15 order of magnitude? This is because we have scaled the discharge by means of the median grain size. So we have a great rivers that we are separated here that are over these classical things that we do in river morphology to use the scale that is 2 millimeters. Use the scale that is two millimeters to separate two different kinds of rivers, greater self-bed rivers. Why? Because they have different kinds of transport modality of their sediment. But they separate in these two clusters and they collapse on this straight line. What it means is that the data suggested to us that the mean length of river loops actually scales with their geometry of the region. With their geometry of the ridge in which they are placed. And again, and another thing is that, so this length is weakly dependent, at least for the data, to the formative mechanism, to their climate, to their geologic context. So we have a sort of kind of universality, okay? And if you observe this kind of number here, if you scale the length of the river by means of the bankful depth, we have this nine number, this That we have this nine number, this like one under times pi. Okay, and if you can remember it, okay, because we'll come later. So, again, we have considered single loops, but how this scaling can be somehow give us, provide us some information about a network. So, here in gray dots, you can see that they are the same data that you have seen in the previous slide about single loops, individual loops. Of single loops, individual loops. Here they have the discharge, they have the mean length. All the other dots are data of the mean lengths of ANA branches from networks. Okay? So here you have a very small value because you are in a laboratory room, you are in Trento in this study, or there you have other kinds of rivers like the Raquaya or the Upper Yellow River. And as you can see, all these kinds of dots place quite consistently with the individual looks. The individual loops. So they are networks composed by several kinds of loops interconnected, but the mean length actually scales with the square root of this charge as an individual one. So this is nice, we like it, but why this? What we thought is the fact that the two things scaled nicely together because multi-thread rivers are composed by also sometimes even by hundreds of loops, but not all of them are active at the same time. Active at the same time. Because it is very common that what we see in rivers is that when we have a network of loops, the river tends to concentrate its discharge just in few channels. Sometimes it's just one channel that carries the whole sediment and the 90% of the discharge. So this is why we thought that it scales just like a single loop. But what we have seen so far have been like some sort of photographs of loops. So we have considered Of loops, so we have considered like a sort of time average length that we compute from data. But when we are seeing satellite images of loops, we observe that they move in time. So I say that we move from photographs to movies because they move. Even in the same region, you can observe that there is, for example, here a loop that is ringing and is being destroyed, but in a little further, a little bit downstream, there are these two that persist over time. Why? Why? So, yeah, there are more data about some North American rivers and South American rivers about this length to depth ratio that you have seen before by data through the years. And as you can see, this length change over time, okay, change, and this change is not monotonic. So, what we ask ourselves is that, okay, but is this the observe length scaling that we have measured? Scaling that we have measured is a sort of equilibrium state that a river can reach, or a dynamic equilibrium state. And okay, what are the drivers of the length adjustment that we see? And how is this the platform geometry of a loop is related with the distribution of water and settlement between the branches over time? And to answer with question against, we try at least to observe nature and to gain. Nature and to gain what can be the main drivers, the basic drivers of the length of variation. And here we start with the process that can elongate a river loop. And this is very common in vegetated rivers. The fact that when the river is in low flow, not during floods, so there is few, the river has a small depth, there is as low depth. Okay, there is a low discharge, as low velocity in the river, and what we can see is that the sediment usually is trapped over the loop and usually is colonized by vegetation. And in rivers, when this phenomenon occurs, as in the Reynolds River in Canada, as reported by Burch, you can see that over 50 years, this loop has elongated over time, okay, has elongated over. Time, okay, as elongate, elongate, elongate, elongate, and he's elongating. And what Bert is observed in his work is that this elongation in his looks is related with the discharge and the sediment that is distributed downstream by the stream. And what you observe is that when the branches combine almost the same amount of flow, this elongation process is faster. But at the same time, But at the same time, there are processes that can force the loop to recede and to erode, and these are almost occurring that are, sorry, usually occurring during floods. So another, let's say, stage of a river. So you are recording a sketch. So the river is in floods. There is a high flow. And so the river can remove the sediment that he has previously deposited. And here are And here are some data. So, this is, for example, the Lena River, and these are the erosion, they are the meters per year of the glutes that are eroded during floods that can be up to 50 meters per year. So it is a lot. Or here there is the big Sioux River, it is receding like 7 meters per year. So we are trying to combine these two processes in a model. And our evolution model has a Model as some basic hypothesis that we decide. So it is the first, it is a 1D model. And this is the scheme of the loop that we are considering. So you have a straight upstream channel, you have a straight downstream channel, and here you have two anabranches. You have a bifurcation, you have a confluence. And this system is fed by a discharge that can vary over time because you have sequences of floods, low flow, flats, low flow, flats. Low flow, floods, low flow, floods, low flow, and so on, and you have a sediment supply to your system. And sediment and water can be distributed unevenly down the channels. But then we make a strong hypothesis. We can discuss about that if you are interested in. At the present time, we are forcing the widths of the two branches to be the same, to be half the one of the upstream and the downstream widths. Okay? And another hypothesis. And another hypothesis is the fact that there are two main time scales in our model. It's the fact that the process of loop elongation and variation occurs on a time scale that is way slower than the time scale of the processes that occur at the bifurcation at the confluence. So it means that the flux adaptation is instantaneous with respect to the length variation. And another thing that, as you can see here, the branches have a sort of senuosity. Okay, so they are not a straight line, so they have a seniosity, and this senuosity we force it to be constant. So essentially, we have an equation for the channel length that change over time, that the length, the mean length of these announced is equal to their sinuosity, that is usually equal to one or two to two in nature. That with respect to the variation of the bifurcation conference distance. And the simple equation that we can write down, so we employ the Occam Grazer and we write this equation that is a simple ordinary differential equation for the variation of the mean length of the other branches. And here you have three principal terms. The first one is the term of elongation. Is the term of elongation here. And we write this elongation term as an exponential function. Why this? This is applies to all guess. But the main point is that you have a rate of variation. So this is the celerity, this is the time scale of your process. And here you have this term that is delta QS that is the sediment partition of in the downstream branches. And this is a function of length, as we will see in the next slide. And what is And what is telling us this exponential function is that it is maximum when this delta QS is zero. So it means that when the sediment discharge is distributed equally in the Dustin branches, the elongation process is at the maximum. And on the other hand, we have those processes that can erode and make our shortening of our loops. And here we have a function that is And here we have a function that is linearly dependent on the mean length. Again, this is our choice. It is a plausible guess that we have to verify. And then we have a function of the. Just one more minute. No, come. We start after. I started five minutes after. Please, please go on. Don't worry. Okay. But Okay. Okay. This is interesting. This is really interesting. Okay, but this is a function. So I just provide you with the main information of this equation. Okay. So this is a function of those shear stresses that also Libya presented. So it is proportional to the velocity of a river. And these two processes are weighted by the hydrological regime of the stream. And we approximated the sequences of floods and the low flow of a river with the probability of occurrence. The probability of occurrence, okay? So we have the rivers spend less time in floods with respect to the low flow. This can be intuitive. And maybe this can be interesting for the one for the fact that how we compute the sediment distal distribution. And for that, we have developed a model, a dock, for this, where it is a 1.5 model. If you are interested, we can discuss since I think that I don't have time. I don't know why. Okay, but these are essentially based on the fact that we have to model the bifurcation of the complex. And at the bifurcation, what do we have is that the bed can change due to the fact that we have to conserve the mass, not only the water. So the bed has to change and also the conference. The bed has to change and also the water level. And water, okay, and we have obviously we have the properties of the water. The properties of the wall reach, okay? The channel geometry. And at the end, what we found is that the behavior of our system depends on just two parameters. These are these arc that is tied to the bifurcation. And this is the ratio between the bank full depth and the bank full deep of the river. So how large is the river with respect to this depth? And to this length. And to this length that we have seen before, because it is the same scaling of the river data, plus this is this coefficient here, but this is a friction coefficient that is a constant in the river. And what you obtain is that this L scaled length is almost equal to pi. And so I just conclude, I cannot have two slides. Thank you so much. So this is one for the ones that are interesting in this. What I want to show you is this one. Is this one? So, how to be computed the sediment flux partition? And this is essentially a phase transition. Okay? So, we have the delta query equilibrium, it's a function of this, our two parameters, R, and the scale length, and the properties, the bankful properties of our reach. And this delta query is proportional to, it is a phase transition, so we have a critical point, and there is a function of the, it is a continuous phase transition. So, when the loop is very short, the channel. When the loop is very short, the system tends to partition the discharge equally in the thousand branches. On the other hand, when it's long, at some point there is one branch that captures most discharge and water, until at the end there is another length where one branch is closes off. Okay? Okay, so sad. Okay, I had a simulation for you. Just one. For you, just one. So, what is our model result? It is this one. It is this one. So, when we solve our ODE and put it all together, what we found is that our ODE has three different behavior. And what we found is that we can have either the destruction of the loops when we have a dominance of erosion, so when we have the floods that can erode. So, when we have the floods that can erode all the sediment. On the other time, we have an unbounded growth we can have when there is an accretion that is unbounded. At some point, the river returns to a single thread morphology because it's not able to carry all the sediment in both branches. And on the other end, we have an equilibrium. And what at the present, we have a model that give us the same scale, the length, where we also we obtain from data that is nearly equal to pi. Nearly equal to pi. And okay, so okay, so this is my last slide where we are trying to include in our model also the variation of the channel length, okay, because the length of the branches can be different, and also the differences in the width of the downstream branches. And clearly, also to a standard, to a standard To extend our model to networks. So I conclude. Thank you very much for your nice talk. You had a very nice introduction, which is very important for this conversation. Other questions? Yeah. Good. So the question is: can you say something? So can you say something about how they are created and how the logs are created by each other? How they are created as they grow deep on the river or as in case of somehow recovered. Okay, no, no, no, okay, okay. This is a fair point. So we started from already formed from already formed loop. Okay. So we are not starting from the, let's say, we don't have a single Let's say we don't have a single channel, and at some point we form a loop due to some initial process, let's say. So, we start already with a loop that is formed. So, we are not modeling the formative process yet. Okay, so what we are thinking is that what controls the loops and it essentially determines the initial loop. Essentially, determines the initial length are these three kinds of processes that are very different. Because the first one, this one, it is an instrument process. So you can think about as an instability problem. So when you have a sediment that is deposited and it grows, it grows, it grows, it grows, and the river is widened here. As you can see here, you have a width variation. So you can think like a path. Like a pipe that can deform as a widening, and so the river loses capacity to carry the sediment that is deposited over time. So this island grows. And you can see this gives rise to quite a symmetric kind of shape. This is very symmetric. But other times, when you have like a jump of a river, or in this case where the river carved this pattern into the floodplain, you don't have this kind of symmetry because there is. This kind of symmetry because the event has to find this path to return to its parent channel. So you have different shapes. But it's also what is telling the model, also what are telling the data, is that they cannot have the shape that they want, but they should have at least a scale, a mean scale. And also, this is what I don't present it, but also the asymmetry of the length of the two branches cannot be too different. If they are too different, what you say. Different, what you observe is that the system returns to a single branch. It cannot persist when they are too different. We have time for one small question. Is there... So if I were to look at the shape of those islands, let's say, loops, would you be able to tell what the river direction is? And I will rephrase, is there any asymmetry in the The confluence versus the bifurcation. You mean with the angle? With the angle, in the general shape. Okay, first of all, what we think, at least, and also what the model tell us is that the angle is not important in this kind of process, at least in the sediment distribution and over time. But yes, what we observe is that there is a symmetry between. So you don't have like here you don't. You don't have like a 90 degrees kind of channel, and then you turn to a confluence with almost, I don't know, 40 degrees angle. There is a kind of sort of symmetry. And this is related, what we think at least, is mostly related to the differences in the length, not in the angle of the two branches. This is why, because when you have different length, you have different slope. So when you have a channel that is way shorter than the other, it's Shorter than the other is also steeper. So the water and the sediment has a preferential path to go there. And if they are too different, the other channel is not able to take also the water and the sediment distribution. So this is a little what we think. So basically, that's the logical conclusion. If you told me the angle does not matter, so the rest is determined by the lattices. Yes. This is what this is what we think. I'm not saying I. I'm not saying anything else. Okay. Thank you, Nicola. Thank you. So we stop recording and we are going to invite Jerome, who is online.
