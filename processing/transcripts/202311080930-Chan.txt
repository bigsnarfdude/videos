That's why we talk about the GGP conjecture. This one chain for the alpha package. And I will mainly talk about the GLN case and PR because  First, so and copy, then the screen will show up. So, and we basically consider an F there and the results most complete so far. So, F is periodic. So, and okay. So The screen shows up below. And all the representations are smooth as other toss and the overseed as in Jessica's talk is overcompass number though. We don't work those modular things. And then we consider the embedding G and G n plus one. So, because we want to talk about one gen, raw banjun is about how representation behave under some subgroup. So, we view g n as g n plus 1 as a subgroup by the natural embedding g embedded to the diagonal zone. And so, what the punching law asks, or punching law asks, So ask some because they are pi to be irreducible representation of g n plus one. So everything is smooth. So we studies or the rough questions. So this is a rough question. So I restricted to Gn though. Why is GM plus 1 representation? But you can use such embeddings or to consider as GM representation. So why this question is difficult or difficulties or Difficulty is that Pygian is not finite length, though. Or you can use the time admissible, it is not admissible. And also, another difficulty is it is not semi-simple, so okay, so then for example. Uh, for example, if you want to use some character theory, then this is not directly work because of semi-simple reasons. So, it doesn't matter. I don't know, then uh, of course, but the whole structure is complicated. We may add some simple structure that I will call it just a quotient branching model. That is, for example, for pi is in irreducible of g n plus one, so and also pi prime is And also, prime prime is irreducible of Gm representation. Okay, so and the question is asked about the home of Gm pi and prime prime. So, it's equal to what? That is to talk about how prime prime appears in the quotient of pi. And the reason it is interesting is from number theory. It's interesting is from number theories or those Kangaus Persak conjectures or later explained to us on one day. So I won't talk about that. But for example, for the generic case, so means pi and pi prime are generic. So the card co-workings are back really so or integrals or imply that the dimension is not Mention is non-zero, so actually equal to one, so I will talk about it later. Now, one of our main concerns today is alpha type representation. So, let's recall those alpha type representation. It appears in many talks before, but let's recall it. So, WF is just a great group of Is just way group of to F. So, and then local Linux correspondence or assess that the one-man correspondence between the irreducible representation of Tn and for those continuous morphisms for the continuous morphisms for the from the ray group uh with the delin so two copies or uh to the length dual group so so here your length dual group is just gl and c so because we just plug in the simplest case or all those conjugacy colours or more those gl conjugacy colours And so for other parameters, um so and then you add one more SL2 copy as before to the land and steel group. So, and you require some additional conditions. Some additional condition is the way dealing group copies or the way dealing group has to be bounded or means that the image has to be tempered. Although some more algebraic conditions on those SL2 copies. Then the upper type representations can be divided in the following: so upper type representations. So is an other parameter, so as before, then associates to L parameters in the following way. So V side and the blade groups or weight dealing groups. So the landscape also. still also but the user ways of the bill X so maps to the W X so and with one more copy so that is the alpha package alpha SL2 copy so great so and maybe as a plus psi here so and you get uh L power L parameter. So then you get the L parameter then, but the one correspondence here. So then you get the representation, the corresponding representation. So corresponding representations is called alpha type representation. When I introduce what is the alpha type representation, Apple type representation. Uncle, the other package is much simpler in this case because the other package is singleton. So I won't go to those other packages. So just using the other type representation. So now we want to talk about the branching law. So this is the Ganga's conjecture. GGP, the published version is 2022. And so, and for pi and pipe prime, so the other type representations of g n plus one and g n respectively. So, and the question is: we want to know when the The home, the display that I talked before, is non-zero. So, and Gandhar's person make up conjectures using those parameters. If and only if, so A parameter, A means the alphas or A parameters, so A parameters of for pi and pi prime. Uh most like the forms of form zone so for pi, so uh for pi it looks like something like uh t Uh, t uh equal to from zero to R, and you have some uh way delim representations, so we call M D pass, and then with some SL2 representations, so D plus one dimension representation. So this is a ray dealing representation, though, and this is just SL2, but the alpha. SL2, but the other copies represented. Well, you have two copies. This is one of the copies. Looks like something. Yeah, I don't have one here. This has D plus one representation, though. You then does that. And then you have another copy, the separation of two parts, other parties like from E from one to S, and then you call it Nim. Call it ND minus is another way the representation. So, and then it's similar, but here you lower the dimension once. So, okay. All right, how it compares with pi prime, the alpha parameter of pi prime. I'll just tell you the alpha parameter for pi. So, right, then for the pi prime, it has to look like d equal to one r also. One hour, and the semi-dealing copies, or but the alpha copies to lower the dimension by one. But for another copy, it goes in an opposite way. So it's E equal to zero to S and M E minus and and then the dimension is uh The dimension is greater than the before by one zone. It's a man like one copy decreased by one, another copy increased by one though. Okay, this is the conjecture also made the for archimedions or okay. But I only talk about long archimedion today though. Can be arbitrary, so not necessarily deridable, arbitrary. Yeah, only the main condition is on d and demand. So it's any arbitrary. But you need to be other it needs to be other parameter means it has to be tempered. So it has to be tempered. Okay, so the result a few years ago. So the result a few years ago, I proved the conjecture for Archimedes or conjecture holds for the others. Yeah, mainly talk about something towards the proof, another proof today. So but I also consider alternate questions. Consider alternate questions. Rather than consider the other parameters, or one can also ask some other similar questions. So can we study the APY package? So APY package. So a more precise question is something like: you consider those API package representations or GLN plus one and also the API package for the GLN zone. And then you consider the dimension of home g n and pi and prime prime zone. But now you can ask if it is equal to one. Ask if it is equal to one or some estimate. And those packages recently constructed by the Kunehanzo and his collaborators. Of course, when your parameter comes from other parameters. When your parameter comes from other packets, then there is the volume's conjecture that this till we talked about yesterday. So, and the API package coincide with other packets. But you can ask about API package for the outside other package. Although I asked Supin yesterday, she said it could be quite hard to compute the structure of the package. And today's apology. And today's approach although we do understand the structure of the APV package, so to answer such kind of questions. So, okay, the goal today is to talk about those proofs. So I'll talk about two stars. The first one is a multiplicity one. So then that is the famous result of Edinburgh collaboration. So Raleigh Jeffman also and Sambo Jews or they are the audience here. So the first one is Piata and Blu, but I put it. The one is Piata and Bio, but I put it together. So, and we also say that if pi is an irreducible of G n plus one representation, so and pi prime is irreducible representation of G n so then the dimension of home Of home pi and pi prime cannot be bigger than one. So call them multiplicity one theorem. And the remaining question is to determine when it is one and when it is zero. But for that, there is an improved result which is also useful in application. Use those or in applications of my work. So let's pi and pine prime be Lennon's standard representations of GM plus one and Plus one and g n, respectively. So and then the dimension of here, so some similar dimension here. So it's the pi and the dual of central representation. So here track is the dual, so must be equal to one, though. Okay, and basically this will. And basically, this result implies this one because you know that every irreducible representation appears in the Lennon standard representations as a quotient. And so this one will impact this one. And this one has some application. I will talk about one later. So right, so this is the first tools or other tools or Tools or and this Benza-Slewinsky theory, so Benza-Slavinsky theory. So pi is any representation of G n load. So that's pi. So we define something called band size winski derivative, so and which is Which is divided in the following pi with upper script i, and then you have the pi quotient of the space that's generated by n x minus side n x with n in our python and x in pyzo. And what is our i here? So our i so pi and then what is uh r here, so our i is uh the subgroup of the form i n minus i and then here is the lower triangular so a unipole and lower triangular so and the subgroup looks like this and Say so and is in our iso and is in our iso the subgroup our iso our i is divided is actually and this is a subgroup of g n zone x is in pi so okay so and what is size I have tell you what is size so size is Tell you what is size or size is along degenerate characters or along degenerate characters. Mainly about talking about the long drain character on the unipolar subgroup in this part. So and then extend trivial to this one. But this is also called Benzai's Rinski derivative. Risky derivatives and why it is useful in branching laws. Okay. And because we have such filtration, so again pi is a representation of, maybe I will use g n so pi representation of g n plus one so g n plus one so and then that exists g n There exists G n filtrations on pi. So, but now we can say as G n representation. So only use G n plus one, but now we restrict to Gm because we want to do some bunching law. So satisfying, we call the filtration in such way pi n plus one equal to pi pi zero as double zero. Pi n pi one zero and the One though, and then the future ends with the n plus one copy, which is zero. So, and uh, and of course, you can write into any colour future, but uh the successive quotients looks like such a pi i minus one mod pi i is isomorphic to so it's using the benzer's ring skip derivative. the Rinski derivative. So I i. Then this is a GM minus G n minus I representation though. Because you can use such copies to add on such copy to get a gm minus i representation. So and so now you get a g n plus one minus a copy and then you pens out with some size the size is a character, a character on On ui minus one zero, double triangular matrix. So in G subgroup of G i minus one zero. Okay. And then now, of course, it is and then you do the tensor product. So how I zoom minus one to the g and so. But this is compact induction, compact induction, compact induction, small iso. That is a small eye. But it is over the ring speed future. So, to be precise, you have to add one more ingredient here. So, twisted by nu half or to make the comparison correct. So, no is the character, so I take Character though, by taking the determinant and then the absolute value of f. So you're adding, right? So this is the main thing is I talked about in the beginning. So when you do the restriction, the representation is not admissible in general. But now this one is admissible. So it's admissible. So if your pie is admissible. And if your pie is admissible, so if pi is admissible, though. And sometimes you reduce the question from not admissible to something more admissible. This is to make things a bit more computable. All right. And so I will talk about how to give some information to the branching router one of. Branching world, or one of it. So, um, so uh, so let me define one more terminology. So, um, that's pi to be uh so now go back to the punching where we only consider the irreducible case or and prime is irreducible representation of GN. So we saw. We suppose the quotient banching law exists and prime is non-zero, then by those multiplicity results of Eisenberg, Rawish, Rawish, Trife, Susanna, Jew, then you know this is one. And so this is unique up to some scalar. So but you just pick some bounds, you know, it's okay, so because it's unique up to on scalar, so and you pick an F. And f inside this home space, or then you consider develop terminologies or call LBL. L means layers, or BL means branching law. The layer of branching row, which determines the branching row for this one, is equal to the largest, so the largest integer, so such that Such that f restricted to pi i n minus 1 is non-zero. So, more or less is to say that you make the submodule smaller and smaller. And eventually, of course, it becomes zero if you take i to be n plus two. But and but the diet also exists exists because we are assuming this is non-zero. So you can always choose i to be one. Choose I to be one, but it may not be the largest one. So then you decrease until it becomes zero, then you stop. And this is very useful, as useful information. So one way to compute it or one way to understand it is the following results. So the layer of banjang law which determines the The boundary between pi and pi prime, assume all these conditions. But all this is equal to the smaller integers, smallest integers such that home g m plus mod integer i stars or m plus one minus i stars or such that such that pi and pi prime is puzzle something I want to do the derivatives of pi no half or nu is the what we divided there so uh pi and i so the derivative of i and also the uh the left derivative so oh it's non-zero so. Is non-zero, so well, I didn't talk about what is left derivative. I only divide the pi i for the i on the right hand side, but the left one is just use the just use the minus one transpose. So it's similar theory, but you wanted then using uh rather than using the r i there, you take the transpose, then you get uh don't similar theory there. Don't see my favorite there. So now the problem is again somehow changed the bunch of problems to some problem of derivative. Of course, I still didn't tell you how to compute this one, so I can transfer to another problem. The main problem here is that So main problems or main problems or so are difficult to understand the structure of eyes of or the left front zone because in general it is not It is not irreducible. And also, it is not semi-simple. But the grouping is admissible, but still not semi-simple. So it's still not easy to do that. I need some complaints to overcome that. So I need some completeness tools. To overcome that. So now I have to introduce those statements. So also appear. So, and also appears in the race talk yesterday. So, and segments, but in some different terminology, so uh segments or delta is equal to A B walls or so where A B is where A B is in C and the difference is integer though. A B can be any compass number, but the difference has to be integer. Difference has to be integers, or MO is a cospital representation, hospital representation of some GL. And the importance is that the Selwinsky theories or Selwynsky theories around the time of 80s or early 80s, that is a one-to-one correspondence. To one correspondence or one-to-one correspondence between segments and the irreducible essentially square integrable representation. But eventually it means it is up to some choice of the character, then it becomes square integral. Character, then it becomes square integrable. So, so the so uh I won't talk about the construction, though, but uh, the corresponding representation I will denote by uh S T delta. So, just definition, this is just definition. I will use such symbols to represent the corresponding square integral representation. All right, so now the main thing is we want to. Main thing is we want to overcome the difficulty using such things and by some powerful induction like Kpanda. And so now I have to devise some more terminology. So derivative. But do you all use it mainly to Janssen because or pit or? You can study other colours group is the result of SU, Atopi, BNU, etc. So for each segment or derivative is divided in the following, we only consider pi is irreducible representation. and we divide the derivative of pi with respect to with respect to delta to be the unique simple G L representations or unique effects or such that the pi is embedded to Pi is embedded to I want to do the right hand side, yes. In the search way, so in general may not exist, you may not find such fan. So, if it is not exist, if not exist, then you just start to be zero. But if it exists, then this is a unique unit now with also of those demos. Yeah. And this is the first derivative. So you may think about this derivative, you try to replace the band size derivative later. Okay, though. But I want to define one more terminology, so we should integral. integral also integral also so it's a kind of a reverse of the the inverse or the inverse of derivatives or inverse of group so okay so uh again we choose a segment of delta so and pi is irreducible of g n z of Of G and zone so define so I delta prime to be the a unique unique simple G L representation such that this representation is a kind of This representation is a kind of replacing the volso. The this representation embed to the pi with the stiper I did not explain this cause means the power industry it's similar to the topic yesterday is a powerful industry and this is also but here is uh so may I be tricky So a bit tricky is the main one is on the right, one is on the left. So it's a kind of a concept theory has something left relevant and the right relevant. So somehow you also need something on the right, something on the left. So to make it a bit different, doing the branching row. Okay, so and not also the uniquely use also some results of La Payman classic. And try to make it more numerical. So those two various representations. So let me make it some numerical that make it more easier to compare. So I divide delta pi to be epsilon. To be epsilon delta prime to be the largest integer, largest integer. So k so a negative, so such that d delta k pi is zero. Oh, no, no, zero. K can be zero, so if zero just itself, then it must be. If zero just itself, then it must be not zero. Or there are some interpretation with some crystal operators, but okay, this is not what we are trying to talk about later. Let me also define some more refined version for the epsilon deltas. So for this, I write into some expensive segment rates or segment rates. And then we define the eta so eta delta pi to. Of delta pi to be a collection of epsilon numerals starting with AB Wiso. And then you reduce the statement length shorter. And and and then you come And then you come back to the singleton segment, so it's B B walls or close the brackets. So but This is important in some representation theoretic interpretation of this one is trying to separate pi into some copies. So the representation importance is like Importance is like your pi can be separated into some copy, like a derivative of those delta with the epsilon many times. And then to me is something irreducible. So and yeah, so uh it is useful in some computation. So but uh the relation to the pancheng wai is the flow range. So okay, so uh Okay, so we consider delta and delta prime to be segments. So and pi is a irreducible representation of a gen zone. Then if you want to do the main bunch of how these three things have to be related. So the man I call is Johnny Johnny. Only L D L I though. This means white derivative or white derivative left integral commutative or commutative. Invariance or it is measuring the those derivatives, how the changes of derivative it does not change after you're doing the integral though for delta prime though it's a kind of yeah again you should think about those derivative in terms of band size risk kit derivative so uh Uh, I was yes, I can do something but let's say derivative does not change the eight time variable on LSI, yes, to saying something such thing, but this is something more computable, though. Okay, so right so and why we call it commutative so commutative because uh remark so uh delta delta prime primes uh those strongly uh Strongly L D L I commutative triple in pi when you do the derivatives on pi and then do the integral can you can switch the ordering so it means they are commutes so you can do the integral first and then do the derivative later though right it is this is why I This is why I call it commutative. The commerce is not quite true, though. It's a bit stronger condition. This is the notion for the branching. The main result will come soon. But that's one has to also define something more now. So one has to extend those. So, one has to extend those terminologies, or one is those terminologies to multi-segments. So, what I mean is you need to define something TM, I am so multi-segment M so I am and also something like M and Pytho, Sony Commute only commut only commutative RTL I recommend it okay it's a triumph in the correct ordering so for more designers if you want to get the standard representation you have to get to put in the suitable ordering it's similar to that you put in the suitable ordering then you define Should the borderline, then you define the derivative and integral in such a way. So, but I will not go into details. The main idea is you have to extend to it. As I mentioned before, so the IM the integral, so and the derivative, so on pi, you should think about this is analog. think about this is analog so analog of of the uh the band size rinske layers i mentioned before so g n so i am i must want the new half and then pi i so and then tensor with some psi well this pi is something your derivative here though and the in this induction part is something like the the integral part here though. The integral part here, though. But again, this is computable, and this one is very much harder to understand. So, okay, so all right. So, once you have such intuition, and then you can ask about which layer will give you the branching row because we will have the band size key filtration before. So, you also ask about in the future which layer will give you the branching row. So, then this is the main result. Pipe irreducible of GM plus one zone and pipe prime irreducible of g n zone and n zone And so the quotient punching law exists, so high and pine is non-zero. So if and only if some that exists multi-segments and touch that So M and how do I divide the commodity? There are no technical. So M pi is only I mean I need shifting, yeah, so the shifting so. So, in particular, you used to say that your only pipe didn't talk about is the relation with pipe pipe. The relation with pipeline is that. Pi primes of the relation with pipe prime is that when you do the derivative, m so on the new half pi, so and then with the integrals. So then this will give you one of the quotient because this is a bi size risky layer. You want that layer, give you some quotient there. So this is isomorphic to pi prime. Pi prime. And this is new half dog. And this is no half. So I've just chased it now. Okay, so and in particular, so if you in terms of some emergence, it is more complicated to write on those invariants, but in terms of sequence, but basically it's to have So I have 10 minutes, so maybe 11, 10, 12 minutes. So as an example, the first example is high end high prime attributable representations of G M plus one and G M respectively. G n respectively. And then, of course, we know that we already know that the hormone of pi and prime prime is not zero. But then how about if we want to use this theorem, then what should we take? We have to take m to be just one segment, which is the m plus one over two. Now we are doing the Idi Mahori case, so you just choose the Okay, so you just choose the cospital representation one, that's all. And it's just the empty set. Another example is simple quotients or simple. Is simple quotients or simple quotients or irreducible quotients, simple quotient of the probability induction of two exensorly square representations or a is or n over two though and then another one is minus n over two though a minus one over two though. Okay, I always use one though if I drop the script, it just means the caspiller is just one. But now I'm It's just one. But now, although you choose prime prime to be the stiper representation, the stiper representation, and recently, so there is a result of okay, so he's a student of dependent person. So he proved that the home bunching law for pi has the quotient of the That's the quotient of the stipend representation. So maybe he did not use those strongly commutative triple, but in terms of strongly commutative triple, you can still take in such ways or take m to be a plus half, so n plus half, one and n, just one set monsoon. And that's one segment, so n is another one segment, so a plus half and n minus half. It's a kind of n is to cut down these segments. So, and then is you cut down some the beginning parts of the stiper representation to get the train. And this will check. And this will check the conditions there. So, and we agree with the result correct. So, back to our main concern today, so back to main concerns. So, back to the other type representation today. So, pi is our type representation. representations so g n plus one and g n respectively so you have two representations and then now we are considering the bunching modes assume they are set aside uh the gg Uh the GGP conditions, the GGP condition. Well, I won't repeat it here, so but this the alpha parameter. So one has to decrease by one and other is other parts, the symmetric part degree has to increase by one. So those conditions. So then in such case, how can we prove that once the one to prove the want to prove is home gm pi and pi prime is non-zero remember by button by the results there so we just have to choose a suitable m and n to satisfy those conditions so then uh the only thing is i have to tell you what what is those m and n so i don't know uh i will erase this one erase this one so then uh But then but now I last was in in terms of more representation ways. So yes, in terms of some state representation, then I will pray u1 d1 or maybe u01 m1 so d1 so and do the power body induction for other state representation. This is the space or space representation. A representation though. And you have uh u uh u o also m al be also and okay what would this represent? Uh maybe I finish this person. So you have two parts right so other parts is using the something that's easy. U o one n one E one so and you won't s prime s n s so yes what is those space representation looks like so we can power poly induction from those uh square integral representations so so in terms of those segment So, in terms of those segments, I mean, like the length is controlled by M1. So, but you do it at D1 minus time. So, and then now maybe D1 plus one times. So, and this gives you the state representation there. So, okay. Okay, and your prime prime is similar, so maybe I should make the notation comparable because I want to make the notation compatible to what I wrote before. Here I use N1E minus one, so and this is NSES minus one though. And your time fine looks something similar, but if something lowering one. Lowering one part and increasing another part prime prime is something like u wall m1 d1 plus one so d1 minus one zoo minus one so and you raw r so m r so d r minus one so and then you do again a spin representation but you just drop one of the You just drop one of the segments. Now you drop one of the segments. And for another thing, you increase one of the segments. So M1 zoo and in one and you also S prime and SO Be increased by one level. All right, so then how do you choose M and N? So, as those previous examples, how can we choose M and N? So I use something like the M is for derivative of pi. Because you want to change it to the D minus one way, also. And the way is you try to cut down this semantor. The idea is you just put this elements, or I will just call it this element to be. So, I will just call it this M1 to be something I will denote by HD, something called highest derivative. So, so I will denote it by highest derivative. So, M1 D1. You just pay one of the segments and then you try to do the derivative, cut down one of it. And you do it for other things as well, though, for other terms in the first part. And so, and then you get the highest review for one though. Uh four one so and uh m al dr so but this is your m so what is your n so so n is you try to increase this e1 plus minus one to something e1 so again you you will try to add one more segment but something adding it's uh you are adding on the left on the left here you try to uh coming from the bottom so it's something like if you you have the segment like uh here Segment like here, which is M1, so and then this is E1 plus 1. So, and then you pick the last one. So, the N is a kind of opposite. You have to pick the opposite. So, because opposite, I will call it left because you are doing something on the left, but then it's on the right. Then I will call this U1 Prime M1 E1. So, for the other one, you just touch it together. And then you compile the segment. So and you get your row S prime and S ESO. And the checking and checking things is checking they are extremely commutative is using some computer as you need to know some rules. You need to know some rules to compute those derivative and integral, but it's not really very difficult for that one. This proof one direction. So I don't have time to talk much on the other direction, so the comrade. So the commerce is, I suppose, suppose home GNOPI and PIMP. ends of pi and pi prime is non-zero and the main idea is that so so i try to try to use individuality check so i mean like uh don't check to to make use the symbols or somewhere those symbols there so into so many symbol like d1 plus m1 over two is bigger than di plus mi over two and also ei plus And also EI plus NI over 2 for all either. But you can do it. So there is some tricks to do though. So you can switch things or you can do the commutative in the power poly induction to make it work. So in such case, and then you can then reduce to the case or reduce pi to case of case of it's again more standard check. So to the case of u raw. case of u wall m i d i minus 2 at d one so d1 minus 2 and the other copies does not change so u wo m two d 2 and so on well other copies does not change only change the one copies and then the the the the and then you you one use the induction so induction to do that so induction to do that so but in such case you still need to hide But in such case you still need to uh when you do the induction you will get some redundant case which does not give you the original uh GGP relevance. But you can check the derivative. Though in those redundant cases the derivative will give you zero. And this is we rule out those case at the end. But it basically gives you an idea how to do the comma star version. So I think I time stop. So thank you. I stopped here.
