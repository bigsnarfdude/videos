Spatial astrogenomics team across three institutions. So, my own lab is split between Sigenzi in Adelaide and Wehigh, where I still have quite a large team. And this work is also a collaboration with Belinda Phippson, who's based at Wehigh, and Aruna Kulsingi, who has been the source of a huge amount of the spatial data that's come to my lab and is based up at the University of Queensland. And the work I'm going to talk about today has largely been done by Darmesh Bhuver, a bit of it by Kristen Ferrer, and By Kristen Ferrer and my PhD students, Junjin and Albuquerque have both contributed quite heavily to this as well. So, I'm going to be talking about some work we've been doing looking at how library size can be found as biology and spatial transcription data. And this work is actually up on bioarchive at the moment, so I'll drop a link to that into the slack. I hope you can. So, it's been known for a while, and Agas presented on this earlier in the meeting, that library size has Library size has an association with cell types in single cell data. And so, this is actually the image that he presented with his talk showing that there was a library size effect that you can see with different cell types in single cell data, suggesting that library size may actually be capturing real biology in these cases and could be associated with things like cell size, but also complexity and function and specific functional roles, for example, in the tissue. For example, tissue. Now, if you look at spatial transcriptomics data, and here I'm showing an embryo section from the STOMIX paper that was published in CELBAC last year or the year before, we can clearly see that there are library size effects that show a huge amount of resolution in the data. This is just imaging library size alone in that particular slice of image. So, library size is typically normalized out using a variety. Normalized out using a variety of different sorts of methods in bulk RNA sequencing data, where each library is sampled independently. And the same is done in single-cell data, again, where the cells' libraries are sampled independently. But library size, or as I'll refer to it quite often in this talk, total detections, are not independently sampled in spatial data. And in spatial data, the adjacent regions are likely to be more similar than the distant regions, with the exception of certain tissue discontinuities, which actually break those. Continuities, which actually break that assumption. So, they could share properties such as tissue stiffness or permeability and would thus have a different sampling process to other regions in the tissue. So, in this case, the library size is going to carry a lot of biological information and therefore be confounded with biology we're just going to tell you. And here you can see, just looking at library size, we can clearly see the brain, the eyes and the embryo, the heart, bladder, kidneys and Embryo, the heart, bladder, kidneys, and so on. So you can clearly see an awful lot of structure before you even look at a gene. Now, library size can reveal structure across different spatial technology platforms. So we've looked at this in Visium, Xenium, STOMIX, and COSMIX data sets. The first three we have mouse brain data, which is very popular because it makes very pretty images using spatial analysis. And the COSMIX data set is the non-small cell lung cancer data that they release probably. Also, lung cancer data that they release properly. So, visually, we can very clearly see that regions have different library size effects. Now, we were able to annotate these regions based, in the case of Visium, on the expert annotation that was made available for the data. In the case of COSMIX, using marker-based annotation and some colleagues of mine at Lehigh, who are lung cancer specialists, and for the xenium and stomics mousebrain, we mapped the anatomical regions. We mapped the anatomical regions from the Allen Brain Atlas using some image registration software. So these data clearly allow, I'd love to have a pointer, but nonetheless you can clearly see the very well defined structural regions within the tissue. And when we then look at the library size per cell across those different regions, we start to see that there are very strong trends in the data that indicate that various different anatomical That various different anatomical regions have quite distinctly different categories of library sizes. Now, because not all of these spatial platforms are actually single-cell or sub-cellular in resolution, we actually use a grid-based way of capturing the total detections or library size across one of these two-dimensional images. Obviously, Visium itself is fundamentally gritty already, as is STOMEX. As is STOMEX. For Xenium and COSMEX, we just overlaid a grid that was approximately cell-sized onto the data. But these analyses are being done in a cell-free manner. And this is something that Wilab's been focusing on because, as I'll mention later, cells aren't real units of measurement. So, to re-emphasise that point, subcellular spatial transcriptomics is not cell-based. So, technologies like COSMIX, Stomics, and Xenium. Cosmics, stomics, and xenium are not based on cell measurements the same way single-cell transcriptometers are. They're not the unit of measurement. Cells are a post-hoc abstraction. They are the result of segmentation, such as what gene presented, but they're not the actual unit of measurement in this data. And so because cells are an abstraction, to make it easier to analyse and compare the data, we simply use this sort of gridding approach so that we can do a fair comparison across all. Do a fair comparison across all of the different platforms. So, this lets us estimate both the total abundances within a defined region and also the number of cells within a defined region because we can simply count those up based on DAPI. And this means that we're not performing an unfair comparison between the actual performance of different cell segmentation algorithms across the different parts. So, if we look at modeling the library size based on these binary. Library size based on these binned spatial transcript domics data. What we can see is that while we certainly see the expected relationship between library size and cell density in the image, that doesn't fully explain the relationships that we're seeing. So in these plots that you can see here, we have cell density captured as cells per spot, and then the library size or total abundances within those spots on the y-axis. And you can see very clear differences across different. Differences across different regions, particularly if you look at stomics data, for example. You can see in pink is, I believe, that's white matter in the tissue. In red, on the far right, you can see the red regions are all of the tumour regions from that non-small cell lung cancer sample. The relationships are less obvious visually in the Visium data because there's not as much resolution in those data sets. But nonetheless, we do still mathematically see that when you correct for cell density, there nonetheless remains an association. There nonetheless remains an association between anatomical region and microsize. So we can detect these relationships across these widely different technology platforms. Oh, sorry, that's just an indication of the slopes that we see in the STMX data. So if we look at trying to interpret what we see from these data, we can see that we are able to robustly identify differences between anatomical regions based on these properties. Regions based on these properties. For example, the white matter and fibre tracts that I mentioned previously. And we can also look at approximating an additional contribution to fibrous size by each cell that lets us estimate it carries from between 400 to 800 counts in these data. We're able to identify various different trends in the data and model technical covariates, including things that are technology specific. So for example, we Specific. So, for example, we have field of view annotation for the COSMIX platform. We don't unfortunately have field of view annotation for the Xenian platform, but we can incorporate these in the models to see whether or not they explain the library size effects, and they don't completely account for what we see. So, the final thing that we did was look at the impact of library size normalization on spatial domain identification in the data. Because we had real anatomical structures. We had real anatomical structures that we segmented and annotated in the data, we were able to perform a suite to evaluate the impact of these different normalization strategies on clustering and then reconstruction of spatial domains. Now, we used the benchmarking pipeline that Matt Ritchie's group had initially put together for doing massively parameterized benchmarking. And so we looked at data from the four platforms. We looked at data from the four platforms, Visium, Xenium, Stomix, and COSMIX. We looked at three different normalization strategies using no normalization at all, or using SC Transform, which does explicit library size normalization, or SCRAN, which does not normalize for library size. And then we used a bunch of different feature selection strategies, looking at the top 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 highly variable genes in the data. We performed some dimensional reduction. We performed some dimensional reduction, used a variety of different graph construction approaches, and three different community detection algorithms. So, this resulted in 14,000 different combinations of parameters being assessed in the results that I'm going to show you here. We then assessed the performance of each of these runs by calculating the adjusted RAND index, which summarised the extent to which the clustering reproduced the known anatomical regions of the data. And so, these are the results of that analysis. What I'm showing you on the right. Analysis. What I'm showing you on the right is the full range of values showing the maximum adjusted RAND index, which sort of mimics the best case we could come up with, that you have done everything perfectly, you have picked the perfect combination of parameters, good for you, and you have got the maximum adjusted band index possible out of the data. And we've also shown there the median adjusted band index that we get across all of the different runs for this analysis. What you can see is that doing What you can see is that doing library size normalization almost universally results in a poorer performance of clustering to identify spatial domains in the data. So in other words, most of the best case scenarios involve using no normalization or using SPRAN, which does not normalize the library size of the data. So this has obvious implications for when and how we might do any sort of normalization when we're looking at these spatial data. When we're looking at these spatial data sets, because if we're interested in identification of spatial domains, then library size is definitely something that carries real biological information. So I'm going to finish off that particular chunk there and just say a couple of words about how we might explore molecular phenotypes in the cellular resolution spatial data without actually annotating cell types or indeed segmenting cells. Types or indeed segmenting cells at all. And so one of the things that we're looking at is whether or not we can use cell-free methods to look for trends and patterns in the data. And so here we've got a workflow that actually uses a couple of the approaches that I talked about in various discussions over the meeting, including Visi, which is a strategy for looking at functional analysis and data. And here we just do a straight factor analysis over the raw. Analysis over the raw localized transcript data in the inner spatial sections. So you don't have to annotate cells to do this sort of analysis. And so we can then perform gene set testing and interpret those gene sets pathways based on the gene loadings that we see on the factors that we extract from the spatial data. And so this lets us then identify. us then identify regions that show distinct sort of differences across the distribution of the transcripts in the tissue. And so here we're seeing that we've identified a factor which is sort of clearly kicking out part of the region of tumour in pink down the bottom, but there's a chunk of the tumour down here which is showing distinct heterogeneity with respect to this particular factor in the data. And what you can see to the right there is the clustering of the The clustering of the gene sets that Visi performs so that we can then extract out the higher-order biological properties associated with these data. So, looking at cluster five, for example, which I believe is the one that I'm showing here, we can see that that's highlighting a cell cycle and mitotic process that's different in part of that spatial sample compared to other ones. So, in conclusion, I hope I have shown. I hope I have shown you that we need to think about how library sizes are going or total abundances are going to influence our data when we have spatial transcriptomics data and begs the question when and how should we actually normalize in these data sets. Obviously if we want to do any sort of differential expression we need to do some sort of adjustment for the sort of total quantity of stuff that we're looking at. But we really need to think carefully about the ordering of how that's done, particularly what we want to do. That's done, particularly if what we want to do is cluster spatial domains in the data. And I think this really emphasizes that spatial transcript domains and indeed all spatial electrical measurement strategies, whether they be at higher level or at low-level resolution like single cells, require us to think about new analytical approaches because we can't just port what we did for single-cell, dissociated single-cell sequencing onto spatial transcriptomics. Transcription. There's an increasing amount of data that's becoming available in this space, and I will feel much more comfortable drawing a lot of these conclusions when we've seen a lot more data sets. But nonetheless, I think across the four platforms we've looked at, these trends are quite consistent. And I'll just finish up with a few things that I'd sort of highlight as considerations and caveats for spatial single-cell data. They're not yet abundant, as I said, so any conclusions that we draw are necessarily based on... Are necessarily based on a relatively limited number of data sets. So we need to keep that in mind. And I think there's something to be said for pooling access to the data that we have so that we can actually draw broader and more useful conclusions based on more technology platforms and data sets. Image-based spatial single-cell data are fundamentally different in nature to single-cell sequencing data. The sources of noise in the data are very different. It's an imaging process, not a sequencing process. Molecular crowding is an issue. Molecular crowding is an issue, density is an issue, there's all of these things that present a source of noise in the actual measurement of transcripts before we even get to a point where we segment the data. And the cells in spatial single cell data aren't real. They are a post-hoc annotation based on segmentation of an image that is not the image that actually measures the transcripts and the data. That's a separate measurement process in all of these platforms. And so, again, I'll just And so again, I'll just emphasise that the sources of noise in the data owe more to the imaging modality than they do to anything that looks like sequencing. We've got to ask the question, what even is cell type annotation going to mean when cells aren't the real units of measurement in the data? And I'm just going to show you an illustration of what I mean by that on the right. This is some of the COSMIX non-small cell lung cancer data over eight different slices of tissue. In the confetti colouring down the bottom, those are all the field. Colouring down the bottom, those are all the fields of view that actually perform the measurement of the transcripts in the data. And what I've plotted up the top is a measurement of the negative probe detection across those images. Now, those percentages are actually very small. Negative probe detection never exceeds about 2%, but nonetheless, you can actually see clear edge effects and field of view effects in the data, indicating that negative probe detection is not uniform across these slides and may not. Across these slides and may not even be uniform across the field of view. So, we can't assume that noise is going to be constant or smooth across the tissue because it's also going to be affected by the neighbourhood of the composition of that part of the tissue. And the tissues themselves have discontinuities. So even our assumption that two adjacent regions on a tissue should have more in common with each other than with more distant regions of a tissue breaks down if we. Regions of tissue breaks down if we happen to have an anatomical discontinuity in tissue, such as a change in tissue structure or something like that. So, to paraphrase one of my favourite quotes from Star Trek, it's single-cell data, Jim, but not as we know it. And that's it for me. Thank you very much. We have one quick question for us. So, a lot of images that you showed are like textbooks. That you showed are like textbook, really great images that were highly optimized, but in reality, they physically developed switches from how we get them on collaborators. They have very various spatial art paths. So, library size organizations have worked in ways. The Visium data showed the weakest association when we looked at these data. And my experience with Visium data sets I've looked at is that they do look a bit washy, like they're lackwater resolution. Like that might be lackwater resolution there. I think the FFP chemistry that they've introduced has improved that a little bit. But I think these conclusions are more valuable for the higher resolution technologies. We see the trends there only statistically because you can't see them by higher the value to the other. Hold questions and leave them to Slack. But thank you, Melissa.
