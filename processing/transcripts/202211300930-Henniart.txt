So, to continue, it is a pleasure to introduce Guillen Yak from Laboratoire de Mathématique docet, who will talk us about simple cuspidals and the language correspondence. Yes, can you see my screen? Sorry? Yes, we can see the screen. Okay, fine. Thank you. Okay, fine, thank you. So, well, let me thank the organizers and the Banz Institute for this invitation. I'm sorry I'm not in person with you, you know, Haxaka, but after retirement I took up a new job, so I can't travel as much as I wanted. Like Sean, I'm very much thinking of Colleen Bushnell, who should have given this talk at this very time slot. Period time slot. I don't have Colin's sense of humor. I don't smoke. I certainly will not break any chalk in this talk, but you can imagine that it's Colin pacing in front of a backboard and giving this talk. I dedicate this talk to his memory. So the subject is one as appeared already in one of Sean's slides. It's about expliciting the Langlands. Explicit in the language correspondence for some GLN and some classical groups, but only for a very special set of caspiller representations which are easy to construct and thus are called simple casps. So I'll set up the setting really and then I describe the simple caspels for GRNF and then the simple caspels for sp2NF and then SP2NF and then go to the explicit Langlands correspondence for those. As usual, my base field is in an Archimedean locally compact field, the same as Sean, and G is a reductive group over F. Actually, since I will be looking essentially only at GLN and sp2n, I'll take a split reductive group over C and I take points. Points graph, and I shall focus uniquely on Caspidor representations of G of F, by which I mean irreducible complex, the smooth Caspidor representations of G of F. As you saw in Sean's talk, they are really the building blocks in the theory of all smooth complex representations of G of F. So I concentrate on those for today. And from Sean's lecture. And from Sean's lectures, you know that there is a general way to construct caspadors. It's via induction from an open compact bot-center subgroup of G. So you have such a group J and the irreducible finite dimensional representation lambda of that group J and you take compacting the junction to G and if you chosen J and lambda nicely then you get Nicely, then you get casped representation. In fact, for NEG where we know all the cospitals, where all the cospitals have been constructed, they have been obtained by the procedure and in a very precise way, which Sean stated yesterday, that you have a list of pairs J and lambda, and any caspetals induced from one pair, and the pair is determined by the caspet. And the pair is determined by the caspetal up to conjugacy in G. This was first done by GLN, for GLN, by Bushnev and Kutsko in their celebrated work, Orange Book. This was done also for classical groups when the residue characteristic P of F is odd by Schultz-Stevens and collaborators. And it's also true, known to be true for general G, provided P is large enough due to U and Fin. Due to you and Vincent and also work of Kim. Large enough means that G has to be split over a tame extension and P should not define the order of the absolute byte group. So for example, P is necessary. But in 2010, maybe a little before, Dick Gross and Mark Reeder invented. And Mark Rieder invented what they call the simple cospodos. As I said, they are called simple because they are easy to construct. The construction works for any splint G and even for more groups. And the construction is completely uniform across G and P. So that's a very nice feature. And they were used for many purposes since then. For GLN, they were known before, and they are indeed rather special cases. Rather special cases of instruction due to Cariola at the end of the 70s and published in 83, something like that. So, what I will do is to describe them for GLN and then SB2N. And then I'll switch to the local language correspondence and describe what we can say about what corresponds to them on the side of the fail group representations. The local Langlands correspondence, as Sean has just stated, attaches to a caspidal for G of F a morphism of the Vale group Wf of F into the dual group G hat of G, which is G L N C when G is GLN and SO2N C when G is S B to F. You might have to add an SL to C as we'll see a bit later. So it's really a morphism of W F cross SL to C into the dual group. Into the tool group. I need a little bit of notation, which is quite similar to what Sean was using. F is my locally compact non-Artimedian field, which has so far any characteristic, characteristic zero, characteristic P. OF is the ring of integers, Pf, its maximal ideal. Kappa is the residue field, OF mod, Pf. It has cardinal. F mod P F, it has cardinality Q, which is a power of P, the residue characteristic. I choose for convenience a uniformizer Duric P, Duric pi of the F, so that Pf is generically pi pi. And psi is a non-trivial character of kappa. In most of the talk, I need only this little piece of data, which is non-trivial character of the additive group of the finite field. So let's start with the general. Let's start with the general group, general linear group. I see GLNF for n strictly bigger than one, because for GL1F, GL1F is F cross, and there is not much to say about its representations. There is no simple caspaton in that case. So GLNF is seen as the group of linear automorphisms of the vector space F to En and I write EF1 to En the canonical basis of F to En. The center of F to the n. The center of g is made out of scalar matrices, and it identifies the center with f cross. As Sean has said already two days ago, that GLNF has a maximal compact subgroup K, which is GLNOF. This maximal compact subgroup K contains the Iwari subgroup, which Sean also introduces, made out of matrices in K, which are In k, which are upper triangular when you reduce the coefficients to the f. The normalizer of the Ewa-Pouli subgroup in G is generated by I and just a single matrix, which is essentially the one which permutes cyclically the vectors of the base. Pi of EI is EI plus one when i goes from one to n minus one, but the last vector pi of e n. last vector pi of En is sent to E1 multiplied by the uniformizer. This way, pi to the n, capital pi to the n is just the scalar matrix corresponding to the uniformizer. Sean also showed you that the group, the Wauri group, has a filtration, a natural filtration. The first step in the filtration is a propy group, it's the propyradical. It's the propyradical of the Euro subgroup. It's made out of matrices in the IWRE subgroup with unipotent reduction mod PF. So it's upper triangular, but with one, the diagonal mod PF. So this means that the diagonal entries are in one plus PF, not only in OF cross, as for in URF7. The second step of the filtration, which I will also use, consists of matrices in the first step of the Of matrices in the first step of filtration, such that the coefficients in the over diagonal have their evaluation increased by one. So this means that xi plus one is in the maximal ideal when i goes from one to n minus one, but the bottom left coefficient, which was in pf for the per p value, has to be in pf square now for i28. So I1, I2 are So, I1, I2 are normal subgroups of the Warrior subgroups, and the quotients can be clearly easily identified with kappa to the n. The identification is obtained by sending a matrix X in I1 to the tuple, the n-tuple, made out of X1, 2. So the coefficients of the over diagonal, X1, 2 modulo P to the F, Xn minus 1N modulo P to the F. One when modulo p to the n. And the bottom left, you have to divide by pi before taking its residue class of xn1 divided by pi. If you have this additive character, little psi of kappa, you get a character of kappa to the n by putting psi on each component. And this gives you a character of lambda psi. The character Landa slide of the propene hero subgroup of G. And the theorem, which is not very difficult to prove, is that the intertwining set of lambda psi in G is the group which I will call J. It's generated by A1, the center, and this matrix part. And it turns out that J is also the normalizer of the lambda slide. Recall that I recall that Sean defined it. The intertomining set is obtained by looking at the intertwining algebra of lambda psi and g, which is just the endomorphism algebra of the induced, compactly induced representation of lambda psi from I1 to G. It can be expressed in terms of double cosets, double cosets of I1 and G, and the intertwining set is the support for the functions which are. For the functions which are supported on the double closet. So, all double closets would support a non-single function made out of intertwining set. And Cariot's criterion, which was stated by Sean too, implies that if lambda is any character of j, of this normalizer j extending lambda psi, then the compact induction of lambda is irreducible. Compact induction of lambda is irreducible and consequently casped or representations of G. The reason is that if lambda is any character of J extending lambda psi, its intertwining in G can only be equal to that of lambda psi or smaller. So it has to be restricted to J and carryoff theorem applies to give irreducibility. A number of remarks are in Of remarks are in order here. I started with psi and I extended lambda psi, which depends only on psi, to a character lambda of j. So how is lambda determined? Lambda is determined by its value on the matrix capital PI. Remember, the matrix capital PI is in the group J. In the group J, there is also F cross, the center. The center, well, pi to the m gives an uniformizing to the center. So I need only say what lambda is on UF on the unit group of F. Lambda has to be trivial on one plus Pf because that's in I1. So all I have to give is a character of coupled cross, which is UF divided by. Which is UF divided by one sphere, kappa star, maybe, with this topography. Second remark is that you, of course, you allow to vary sine and to vary lambda, and we get the simple caspadors of G, by which I mean you get casped, and the equivalence classes of such casped all representations are called the simple caspadors. Third remark is that we may choose different non-trivial characters, psi one to psi n, on each coordinate, kappa to the n. And analyzing the intertwining and normalizer, we get casped in the same fashion. But we can also use the action of I divided by I1 on the situation to show that we don't. Situation to show that we don't really get new cospitals. The caspetals we get by varying psi 1 and ψ n are equivalent to the preceding ones. And similarly, we change our choice of uniformizer, then we do get the same set of equivalence classes of simple Casparov representations. So they are indeed very easy, and you don't see any difference, and you don't see any really simple character in the sense of. Simple character in the sense of Bushnell and Kotsuko. Actually, it's a Landau psi, which is a simple character, but it's so easy to define that the important thing in Bushnell and Kotsko was inventing the concept of simple character, which has nothing to do. Well, it's very different from simple customers. Now, let's switch to how am I doing in terms of time? Well, I'm going fast. Wow, I'm going fast. Let's switch to simple caspetals for another group, split group, the symplectic group. So I see the symplectic group inside the linear group in dimension 2n, so for which I use the notation of the G this twiddle. G twiddle is GL2NF. And on the previous notation, when I consider GL2NF, I put a twiddle. For the symplectic group, For the symplectic group, well, G is S P2NF, which I define as the subgroup of matrices in G twiddle preserving the alternating form B, which has entire diagonal matrix with coefficients 1 minus 1 and 1 minus 1 going down the entire diagonal from top right to bottom left. It's just a matter of specifying which simplicity group I use if we. Symplectic group I use, it would make the difference if I use another presentation. Now, the center of the group G is just made out of scalar matrices, but those scalar matrices have to be in the group of square roots of one in F cross. There is a maximal compact subgroup, which I think Sean has presented too. It's the intersection of Kwido with G, it's just the symplectic group. Symplectic group sp2m OF values in the ring of integers. Similarly, we get an IWARI subgroup, which is intersection G with I twiddle, and it has a filtration I1 is G intersect I1 twiddle, I2 is G intersect I2 twiddle. And this time we can also analyze I1 divided by I2, but because of this symmetry implied by the fact that implied by the fact that our matrices are inside of sp2nf. I1 mod I2 is not kappa to the 2n, as perhaps we would think first, or kappa to dn as we would think at the second thought, but it's kappa to the n plus. And the isomorphism is obtained by sending the over diagonal x12 mod pf up to xn plus 1 mod pf. And n plus 1 mod pf, this is maybe even surprising coefficient. And again, x2n1 divided by pi mod pf. So it's kappa n plus 1 in this case. And again, we'll define lambda psi to be the character of i1, which is given by psi on each coordinate of this vector space kappa to the n plus 1. And it's no surprise that can. And it's no surprise that one can easily control the intertwining of lambda psi in GE, which is J. It's just nu I1. Very simple. Of course, the center has to intertwine, but that's all apart from I1. And this intertwining set is also normalizing. So we get, as previously, the corollary that if lambda is. That if lambda is any character of j in extending lambda spine, the compact induction from j to g of lambda is a cascillo representation of g. Same thing. Cario's criterion applies even more easily than in the case of gl same remarks. If your given size does give you a lamp of size, what do you need to? What do you need to extend to lambda? Well, you need to determine the value on the group of square roots of unity in F cross. Well, it's given by a sign if the residue characteristic is odd. And it has to be trivial if the residue characteristic is true, because then I contains mu. And even if f has characteristic two, mu is trivial anyway. So there is no There is no sign when p is 2. Second remark is as for the group GLN, we may allow different characters on each coordinate of compared to the n plus 1, psi 1 up to psi n plus 1. When p is equal to 2, this does not give new caspitals. So you get caspetals, but they are equivalent to the previous one. But when p is odd, it gives twice more. And the reason, I don't want to go into the detail, but the Don't want to go into the detail, but the real reason is that the group kappa star modular squares has order two, whereas when p is two, kappa star modulus square is just the trivial group. And similarly, as before, we declare that the caspidols which are obtained by the procedure just above are the simple caspidols of the group SB2M. Well, the main object of the The main object of my talk is to examine what happens when you start with those simple cosmos and try and determine what their language parameter. That's part of the program to explicit the language correspondence. So let me recall a little bit the context of the local language correspondence. But Sean has said it already. Sean has said it already just the past hour. I write fs, the separable algebraic closure of f, which he wrote f bar, I think. I take the value group, which is written wf, which defined. And the other notation for Chile and F is the same as in section two, matrices and naiwan, etc. The local nine lens conjecture. The local England's conjecture gives the local England's correspondence. It was proved by L'Homour, Raport, and Stuller when F has positive characteristic. It was proved by Harris and Taylor when L has characteristic zero, and afterwards, I and maybe more afterwards, Schulzer gave simplified proofs. This logo-Langlands correspondence attaches to a caspillow for Jillian. Attaches to a caspido for GLNF, to rather to an equivalence class of caspadols, an irreducible n-dimensional representation of WF. Again, an equivalence class. And it's a bijection. So conversely, if you have an irreducible representation of WF in dimension n, you get a cascader for GLNF, which is well defined up to isomorphism. And the question is, when n is an integer greater than one, and you start with a simple cascader. And you start with a simple caspetal pi for GLNF, determined, as I mentioned, by the choice of uniformizer, the choice of additive character psi, the choice of the value of the character lambda on this matrix, capital Phi, and also the character, the central, part of the central character, which gives the restriction of lambda to units, and which is a character of kappa star. Gamma star, which I call chi. So, given all those data, which are very simply allow to construct the simple plus composition, can we describe the representation sigma of WF, dimension n associated phi? It's a very simple question. We expect a very simple answer. And the sample, well, the answer is yes, we can. Bushnell and I in 2013, 2013 gave an explicit description, not exactly of sigma, but of the projective representation given by sigma. That is, sigma goes into GLNC and you can project GLNC to GLNC and we give a completely explicit description of the projective representation. And then Imai and Tsushima in 2015 gave a geometric realization of sigma. So not only the projective representation, but sigma itself and C. Sigma itself and C rubber geometrically. What is the answer? The answer is very different if P divides M or P doesn't divide. The extreme cases are, of course, P doesn't divide N, which is called the Taine case, well, the essential taint case, in fact. And the other extreme is when N is a power of P and the general case is a mix of the. And the general case is a mix of the two. Let me concentrate on the two extreme cases. When n is not divisible by p, the matrix capital pi, which remember satisfies pi to the n, is equal to the uniformizer. So it generates a totally ramified thin extension E of F of degree n. This totally ramified thin extension. This totally ramified them extension D can be embedded at S in the simple random algebraic closure so that the main group WE can be seen as an index n open subgroup of W N. And it turns out that sigma is induced from a character of WE. Well, by class field theory, this is the same thing as a character of E cross. And which character of E cross we use? Well, it's. It's given on one units of E by sending one plus six to psi at x divided by not by this small Doric pi, but the x divided by capital pi. Sorry for the typo. This is for x belonging to the maximal ideal of the ring of literatures OEN of E. Well, you see, x is a maximum. You see, x is a maximal ideal. Capital Pi is a generator of maximal ideal. So, x divided by capital Pi modulo p e is an element of the residue field kappa E of E. But because the extension E over F is totally rounded by E, residue field kappa E is the same as the residue field kappa. So, I can really take the value of psi on the class of x divided by capital phi multiple. So that's the main part of the character. And you also have to say what the value of the character is on the uniform iso capital pi of E. Well, it's given by alpha. And on the new one, E, but the part made out of the roots of unity over the prime to be Tashmus Muller lifts of cut across into. Of Kappa cross into E cross, it's given by chi, by the character of chi, which goes into the parametrization of the symbol caspos. Well, there may be a slight explicit sign tweet when n is even, but I mean, it's not necessary to write it here. So the answer can be expressed easily in when n is prime to be in this aim. Is prime to be in this tame case, and actually, the answer here is a special case of the work that Sean mentions of Cullen and I when we explicited the Lange correspondence in the essential incidence. So that's a special case. But the case where n is a power of p is much more difficult because then sigma. Because then sigma is not induced from a character, it's not monomial, as we say, but even it's primitive in the sense that it's not induced in any way from a proper subgroup of WF. And primitive representations are not so easy to describe, even very quickly. Let me see how we could approach this problem of describing signal as Sean's. Sean's mention, the main information and actually characterization of all Bohr angles correspondence is that it deserves L and epsilon vectors for pairs. Here I shall only use the characters for a single representation, not for pairs. So that's a special case. Characters for with ln epsilon factors for pairs are defined using ranking server where if you have It was, but if you have a single representation, then you can use the method of German Chaqué generalizing face method. And it gives you, if capital Psi is a non-trivial character of F, an epsilon factor, epsilon pi S psi, where S is a complex variety. And even then, if you can twist, as occurred already in Sean's talk, you can twist by a character of F plus and consider. of f plus and consider the f signed factor of mu pi sign where mu pi is really pi twisted by mu composed with the determinant so mu is a character cross determinant sends glm f to f cross and we can compose mu with the determinant and twist phi the and the local language correspondence is such that this epsilon factor defined by ma and sha k is equal is equal to the epsilon factor of mu sigma as psi. This sigma is the parameter for pi, this is the weighbour representation corresponding to pi. And mu sigma has a new meaning here because mu is a character of f cross. So it corresponds by class field theory to a character of w which I also call nu and I can twist sigma with this character of w. So it turns out that the turns out that the epsilon factors are just monomials in q to minus the exponent is important the exact value for example at zero in one hour is important but here just looking at the exponent we see that the exponent uh the exponent involves the artin conductor on the side of the value group representation and it's called also the artine exponent on the gln side but The GLN sign, but what we obtain is that since the simple caspetals have art in exponent n plus one, in fact, looking at the exponent q to minus s on the side of the vapor representation, we obtain the information that this one exponent of sigma is equal to one. In fact, the simple caspads are the caspital representation. Are the caspado representation of GLNR, which are ramified but the least ramified in the terms of depth that Sean mentioned in his talk? They don't have depth zero, certainly, so they are widely ramified, but they have depth one over m, which is the smallest positive depth which one can obtain for a casped or representation of GLMF. And similarly, sigma And similarly, sigma is the least widely rammified representations that you can encounter. You have the level of zero, the tamely, the tame representations, which would have a swan exponent zero, but here you have swan exponent one. So it should they should be as simple as possible. Another information that you have is that sorry. Is that the central character omega of pi of pi corresponds to that sigma of class field theory? This was also mentioned by Sean. So remember that recall that omega pi is trivial on one plus pf. It's given by the parameter chi on the OF cross UF and it's given by alpha to the n on this is not small pi, it's Doric pi. Small pi is Doric pi. Capital pi to the n is Doric pi, and so capital pi having lambda having value alpha on capital pi as value alpha to the n on Doric pi on the uniformizer. So anyway, the central character of pi is easy to compute from the data, so that sigma is prescribed. And Colin and I shown that if you have a sigma with one of sigma equals one, then it's determined by a few data. You need only specify what the determinant is and also specify what the signing factors are when you twist by the same character. Actually, it's true for in the case of GLNF. of GLNF and so it's true for this sigma 2. Now if you take psi capital of psi to be trivial on pf and given by small psi on OF then it's easy to compute f psi and mu sigma s psi in terms of torque pi, alpha, kappa r, mu, which are all the parameters which intervene in the construction of a simple capacity. And when n is present And when n is prime to p, one checks very easily that the above description does give the answer because description has the right determinant, it has the right assigned factors. And this is not the way that Colin and I proceeded in the more general 10 case, but this direct approach was done by Adrian and New in twenty sixteen, so it's rather easier than the whole authoritarian. Than the whole varieties of a collin and height that I will briefly mention a bit later. Now, when n is a power of p, the fact that we know that the exponent, this one exponent is one, implies that sigma is primitive. If it were induced, then this one exponent would see the ramification of the inducing representation would be at least two. To we know something about primitive representation, but work of Koch in the 1970s. If we let G, well, I should have taken another letter, maybe, if we let G be the image of sigma and G1 its wild inertia subgroup, then G1 is a Heisenberg type group, so it's a group of order n squared P. The center is of order P, and the quotient, which is And the quotient, which is ambiguous of order n squared, is a symplectic group over F. So we know the structure of G1. We also know that there is a minimal Galois name extension E over F such that the restriction sigma V to E becomes induced. So it's not, sigma itself is primitive, but if you restrict enough to a suitable Galois ten extension, then it becomes induced from D V extensions and actually n square of them. Quail then would do. And being induced from a degree p extension means that it's stable under twisting by an order p character. So it's a criterion which has an equivalent for the side of GLMF. And the tools that Collin Buchner and I used to determine at least the projective representation, such as Sigma, even the hard case. Sigma even leaves the hard case where n is power of p. The theory of base change of Rocker and close n and the theory of taint-based change that Connie and my invented. So it's an explicit version of Bayes change. Base change works for cyclic extensions, K over F. And then so if you have a cyclic extension or any extension and the representation of WF on the very group side, you can restrict it to the Restricted to the subgroup WK, which is open-finite index subgroup of WF. Base change constructs from the extension of cyclic the procedure on the side of GLNF. So from GLNF to GLNK, but of course without any reliance on the Bengal sign theoretically on the GLN sign. So it's due to afternoon close L. And Buchener and I using the explicit description. Using the explicit description of Kasparov representation by Gushnev and Katzko can deal with phase change for a tame extension theory, not necessarily Galois or cyclic or Galois. And of course, when you have a tame cyclic extension, you check that the two theories are compatible. So using tame-based change and the criterion for determining E previously, we determined Previously, we determined E really, and also, as I said, the projective representations attached to signal if we're using criteria with character twists, as I mentioned before. E over F is given by an explicit, totally ramified extension term, an explicit polynomial, so totally ramified extension of degree n plus one. And we also have explicit equations for the inducing extension in prime of. Imai and Tsushima, a bit later, proceeded rather differently, possibly motivated by the description that we gave, which was not complete because we published only the projected representations. We knew how to do the linear one, but didn't publish it. And also, they mentioned it, they're motivated by their. They mentioned it motivated by their own work on the linguistic varieties. They guessed G as a group, not too hard. They make it act on the curve over the residue of kappa using an Artenschreier sheaf attached to this character. They get a representation of G on its cohomology. But that's a priori representation of the Navstride group chain. But then they produce G as a quotient of W F and they check using the And they check using the criterion which I mentioned before with epsilon factors in determinant that the representation facility is the right one. So this finishes the story for GLN, and I still have a few minutes to say what happens for simple transports in the case of SP2F. So the notation is as section three. As section three, so notation for SP2N. But now I have the hypothesis that the characteristic is zero, because Arthur's work is for characteristic zero or fields. Possibly lots of it can be extended to positive characteristic organisms, but I'm not talking about that today. As Sean mentioned, Arthur associates the cuspidor and more general. Associates the caspidal and more generally discrete series representation pi called sp2nf the parameter which is a morphism pi depending on pi of ws cross sl2c into the dual group which is so n plus 1c and this parameter is taken up to conjugation by the dual group and since we're dealing with discrete series we have some irreducibility condition that phi is the during That phi is the direct sum of inequivalent irreducible alphabet representations pi one, pi pi. So the irreducibility condition is that the irreducible components of phi should be inequivalent. Now, as Sean mentioned again, the discrete series of the same parameter phi form an L packet, L of phi, and this L packet has two. And this L packet has two to the R minus one. So only if the morphism has only is irreducible is the L packet a single term. Otherwise, there are more elements. There is a way to label the elements of the L packet if you are given Witteker datum that essentially a Borel subgroup of G and the non-degenerate character of the unipotent radical is Borel. The unipotent radical is borrowed, then the L packet contains a unique element with the corresponding protected model. And it's possible to label all the elements by characters of the group Z or 2Z to R minus 1 with the representation with the Wittecker model corresponding to the trivial character of that. That group can be defined in terms of y, but as shown, I will not. Sean, I will not give definition. And the question is the same as previously. Assume that you have a simple representation, can you describe what the parameter is? One information is that file is indeed trivial on SL2C, and that's easy because we know that. That's easy because we know that from the construction that has a witch of the model field. So if phi were not triggered on a cell to see, the element in the alpha k associated with pi cannot be superclassical by results of the planet shoe. The second information is much harder and uses the full strengths of the author's construction via endoscopy and twisted endoscopy and institute to Mazaukoy. The fact is that r is one or two, that is, either phi is irreducible or is the sum of the character I say square one and in the irreducible representation of dimension 2n. That's really important information. And the outcome is rather different when p is odd and when p is 2. When p is odd, Which is due to Mazari, pi is reducible. Indeed, there is no irreducible orphanal representation of WF in odd dimension greater than one. So pi cannot be reducible. And as I said before, r is equal to two. And Mazaro determined the two irreducible components explicitly from the character lambda. Remember, character lambda is just psi and. Psi and a sine. And it turns out that the irreducible components in dimension 2n is indeed the parameter attached to a simple cascador for GL2NF. And this simple cascador corresponds to exactly the same choices of uniformizing parameter and additive character. So this maybe was to be expected, but still it's good to have confirmation, and the proof is not so easy. Is not so easy. When p is 2, I first obtain the result that when f is equal to q2, because I could use results of Ariane Kaplan, which I mentioned a bit later. And then Mazaroi and I joined forces to get the general case. So F is any two-handed field. Then phi is irreducible, contrary to the previous case. And it is also the representation. Also, the representation attached to a simple cast results for GLN2N plus 1F, which is explicitly given from the data defining lambda. And again, it corresponds to the same choices of pi and psi. I have a couple of remarks, and I still have three minutes, I think. So I might give the remarks on Libya. Might give the remarks, or maybe I do have one hour, okay? 15 minutes. So, a couple of remarks. First, author, in fact, doesn't give phi directly. It's not really the local language correspondence that he gives. It's the kind of transfer of functoriality from sp2nf to gl2n plus 1f. So he doesn't give pi directly, but rather he gives. Phi directly, but rather he gives the representation phi i of general linear groups corresponding to the irreducible components phi i of phi. And indeed, the way we use this endoscopic and twisted endoscopic character relations to get the whole in the pi i's is gives some information on pi i's and not on the pi directly. So, at this point, I should mention maybe two other approaches which are Other approaches which can be used to tackle the same problem. One approach is using a Moglas criterion to determine what the pi i's are which intervene in the parameter for pi. It works when p is odd and you will hear about it in Coin Rodell's talk maybe, I don't know, on Friday. I don't know, on Friday. It almost works in the sense that there is still an ambiguity. It's rather general, it's not restricted to simple caspetals, but there is some ambiguity which still has to be resolved, and perhaps even in the simple cospital case. The error has been advocated by Moshe Artojani for the years, and he set up to Set up to this program is to use the characterization. After all, we have a characterization of epsilon of sigma using epsilon factors and the determinant. And if you can guess what sigma is with the right epsilon factor and determinant, then you get it. So Adrian and Adrian and Kaplan worked out. Worked out the computation of the F-simm factors. Well, where do they come? The F-7 factors. The F-simmer factors can be seen at the level of the SP2N by some rather complicated Frankenselling. For SP2N, that's difficult to compute, and especially when P is 2. This is why I could treat only the case where P is equal, F is equal to Q2 in my. To tune to in my first approach, and I had to join forces with Mazaru I to give the general case. Just a remark, when P is out, I also treat split special orthogonal groups. But now we have completed the case where P is two by reversing to reverting to the approach of Adoyan. So the approach of Adoyan lacked only one. lacked only one step, which is that this choice, the shape, so the shape of the parameter. It turns out that it was important to know that the parameter is irreducible and we provide that. One piece to provide the special forgotten groups. The parameter is ignorable or irreducible plus. Or irreducible plus character. And using this approach in computations, or rather hot computations by Adrian Klaus complete the case for split special orthogonal groups. There are other groups yet you can look at, but when P is out, the OE treats the Ramified non-split special orthogonal groups and also unramified individual groups, but when P is two, they are still remaining to be treated. That remaining to be treated. So maybe I should stop here because the last slide is sort of technical. So it's, I know you have something to do right now. And maybe I'll answer questions and then look at the soccer game. So thank you very much for your attention. So, are there any questions or comments either for Sean Stevens or Ian Ya? Hello, hello. It is a beautiful set of lectures and talk, and it also saddens me that Colin Bushnell is not here, remembering much of the work. And I did have a simple question to put things in context, how do the level zero and the epipalagic come into play inside the work that you describe now? I'm not sure I've heard. I'm not sure I've heard your question. Epipelagic representations? Yes, epipelagic representations are something which were introduced, some rather simple two representations which were introduced by you and reader. They are a bit more general than simple classports. Especially for classical groups, you have epileptic representations which are not simple classpods. So of course it's not Hospitals. So, of course, it's natural to ask what we can say about the parameter of epipelagic representations. Epipologic representations also occur rather uniformly across the group and the residue characteristics, so they do exist, they are interesting, but okay, it's an open question to determine their parameters. It's not done yet. I suspect it's not so difficult with the technology which we have. Technology we have, we have three different approaches and Arthur's approach, the one with epsilon factors, and also the one that Cohen will tell you about. But okay, works to be done. Young people, do it. Any further questions or comments? So, if not, we thank the speakers again. Welcome. My pleasure. Now we have a coffee break. And as always, we maintain the Zoom session open. And we continue at 11.  Um and it's all colours that we're not If you can hear me, I was going to ask if we could upload your slides of the talk online, if that would be okay. I cannot hear you. Maybe you're muted. Yes, you're welcome to upload the slides. As I mentioned during the talk, I noticed a few typos at the last minute, but they should not be rubber too hard on the reader. And I hope it gives the impression of what we do. What we do. Yes, so yeah, they are recording many of the talks, and then the slides can also be uploaded to the web. So please do that. And thank you for typing, actually. Thank you very much. I wouldn't. No problem whatsoever. I guess I'll get a cup of coffee now, but it's good to see you. But it's uh it's good to see you yes, I'm glad to to see the audience, a bit of the audience now. And my other job, of course, is that of a grandfather. Yes, so we did not shift too much the schedule with your grandchildren because we moved four. No, that's okay because my wife is uh is uh with them at their home, so I'm alone. So, I'm alone here. I don't have to deal with the babies tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. It will be my turn. Oh, okay. So, my regards to Elizabeth. Certainly, certainly she sends her best. And so I'll have to see somebody, somebody phoned, I have to see what's happened. So I'll listen to the arbitrarily. Thank you again, Luis, for organizing all. Uh, race for organizing all this. See you later. See ya. Bye.
