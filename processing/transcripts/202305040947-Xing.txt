Thanks a lot, the organizer, for this opportunity. And it's such a blessing for this week. So I hope to use this opportunity to share with you this recent work. This is the first time we ever presented, so any suggestion or comments are greatly appreciated. I started the project with Ali when he was in Rice University, and then later Karebeck got involved, and Ali moved to Berkeley. And Ali moved to Berkeley and claimed a PhD student at Berkeley who helped a lot on the empirical side of this paper. So for a public company in the US, they have a board of directors. And two major part of their jobs is first they need to implement the oversight system and monitor the system. And secondly, they also determine the compensation package for the top executive. The top executive. The research question that we aim at is: how do the firm and the board of directors use the monitoring to determine the long-term compensation to their top executives? More particularly, how do the board optimally set the compensation in response to the signal they observe from the monitoring? And when do firms monitor more or less? So, in summary, we propose a dynamic principle. Propose a dynamic principal agent problem. And in the setting, there is a project, and the project only generates a long-sum payoff at the end when the project is successfully finished. And the arrival of this success is random. And this follows a Bolson process whose intensity is controlled by the agent. And there is no intermediate cash flow. So there is only one long-sum cash flow. Is only one lump-sum cash flow when the project is finished. And on top of that, principal also observes a noisy signal about the agent's effort, and the principal can use that to incentivize the agent. The continuation utility of the agent is driven by the signal that the principal observes. And the sensitivity of that, we call this contract sensitivity to the monitoring. In the optimal contract, the principle of the In the optimum contract, the principal decides this sensitivity and also how much the principal paid when the project is finished successfully. The main result of the paper can be summarized by this implementation. The optimal contract is implemented by this performance index. And this performance index PI follows a dynamics. It has a deterministic drift, which is always negative. Drift, which is always negative, and is driven by this signal, which is the DUI. The weight in front of this is the contract sensitivity to the monitoring, which is always positive. So the positive signal will increase the performance index, and the negative signal will decrease the performance index. If the performance index drops to a lower bound, then the project will terminate ineffective. Will terminate it inefficiently, no matter whether this project is completed or not. And moreover, if the project is completed at this awesome jump time nu, and if it is further a success at the completion, then the principal will reward a monetary compensation to the agent, which depends on the current value of this performance index. And this R function is increasing with respect to the performance index. So if the performance index is high at the completion time, then the reward is large. If the performance index is low at the completion time, then the reward is low. And moreover, we show that when there is a positive signal, this contract sensitivity, the weight that you put on your current signal. On your current signal to integrate it into the performance index, this jobs. So after the positive signal, you put less weight on your current and future signal, and in some sense, the monitoring is less important. On the other hand, the reward increase. So positive signal means that the agent is monitored less and reward more. On the other hand, if the signal is negative, then the monitor. Is negative, then the monitoring is more and the reward is less. So after the negative signal, if there are further negative signal, because this size increases and the further negative signal will substantially decrease the performance index, which also decrease the reward at the completion. So this is a kind of a punishing mechanism for an agent. There is also an empirical There is also an empirical side of the paper. There are two model implications that we want to bring the data. Empirically, it's very difficult or impossible to observe what the signal that the board of director observe. So what we want to examine is there are some exogenous shock on the quality of the signal that the board of director receives. To provide a proxy for that, we look at the direct. That we look at the direct flight between the board of directors residence to the headquarter of the firm. So, if at certain point in the tenure of the director, the flight is permanently removed, then you can imagine that it's getting difficult for this board of director to travel to the headquarters of the firm to attend the board meeting in person and monitor the firm. And monitor the firm. As a result, we assume that the quality of the signal that the board receives is lower. And if the quality of the signal received is lower, then they want to increase the long-term compensation to still incentivize the agent. And to approximate the long-term reward in our model, we use the optional award for the top executive. There are two model implications. The first is that when the signal position is reduced, then in the optimal contract, it depends less on the signal that the principal observe. To ensure still the incentive compatibility constraint, you need to increase the future reward. And empirically, we observe that if at least one of the board directors loses a direct flight to the headquarters of the firm, then Headquarters of the firm, then the option compensation increased by 11.1%. And the second implication is that this increase in the long-term compensation is larger when the firm performs badly. And we show that when the firm has lower than medium profitability, then this increase is 21.9%. Now there is a Now, there is a relative more literature on the monitoring in dynamic contracting. Several people in the audience contribute in this direction. The most relevant paper to us is this paper by Perkovsky and Westerfield, who show that there is a hump-shaped relation between the monitoring and the continuation utility. In particular, when the continuation utility is low, the monitoring is also low. In our model, In our model, we show there is a decreasing relation between the monitoring and the continuation utility. So, if the continuation utility is low, the monitoring is the highest. In a nutshell, the model looks like this. The agent choose effort which is in a finite time, finite interval from 0 to A bar. A bar is the maximum effort, or a deficient effort, of the agent. Of the agent. It's a shorting model. If the agent does not perform the highest level of the effort, then there is a linear private benefit received by the agent. Agent has a reservation utility. Whenever the future continuation utility drops to this level, the agent will stop the contract and walk away. At that time, the project will be terminated, and this is assumed. And this is assumed to be inefficient due to the principle. The agent's action is the arrival rate of the Boson process, which is the completion for the project. At the same time, the agent's effort also increase the probability of success at the completion. So agent's effort has two roles. One makes the project on average shorter. On average, shorter, and second, they make it more likely to be a success at its completion. Once it is a success, the project generates a lump-sum payoff, which is called the data. And on top of that, the principal observes a noisy signal about the agent's effort. And this noisy signal has A as the drift, and there is a Brownian noise whose precision is this X. The agent problem is to choose the optimal effort to maximize the continuation utility. Before the termination or completion of the project, the agent will receive a flow compensation and a private benefit if they decide to shirk. If the project is finished before its termination, and the agent will receive expected reward and Reward, and if the project is inefficiently terminated before it's complete, then the agent will walk away with the outside value. The first result is that the agent's optimal effort has the following form. If this inequality is satisfied, the agent will exert the highest effort, otherwise zero. And this inequality says that on the left-hand side, the first term is. The first term is the expected reward if the agent works the highest effort. And the second phi is the sensitivity of the agent's continuation utility to the signal. As a result, the left-hand side is the marginal gain if the agent works the fullest. On the right-hand side, if the agent works, they will lose the private benefit, hence there is a marginal cost of this lambda. And if the agent Lambda and if the agent work it makes the project on average shorter. If the project is completed, the agent will also forfeit all the future continuation utility, hence this is another cost UT. So when the marginal cost benefit is larger than the marginal cost, the agent will work at the highest level. And we assume that the agency friction is not too big, so that it's still optimal for. So, that it's still optimal for the principal to implement the full effort contract. Otherwise, the principal will just walk away and do not engage the project at all. The main result of the paper can be kind of summarized in this plot. First, as usual in the Senikov and the Maso type of the paper, the value function for the principle is conc. For the principal is concave in the agent's continuation utility, and there is an upper bound of the agent's continuation utility, which we call the U-upper bar. And because of this connectivity, the incentive compatibility constraint, that inequality we show in the previous slides, is actually an identity. And this shows that the expected reward and this contract sensitivity, they are perfectly substitutes each other. Perfectly substitute each other. You only need their sum to be larger than the marginal cost to incentivize the highest effort. And this will play a big role later. In the middle panel, you see that this contract sensitivity to the monitoring, which is this phi, is decreasing with respect to the continuation utility, and it's completely shut down at the highest level. So when the U is at the When the U is at the upper level, you completely shut down the monitoring. The signal doesn't matter at all. You only incentivize the agent to use the reward R. And since they are perfectly substitute each other, then the success reward is an increasing function of the continuation utility. And this is the lowest at the beginning. So, more theoretically, we can summarize the main result in the following. Summarize the main result in the following slides. The optimal reward has the following form. The optimal contract sensitivity is always strictly positive unless you are at the upper level, the U-upper bar. And moreover, typically in the Mazo and Senikov type of paper, you show the optimal contract by numerically solving some PDE or ODE. Or ODE, and here because the model is quite simple, we can provide some analytic results, at least in a neighborhood of the upper bound. So we show that in a neighborhood, the optimal reward is increasing with the continuation utility. In the limit, it converged to the maximum value. And on the other side, the contract sensitivity dropped to the lowest level, which is zero. Moreover, if this technical assumption is Moreover, if this technical assumption is satisfied, then the derivative of the reward goes to infinity at the limit, and the derivative of the contract sensitivity goes to negative infinity in the limit. And in this technical assumption, there is this V second order derivative at the upper boundary. Typically, in the Mazo and Senikov, you have a supercontact condition, and that second order derivative equals to zero. In our case, To zero. In our case, we can show that this is always strictly less than zero, so the supercontact condition will never hold. And as a result, the flow compensation, which is the singular control, in the muslin equal in our setting is always equals to zero. So you don't have the reflection type of the flow compensation, and all the transfer is conducted by only the Lampson report at the end. To see what's the mechanism. To see what's the mechanism for the result, let's recall this continuation utility for the agent. The red part is the expected success reward, and the blue part is the contract sensitivity. So they are tied to each other because of this perfect substitution. If you increase the red part, the blue part has to decrease. And let's imagine that the U continuation utility is close to the outside value. Close to the outside value. If you reach the outside value, the firm will be liquidated, which is inefficient, and this is bad for the principal. So the principal wants to control this termination risk. What he does is he's trying to decrease this red part, which increases the drift of the continuation utility, but at the expense that if you decrease the red part because of the perfect substitution. Because of the perfect substitution, you need to increase the blue part. As a result, you have a positive drift, but you have a larger volatility. But intuitively, the positive drift will always lead the continuation utility to be larger. And whether the volatility decrease or increases the continuation utility depends on your sign of the fundamental shock. So, in some sense, the drift effect dominates. In some sense, the drift effect dominates in this case, and the principal prefers to increase the drift at the expense of increase the volatility. A technical part, at the upper level, the drift is always negative, and the volatility, which is this spy, that we show it's completely shut down. As a result, whenever you reach the upper level, the drift is negative. There is no volatility, there is no chance you can go. There is no chance you can go over the upper level. Therefore, there is no reflection. And we also show this supercontact condition. Minutes for empirics. To link to the empirics, we change the precision of the signal. Once the precision of the signal becomes lower, then the reward increases. The reward increases in part of the state space. And remember that when you are at the higher level of the continuation utility, the drift is negative. So most of the state is kind of distributed along this regime before you have a shock on the signal position. So, two implications for the model. First, when there is a When there is an exogenous reduction in the signal quality, then the success reward increases because of this substitution effect. And secondly, this increase is more significant when the negative evidence culminated in history. So, as we kind of foreshadow in the introduction, we approximate this quality of the signal by whether Of the signal by whether there is a direct flight available between the residence of the board of director to the headquarter of the firm. And to mitigate the endogenous effect, we look at the exogenous shock. So at the beginning, the board of director have access to the director of flight. In the middle, the director of flight is stopped. The main instrument variable, the main independent variable. The main independent variable is this director stopped. It's a dummy variable. It is equal to one. If at least one member of the board lost this director access to the director flight in that year, if this flight was previously available. The main empirical study is provided by some Bolston regression. You assume that the fair value of the option for The value of the option follows a Poisson distribution whose mean value is regressed using this exponential form on the right-hand side, where this is your main variable, and there are some control on the feature of the firm, and there are also some fixed effects. Let me just show two slides on the empirical regression. Control all the fixed effects and also Effect and also the firm characteristics. The option award increased by 11% if the directed flight is stopped, and this is significant at 10% level. One more, maybe less. In reality, some of the CEOs are also chairperson of the board. In that case, he is in charge to determine the compensation. In charge to determine the compensation of his own. So, in this sense, you can think that the board has less dependence. And we show that in the case that the CEO is not the chairperson of the board, this effect is more significant. So, there is more dependence of the board, and if the other independent director loses the flight, this has more impact on the option grant for the topics that are. Option grant for the top exact. To conclude, we also have an extension where in the baseline the signal is free. There is an extension where the signal is also costly. The principal needs to pay a cost which is proportional to the precession. And we show that there is a band-band type of the signal precession choice if the continuation utility is. If the continuation utility is low, the principal will choose the highest precision. When the continuation utility is high, the principal will choose the lowest precision, which is kind of consistent with the baseline result. And thanks.
