Give a talk in Banff. I hope our next one will be presential. My previous meeting in Banff was just before the close-up, and it was in Bannfor Haka, which was wonderful, really great place. Well, today I'm going to talk about subspace stabilization. About subspace stabilizers in hyperbolic lattices, which is a joint work, I would say, joint work in progress with Nikolai Bogachov, Sasha Kaupakov, and Leoni Slavich. So I will present some results and also mention some questions that we are thinking about. Well, let me say something. I'm going to start with a gentle introduction. It's the first talk. Gentle introduction: It's the first talk of the workshop. I'm I saw the list of participants, and I'm aware that many of you know very well what are going to be on my first slides, but still I feel that some others may benefit and also for others. Good to refresh, not to run. So, well, basic example, not basic example, basic class of examples to consider. Of examples to consider for today's talk is hyperbolic reflection groups, and they will appear in other talks in the workshop as well. So, well, as kind of a definition, look at hyperbolic polyhedron in Hn with diagram angles integral quotients of pi, pi over m, or could be also pi over infinity corresponding to cusps. And look at a group gamma generated by reflections in co-dimensional one phases, facets they call sometimes of this polyhedron. So well, here is a picture of Doddy Gahedron in hyperbolic dimension three, a very famous figure. Well, it may happen that. I'm sorry, I don't think your slides are progressing. I only see the title. I only see the title. Sorry. Thank you, Paul. It might be that you see your site slides full screen, but we see the other window, which is in the back of your full screen. So maybe it should switch off the full screen. Let's try this way. And now? Yes, now I can see the yeah. Okay, so I just quit full screen and now it's better. Good. And so. Good. And sorry. So well, we are talking about hyperbolic polyhedra in the NHM and groups generated by reflections in the facets of collimention one phases of polyhedron. These are hyperbolic reflection groups. So already, you see here it looks that I'm mentioning some obvious facts, but there are already But there are already several big results in the background. First of all, why this polyhedron exists? Well, in dimension two, it's the Poincar√© theorem. In dimension three, it's a deep theorem of Andre, which is directly connected to geometrization conjecture, Swesch theorem of Thurston, and etc. In dimensions higher than three, we don't know precisely. Three, we don't know precise conditions when the polydron will exist, and here there is another assumption that I assume that gamma is not a discrete group, so the group generated by reflections. That is, okay, in that case, P is a fundamental polyhedron for gamma and gamma is a cochlear group. However, the next warning is that, as Winberg and his students showed, Winberg and his students showed in the 70s and 80s these hyperbolic reflection groups, which are lattices, so of finite co-volume, they exist only in bounded dimensions. Well, anyways, there are some things in the background, but there is a picture of hyperbolic dodicihedron in dimension three, and we can think about and imagine hyperbolic reflex. About and imagine hyperbolic reflections groups. So, what do we want to do with them? In our work, we are interested in phases of P. So, here is an observation that for each phase of this polyhedron, we have an involution in the group gamma reflection on hyperplane, which lifts to an immersed totally geodesic subspace. Merth totally geodesic subspace of the finite cover of the quotient space. Well, here is a picture, say in dimension two, assume that P, this polyhedron, is a hyperbolic triangle and look at the covering Riemann surface of genus two. So this is a hyperbolic surface. Surface and you can consider a lift for say any H of P to this surface, and what you will get is a geodesic curve immersed of finite length. Well, this schematic picture, of course. And the same phenomenon happens in higher dimensions. So, well, so far, so good. Well, so far, so good. Now I want to change the perspective. And this is the first idea. So we don't start with reflection groups. We even don't have any reflection group at all. What we start for Rome is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension M, N, say M, and we look at a totally geodesic immersed sub-manifold. It can be also orbital. Manifold. It can be also orbifold, so suborbifold. And the question is: Is there some finite group like reflection in the involution in the previous case, which we can naturally associate to this totally geodratic subordinate fault? Well, so after some thinking and playing and experimenting, we came up with a definition of a finite Of a finite centralizer subspace or F C subspace for short. So an immersed totally geodetic suborbifold of a hyperbolic orbifold is called F C subspace. If there exists a finite subgroup of conventurator of its group, so F is a finite subgroup of com gamma, such that H, this subspace is a projection of the Is a projection of the fixed point set of this finite subgroup. So, in other words, n is a quotient of h, which is a fixed point set, modulus of the stabilizer in gamma of h. Well, here is a reminder, okay. Fixed point set is clear. We just look at, okay, we have a subgroup of isometries, and we look at the points in hyperbolic space, which are fixed by all the elements. Which are fixed by all the elements of F. And commengurator is an important notion in various aspects, and it's important for us. So commensurator is a set of the element isometries which commensurate gamma in a sense that the quotient, oh, the intersection has finite index in both. I think there is a question in chat. In chat. You mentioned eco. I'm using headphones, so it should be reasonable. Can some organizers say if I should do something? Okay, good. So I continue. How to close this. How to close this well? So, commengerator, and here is the thing. So, we are talking, we start with the lattice, then a totally geodetic subspace in the quotient. What is commengerator? Commen generator can be very big. For instance, if gamma is a SL2Z, modular group, then its common generator is going to be SL2Q. So, it's a dense subgroup. So it's a dense subgroup of SL2R. It's huge. And there are a lot of finite subgroups there. So there are many choices for F. This is the idea. In general, if gamma is an arithmetic lattice, Kamenjurator will be dense by Barrel's theorems and theorem. And we are going to use that. Well, for short, if you want to take just one fact. Take just one fact out of my talk, I would suggest you to take this definition. We are going to apply it for hyperbolic lattices, but it's very general definition in a sense. You can just change this hyperbolic orbifold or say other locally symmetric space, or even forget about the space and just look. Forget about the space and just look at the group gamma and its commanderator. And then you can look at the finite subgroups of commengerator and consider corresponding fixed point sets and define some version of a totally geodetic subspace when there is no even Riemannian metric on the space. So we didn't thought that much about it, but it's possible to. Much about it, but it's possible to apply the definition in different ways. Well, oops, where I am. First important property of this Fc subspaces is that if you take an Fc subspace of dimension at least two of a finite volume hyperbolic orbifold, then it's going to be finite volume hyperbolic orbifold. And okay, the And okay, the this is not totally obvious property because okay why why why it has to be finite it can as geodesic for instance can in principle accumulate and distribute erodically in your space but it's not gonna happen with FC subspaces so it's it's a So it's a first proposition. Now, in order to continue, I need to bring in arithmetic lattices and talk a little bit about arithmeticity. Again, something which is familiar to many people here, but I'm going to first remind the definition of arithmeticity for our For our hyperbolic reflection groups, our first example. Let's consider a cost of polyhedron in HM, like in the beginning of the talk. And okay, it has a gram matrix, which is a matrix. So you take this E E G. So there are the normal vectors, unit normal vectors to the facets of P and look at their. P and look at their inner product in the vector model in the vector model of the hyperbolic space using quadratic form of signature N1. And then you put this inner products into a matrix, and this is called gram matrix of polyhedron. What happens is that What happens is that these entries are, well, you can understand because their angles are pi over n, basically. And well, eventually these entries can be in algebraic numbers. So we'll see it in finite extension of T and we can consider. And we can consider the two fields. One field is generated by all the entries of the gram matrix, and another field, little k is generated by all cyclic products of the entries of the gram matrix. And here, okay, I will not give a definition of arithmeticity to save a bit of time, but here is an Winberg's criterion for hyperbolic reflection group to be arithmetic. Be to be arithmetic. So we start with gamma-ray reflection group with the finite Cabonium fundamental Cox and Palahedron. Then this group will be arithmetic defined over field little k of p if and only if the following three conditions hold. So this field generated by matrix entries of the gram matrix has to be a totally real algebraic number field. And for any embedding of For any invariant of this big kp into R, well, except one, the associated matrix is positive definite, positive semi-definite. Moreover, the cyclic products of this, okay, two gram matrices, two Gram matrix two multiplied by gram matrix have to be the algebraic integers of the ground teeth. In this case, a group is called arithmetic. And here is one more sentence which says that it's also from the paper of Windberg from 67. He defines the group to be quasi-arithmetic if and only if it satisfies conditions two, one and two, but does not satisfy condition three. Does not satisfy condition three for entries to be algebraic integers. Or not necessarily satisfy condition three. So properly quasi-arithmetic if it does not satisfy. Somehow lately, this definition of quasi-arithmetic groups became important by several reasons. So I will talk a little bit more about them, but why Bit more about them, but why quasi-arithmetic groups are interested? Uh, I can mention now. So we are let's talk about proper proper quasi-arithmetic groups. First of all, there is Markool's criterion for arithmeticity, which says that in arithmetic case, the commencerator is dense, like we saw with SL2Q, right? So, commencurator is dense, while in non-arithmetic case, the commencator. In non-arithmetic case, the commencerator is a discrete subgroup, it's a lattice itself, so it's a striking dichotomy. And if you look at the proper quasi-arithmetic group, looks like you dropped just one condition, but the things change so dramatically. So by Margulis' theorem, its commensurator is going to be going to be a lattice itself, discrete subgroup. And for us, it's also important. And for us, it's also important because you remember, let me go back to my favorite definition, that here we are looking at finite subgroups of commensurator. So when commengerator is a lattice, commencerator is much smaller. There is less space to choose these finite subgroups. And quasi-arithmetic groups can give such examples. The second important fact about quasi-arithmetic groups is that now we know that there Is that now we know that there exists in all dimensions of the hyperbolic space? And so, why? That is by the following fact. Well, how to construct non-arithmetic lattices in all dimensions. This is Gromov-Petevsky-Shapiro construction. However, if you look at the Gromov-Petevsky-Shapiro construction, you will notice that the non-arithmetic lattices that we So, the non-arithmetic lattices that you get are not quasi-arithmetic. Ready? They're even more non-arithmetic, if you want. So, no quasi-arithmetic. However, there is more recent work which was started by Ego and then with Scott Thompson we generalize some of Ego's results and edit a little bit. So, there is another construction of non-arithmetic. Non-arithmetic lattices in HN, which is called inbridging sometimes. So, like in a sense, you take one arithmetic piece and glue it to itself. And this construction, the first motivation for this construction was to construct hyperbolic n-dimensional manifolds with arbitrary small C-stall. But then Scott observed that actually all the groups which come That actually, all the groups which come from this inbreeding construction are in fact quasi-arithmetic, and most of them are non-arithmetic. So, we have quasi-arithmetic lattices in all dimensions. And we from one side, we have the arithmetic characterization, from other side, we have this geometric construction. And from, say, third side, there is Malguli's theorem, which tells you that the commengerator is this. That the command generator is discrete. Well, I continue a little bit more. So, in our work, we did quite a detailed study of arithmetic subgroups of isometries of the hyperbolic n-space. Well, basically, everything here is well known, at least to some people. But in short, there are three types. There are three types of arithmetic groups, of isometries, of hyperbolic isometries. First, the simplest type, and arithmetic reflection groups that were discussed so far of this type. So, more general, these are arithmetic groups defined by quadratic forms. There is type 2 associated to unitary SUN1. S u and one and unitary groups. And this type two is possible only in odd dimensions and but in all odd dimensions there are arithmetic groups of type one and arithmetic groups of type two which are not of type one. And also in dimension three and dimension seven there are what we call exceptional type. So in dimension seven it's related to triality form of type Form of type D4, well known to people who work in algebraic groups. And okay, it's known to be complicated and a very interesting case indeed. I would like to mention that, okay, in dimension three, what do we have? In dimension three, we have, if we follow this classification. If we follow this classification, we have simplest types associated to quadratic form. We have type 2 associated to unitary group. And we do have also exceptional type in dimension 3, which is not of type 2. That is, I think it was first observed by Norrie and appears in a comment in Limiun's own paper. However, they don't elaborate on details. Don't elaborate on details, so we were puzzled about it a little bit. Sometimes there is a confusion here. So people say that in dimension three, we have okay, type one, type two, and nothing else, but it's not true. There is also exceptional type in dimension three. So in dimension three, there is another construction using quaternion algebras, and then you get all of them. However, sometimes it makes sense to separate, and if you really separate, you see all three types well. See all three types, well, three different types in dimension three. So, if you are interested in details of this, you can check our preprint. We tried to details were known to some people for a long time, but it's impossible to find. So we tried to write it down carefully. Well, and here, what I already mentioned is fundamental result about arithmetic groups is that gamma is. About arithmetic groups is that gamma is arithmetic if and only if its commensurator is dancing the real points of the isometry group, and it's non-arithmetic if commensurator is discrete. Well, I think I'm done with the introduction. So I would like to show some of our results. Perhaps before telling about the results, I should make a little warning that Warning that we have a paper in Archive, but it's a preliminary version, so that it should be taken with caution. And we are working on a new version. I hope we will be able to post it in a month or two, but there are some statements which need to be corrected in the preprint. Well, either read it with caution or wait for a new version. I will mention some of these details during the talk. However, I will not be able to go into the proofs. Well, so the first result is that if we take arithmetic or quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic and orbifold and a totally geodetic suborbifault of dimension at least two, then n this suborbifold is else arithmetic or quasi-arithmic. Is else arithmetic or quasi-arithmetic. In particular, if you take arithmetic or default and a FC subspace, then it's also be arithmetic and the same for quasi-arithmetic. So, well, this was partly known before. Here is a remark that is more delicate is that actually this suborbital n is not necessarily defined over the same field as m and even if As M and even if it is an FG subspace. So even with quadratic forms, we can of the simplest type, we can create an example when, for instance, you take an arithmetic lattice of dimension n and then you the we can construct an F C subspace of dimension roughly n over 2 that is going to be defined over quadratic extension of the field of. Quadratic extension of the field of definition of M. So this remarks indicates that not everything is trivial in this theorem. But on the other hand, we do have good understanding and complete question, at least for type one and type two, of what is going on. We still have some questions. We still have some questions about type 3 in dimension 7, which we don't know how to answer. Well, theorem 2 is the main theorem of our paper. This is the whole theorem is the following. We have a dichotomy. Either M is, so take an arithmetic finite, take hyperbolic finite volume or befold. The dichotomy is as follows. the dichotomy is as follow. Either it is arithmetic, in which case it has infinitely many FC subspaces, and moreover, all totally geodesic subspaces of sufficiently large co-dimension, roughly sufficiently small co-dimension, sorry, roughly smaller than half or large dimension. Or largely mention RFC subspaces. And in contrary, so the other part of dichotomy is that in non-arithmetic case, M has only finitely many of C subspaces and their number is bounded by constant multiple of the volume of them. So this is the result. Have a corollary here. Hope it's visible. So this part is a little bit annoying that we have to restrict co-dimension. However, dimension three case, which is important case, it's one of our principal motivations. So in dimension three, the dichotomy becomes more clean. Either it's arithmetic within cleaning many of C subspaces and all totally just. Of C subspaces and all totally geodetic subspaces are F C, or it's non-arithmetic with only finitely many FC subspaces because this dimension bound, you know, well, it becomes two co-dimension two. Well, you cover them all. We also, let me mention that in this theorem, we allow to consider one-dimensional FC subspaces. FC subspaces which are geodesics. So, and this is important in dimension three. There are examples of three-dimensional hyperbolic orbifolds, could be arithmetic, that have no codimension one totally geodesic subspaces. These are, for instance, the reason criterion of our and McLoughlin that. That and McLaughlin that they have co-dimension one subspace if only if they are of type one arithmetic. So you take type two, exceptional type, and there is no co-dimension one subspaces, but they all have co-dimension two subspaces, geodesics, of course. Moreover, we can prove. So it would not be so clear what to, there is no definition of one-dimensional, you know, arithmetic manifold, but Manifold, but our definition of FC subspace works pretty well. So, this geodesics, I will show more about this, are fixed points of finite order elements of involutions in H3. So, well, here is the main theorem. So, to put it in the contents a bit more, I mentioned a I mention a recent important result of Baden, Fisher-Miller-Sorber, and independent team of Gurus Mohammadi. So I mentioned only part of their result, which is in fact the main, the most difficult part. A non-arithmetic finite volume hyperbolic manifold has only finitely many proper maximal, well, okay, let's say only finitely many total. finitely many totally geodetic subspaces, maximal totally geodetic subspaces of dimension greater equal than two. And then in their paper, they also have, of course, another part that in arithmetic case, there are infinitely many. The arithmetic part would be easier. So well, so they proved this dichotomy of this type for all totally geodetic subspaces. Totally geodesic subspaces. We proved similar kind of dichotomy for only FC subspaces. So, from one side, of course, we our case is less restrictive, but at the same time, we get the same type of results. So, either infinitely many or finitely many. So, we get characterization. And in many cases, it's possible to construct these FC subspaces explicitly. FC subspaces explicitly. It depends on what you call explicitly, but you really can put hands on them. While in this case, the main part of the proof is a new super-rigidity theorem, which uses some ergodic arguments. So there is, it's a difficult proof of different kind. Perhaps one more thing to mention. Perhaps one more thing to mention is that our theorem too is independent on these recent results. In part two, we use Margulis' theorem, but the classical Margulis theorem, not the new theorem of Margulis Mohammadi or Bader Fischer Miller-Stor. This paper by four authors was published in Annals of Mathematics recently. Mathematics recently. Well, so getting back to the subject, they proved that non-arithmetic orbifold has finitely many totally geodesic maximal subspaces. The natural question is, so we also proved finiteness. So the question is, are all the spaces which we are all of them FC? Well, the answer is. Well, the answer is no. Well, it can be disappointing the answer is no, but it's also no in an interesting way because we can look at them, we can try to look at the examples of these totally genetic subspaces which are not FC. And we did look for quite a while. Quite a while, and we don't have a clear theorem yet. But what we observe is that whenever we find such a non-FC subspace, it's directly related to the non-arithmeticity construction of this non-arithmetic manifold. So, our first example is that any non-arithmic Grom of Peterski-Shapiro manifold has a non-H equal dimension one-totally geodesic subspace, and this subspace. And these subspaces are exactly the gluing subspaces in Gromov-PTST Sharpiro construction. For quasi-arithmetic, we even don't know if these gluing surfaces are FC or non-FC, because the argument which we used to prove theorem 3 doesn't. Used to prove theorem three doesn't apply here, so there is an open question. Um, I will show in a bit in the next slides another example in dimension three when we can also pinpoint pinpoint directly the non-FC subspace, and we see that this subspace appears, is associated to dense feelings of the hyperbolic. To then feelings of the hyperbolic arithmetic of three manifolds. So, associated to the then feeling construction on non-arithmetic things. Somehow, really, for a long time, I'm thinking about this FC subspaces and they as you find them interesting. Okay, well, I will say a few words about the proof of theorem two. Theorem two, the main theorem, the dichotomy. So, but I will not give details, but first part is how to prove that there are infinitely many FC subspaces in arithmetic case. So the proof is as follows. For each type of the arithmetic lattices, we construct an for each arithmetic lattice of each type, we construct an involution. Each type we construct an involution and then we apply density theorem of commencerator of Barrel and we act on by commencerator on these involutions and obtain infinitely many subspaces so that's quite simple infinitely many conjugates so the infinitely many subgroups and each one gives an XG subspace well Well, so about construction of involutions. In type 1 case, it's very simple. Each type 1 lattice will have a reflection involution. And okay, that will do. In type 2 case, so there is no, there might be no reflections, but Reflections, but we can find the involutions of with higher co-dimension fixed point set. So the idea is, comes from dimension three. There is famous Jorgensen involution. I will tell a little bit more later about Jorgensen evolution. So if you take Jorgensen involution in dimension three, then you can replicate it to any odd dimension. To any odd dimension, giving you involution with codimension roughly n over half, n over two fixed points. Well, and then there is a question how to construct an evolution for triality type, and that is more technical, but we managed to do it during some Fodian construction. And then in each time, Baryosterium is the same. Is the same well? So, this gives you infinitely many FC subspaces. How to prove the second part that all of the large dimension subspaces are F C well first there is a proposition in Berjeon Coiselle, important paper. The proposition is not very difficult and it is somewhere in the end there. But they prove that so. So they prove this totally geodetic subspace of arithmetic many orbifas are arithmetic. And they in the proof they construct an algebraic group defined over Q in their case, which appears associated to this subspace. Then we do, assuming the conditional dimension, we do a construction, geometric construction of involutions. Construction of involutions with fixed points at this group, and then we apply a proposition from the paper of Hermling and Wank, who did a detailed study of involutions of algebraic groups. So again, we are talking, our definition of FC subspace was for general finite subgroups, but in fact, what we do, we only use involutions. And we don't know if you can get much more if you. You can get much more if you look at other finite groups. Sometimes we use products of evaluations, anyways. Um, um, so gives this gives you for any totally generic subspace of sufficiently large dimension, a corresponding involution in k points of g. In non-arithmetic part, as I mentioned, we use classical Margulis superigidity theorem. Super regularity theorem that gives you that commensurator is discrete. And then there is a result of Illusamet that allows to bound the number of finite subgroups of a lattice, arithmetic or non-arithmetic, in terms of covarium of lattice. So you combine the two and basically that works. Well, I don't have, I have very little time. I don't have, I have very little time, so I wanted to talk about examples, and I guess I just go very quickly. Misha, you started like 10 minutes late, so because of all those issues. So take some more time. Okay, I can go through examples then. Thank you, Paul. So I want to show a few examples that also indicate what is going on here. I start with the I start with the hyperbolic arithmetic 3 manifold, and okay, any say take two laxadromic elements in its group, which are independent, so the group generated by them is not cyclic. Then we can make up the following funny thing. We look at Lika mutator, right? Leak a mutator, right? AB minus BA. This, of course, a priori, this doesn't have to be in SL2C in gamma because, okay, there is an additive operation here, but a little computation shows that this Lika mutata, which Jorgensen did in his brilliant short article. So you compute the trace, you see the trace is zero, which implies that by a miracle this AB minus BR is actually in SL2C, and A and B are in SL2C. So it's an element of isometry group of the hyperbolic free space. And this and also traces zero means that it's an involution. So this is Jorgensen involution constructed algebraically, geometrically, it's nothing else as a following. As a following, you take two axes of these elements a and b in hyperbolic three-space, then you look at the common perpendicular of this axis and you look at the half-turn in this common perpendicular. So this is geometric description of Jorgensen evolution. It's a super nice object in hyperbolic geometry with many applications. One of them appears in the Appears in the work of Lacanby, Long and Reed, and later used by Lacanby in his proof of what he's proved. This version of fiber and conjecture for arithmetic Lanyard groups. Well, so the observation is they do is that actually if gamma is arithmetic, then the involution always belongs. The involution always belongs, it doesn't have to belong to gamma, but it always belongs to its commensurate. And in particular, it's defined over the same field. And moreover, whenever you have an laxadromic element in hyperbolic arithmetic group, arithmetic Klanian group, you can construct a journalist and evolution associated with it. Well, very nice. So you remember our definition. You remember our definition of FC subspace, and you immediately see that: okay, this is a finite subgroup of Kamenjerator of order two, and so and the corresponding Fc subspace is axis. And basically, basically, one of the things our Ethereum 2D does is generalizes this idea to higher dimensions. Well. Well, one more example in dimension three. This one is very well written in our paper. You can look it up for details. So here is an example of non-arithmetic hyperbolic over class of collection of non-arithmic hyperbolic. A collection of non-arithmetic hyperbolic three manifolds which don't have any FC subspaces. You take a hyperbolic, well, you basically take twist knots in S3. Then for this number of twists, half twists, J equals two, it will be figure eight node, but for all bigger number of twists, it will be non-arithmic node. non-arithmetic node complement and it's okay it's known that by the work of reed and walsh and le Palmer more recent that this NG have unique totally geodesic surface homeomorphic to trispungient sphere so there is only one totally geodesic surface Surface and dimension three. So, okay. There is only one candidate to consider for this FC subspace of dimension at least two. And we can check that these surfaces are non-FC. So, well, as I indicate, we check the details in the paper using some previous works, but also it's but also it's curious to observe that these surfaces they correspond to so the twist nodes are obtained by then fillings on the on the white headlines on this component right and then um in white headlines there is also a tricep sphere but this is an fc subspace of white headlines white headlines is arithmetic Quite is arithmetic complement. So you take FC subspace, you apply den feeling, you get non-arithmetic orbifa, and the FC subspace turns into non-FC subspace as well. And really, I'm finishing up with one more example. So it's a non-arithmetic Coxstra group in dimension five, a simplex, non-compact, and And I mean, it was known from work of Winberg, but it recently captured more attention because it has some exceptional properties. In fact, this is the only lattice we know with this set of properties in dimensions bigger than three. So it's non-arithmetic and non-quasi-arithmetic, and it's not commensurable with Gromov-Petersk-Shapier construction. And it's also not commensural with this inbreeding construction. construction. So it's really like non-arithmetic lattice of a different kind and the only example we know. But it was curious for us to see what happens with this FC non-FC subspaces in this case and we were able to prove. So some things you can do very concretely. In this case, we could describe the commencerator of gamma, which appears to be just Appears to be just so there is a simple symmetry here, the promotation of order two called T called sigma. And if you attach sigma to gamma, you get the whole, we prove that you get the whole commencerator. And also this sigma has an associated FC subspace, which is arithmetic. An arithmetic triangle and a group two, three, seven in dimension three. Okay, now I stop. Sorry, I if I run over time. Thank you. Thank you. Let's thank the speaker. Are there any any questions for the speaker?
