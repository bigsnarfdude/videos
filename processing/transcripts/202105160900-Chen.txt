  So we will start now, Eric. So our next speaker is Eric Chen from UC Santa Barbara. I think he will be at UC booklet next year. And the title is Yamabi Flow on Asymptotically Flat Manifolds. Okay, thanks, Alice. So, first, I would like to say thank you to the organizers for inviting me to speak. It's certainly nice to have such a large gathering and to be able to see a number of familiar names and faces. So, as Alice said, the title of my talk is the Yamabi Flow and Asymptotically Flat Manifolds. And as you can see from the top, And as you can see from the top header, basically I'm going to start by introducing some background about the Amavi flow in the compact and non-compact cases. Then talk more about what people have thought about for the specific non-compact case of asymptotically flat manifolds, and then state the results and hopefully have some time to give an idea of some of the proofs. So this is joint work with Yi Wang, who's also participating in this conference. And let me begin. Begin. So let me just start by recalling the Yamabi problem, which was resolved by the cumulative efforts of Yamabi, Trueminger, Alban, and Shane. And so from their work, what we know is that any compact manifold admits symmetric in the same conformal class with constant scalar curvature. And this has to do with minimizing the Yamabi constant, which is defined here. Either one can think. Defined here. Either one can think of it as minimizing a suitably scaled total scalar curvature functional, or as a sort of conformally invariant Sovolev quotient, which is the second line. And that will be useful for us later when we talk about the non-compact case. So motivated by the Yamabi problem and its resolution, Hamilton proposed a natural deformation to constant scalar curvature, which is the L2 gradient flow of Gradient flow of the scalar curvature functional within the conformal class, and this is known as the Yamabi flow. So the Yamabi flow on compact manifolds is typically rescaled to fix the volume, but for the purposes of this talk is just going to be the flow by the negative of the scalar curvature R times the metric G. And typically you start from some initial condition where G at the time Condition where g at the time zero is some initial metric g naught. Right, so as you can see from the equation, the conformal class is fixed under this flow. And so we can also think about this flow as an evolution equation of the conformal factor, typically with u at times zero being one, and then it evolves according to the PDE written on the bottom line here, which is a parabolic PDE. Is a parabolic PDE. Okay, so I guess a very natural question in many flows is then short-time existence, long-time existence, convergence. So in dimension two, things are very simple. The Yamabi flow and Ricci flow coincide and we have long-time existence and convergence in general. And unlike the Ricci flow, the Yamabi flow continues to have fairly nice smoothing properties in the compact case. Smoothing properties in the compact case and doesn't exhibit much of any singularity behavior. In particular, when Hamilton introduced the flow, he could already show that one has long-term existence in general. And by the works listed here of Ye, Schweitlich, Schreue, and Brendel, one now basically knows that the Yamabli flow should always converge in all compact settings, although for high dimensions, I think six or larger, one may still need some technical. Larger, one may still need some technical condition that is not absolutely clear whether it can be removed or not. But I think typically people have the impression that it should basically always converge in the compact case. Okay, so let me now talk about the non-compact setting. So, non-compact setting, we have some short-time existence results. Short-time existence results, say, under the hypotheses of initially bounded scalar curvature. With regard to long-time existence, we don't know if this is true. Well, we know this is not true in general, as we'll see in a moment. But people have been able to show long-time existence under certain conditions. And I've listed a few of the works that have dealt with this in the past. So, Lima's result, I think, requires positive scalar curvature and the metric to be conformal to. And the metric to be conformal to another metric of negative scalar curvature with bounded conformal factor. Schultz's result is similar, but instead of requiring positive scalar curvature, he requires positive Yamabi metric. Live-Wertman, I think, is also requiring positive Yamabi constant on some singular spaces. And Schultz's result from 2020 is on metrics conformal to the hyperbolic metrics. So, in certain cases, So, in certain cases, kind of summarized here, people do know that there is long-time existence. Okay, however, okay, the convergence results don't seem to be as common. So, the one that I know about from the past is in the same work I mentioned above by Lee Ma. So, under those same assumptions on the sine of scalar curvature and the conformal class. Curvature in the conformal class will smooth the local convergence. And looking through the program of this conference, it looks like Gil Caron is also going to tell us about a convergence result as well. So in terms of non-convergent, like I mentioned, we don't expect long-time resistance to hold in general because people have shown that there do exist both finite time and infinite time singularities. I think these, many of these examples are asymptotically cylindrical singularities. Singularities given by a conformal deformation of the Euclidean space. But here are some of the works that have been done by Troi Daskalopoulos King and Daskalopoulos King says them as well. Okay, so the point is that in the non-compact case, one doesn't always have, unlike the compact case, in the non-compact case, one doesn't always have either long-time existence or convergence. Resistance or convergence. And so the purpose of my work with Yi Wang, that I'll mention in a bit, was to study this in the particular non-compact setting of asymptotic flatness, where we have some additional control of the manifold at infinity. And as a result, we can say some more about what happens to the Yamabi flow in this setting. Okay, so let me just first state what... Just first, state what I mean by asymptotically flat. So, for us, asymptotically flat is something that looks like Euclidean space outside of a compact region. In particular, the metric should be decaying to the Euclidean metric far away from this compact region. So here I've just stated that the metric and the derivatives decay. Later on, I will state more explicitly which orders of derivative we need to decay, but this is just a rough definition. The rough definition, and here's a picture of something that might be an asymptotically flat two-manifold taken from Wikipedia. Okay, and so the order tau tells us the order of decay to the flat metric, as you can see defined here. That will also play a role in the hypotheses that we state later. Okay, so Okay, so let me also mention some background that people have considered for the Yamabi flow on asymptotically flat manifolds. And the main work is by Song and Zhu. And so as with a number of other flows, the Yamabi flow has a very nice property on the asymptotically flat manifolds, which is that this property is preserved under the flow. And moreover, we have a nice behavior of the ADM mass under the flow. So it is non- So it is non-increasing under the flow in certain situations, such as ones when you have non-negative integrable scalar curvature, and you situations in which one typically likes to think about the mass. And in fact, in lower dimensions, I think n equals 3, 4, 5, the A DM mass actually doesn't change under the flow. It's not clear if it doesn't change under the flow. In higher dimensions, it's just that it's not known. It's not known. So, right, as I mentioned a bit earlier, this is related or at least similar to the behavior for the Ricci flow and the maybe not as well studied conformal Ricci flow on asymptotically flat manifolds, where again you have preservation of asymptotic flatness and also nice behavior, non-increasing behavior of the ADM mass. And this also motivated looking at this because of Looking at this because of the nice behavior of the mass, as well as the that would stay within this class of non-compact manifolds. Okay, so let me now state our main results. So just the description in words, we have a general long-time existence result for the flow on asymptotically flat manifolds. The second, we have a distinction between what happens given long-time existence, which is based on the sign of the Based on the sign of the Yamabi constant of the manifold. So if the Yamabi constant is positive, we have convergence in a weighted sense. So stronger than uniform, it should be converging, I guess, in some sense faster at infinity. And non-convergence if the Yamabi constant is non-positive. And as a result of the weighted convergence we have in the Yamabi positive case, due to some Due to some works that people have studying continuity and semi-continuity of the ADM mass under certain convergence types, we can say a little bit about how the ADM mass at the limit compares to the ADM mass along the flow and in some cases at the initial time. Okay, so the first statement then here, theorem A, is the long-time existence result, which just says that if you have an asymptotic B-flat manifold, An asymptote B flat manifold, then it should that you should continue to have a Yamabi flow existing for all positive times of a certain decay order. So here what CK plus alpha minus tau means, the minus tau refers to the decay that we saw on the slide where I defined asymptotically flat. And the k plus alpha refers to the number of derivatives that one would ask the asks the metric to be decaying, to be looking like, to be decaying at the order tau to the Euclidean metric. So here, k greater than or equal to means we want at least two derivatives of the metric plus the second derivative's holder quotient to be decaying appropriately. And usually people consider c k plus alpha minus tau because one wants to work with some parabolic shauder theory. Parabolic shouder theory in dealing with these situations. Okay, so second, the next two results kind of go together, but I wanted to separate them a little bit. So the next one is about convergence, non-convergence. And so here we have a slightly stronger assumption on the asymptotically flat manifold. So previously in theorem A, we had k greater than or equal to 2. Now we To two, now we do need to impose an additional assumption on the third derivative of the metric decaying to Euclidean one here. But the distinction then is that if your Yamabi constant is positive and the Yamabi constant here, well, it's not so easy to consider the total scalar curvature given that we are on an infinite volume manifold. So we think of it in terms of this conformally invariant Sobolev quotient. This conformally invariant Sobolev quotient stated at the bottom of the slide. Now, then, if this constant is positive, then the Mabi flow, which we already know to exist for all times, will converge uniformly in the regularity that you asked of the manifold to begin with to the unique scalar flat metric in that conformal class. So, I guess when one expects to have a scalar flat metric, it converges, and otherwise, when one doesn't, in the Yamabi non-positive case, The Yamabi non-positive case, then you will not have convergence. It would be nice to know more about it, but at least here we can say that the supremum, the L infinity norm of the conformal factor would blow up, and you won't have a nice analytic property of L2 Sobolev constant. So that constant will also blow up as you go to time infinity. Hopefully, if we have time later, we'll see that the second comes from the Comes from the proof of the first one and some contradiction argument. Okay, so next then, I just want to focus a little bit more on the MABI positive case, and we can say a bit more about the convergence. So we actually have a bit better than CK plus alpha convergence. We have weighted convergence. So now in the UMAB positive case, with a little bit additional assumption on the decay order tau, then the order tau, then the Mabi flow will converge uniformly in this weighted Ck plus alpha minus tau prime space. So basically it's if tau is too large, there are some technical limitations that one does not get the convergence in minus tau for very large tau, but up to n minus two. And so in particular, this restriction tau greater than n minus two over two is also a natural one if one wants to consider the Adium mass. Wants to consider the ADM mass. Actually, we don't quite need such a strong assumption on tau. Tau greater than one works, but for dimension three, n minus two over two is one half, which is not quite strong enough, at least technically for us. But if we want to consider the ADM mass and we have integrable scalar curvature non-negative, then that is enough to fix things for us. And we can again work with. For us, and we can again work with tau greater than one half in the dimension three case. So, for all dimensions three and larger, we get the convergence in this weighted sense. Okay, and so as a result of the convergence in this weighted sense, just direct application of convergence semi-continuity results for the ADM mass, we have the following behavior of the mass under the flow. So, again, in a situation where we have the mass. Again, in a situation where we have the mass, non-negative integrable scalar curvature, from Chengzu's result, we know that the mass decreases along the flow. And what happens is it's going to decrease. And certainly it's bounded from below. It's going to reach some limit. And it then will drop in comparing the limit of the mass to the mass of the limiting metric. And the drop is given by this number on the right-hand side, which is the limit. Number on the right-hand side, which is the limit of the L1 norm of the scalar curvature. So since the scalar curvature is locally converging to zero, basically what this is then is sort of local mass, the scalar curve, the total local mass or the scalar curvature that gets pushed out to infinity along the flow. That's going to be the difference between the mass of the limiting metric and the mass that we see as we carry the flow to time positive infinity. time positive infinity. In particular, in dimensions 3, 4, and 5, the mass doesn't change under the flow, again, by Sun Tzu's work. So in that case, then this would be the difference between m at g naught and m at g infinity is this limit. Okay, great. So I think in the time remaining, I will try to give some idea of what goes into some of the proofs. What goes into some of the proofs. And so, probably, I'll talk more about long-time existence and the scalar curvature decay that allows us to get convergence and maybe not talk as much about weighted convergence, which is a bit more technical. So, let me start with the outline of the arguments. So, long time existence, one uses some maximum principle arguments, one gets conformal factor bounds, and as is As is usually the case in the Yamabi flow, once you have conformal factor bounds, both upper bounds and lower bounds away from zero on the conformal factor, then this is quite good and gives you at least long time existence. So then we want convergence, and for convergence, basically, what we would like to do is to establish a fast enough decay rate of R, in particular, a decay rate that's integrable as we go to time infinity. And then if we have such And then, if we have such a thing, we can use the equation given here, which relates the behavior of u to the behavior, so the time evolution of u in terms of u and the scalar curvature. And so if the scalar curvature decays at a sufficiently fast rate, we can basically integrate this equation to give us convergence of the conformal factor u. And so first we do this just a time decay of scalar curvature that gives us the uniform convergence of u. The uniform convergence of u, and then later we work to improve this to get a space-time decay of scalar curvature, and again integrating again, we get spacetime decay of the conformal factor and thus the space-time, sorry, sorry, the weighted, the weighted convergence of the conformal factor. Okay, so bounded the conformal factor, like I mentioned, once we have the bound parabolic theory. Bound parabolic theory gives us control of the scalar curvature. And then the short-time existence results basically tell us that if you have bounded scalar curvature, then your flow can be continued for a short time. So this would give us the long-time existence results. And the difference one has, which comes into more importance later on in terms of convergence, is that when Yumabi is positive, you can get time-independent bounds on the conformal factor in this case. A factor in this case. But really, for long time existence, all we need is the first bounds, time-dependent bounds are perfectly fine. We just go up to that time, we work with those bounds, we get bounded scalar curvature, and we can extend a little farther. Okay, so how these come about are basically by certain PD existence results for prescribed scalar curvature on asymptotically flat manifolds. Flat manifolds, and here's how it goes. So, basically, we can change the background metric from the initial metric to some other one in the conformal class. So, we change to G0 tilde as another background metric, and then now we work with Laplace G0 tilde and the scalar curvature of G0 tilde. If we do so, we get an equation that essentially looks the same as what we had before for the conformal factor U, but now with a different initial condition. And now we call this new conformal. Now we call this new conformal factor W. And it's possible then, if we can choose the scalar curvature of the background metric appropriately, to do maximum principal arguments and get good bounds, upper and lower bounds, depending on the situation for this conformal factor W, which just passing back by multiplying by V gives us conformal bounds on, gives us upper and lower bounds on the conformal factor U. Okay, and so in the asymptotic. Okay, and so in the asymptotically flat case, we have such a thing. So, in general, one can always, it's always possible to choose such a G0 tilde with negative scalar curvature. And it's only possible to choose a scalar flat, asymptotically flat, conformal representative, if the Yamabi constant is positive. So, another way of saying this would be the existence of a potential target limit. Of a potential target limiting metric, the scalar identically zero metric gives us good bounds on the conformal factor. Okay, so once one had this, as I mentioned on the previous slide, we have long-time existence, so then the main concern is convergence. So convergence, we need a decay estimate on the scalar curvature. Like I mentioned before, we then wanted to integrate an equation for the time evolution of For the time evolution of U. And so, our decay estimate that we have, where let's see. Okay, so I may be leaving out some assumptions in the n equals 3 case, but the general form of the decay estimate that we have then is that the scalar curvature should be decaying as time goes to infinity at an integrable rate. So minus 1 minus delta. This is really a long time estimate, short time. We don't worry too much about that. We have bounded scalar curvature. Too much about that. We have founded scalar curvature starting at time zero. Okay, so this has also come up in some previous works for the Ricci flow. And basically, what happens is that we are the control at spatial infinity eventually gives rise to this time decay. So, as you can see, the order of decay is related to our order of the asymptotic flatness, where delta is a little strictly. Delta is strictly less than tau over two. And right, so this has come up in works by Yui Lee studying the Ricci flow, and also the work mentioned in the last talk by Paul that I did on Ricci flow on, say, deformations of Rn or asymptotically flat manifolds. Okay, and maybe try to mention a little bit about how one gets such an estimate. So the scalar curvature itself satisfies The scalar curvature itself satisfies a nice parabolic PDE, integrating this PDE, assuming we have uniform Soblov inequality. So I forgot to mention, but if one has uniform bounds on the conformal factor U, then one certainly has a uniform Soblov inequality for all times along the flow. And then this integral inequality can be used to control certain LP norms of the scalar curvature. Norms of the scalar curvature. So, first we have control of the L and half norm, and that in turn, once we have control of the L and halves norm, tells us that we also have non-increasing of L P norms P close to n over 2. And we have this integrability again. We're taking advantage of the additional assumption of asymptotic flatness so that we have spatial decay that allows the integrability of these quantities. Okay, and so then. Okay, and so then that inequality above, basically by Moser's weak maximum principle, gives us that the L infinity norm of R is bounded for all time. Well, we already, that's not too useful. That only gives us long time existence, but that can be improved a bit to scalar curvature goes to zero. But then we have to work a little more for decay rate. And so basically, we use scalar curvature going to zero, put it back in, and now we can put it in. And now we can push the range of control for LP norms of scalar curvature down far enough. And basically, what we're expecting is that for this p, we expect to have decay rates like t to the minus n over 2p from parabolic Moser iteration. And so if p is small, this gives us a better rate, and we can get this down almost to n over 2 plus tau, which is the smallest where we have integrability. Smallest to where we have integrability of scalar curvature. Okay, so in any case, from these integral estimates, we obtain a good decay rate estimate on the scalar curvature. And then again, we work to integrate. Right, so we integrate, that gives us uniform convergence. And for the Yamabi non-negative case, we basically this just again comes from the proof. We didn't need to use too much about. About the manifold. Basically, one of the main tools is just the bound on the L2 Euclidean Sovolev constant. And so, if one assumes that that's bounded or it's uniformly bounded, then basically by the same method, we would again get decay to some scalar flat metric. And that would contradict our assumption on Yamabi non-positive. And so that's how we get the non-converging behavior in the Yamabi non-negative case. Non-negative case. Okay, so let me just finish with this slide here. So weighted convergence, we need a space-time decay of scalar curvature, which is given in this proposition here. It's a little bit more technical in terms of the proof. And here's where we also need some additional assumptions on the decay rate tau. And that's because it's, for example, unlike Vigi flow, once you have control of scale. Once you have control of scale R, one doesn't get for free control of, say, gradient R or D2 or R or higher derivatives like you do in Ricci-Forward's estimates. So you have to work a little more, but eventually we can get space-time decay and integrate again. We get the weighted convergence. Okay, so that's all I'd like to talk about today. So thanks again. And that's it. Any questions? Any comments?
