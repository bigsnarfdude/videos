Thanks for organizing. So I'm going to talk, really, there's no methods in here, this is an event talk that I'm giving. The work that I'm talking about all comes from the page study. The page study actually involves quite a few cohorts in biofangs. So there are some lessons here about harmonization and things like that. I'll talk a little bit about the page study in the next few slides. There's a major paper from a few years ago, which you can start flexible. So, PAGE was initially started as a consortium at NHCRI. It started in 2008. There were four studies involved and the coordinating center and the genotype 24 SNPs and you were associating them with various genotypes and stuff. We were doing big science. Then, for the second round, NHGRI continued. There was one other group replacing. Other group in place in one group. In the second round, we really decided to focus on the racial, ethnically diverse populations. One of the main things which came out of the second round is that Paige developed the mega array, which is still the backbone of a lot of the Illumina arrays that are being used right now. So after the second round, NHGRI was willing to continue, but Was willing to continue, but not at the same funding level, and then we expanded ourselves. We got a second source of funding from the NHLBI, but we also included quite a few more studies. So this is sort of like what pages are involved right now. There are core studies, and we'll do a lot of data sharing there. There are a bunch of affiliated cohorts. A bunch of affiliated cohorts, and all these affiliated cohorts there are either investigators who are part of PAGE or there are investigators who are really close friends of PAGE. Then we work together with a bunch of the biobanks. The US-based ones, they are all have investigators who are also in PAGE. And for the other ones, we have people with whom we work together. And then obviously, we use the And then obviously we use the UK diet of UK data in all of us, which is sort of like from everybody's design. All of us, all of us. So data sharing, collaboration. So in the second round of page, and this was initially a little bit forced on us with NHGRI, and we are actually sometimes you're not happy if these institutes forced us to be here. We actually were, they forced on us. We actually were, they were fortunate enough to actually set a data use agreement so that we could actually, all these six initial cohorts could share all their raw data, all their phenotype data with each other. We have a model which is actually very similar to, I see Pete frowning, it's actually, I'm not mainly frowning, raising his eyebrows, it's actually a very similar model that what he described about the breast cancer one, where there's sort of like one group which Which actually, in our case, there's one group which looks at the data, there's one group which looks at all the data use agreements, but still everybody deals with those ones. Rather than having N choose two, you have two N response. Work is organized in working groups. Different sites take the lead for different phenotypes. We've spent a lot of time on phenotype harmonization, primarily with the initial cohorts, also a lot of the other cohorts in biobanks. Well, a lot of us have probably our students once in a while ourselves analyze the UK dialogue with all of this data. There's a lot of learning involved in that one. And in the consortium, we've actually found that it's most useful that there are just a few key analysts who really know how to do it well. And so if there's an analysis which is run by the group in Colorado, they might have their all of us analysis be run by an analysis of the Fed Hatch. Analysis of the fragmentation, that's we find it more efficient than everybody learning how to deal with all of us. A lot of our work is done in collaboration with TopMed. So as a joke, I'm sometimes saying that concertia are like families, and there's some families which have skeletons in their closets, and there's some families which are really close. Pages I I I know both of these types of families and of consortia, but page is definitely one where everybody's close. Definitely one where everybody spots. So, I'll talk a little bit about polygenic risk scores, which you all know what they are. And we're all aware that polygenic risk scores work not equally well in every race, ethnic group, but there are actually also some other characteristics of participants that can influence how well the PRS works. And that's useful to. And that's useful to, I guess, to know. And the other thing is like if you, if one PRS is high, does it also give us indications of whether there's risk for other related phenotypes? So we are having in page a number of these characterization studies going on for type 2 diabetes, Lipid's mantichometric traits. I'm going to show you mostly the results from the diabetes. I'm going to show you mostly the results from the diabetes study, but I'll sprinkle in some of the liquid ones, and the anthropometric ones are relatively similar, but I'm not going to touch on those ones. Having as many studies and this is largely, this becomes a serious bookkeeping issue. So, for the polygenic risk scores, we felt like first we need to decide from which polygenic risk score are we going to use. Decide from which polygenic crisp are we going to use. And we, I'll show that in the slide later, but there were a number of GWASs on which they are building, and then a number of PRSs, and then we evaluate them on the page. Obviously, for doing things like this, it's really important that when you're characterizing them, when you are doing this, that the studies which you're evaluating them on are not the ones that were used in the. That were used in the original GWASs. This is one of the reasons, like on the previous slide, you saw the UK Biobank and Biobank Japan. They're not being used here because they were in some of these GWASs that I'm using here. So after the initial page studies, then we are doing stratified analysis on a lot of different cohorts, and then we run also FIWAS on a number of biobanks. You'll see that these cohorts. You'll see that these covers are actually fairly varied. There are a bunch of US-based ones, but Cebu is in the Philippines, Greenland is, I'm sure you know where Greenland is, Qatar, you know where Qatar is, but also the US-based ones, the CCHC is Canon County in Texas, which is all Hispanics, CCPN, sorry, CHNS is. Is are all Chinese people. So it's a fairly varied group. So we look at, for type 2 diabetes, we got between the cage studies, which had about 90,000 80,000 samples, we have 10 times as many in biobanks and additional cohorts. We had harmonized phenotypes, which led to about 250,000 diabetics in the system of 46. Diabetics consistent with 40,000 controls. There are one or two cohorts which specifically identify pre-diabetics, which is a much smaller number, mostly because that one is actually less well harmonized. I'm not going to show any of the pre-diabetic data. We have big numbers of African ancestry, Hispanic ancestry, obviously, not surprisingly, even bigger numbers of European ancestry. Not such a big number of Asians. Such a big number of Asians, and Middle Eastern North African is smaller. That's the Qatar ones, people were in Ol of S. Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, there coming mostly from MAC, and we have from Olives, Dutch Greenland cohorts. And the Native Americans, American Indians, are actually mostly WHI women who are all city dwellers, and I I had discussion about it with uh Neil earlier this this week and it's probably mostly all whites. Probably mostly all lines are carrying having some data from the ancestry. So, selection of the PRSs, we looked at four of them. One was one based on PRS-CX, which is about the ancestry method, which had already been developed. We downloaded these numbers in the GWAS catalog. Then we felt like, well, we kept there some more newer GWASs, so we developed one ourselves. GWAS, so we developed one ourselves using roughly the same technique that which is the one between this TRS2. And then we also decided: well, PRSCX, you can have them, you can develop them ancestry specific. And we but how if we design rather than have PRSCX weigh them together, we can weigh them together ourselves. Obviously that's now we need to do some cost formulation, cross-sequencing weights. And then we looked at a pruning and threshold one mostly to see how much we obviously standardize everything and evaluate the page data. So this is how things look like. So as you're probably not entirely surprised about is that the African ancestry does the worst. You once see that You want to see that everything is that the PRSs do better than just the base model, which includes BMI and age and sex as predictors and sort of study NPCs as more characterizing the different colours. So this was using the GUA6 plus the page data, the training. No, the testicle The PRSs were developed using the GWASs, and Page is not involved in those ones. And then these are evaluated on Page. The only tiny exception is the one which is meta is false. We did the linear combination using Page, but we were very careful how to do the cross-combination. So there's no linear. So mostly page is being used for testing. Yes. So what you see here is that What you see here is that the winning method is not always the same, but actually the G at all one seems to be overall the best one in the one for African and Hispanics where it's not, it's actually pretty close. So a lot of the characterization, we've actually done it for other ones, but I'm only going to show you the results for the GFR one. So this is on these ones. So now we go and look at other ones. Go and look at other ones. So now, here there are lots of other cohorts in here. So now you see quite a bit more heterogeneity because there's quite a bit more heterogeneity involved in these fonts. But you still see that in general, the Africans do worse. You see that among the Asians, Cebu does quite a bit worse, but Cebu is actually Filipinos. And these Jiwas did not. These GIWASs did not really have large Filipino groups there, so that's probably understandable. So, if you look at the ethnicities on my left, your right, we have far smaller numbers. So, there I wouldn't look too closely at those ones. Uh but it's it sort of seems uh that there yeah, well we were we this was sort of roughly in line with what we expected. Was sort of roughly in line with what we expected. I'll show you later things like this, also for lipids, and it looks a little bit different. So you see that the deciles of the PRSs are associated with the trait. And again, you see that the blue dots, when you go to the 80s and the 90s percentile, and the 70s percentile are the lowest ones. So the Africans are not doing as. Lowest ones, so the Africans are not doing as well. The Native Americans seem to be doing really well, but they're having enormous confidence in the falls, and there are only 600 participants here. NA is Native American. You know, it is really tricky how to get these things, these denominations consistent. So now I'm making this a little side. Now, I'm making this little sidestep from the diabetes to the lipids. And you see that the roughly these things are a little bit similar here in that yellow ones are lower. So I should tell you here that previous ones I showed you the page slides and the replication slide. Here I see the page and the replication are on the same slide. So this gets a little bit more confusing. Mostly you see that there are things inline that page and the replication studies are fairly similar. Studies are fairly similar. Actually, it's for the Europeans, there is a difference between the page studies and the replication studies. And we still haven't figured it out yet. The replication studies for the Europeans are dominated by the million strategies projects. So we're wondering whether there is something else there. We've been working with, we have a collaborator who is an MTP investigator, and if we haven't Investigator, and we haven't really figured out yet. If you look at something like the Native Americans, that they are looking different, you know, they're really small numbers. There are small numbers in the 600 in page, there are probably a few more in all of us, but there are small numbers of people. There's in Native Americans, there's a lot of recruiting involved. So, characterization and subgroups. Characterization in subgroups. First, as, and this will probably not people surprise people, is that PRSs work better in younger people than in older people. We tend to think of like particularly for chronic traits, that when environment starts to catch up on you when you're old, but when it's young, then it must be the genus. Since early on, somebody said to me you should look separately at the System, you should look separately at your model building and your heterogeneity. So, this is sort of like page in the replication students. And you see that there's a lot of consistency here. Page is a little bit more variable because the replication students are 10 times larger. You really see the same calories. Now, here it becomes actually solid. Becomes actually somewhat interesting. So you see, because it becomes interesting because of what I show you four or five slides later. So it seems like, so for type 2 diabetes list, it works better in males than in females. And actually, the heritability is higher in males than the females. So that's fine. But that turns out to be that's very much trade-dependent. Because I'm going to show you later that in lipids, it's a lot better out. So for not PRSs sometimes work better for one group, so for another group. Sometimes it works better for one group for another group. Again, it's similar between the family history. Obviously, we tend to think of that as family history is a mixture of genetics and environment, but it's still people who have family history probably tend to have a little bit stronger genetics for this particular trait. So it's probably not surprising that it's that. That again, PRSs work better for women, for people with family history, and people without it. Since Neil showed something actually about statin use and diabetes, I picked this one in there. I'm not really sure how to interpret this. But people who use statins, PRS performs for diabetes, performs better than people who don't use statins. Don't use standards. And even though these differences might not be that big for clinical relevance, for significance, it's very significant. And I'm not really sure how to interpret that. Yeah, but you've done good statins for diabetes. You've got statins for cholera. Okay, so this is now I I look at at lipids. And here you'll see from the you know there's a different postdoc who made them so the graphs are different. I think post-benefit limits. Very clearly, they're written very correctly. Uh so but for uh for the lipids, and this is actually looking at LDL, we believe it's the the same for all of the lipids. But it's the same for all of the lipids. That again, the heritability, the PRSs work better for the younger people and for the older people. But here, for lipids, actually, it's more heritable apparently in women than in men. So it's the other way around as in diabetes. So some of these heritability seems to be very trade-dependent. This is a very busy slide, and there are a few things. This is again looking at Lippets. Again, we're looking at lipid stratifications. But the things here, there are multiple things to think about. Page replication studies, it's roughly the same as for ID, so it's 10 times more in the replication than the page. We are seeing whether there is, and it's stratified here for each ethnicity. But first, if you look at the top line in each graph, you see that the You see that the cases in that effect of the case of the PRSs goes down is lower than for the controls. And that's the same for page in the reputation. So one of the things is to notice is that, first of all, it is related to pretty much any trait you can get to because there are a lot of stars everywhere. The second thing is to notice that there is a lot of consistency between patient representation. There's a lot of consistency between patient reapplication studies. And the first thing to notice is that there's, even though the PRSs might work different in different ethnicities, they're the same ones here. So this TDS, T2D PRS is related to a lot of the traits. It's probably not that a surprise. It's probably not a death of surprise, both biomarkers and critical trades. And you can do, in the biobanks, we did a complete VIWAS on the PRSs. And one of the things that you notice here, we have upward triangles with positive associations, and downward triangles with negative associations. You'll have a tough time finding any negative triangles. Negative triangles. When you're at risk for diabetes, you're at risk for a lot of, let's say, FEMA sculpts are usually bad things. You don't want to have them. So a lot of these things are things that you would relate, but there are some things probably that he would not expect. So we did a comprehensive analysis of VRSs for various outcomes. It differs by race ethnicity, but differs a lot by lots of other Other values. The differences in the genetic architecture really suggest that we need, and I'm preaching to the choir here, we all know that we need more varied GWASs, with people from different ethnicities, with people with different backgrounds. And the PRSs are not just related to the trade itself, but also the other ones. So acknowledgments.
