Thank you very much for the invitation and the opportunity. So, in this talk, I will use tools of geometry invariant theory by to find of classifying poliation on the complex projective plane with certain. With certain invariants, fixed invariance. So the GIT focus on the study algebraic varieties under the action algebraic groups. This involves identifying the good or bad points. Of bad points in the variety under the action of group. Usually, the people hope to get the good quotient, but in this occasion, I only use the tools of the GIT. So, the first thing we'll do is review some concepts. Concept basis concept and GIT, and then we'll proceed with for you. So, an algebra algebraic group G is a group with a structure of an algebraic variety and its product and inverse. Its product and inverse morphism are morphism or variatives. The classic examples are the general, sorry, the general linear group and the special linear group. And the action the action of an algebraic group on an algebraic variety P is amorphism such that the is associative with respect the element in the group and the And the identity element does not. The establisher of an element of B, the variety, is an subgroup of the element of the group such that how do you say not more. Not move the point. I will denote this element by G V. Other concept that use is the orbit of the point, which is a set of image of the actual. Of the action with the fixed point B in the variety. When B is a projective variety, we say that a group acts linear on B if the action is induced by the represent a representation of the group. Represent a representation, this so we consider the projective variety, the projective variety on CPN and a reductive group G acting linearly on B. The consequence. The consequence of this action is you can obtain another action, but in the CN CN rule one or in the affine con of P. a fine cone of p and this section is the same and we talk about of the orbit for every represent represent of the element and we did not again but by of b sorry at the orbit of At the orbit of V bar. Then we say that the point B is unstable if zero belongs to the close closure of the orbit of the element bar B bar of B bar. So. So the set of stable points we denote by P U. We said that B is semi-stable of zero doesn't in the closure orbit of Orbit of V bar and the set of semi-stable points will denote by BSF. And we said that the element B is stable if it's semi-stable and the orbit is close in the set of semi-stable points and the dimension of the orbit is equal to the Of the orbit is equal to the dimension of group, and we denote the set of stable points with Bs. Now the previous course is read on the computer. 3D on the complex projective plane can be written as vector vector where p, q and r are homogeneous polynomials of degree d modulum multiplic multiplication by non-scalar zero. non-scalar zero. Moreover, x and x plus a multiple of the radial spectrofield represent the same pollution for every polynomial of degree homogeneous polynomial of degree d minus one. We can there We can denote by F D the set of volunteers of degree D on CP2. This set is a projective space of dimension d square plus 4d plus 2. A point important of A point important of this volation is a singular point. A singular point for the volation X is one point in CP2 such that of the same component. I will denote by the set of singular points as this. So in this talk, I assume that the volations are insular singularities. So for a change on coordinates, Uh, a change on coordinates, you can think the singular point is one zero zero. And if you take this point, you can take an a fine open chart of CP2 in this. In this, around the point, for example, do you have the point? And I don't know. Take the U0, the open set of P2 in this chart, we take a local representation of the polliation X. X and we can write writing with this as previous talk the object and Arturo yes it's the same so with this local representation we have two environments We have two invariants. The first, the Miller number, which is the dimension of this quotient. And the second is the multiplicity of p which is the minimum of the m of m the norm the the num the number here and here in the in the in the representation by homogeneous pair of F and G so with this invariant comes from Gomesmond and Keung prove that if the foliation is non-degenerate, that means the foliation has an singularities and every singular point has minimal number one, then the volation is determined by its singular set. Later on, Campillo en libares generalis dir resolute when for any singular point but here the degree is greater or equal to two because in degree one is four so So, moreover, we can contain the singularities and Jonolu said that only you have d squared plus d plus one singularity, no more. Maybe one singularity has multiplicity, but But this is the the bone. So for me, the invariants to classify poliation are singular set, Milner number, and multiplicity using Hilbert Movement. Using Hilbert move for stability. But on other people use to the existences of invariant curve. But in my case, it's some process. So in this case, Gomez-Monica proved that a non-generated volume. And no generated volunteer is always stable. Later on, I can't prove that stable foliation of degree rather than equal to two has generated singularities and some cases. And some cases it has invariant. The question here is how degenerated those singularities are and what about the semi-stable variation? Because these points, the points in the introduction, the good points and the bad points. points and the bad points are these the unstable are the bad and semi-stable are good the points then for degree t or degree one sorry for degree one alcantara proof that a voluntation of degree one of degree one is of this form this form when um when i where i is a matrix and this volation is unstable if the matrix is not newpotent in this case for example when you We knew it's new the good washing and it's P1 for degree two Alcantara prove that if the colliation have insular singularities The pollution is unstable if only if one of the following properties there exists a point, a singular point with Miller number two, or there exists an invariant line such that this line has a singular Has a singular point, a unique singular point of deferration, and this point has multiplicity one and number Melorth Pielph pi the foliation X is Is again with insular singularities is semi-stable but not stable if all singularities has multiplicity one and there exists an linear an invariant line, sorry, such that again the points The points that exist a unique point in the line which have Milner number three or four. Or there exists an invariant line and this line has two singular points, has different singular points. Singular point. And this point has minimum numbers three, four, six or five actually and a foliation uh with singularities with ice insular singularities is stable. Insularity singularities is stable if only if again all singularities have multiplicity one and X does not have invariant line, but if the pollation has an invariant line satisfied that That this line have two singular points, different, but one singular point has million number two, and the other singular point has one point. Or the line has two different singular points. Two different singular points, and the two singular points have the same minimum number is equal to two. Or the line has three different singular points. This is the case with the With D is equal to for degree three, Icantara and Ronson provide an stratification on the space of degree three radiation, and they obtain 16 stratification. 16 strata. 9 strata have a singular curve, and 7 strata have singularities of multiplicity 2 and 3. And these singularities, its Mill North number is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. And 13. So when you have 13, when you have 13, that means by Johnolou that the foliation has an unit singular point in this case. So One particular case, an important case for the classification, is when you have a unique singular point. For this case, I will denote by AD the set. The set of foliation with unique singular point and I denote by ADM this colliation with unique singular point and multiplicity M okay then by the structure By the structure of the previous line, sorry, for this, for this sorry, sorry for strata, the pregnancy sign the degree three, this set does that mean the That means the foliation with unisingular point of multiplicity unstable is not MP. MP set. Claudia and Ronson, in the article said, this This the this set that means the variation of degree three and multiplicity two is no MP, but they send an example of nothing only say this is known, but the question here is. But the question here is the set I3M unstable, I3M stable, and I3M semi-stable is no empty for m equal to 1, 2, or 3. If there exists, can they be described explicitly? So, for this, I return the GIG Consider lambda one parameter subgroup. I don't I we denote by one ps. One ps. So there exists another morphism we are the not by lambda two is given by this. This morphism is an diagonal representation of the torus and there exists a And there exists an basis for each element, not zero, we can write this image for this object. Here our eye is an enter, enter. Enter, enter and is calling the weight of BI. We respect the action. For example, every one parameter subgroup of the special linear group can be written. Can be written as this where Q Q I don't know how to say Ka Ka K K one K two and K three satisfy this condition K one is rather but equal to K two and K k2 and k2 is greater than or equal to k3 and the sum is equal to zero. Every one parameter subgroup is of them four then if you take an element in a battery, but you can use the element. Elements in a variety algebraic variety P and one parameters of group and a representation of V that is B bar with the action or morphism lambda we can define We can define the Moonford function given by this. The Moonfort function of V and lambda is equal to the minimum of the weight in the representation this one point part here. One point in part here is the moon for function is invariant with a equation of the elements in G. So, with this function, we have a numerical criterion number mover of the following. Again, B is stable or semi-stable if only if the for function is negative or in the case in the case in the case um in the case when b is semi-stable is less or equal to zero for every one parameter subgroup and the point is unstable if only if there exists a one sub one parameter subgroup such that the moon for function The moon for function is velocity. Then, if you have the group a special vineyard and the varieties is the space of foliation, this group at over b by chain hot coordinates and by this action you have the milner number the multiplicity and the singularities are invariant so Moreover, you can consider the wave diagram of the representation of its Lie algebra of F t. Here I explain with this, but if you consider this action. This action by change of coordinate, you have, for example, for degree D, this diagram of the representation of F1. And for degree two, you have this white diagram of the representation. Diagram of the representation. And for example, for degree 3, you have this wave diagram of the representation of the space. So in this case, the Hilbert-Monfort criterion becomes a convex. Becomes a convexity criterion on the waste diagram. The equivalence on the stability criterion is the following. You have a point in project variety. Then we said that B is semi-stable if zero if zero belongs a convex. belong convex of of this of this way we said that b is stable if zero if zero is in the interior of the convex of the wave and b is unstable if zero doesn't have in the convex. Have in the convex. So, in my case, when you have degree equal to two, Servois, Deserti, Garba, Missiani prove that there exists four foliations of two chains of coordinate with U. Coordinate with a unique singular point, this volition. So we can see that by the weights diagram, if for example the valuation X one is unstable. Two, the position two is unstable, and the position three is stable, and four is stable. For example, here I have a diagram. This is the way diagram of degree two. We take the first pollation that is what happened J two partial X rule C two partial with respect yeah this point correspond Correspond in the diagram, but this point and this point represents this point as is you take the convex hole on this this point is a line Only this point. So the origin origin was this belongs only one part and this part or this part, but this doesn't in the line. So the So, by the criterion of Monfor Hilbert, is this foliation unstable? We can see for this example two. Two that all polliations of degrade three with unique singular point and multiplicity three are unstable. Practically is because you have often changed of coordinate of variation of degree three and Of degree 3 and multiplicity 3 is, for example, this convex hook of obviously in the background diagram of the gray train is the two. For degree three, multiplicity two and semi-stable, we have the following result. Semi-stable, no stable. You have this colliation, but the coefficients have this relation. In the case, here there is an example more an example for this case for degree three, multiplicity two and a stable, we can prove The voluation, this volation satisfy this condition in the coefficient and for multiplicity to unstable, we should. Which is the conjecture or comment of article Al Cantera Aronzon? We have this volition. This is unstable of multiplicity tool if the coefficients satisfy this condition. And by multiplicity one, it's easy to see that our foliage is stable foliage. For example, here, this example is important. Or was important because was a new example of volation of multiplicity two, degree three, one unique singular points, and we have invariant curve. Jean-Nolu proved that the set of The set of poliations with these properties, that I meant with an invariant curve, as tense, but is not easy to find. So this is an particular case of this family volation and is stable. So, more general, we a polliation of degree greater than or equal to two with a singular point with multiplicity d, then we can prove that x is an stern volation. Again, Again, the the idea is because you have in general you have uh the the way diagram is of the form. Maybe this in general, the wise diagram. And this result said if you have a singular point of multiplicity, that is the multiplicity, you can see this convex. See this convex here is zero, this convex, so we have unstable volation particular case is when you have these four here. Here, all homogeneous polynomials are of degree, but only two variables. This is unstable. Moreover, if the C D is not zero and the P and P and Q satisfy this condition, then Then the volume has a singular point with minor number d squared plus k. Another result, if you have again this for a pollation with insular singularities, we have the following condition. Wind condition, or you only have one singular point, or you have two singular points which one have minimum number one and the other point has minimum number d squared plus d. And the other example is a Is when you have multiplicity d, but in this case, you homogeneous polynomial is in three variables. So we have that x has a singular point and multiplicity and then the Then the minimum number between m f d plus m and d square plus d plus 1. So in this case, you have a releation with unisingular points. That is all. Thank you very much. Basically, we'll enter using each other for a moment. So, really. So, you mentioned this theorem by Gamas-MontenKemp that the singular points of foliation, I think, with isolated singularities, determine the foliation, right? So if I give you, I guess, is there a geometric interpretation in terms only of the singular points? For, for example, a curve being invariant under the foliation. Again, please. Yeah, for example, you mentioned foliations with invariant lines. And I understand that's a condition on the polynomials of the foliation. But if I only have the singular points of the foliation, how do I see geometrically if a line is invariant or not? I don't know very well. Uh I don't know very well, but yeah. You said if it was if you singular are of multi of minimal number one or I don't know very well. No, no, no. Or I understand your question. I don't understand your question. Maybe. Okay. Well, we have the point singular or what is singular in a folioción and a direct for example or a curb. Or a curb. I can see an interpretation of the curb, it is invariant, the podium. Well, I think it's the podium spensar mejor as the separator, no, the location, like a separate sector. But theory singular foliation. They are. They are decided if one curve is invariant, if you don't know what it is. Sorry, Ten here corresponding. Legend of multiplicity one point singular and that has invariants, the fan. And the dice that has invariants don't terminate invariants, or no. For example, there are a result of the example, there is a result, it is a pushuri y. For example, if your policy has a singularity of type or important, you have invariant. But what is that? But if it is  A curb can project the normal, the lineal normal of the curva. So, yes, you can calculate the class of Chernobyl. So, if you have a point that the class of Cherno class, I will, and then decir que estanges, or a manera description, if a policy. A policy is a curb is stringent of the campus of vectors to the curb and project the normal fibro. So, if you have more points singular of the tener, who decires your channel identifically, as the projection normal project, that is, so if you can, if they If you have points, because for a situation, if this is points, and the idea of that project normal, that all functions when the singularity is multiplicated. When you have a singularity of multiplicity, have the restriction of the curve. The restriction, the curve, what is the multiplicity for us? So, put more elite, so study multiplicity. In the graphic that posits there. No, no, no, the 30 and some questions. Eh? There are tienes uncero there in the decir. That's what I want to decir one that can express y queer decir because the arrival is in coordinates, no? Certificate depends on it, but the sero is the coordinated set, not the campus of vectors too in here, so these camps of vectors like zones. So it means that a little bit that Lisa Claude. Licia Claude, that was a little bit when a campo de vector is in stable. So there is a group that is the culpable of the inestability. So dad the vectors inestable mechanisms are great parameters. A group to relax the vectors. So utilizar is campo de vectors in the ladder by theory, invariant to integrate the campo de vectors. So these all geometric invariants meet these champions. Meanwhile, these campos de vectors por that are established. So, I think a commentaries interest one of these and integrate because you are here the expression of the campo de vectors, but integral, integral. Integral in those integrated polynomials, very difficult. Yes, but if you have a information tumor, theories of invariant can be various groups a parameter that is causing the instability, but there is a thing that there is a criteria of what is a unique. And there is a unique utilization to say of the affoliation, associated vectors. So, 1, verse 1, much all work of Claudia, the Ronnie, and these diagrams are very interesting, and more of a. Masallad of a first passage, but we say that the examples are what recommendation is that the integrated queen singular, a unique point singular. Hora estamien cuando una cosa es estable quiere decir que las orbitas de los otros están pasando cerca. So, also. So, also that if I perturb, it is a lot of campus that are passing for there, because in this way, because in establishments that are not a cocciente. So, Amilo que Rigo Gruque is very interesting that I can describe. Interesting that I can describe these campos de vectors, but integral, integral, integral campo de vectors, like the foliation, associated the campus of vectors because the method of this is to serve. So, if you like integrate, but we are very interested. The resume that is very interesting and very valuable the description and this and more questions or Well, also felicitades. Nanamas una sugrencia que te communiques con Gilberto Bruno. Gilberto Bruno what is mirando is a singular with their classification with their numero de saris qui fijo.
