Okay, well thank you very much. I'd like to start by thanking Lin Chuan, Luis and Carl for inviting me to speak in this conference. And even though I couldn't come in person, I'm really happy at least to see most of the talks in person. So I still have to go to my first or you know to go back to any in-person conference. I haven't had the privilege yet, but hopefully soon. Had that privilege yet, but hopefully soon I'll be able to. So, again, it's just nice to see people give more talks and being in person again. So, as Eloise anticipated a bunch of times, I'll be talking about joint work with Eloise and Jack. And it's in a sense, it's a continuation of what Eloisa talked about. So, I will recall some of the things that she said, even though I won't be giving too many details because she already, yeah. Uh, you know, she already explained most things, um, some of the things that I'll be using, but again, I won't assume that people were at her talk, so I will redefine some of the things. And as Eloisa said, this is more recent work that we finished about a year ago. So, the first part of the talk will be motivational. So, I want to tell you more or less what were the motivations that got us started. And essentially, I will explain. And essentially, I will explain the title. So, I will tell you what Chevrolet theorem I'm talking about and what I mean by uniform, and then I'll move to direct summons. Okay, so let me start with Chevrolet theorem precisely. So, let me start just for this theorem with the case of a complete local ring. And let's take a family of ideals, a descending family of ideals in R. R and let's assume that the intersection over all these ideals is zero. Then, famous theorem of Chevalier from 1943, so quite some time ago, essentially says the following: that there is a function which Function, which in principle and in practice depends on the filtration of these ideals such that, so if I fix a power of the maximal ideal, I can find an element of this filtration which I can stick inside this power of the maximal ideal. So this is for every hand order equal to the model. greater equal than one okay so this is what chevalier theorem says and this is where we started essentially and in a sense what i'll be talking about is an extension of this result uh to a special family of um of to a special filtration and in a special setup and i'll get to that so the family i want to focus on in fact is something evalua already talked about so symbolic powers and she already told you all Powers and she already told you a lot about them, but let me just define them for sake of completeness. So now I won't need R to be complete or local or anything. I'll just assume maybe for the rest of the talk, it will be just any, well, I'll specialize at some point, but for now it's just any commutative in Ethereum ring with identity. And symbolic powers can be defined for any kind of ideal, but you know, it will. For any kind of ideal, but you know, to avoid ambiguity, let me just stick with the case of radical ideals as Louisa did. And so I'll define the filtration given by the symbolic powers, which, as Louisa said before, are just, I mean, they are defined as follows. You take the intersection over all the minimal primes of the ordinary powers of the ideal. Video, you localize, and then you pull back to R. Okay, and in the case in which Q is actually a prime, then as Louisa said, Q to the n just happens to be the Q primary component of the ordinary part. Okay. So, with this special family of ideals, I want to actually start with a slightly different problem than Chevrolet. I mean, it's related, but it's slightly different. And in a sense, it's what Eloisia mentioned before. So it's related to the containment problem in a way. I mean, in a way. So let me tell you what I mean by this. So a question, a general question is Is in this generality, if you take an ideal, a radical ideal, the question is whether there is a function, which again, in principle depends on i, such that if I fix a power of my ideal, well, I can stick a power. Well, I can stick a power, a symbolic power, my radiance. Okay, and as Elisa mentioned before, I mean, the containment of ordinary powers inside symbolic powers is always true, so that's always okay. And for the other containment, well, the answer is it depends. It depends on the ring, it depends on the ideal. On the ring, it depends on the ideal. Okay, so this is in a sense a related question because it's still, I mean, I want to compare in a sense the topologies given by a filtration, the one of symbolic powers, and in this case, a filtration given by the ordinary powers. So I'll use some notation which will make my life easier later. So when there is this function f, so when I can find So, when I can find a function f as above, I'll write that the topology given by this filtration of ideals is finer than the amadic, so I'll write less than equal. And in this setup down here, when this function g exists, I'll write that the filtration given by the symbolic powers, well, is less than or equal to the one given by the ordinary powers, but since Given by the ordinary powers, but since this containment always holds, I may just say that they are equal, or I'll just write this instead of equal, just to not confuse. Okay, so when g, when this function exists for this ideal, I'll write like this. So the two two polars are actually equivalent. Okay. All right, so let me mention Ethereum which is due, well. Which is due, well, to a bunch of people. So I'm Lazarusfeld Smith 2001 and then Hawkser Unity around the same years, but I found 2002, probably the year it was published. And then much more recently. Recently, Ma and Schweed. I will explain. I will attribute once I write the statement. And this was published in 18. And then very recently, Murayama was able to get rid of an assumption. So what's the statement of this theorem? So let R be a regular ring. Of dimension cruel dimension D. Then the ND symbolic power is contained in the and ordinary power for every prime ideal Q of R and for every n greater or equal to. Okay, so Lazaruspeld and Smith, I Lazarfeld Smith proved this in the equal 360 case with the extra assumption that the ring is excellent. And then Hoxer and I mispeld Unity, I believe. Sorry. So Hoxer and Unity proved this in the equal characteristic case without any further assumption. And then May and Schweed recently, as I said, proved this in the Recently, as I said, proved this in the mixed characteristic setup, I believe, with the excellent assumption. And then I think Morayama was able to get rid of that assumption as well. Okay, so what does this theorem have to do with what I was saying before? Well, let me point out two things. So the first one is that in the notation I had before, so this function g, well, g in this case, In this case, it can be chosen to be a linear function, namely n times t. Okay, and that's surprising in principle, although there is a really nice theorem of Swanson, which I want to mention. Swanson from 2000. Allows them, which says that this is much more general. So, if R is any commutative Ethereum ring, and if the two topologies, if I have an ideal and the two topologies given by ordinary and symbolic powers are equivalent, then there is a constant, which in principle depends on I, in practice, in general, depends on I. General depends on time such that the CN symbolic power is containing the nth ordinary power for everything. Okay, so basically this is saying that in this case I can choose G depending on I to be linear with this constant C. In C. Okay, so this is saying essentially that once you know that the two topologies are equivalent, you don't need regular to say that there is actually a linear function for which this works. Okay, so this is the first thing I want to take from the theorem. And the second take I want is the fact that if I take g of n and I divide by n, so I basically take the slope, this dimension of the range. This dimension of the ring. Well, this is uniform. In the sense that it works for every prime. So it's independent of the idea. And this is the kind of uniformity that we will talk about. And in fact, in this direction, let me mention the following theorem. Which is due to Unique Katz and Balidashti. And this is from their paper from 2009. So the first they have on this stuff, which says the following. So we're back to local for the moment. So if R is a local ring, which is analytically analyzed. local ring which is analytically unramified so the completion is reduced then there is a constant independent of any ideal i will pick such that if i take an ideal such that Such that the topology given by the symbolic power is actually finer than the topology given by the amadic topology. So for ideals for which there is a chance of having a function f as at the beginning, one has The hope containment. So, basically, in these assumptions, for every ideal for which there is a chance, there is actually a constant, a uniform constant that works for all of them and linearly, as in Swanson's theorem. And this theorem is in a section that they call uniform Chevalier theorem. So, this is the first place where we saw uniform. place where we saw uniform where we saw this terminology it's a chevrolet type of theorem and it's uniform in the sense i just described okay so and this is the kind of result we we want to we want to start we want to talk about okay so this was very general so let me now start to get into the Get into the setup for the talk. So, I will make some assumptions and I will stick with them, these assumptions, and this notation for the rest of the talk. So, let me denote by A, for the moment, just any regular local ring. I will have to make further assumptions in a moment, but for now, this is all I need. And let me take a polynomial ring over A. Let me take a polynomial ring over A, and I want this to be graded. So I want to give degree positive positively graded. So I want to give degrees, positive degrees to the variables, and A sits in degree zero. Okay, now I pick elements F one to F T in S. To F in S, and I want them to be homogeneous with respect to this gradient. And I take R to be the A subalgebra of S generated by these F's. All right, and the final assumption I will make is that R is graded. Rated direct summit of S. Hence the title. Okay. So what do I mean by this, just to make sure we're all on the same page? By this, I mean that I can find a map beta, which is R linear from S and goes from S back to R. Traded, so homogeneous. It will be necessary of traded of degree zero, but such that when I apply to R, I get back R for every element, R over R. Okay, so it's a splitting of the inclusion, a graded splitting of the inclusion. And throughout, I'll use this symbol on the Throughout, I'll use this symbol on the inclusion, this sort of, well, that this sort of direct summit symbol on the inclusion to mean what I just said. Okay, so before I go further, let me give you some examples where this actually happens. So, the first example that comes to mind is the following. Actually, for this. The following, actually, for these examples, let me assume just for safety that it's sort of standard rated. Let me just assume that they all have to be one. All right, so the first example that comes to mind is a Veronese subrain of S. So I will take R to be the subrain generated by all the monomials of degree capital D where D is some Where d is some integer greater or equal than one. Okay, so this is one such example. Another example is the following. So let me take R to be A of X, where X is an R by S generic matrix, so a matrix of indeterminates. And I go modulo the two by two minors of X. So, well, how is this a sub-ring of a polynomial ring? Well, this can be realized as a silver product. So, this can be written as the algebra generated by the A algebra generated by the elements yi times zj, where i goes from 1 to r, j goes from 1 to s. And the yi's and z j's are just variable. And the yi's and zj's are just variables. So this is a graded drag summon of s, which is just a polynomial ring in the yi's and zj's. Now I should say that I won't give too many details, but I mean, if A is say a field of characteristic zero, then here you can put you can put actually You can put actually, you can be more general. You can put t by t minors where t is greater or equal than two. In this generality, we can do much more than this. Okay, so we have to stick actually with two by two minors to be safe. All right, and the third example I want to mention, and this will come back later, is the case of a finite group. Of invertible order, so D invertible in A, which acts linearly on S as above. So, in this case, we can take R to be the ring of invariance under the action of this group. And with the Reynolds operator, given the assumption of D, this is indeed direct summon of S, greater direct summit of S. Okay, so these are all examples where my setup assumptions or the assumptions of my setup are indeed satisfied. So, for everything I'm saying from now on, you can. For everything I'm saying from now on, you can think of one of these examples more in black. All right, so what can I say in these assumptions? Well, in the running assumptions, so in these assumptions. So if I give a name to, let's say, the homogeneous maximal idea of R, so the rectangle. Maximal ideal of R, so the direct summon. So if I set M to be the ideal generated by the F's in R and I add the maximal ideal of A. So remember that R was A of F1 through F. And it's a greater direct sum of S. So in these assumptions, if I set M to be the homogeneous maximal ideal, then what I have Maximum ideal, then what I have is that there is a constant such that I have a uniform Chevrolet type of theorem. For every Q, I'll put an H here to denote homogeneous primes. Okay, so one can show that this is the case. So, in these assumptions, we do have a chance to have, we do in fact have a uniform Chevrolet type of theorem in the sense that I was mentioning before. And now I can finally tell you what the goal of this, the broad goal of this project was. What is? Well, the goal is to find. Well, the goal is to find explicit slash good or in a compromise between the two, whatever this means, estimates on this constant C. Okay, and I haven't yet specialized. I haven't yet specialized A. So for now, A is just any regular local ring. So I'll have to do that if I want to get decent general estimates on this constant. And I'll do that in a second. But this is sort of the broad goal. And good and explicit, again, we want a balance between the two. And the first very concrete and very explicit answer to this is the case in which A is a field. The case in which A is a field. So let me mention this theorem, which was the starting point for the project. So this is a theorem of Eilong Dow, myself, Eloisa Agrifo, Craig Unicke, and Luis Munispetunkor. And this is a survey from 2000. Survey from 2018 on symbolic powers. And as I said, this deals with the case where A is a field. So let me just recall the notation just for safety. So we have graded direct segment of a polynomial ring over k. Over k again, these are all these all have positive degree, and the fi's were homogeneous. So, let me say that they have degree bounded by some capital D. Okay, so the statement in this case is that basically we can pick C to be equal to this degree over here. So then We have that Q to the N D is containing m to the n for every n greater or equal than one and for every q homogeneous prime of r where just to remind you m in this case is the maximum ideal of r so this happens in r Okay, so this was the starting point. And I do want to give you an idea or a sketch of the proof because that's where we could start to extend this to the mixed characteristic setup. But before that, let me ask if there are any questions at this point. So I pause for a sec. Seems not, thanks. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay, thank you. All right, so let me give you a sketch of the proof. Okay, so the first ingredient we need for the proof is the Zariski-Nagata theorem over a field in the generality that Eluisa described before. Let me just recall it. So the first ingredient again is First ingredient again is a risky nagata theorem. So as be my polynomial over k, k is a field, and let me take a prime such that Such that the extension from K to the residue field of our localizer Q is separate. You remember from Eliza's talk, there was a separability assumption at this point. Well, then the nth symbolic power is the nth differential. nth differential power or k differential power. So maybe I'll rewrite this down explicitly for people who maybe forgot from last talk. So these are the elements of S such that if I apply any differential operator to f, differential operators over S which are k linear and they go up to order n minus one, well this has to land in Well, this has to land inside Q. Okay, so this is gonna finish. All right, so this is the first ingredient of the proof. And I do want to make a remark, which Eloisa did in her talk for the mixed differential powers, but I do want to make it also in this case. So even if I'll use R suggestively for later, so instead of S. Of S is possibly not regular. So, even if we're not in the polynomial ring case, well, all of these definitions still make sense, and we still have an inclusion, which is that the nth symbolic power is containing the nth differentiable. And again, we'll use this in a second. We'll use this in a second. Okay, so with this ingredient, let me finally give you a sketch of the proof. So let me sort of remind the notation and define one further object. So m is the maximal ideal of r, and let me denote by eta the maximal ideal of s. Okay, so. Okay, so the homogeneous maximum ideal of S. All right, so the proof is based on the following three facts. I want to start with one. So the first one is, well, if I start with the symbolic power of ND inside R, well, by the remark I just mentioned, this is at very least contained. This is at very least contained in the differential power. So at least we have that. Okay, but now the differential power is contained certainly in R and also is contained in the n de differential power of eta in S. Okay, so here is where we use the fact that R is a direct summit of S. And we'll put this in red. Because you see, I mean, if you extend Q to S, then of course that will be contained, since Q is homogeneous prime, that will be contained in eta, and that's, you know, that's fine. But when we define differential powers, we're omitting. Define differential powers, we're omitting from the notation the fact that the differential powers heavily depend on the ring over which we're computing them, meaning that S, the differential powers, the differential operators in S and those in R could be very different from each other. So that's why we need this thread summon assumption to sort of relate the differential operators over R and over S. Okay, so this is the first step of the proof. Step of the proof. The second step in the proof is the Zariski-Madata theorem, basically. So the and the differential power, now because we live in S and S now is regular, is a polynomial ring over K, then by the Zariskinagata theorem, this is indeed the Is indeed the NDE symbolic power. And since theta is maximal, as Eloisa mentioned in her talk, then this just is the N-D ordinary power. Okay. And now the third ingredient is really just a degree counting argument, essentially, if you want a pigeonhole kind of pigeonhole principle kind of argument. Of pigeonhole principle kind of argument because what's left to show is that if you take this power of the maximal ideal in s and you intersect with r, then again by pigeonhole principle, essentially, you have to land inside m to the n by degree reasons. And if you combine all of them, well, you start with this and you end up with the containment in this, which is the statement of the theorem. So basically, this is the proof. Is the proof in the case of a reference? Okay, so the title was about mixed characteristics, I mean, uniform Chevrolet type of theorem for mixed characteristic threat summons. And that's what the main theorem is about. So let me tell you what the main theorem is. So let A be DVR and ramify DVR with a uniformizer P which has a P derivation. I'll briefly remind what this is, but I won't need details. Need details. For example, if it's complete, as it was I mentioned before. And again, so R now be the A algebra generated by a bunch of homogeneous forms that live inside S. These are positively created, and these have degree bounded above by. Now, of course, the maximal ideal in this case would be the one generated by Fs together with P. And then finally, the statement is analogous to the one before. So the Q to D and D. So the q to the n deed symbolic power of q the n deed symbolic power of q is containing m to the n for every n greater or equal than one and for every q homogeneous prime of r. And I forgot to put this in the statement, but of course I'm always assuming that this is a greater direct summit as before. Okay, so this is the main theorem and Okay, so this is the main theorem. And for essentially the rest of the talk, maybe except for the last five or 10 minutes, I'll give you an idea of how this is proved. And yeah, so I'll tell you, I mean, yeah, I'll tell you what the ingredients are, and I'll tell you what the difficulties are. The difficulties are in just generalizing it from the case of a field. Okay, so let me start with the sketch of the proof. And again, let me try to mimic what we did over a feed. So the first ingredient was the Zariskinagata theorem. And for that, well, okay, no, sorry. First of all, let me just. Okay, no, sorry. First of all, let me just say that if the prime doesn't contain p, if q doesn't contain p, then things are easy, just as Louisa said in the previous talk. So the statement is easy if Q doesn't contain P. So let's assume That Q actually contains P. All right, so let's start. I mean, we need to start, we need the Zeliskin Agatotheos. And so for that, I need to at least briefly recall what the p-derivation is. So as Louisa said in her talk, so we have over S. We have the notion of liftoff for beams, which is basically just a read map which mod p coincides with the Frobenius on S mod P. And from this, we can construct. From this, we can construct an object delta function which is a p derivation. Now, this is possible because, again, we have a p derivation on a by assumption, and we can sort of extend it trivially to the variables, pretty much. And I'll give an example later, but again, for now, I'll just wanted to at least set up the notation. And for the details, I refer to Eloise's talk. Louis's talk essentially. All right, so what's the theorem that Louisa talked about before? So it's the theorem of myself, Louisa, which appeared in 2020. And again, S A is above, and S is a polynomial ring over A, and Q is a prime ring. That contains P, then the n symbolic power of Q is what we what she what we denote by Q n nix, so the next differential power, which is the set of elements in S such that if I apply differential operators and I And I also apply the p-derivation eight times. I land inside q if the combined order of the differential operator and the p-derivation is at most what it should be. So, n minus one. So, again, the way to think about this is of this as a sort of a generalized kind of differential operator, which works in this setting. This setup. Okay, so Eloisa made this remark, but I want to make it again because there is a point here. So if R is possibly singular, we still have. That the nth different symbolic power is contained in the nth mixed differential power. But the point is, well, provided R is a p-derivation, because in principle, we have no idea if R is one, if it's singular. There are rings which don't have p-derivation. So if, and this is a big if, r has a p-derivation. So, at least I told you how to construct a list of Frobenius and then a P-derivation on S as above, but otherwise we don't know if this is the case. Okay, so this is a big if. All right, and with this big if, let me try to start the proof and then we'll get stuck at some point and we'll fix this. But with this in mind, let's try to mimic the proof of the case of reference. To mimic the proof of the case over a field. And you remember there are three steps, and I'll again mimic the three steps but in reverse order. So let me start from, well, let me start by reminding the notation. So n is the maximal ideal of r. So it has the f's and p. And then eta, as before, will be the maximal ideal of s. But now, of course, again, I also have to add p. Okay. Okay, the steps were as follows. So the first or the last one was, again, a pigeonhole principle/slash degree type of argument, and that works just fine. You have to be a bit careful, but it's not a big deal. I mean, one can make it work. So the third one is okay. Now we go down to the second. And the second, if you remember, was essentially the Zaviski Nagar. Remember, was essentially the Zaviski-Nagada statement. And for that, we, well, we just gave a solution to that problem. So as long as I'm willing to put Nix differential powers here, then the theorem of myself, Eloise, and Jack says that these are the symbolic powers. And these, again, because n is maximal, are the ordinary powers. The ordinary parts. So this is also K. So the issue really isn't one. Because, well, if you remember, we were starting with the N deed symbolic power was contained in the N deed differential power. For now, I'll just leave it as it is and then fill it up with the sub the appropriate subscript. And then we were saying that this is contained. And then we were saying that this is containing R and in eta to the ND differential power. Now, of course, to make things work, we have to work with two, we have to put mixed differential powers to eta. And the problem is, as I was saying just before, we now don't know if there are, if there is any, even if there is any p-derivation or r. So I can't even write mixed differential powers here if I don't even know. differential powers here if I don't even know if because I don't know if the p derivation on r even exists so what's true is that I can put mix here if the p derivation on s restricts are so if that's the case and that's a strong assumption then I can actually make things work I can actually make things work. Things work. Otherwise, in principle, I don't know. And the fact that R is a direct summon of S doesn't quite help. Because I mean, the natural thing to do would be post-composing with the splitting, but that doesn't give you a p-derivation in general. So this was the main issue for this project. So we had to tackle this. And essentially, the main content of this project was what's coming. And what's coming is a new type of What's coming is a new type of differential powers, which looks very massive. You know, the definition is quite messy, but it just does the job. And let me just do that. Let me define what this new object is, and then I'll make some comments later. So in our assumptions, let me give a name to the splitting. We have a splitting, right? So let me give a name to the splitting from S back to R. So this is my create splitting. So, this is my create splitting. And actually, what I need for this definition is not that R is the direct sum of S, I just need that this happens mod P. So I'll put bars over this, where by bars, I mean things mod P. Okay, so this is in principle a bit, you know, a bit weaker condition. Okay, so the object I'm going to define is for Q, a prime that contains P again. I'm sort of out of symbols for powers. I'll use braces. Assuming I can draw braces, okay. So Q to the N will be the elements of R such that, so let me try to justify this a little bit. R is a subring of Um, R is a subring of S, so if I view the element F in S, I can use the sort of combined differential operators and P derivation. So this will look for the moment very similar to what we had in the regular setting. So I use this combined differential operators in S now. Okay. So, this is what I would. I mean, I would ask that this element belongs to Q if I was in S in the regular set. What I do instead is, for technical reasons, I take the ideal in S generated by this element, and in fact, I do this mod P. And then I use the splitting, and I go back to R. Use the splitting and I go back to R bar and I want this to be contained in key bar. Okay, so as I said, this is quite messy, but the idea is I do things in S, like as if I was in S in the render setting, and then modulo some again, technical details, I kind of apply the splitting and go back to R. And I Bar and I can work mod p essentially this for the bars. Okay, so this strange-looking object happens to be an ideal, and in fact, it's a Q primary ideal containing the ordinary container. And hence, it will contain the symbolic. Okay. With this new power, we're actually able to pull things off because we now use one prime condition, which is that the end symbolic power, by what I just said. Power, by what I just said, is contained in the indeed braces power. And then basically by definition, and using the splitting and everything, we get that this is indeed containing R and in the appropriate mixed differential power of eta. And this just does the job. This concludes the proof. Okay. All right. Before I give you one very explicit examples and maybe example and maybe some sort of natural questions that arise from this, let me give you one corollary, which I find very nice. So let's go back to the case where G is a finite group of order D. And A again is DVR with the uniformized with P and with the P derivation. So in the same assumptions as the main theorem, I do want to use the main theorem. So I will have to assume that P doesn't involve. Assume that P doesn't divide D. So this is my assumption that D is invertible in A. And I will assume that this acts linearly on S, which is my A of X1 plus M. And I want all of these to have the one. And of course, R will be. And of course, R will be the ring of invariance under the action of this group, which, as I said before, is a greater direct sum out of S. And finally, the maximal ideal here, M of R will be just, well, R plus right, so the homogeneous maximum ideal of R. Then Then what we have is that the n deed symbolic power is contained in m to the n for every n greater or equal to one and for every q homogeneous prime where again this d oops this d now is the order of the group and this is basically this is an immediate consequence of our theorem and uh you know not And extend generalized versions of the Nörder bound, which pretty much says that the ring of invariance in these assumptions is generated by elements of degree at most D, where B is the order of the loop. All right. Okay, so in the last maybe 10 minutes, let me sort of address one. Let me sort of address one question or concern that one might have at this point. I mean, we introduced a new type of differential powers, and again, they just work for purposes, but then of course, introducing a new object, the question is, you know, how do they relate with other differential powers that we already defined, at least when the other differential powers are defined? Are defined. So let me be more specific in what I mean. So assume for this final part that the p-derivation on S does indeed restrict to R. Okay, so in this case, we have a p-derivation on R, and so we can consider mixed differential powers also in R. So the question is: how do this curly differential power, you know, embraces differential powers and mixed differential powers relate. Okay, and without any further assumptions, I mean, they can behave badly. I mean, there's no real relation between the two. So, the extra assumption that we need, which is fairly reasonable for the examples we have, is the assumption that the extension is differentially extensive, that the map from R to S is differentially extensible. So, let me tell you what that means. So, we have our inclusion of R into S, and then A is a subgroup. And then A is a subgroup of R. We say that this is differentially extensible if differential operators in R extend to S. So if I take any differential operator of order n in R, there is a differential operator of order n in R. Of order n in S that restricts to R and this happens, for example, if R is a Vironese submarine of Of S as before, as in the examples, and M at least two. So, if M is one, in fact, this is not if the extension is not differentially extensible, and in fact, I mean, there is a bad relation between the two types of differential powers. But if we assume that the extension is differentially extensible, Then we can prove the following result: that well, the n-symbolic power of an ideal, again, always containing p, I mean, this is always the case from when I said it up to here, is contained in the braces differential power, which is contained in the mixed n differential. Differential. Okay, so this is the relation we were able to find under these extra assumptions because, again, otherwise there isn't really any good relation. And let me point out that, so we know an example, which I'll show you in a second, where these two coincide and they do not coincide with the symbolic power. So we still don't know whether these two are equal or not. These two are equal or not. But in any case, what this is showing is that our this, you know, this new kind of differential power is a better approximation of the symbolic power than the mixed differential power is anyways. So it's weirdly defined. I mean, it's a bit odd to work with in principle, but it turns out to be a better approximation to symbolic powers than mixed infraction powers. So let me conclude with. So, let me conclude with the example I kept talking about. So, let's say that S is A of X Y, where let's say that A is just the P addicts. And R is A of X squared XY, I squared. So it's a Vernese subring where D is equal to 2 in the previous notation I had. So this is a Hat. So see, this is a greater direct summon of S. And so there is a p-derivation on S, which corresponds to the sort of trivial lift of Frobenius. What do I mean by this? It's the lift of Rubenius that takes a polynomial in x and y and sends it to the polynomial evaluated in the p-power. So this is a lift of Rubenius, and again, sort of a trivial one in a certain sense. And the p-derivation, what it does, it sends the monomials that generate my algebra, sub-algebra to zero. And one can show that this is sufficient for delta to receive. that this is sufficient for delta to restrict to the to r so delta restricts to r okay and in these assumptions and with this i will finish i'll take m to be the maximal indeed of r then one can check that well the second symbolic power of course is just the second ordinary power and these are strictly contained in Are strictly contained in m curly two, which is equal to m2 mix, which just happens to be the one generated by p squared, x squared, xy, and y squared. So this is basically m squared plus. So it's basically m except for p squared. And so as I And so, as I was saying, you know, we don't have an example where maybe I was saying I forget, but we don't actually have an example where these two differ. And so it might very well be that they are always the case. And I should say that as a consequence of the theorem of myself, Elise, and Jack, these two are all equal. These two are all equal if Q is a regular prime. Because, of course, one can just check this locally at Q, and if you localize that at Q, then they all coincide just the ordinary power because of the Zaliski-Hagata theorem that Elisa talked about. And so if one wants an example where these don't coincide, one needs to find the prime which is in the regular locus and work from there. And I think. And I think this is, well, my time is almost over. And in any case, it's a very good place to stop. So I'll just stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Alessandra. Questions? Yeah, it might be a meaningless question, but what if your ring has infinitely many variables? Has infinitely many variables? I mean, I guess my starting assumption was that R was an Ethereum. I don't know. I mean, other than sort of maybe obvious statements that you can deduce for, you know, primes that involve finding many of them, other than kind of obvious statements of this kind, I haven't really thought about that. That's really the answer to your question, I think. Your question, I think, but um, I think that some things could be done, but um, I can't really say I thought about that. Uh, so I don't, I can't really say right now if there's any obstruction at any point. Um, I can think of any, but again, my ring was Netherium to start with, and that's, yeah, I won't commit to saying anything more than this. Other questions? So, do I understand you correctly that you don't know any cases where the races power is unequal to the mixed differential power with the angle brackets? That is correct. Yeah. Interesting. So they could just always be equal. They could just always be equal. Yeah. We were not able to. I mean, obviously, computations with these objects. I mean, for one thing, as I said, for. I mean, for one thing, as I said, for nice primes, they're all equal. So you can't really pick nice primes. Plus, rings where you know that the direct summon has a p-derivation are not many. In fact, we're currently working on trying to understand what kind of sub-reams have a p-derivation. And I mean, it's a hard problem in general, I would say, but even assuming direct sounds, as I said, this doesn't seem to help very much. Help very much. So, in fact, I mean, for this, for R to have a P derivation, or rather, for the P derivation of mass to restrict to R, I didn't use the fact that R is Gregson. I just used the fact that it's generated by monomials. So, it's at the moment, it's, I mean, we don't know when the p-derivation restricts. So, again, cases where we can do computations are not many. And in those cases, those two are actually coinciding. Actually, it coincided. So it might well be, very well be, but we don't. Okay. Yeah. Is the braces power independent of the choice of splitting? Oh, that's a very good question. I mean, again, other than sort of a cheap answer, like, you know, for cases where they all coincide and with the symbolic power. Symbolic power. I mean, even in the case of mixed differential powers, I mean, I wouldn't, I mean, in a non-regular setting, I actually don't know if the mixed differential power is independent of the p-derivation. Maybe Elise and Jack know, but I mean, the only way I can say this is because they are all equal to the symbolic power. So the answer is I don't know. I suspect. I mean, I suspect it might, except for the cases where there are. The cases where they're equal, yeah. I don't know. That's that's again a very good question. Thanks, Alessandro. Other questions on Zoom? I have a question if I may. So you mentioned this example of the two times two minors, and you mentioned that if I try to take bigger minors, there arises difficulties. Can you explain a little bit about that? Yeah, so let me go back. Okay, so. Let me go back. Okay, so for example, if A's, let's say maybe the integers or the p-adics, I think. I mean, there is a recent result of Jeffries and Singh, Albert Singh, saying that in some cases, like even the terminants, I mean, these are actually not direct summons of any polynomial ring, any, you know, polynomial ring of. Any, you know, polynomial ring over A. So, not just this embedding doesn't work, I mean, there's actually no embedding that will work for those cases. So, this is kind of the, I mean, if it doesn't even work for determinants, there isn't much more that you can hope for. And in the case of a field of characteristic P, I mean, I've seen a seminar talk, a nice seminar talk of Vaidbhav Pange, a former student almost at this point of Anuradh Singh. Talking about, I mean, so he has a result with Meloxer, Jack Jeffries, and Andrex Singh saying that this embedding is not pure in that case. So again, it wouldn't be a direct summit either. I haven't been able to find a reference for that. So I don't know if it's still work in progress, if it's published or anything. So actually, people in the audience there might be able to. In the audience, there might be a more details, but yeah, so I just happened to see this talk and to see this nice result. So, in that case, this embedding would not be pure. This embedding would not be pure, so this won't work, but that in principle doesn't say that there is another embedding that would make it work. So, yeah. Sorry, I was just saying it is work in progress, but yeah, sorry, there's no preprint on the archive as yet, but. Okay, and actually, again, correct me if I'm mistaken, but you show more, meaning that you show that, I mean, there's no t other than you know, basically t equals to or, you know, the sort of the generic case that, you know, for which this embedding will be pure. So this is basically the only example where this is pure. Again, in the case of a field of keratic. That's great. Thanks. Other questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Zandra again.
