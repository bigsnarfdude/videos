We're very pleased to welcome Keto Kilto from Heidelberg to be part of our local Galaxy Breaks. Keto, thank you for the invitation and to the organizers and for giving me a chance to talk about the results. So this is joined with Ashley and Jenkar and Ito Haskunas, which are, I guess, both here. And then I guess also Perdov, this is joined with a former PhD student of mine. And Christine Jushka. So let me. Take a little bit of notation, so P is F prime, F over Q P is a finite extension. So I guess this is A is the field F, then G F is the absolute Garois group of F. Um and then we also have the coefficients. Coefficients. So, this is another chiadic field that for some reason should ever contain F or at least part of F, and as we just assume from the start, so this is again a K-Addic field. Then O is its ring of integers. High is a uniformizer, and F is the result. And f is the residue field. And then I also want to tick the representation from GF to GLD over this finite field, which is continuous homomorphism. And so I don't want to give any So, I don't want to give any motivation because I will very soon tell you the results, and then maybe that's the motivation at some point. So, and then I guess I will spend maybe, I don't know, 25 minutes telling your results and explaining a few things, and then maybe in the second half I can say a bit about who. So First part is about deformation theory. And then just to stick some notation, this gothic A will be the category, oh yeah, KO, and I won't use it very often, category of Artenian local. Um of algebra A and A such that the residue field is our fixed field small F. This is a finite field of characteristic T. And then if I want to put a head on this, sometimes then not Artinian, but complete the same. Ethereum algebra. And then in this context, there's a lifting functor, Eth rho bar framed from AO to sets, which, I guess, you can quickly write it. So you met A with a set of all lifts. But then row A is congruent, row R. What F and then I guess it's an elementary fact and just context to show that there is just a universal ring R squared rho bar so it's complete in the theory. So it's complete in Ethereum local. It's an O algebra and S recipient feel F. And what you have A, right? You are not. Thank you, Module MA. Yes. Over there. There is just a unique universal ring for listings and corresponding. Corresponding continuous representation, let's say robots from GLD of this ring. And I guess this means this represents this functor, et square. And now let me. Now, let me stage first result. So, theorem one by Marcel's Jenga. Jenger and Vashkulnev. So we have some ring-theoretic properties that we established of this ring, of this universal ring. So this is a local complete winding section ring itself. It's flat over O and of relative dimension d squared times one plus the degree of F over Q key relative dimension over OK. And before this result, I guess there were many. Result, I guess there were many special cases known for row bars having certain properties, and this is a result that holds for any row bar. And one corollary you get from this is so for any row bar as above, there exists a lifting. from Gs to GLD Zt bar and I guess you could well you can't be so much more precise could be a finite extension of Zt but you can't really say what the ring is so a lifting such that rho mod the maximal ideal of m t bar is T bar is to rho bar. And not because this is a difficult proof, but mainly to fix some notation. So let me just remind you. So to any X in a state of R row bar framed, I denote my X row bar friend. There exists a continuous lift, namely you specialize at the point X. And then there is an undefined ring, but so at least there's a residue field. Residue field residue field and uh so this is the ring well we get the map from our robot framed to the residue field and there is a closure then that gives you a sublime of the residue field And that's the AX and now we basically want the chatic residue field and so now by tools we know that Generic fiber is non-empty, and so now we take X in here. That's a closed point, and then the residue field is a pair field, and that gives you the wanted lifting. Lifting and maybe that's wrong. So this result was known at the time we proved this, namely, there was a previous proof by Emerson Qi by the state that they constructed. And now let me explain a few more results in this context and give some applications. So let me first make a convention, namely I want to use a bar symbol or rings to always denote the quotient by the uniformizer. Uniformizer and the bar on these affine schemes just a special fiber over f of this x bar. And before I come to some applications, I want to mention one thing we prove in this context that is also interesting. Also interesting, I find in let me make a somewhat particular definition. So we call X in the now the special fiber of the universal wing commer irreducible if and only if for all degree P extensions. F prime of f adjoint zeta p are Galois extensions rho x restricted to G F prime is absolutely irreducible. So, in particular, So, in particular, everybody who is commer irreducible is also absolutely irreducible without restriction. And we show also that the set of points on the special fiber of this deformation ring, where the points are points are Uber irreducible. So inside the space X rubar frames, special fiber is dense open. So firstly there is a huge abundance of absolutely irreducible points, but this locus also has a And this locus also has a very nice property that I don't think I will mention this in any explicit way, but maybe it's at least interesting to some of you. So if you take the determinant map, not in the sense of Scheneve, but your presentation take its determinant. So you get to x bar dead rho bar. This is a very simple ring. These are therefore Simple ring, these are deformations of one-dimensional representations. So we have this that thing. And so now we can look at this arrow, and then I guess one can somehow say that this is formally smooth, because this absolute irreducibility of these restrictions. For these restrictions, imply that a certain H2 vanishes, that gives you exactly that you have smoothness of all the points over the image point, which then tells you that somehow, if you want to understand this, there's a big chunk that looks very nice over this ring. And that this ring is very well understood because this has been computed by Mesor. It's a first example of classical theory. Okay, so now the next theme I want to talk about are irreducible components. And then we need this picture again down there. And then we need this picture again down there at some point. So let's say mu are the p power roots of unity contained in F. So this is an n theta t to the n is one. So this is a finite t group. And now yes, and now the next thing I want to explain is. thing I want to explain is so we have this initial universal ring and we want to break it up into certain components that actually have something to do with this map to the determinant ring. And so we take the determinant of the universal representation that goes to our framed row bar. Our framed row bar units. So that's abelian. So this factors via GF abelian. And now here you have RTNF of class field theory. And in there, well, you have mu power roots of unity. And so now So now you get from this a map from O mu to the frame deformation ring of rhobar coming from this concatenation and you get a subfontus the rhobar frame Frame Kai, namely you look at Gauss liftings such that if you look at that row A, so that row A will go into A star, factors by a GFF, and then we can And then we can compose it with the artin map here, and then we can restrict it to mu. This is a psi. Oh yeah, now we fix, that's the virtual plan, we fix them at psi from mu to O star and And we can do this because a long time ago I mentioned that L is an overfield of F and so L contains all these roots of unity. So that's maybe the main purpose of having L somewhat big. And now we have this sub functor. So sub functor. Of different robots and it's represented by you just give the ring a name, but you can also deduce it from the ring that you already have, namely our robot framed, and now you can Frame, then now you tensor over OÎ¼, which is the map that we have from one with O along chi. So here we use the the map from one to get us from omu. Second theorem is now a result of the current. A result on these rings with a fixed chi. So for any chi from u to o, we can show that our bar frame chi is L C i flat. Let me skip the dimension, but skip the dimension, let's say something else and a normal domain and if you look at the special fiber this is L C I and the normal domain. Normal domain of dimension, well, what you would be one, namely d squared, and then if hasn't changed, degree of f over q plus 1. Oh, and this also has the same relative dimension as the special firework that I have. Um I have now I still have this diagram here. So basically what we did is we imposed a chi here. We could also impose a chi there. So we live over a certain component over the ring over the base and the ring over the base is just to form our series ring over O with a fixed chi. And now what we show is that the fiber of these things us that the fiber of these things are actually irreducible components of the original grid. And so we determined all the irreducible components. So the corollary is that that produces by fraction between the very useful Irreducible components of X robot frames and the irreducible components of X that row bar friend and explicitly you send the rowbar friend chi to the X X and you shouldn't have frames for determinants, although it doesn't really matter. They're one-dimensional presentations. And so you get this bijection. And yeah. Now let me erase the last ease here. And this was interesting because. This was interesting because it was known that if you would find on a certain component crystalline point with regular shade weights, then the rigid energetic generic fiber associated with this would contain a dense set of such points. So, in fact, maybe the next question. In fact, maybe the next question is: do these guys have enough crystalline points, or then at least one? And so the third theorem is that each component, that is the X row bar frame chi, contains Oh, and let me invert T going to be on the generic fiber. This contains a crystalline point x, I mean, or contains a point, shape like this, contains a point x, such that rho x is crystallized. Crystalline with regular hard shapes. And maybe the I mean, so let me say something about the proof. Of course, again, the one input is the Hamilton G-stack. So So the main point we had to figure out at this point was if rho bar is absolutely irreducible and such rho bars over pedic fields they were classified then you know they're induced from an unrampified extension then as and as a psi The psi let me say and psi is lift, sorry, this a crystalline lift of that robot, then uh we can find by explicit construction. By explicit construction, a list row that is of the required type. So crystalline with regular touch tape weights. And then there's an induction part. Here's an induction part for the reducible cases. And that requires an input. So if flow bar is reducible than the induction part. This is again results from the Emerson Chiefsing. Okay, let me not do any of these details. And then ideas. Corollary and I think I mean this was known that this corollary would would With oh well then, so this builds on Shenery and Nakamura. So the crystalline points are surrisky dense. In what is it? Rigid generic fiber of this formula scheme. The only thing they needed as an input was this existence of this. Okay, now So maybe in the second half I want to say something about the proof of theorem one and theorem one was the initial statement about ring theoretic properties of this frame deformation ring namely that it was a local complete intersection flat over O and of some perhaps expected dimension and a Dimension and so maybe the first part is a and this is also a written up, but it's a folklore. I mean this has been known I think for a long time. So if you control the dimension of the special fiber it has If it has this dimension that we eventually defined as the dimension of the relative dimension of the ring, then theorem one halts and maybe let me say something about the reason. So by Maver, although maybe he never looked at lifting rings, but somehow he showed how one can use obstruction theory. One has an isomorphism of these lifting rings as a quotient of a power series ring in, let's say, In, let's say, R formal variables module, a number of equations. And you can give explicit formulas for R and S. R is the dimension of the space of one code cycles of G F with coefficients in the adjoint representation. 50s in the adjoint representation of rho bar and s is the dimension of the second cobalt G of G s with add rho bar coefficients. And okay, so the fact that you have S elements in here, this is what obstruction theory gives you, but it doesn't tell you anything about the shape of these elements. Anything about the shape of these elements, they can all be zero for that matter. So we want to need something interesting about this. But we also need to understand this number, the dimension we have in relation to R and S. And so Gadoa Cohnology tells you. So Galois homology tells you that R minus F is the number R was brought, lengthy d squared times the degree of F over Gt plus 1. And then commutative algebra tells you this good effect. Defect in part A. Namely, if you do know that the dimension is a nose is thick, then you can reduce from computative algebra that these elements have to be a regular sequence, and then you can conclude from that. Now, Now the next thing is we have to find a dimension of a special fiber ring and so so let me first A key tool that we use in our argument, namely to any representation row from GF to GLD sum ring A. You can always attach factorially a pseudo Representation, let's say key law. And so this is a polynomial law mimicking the properties of the of the characteristic polynomial of um rho as a function of the group. Maybe one shouldn't say more. And so now we have a formation functor and well one can also perform pseudo representations, as has been explained by Cheney and now we get this map. And now we get this map if P bar, this residual pseudo representation, is P of rho bar. Yes, and maybe I mean some something that should be expected if you remember a representation only. Remember a representation only by its characteristic polynomial is that you cannot necessarily recover the representation. You can only recover if A is a field. You can recover a semi-simple representation giving rise to the T. So for rho, I mean sorry for T, a pseudo representation of Of GF, let's say, field values, field K valued, there exists a semi-simple representation, let's say rho t from GF to GLD of K algebraic closure. Um so actually at the T is oh I don't know P of rho of P oh yeah, just to say characteristic polynomial and these uh pseudo presentations and their deformation theory they have been studied by Shening and um so so Shenandier proved that um P P bar T S is defendable. representable by let's say some R P S, which is in this category AO hat and a universal pseudo representation from the oblated group ring. Oblived grouping over RPS of GF to RPS. And he also proved the still unpublished preprint, I believe, some further results, and I'll state them in a second, because they were the main motivation for us to prove some other results. For us to prove some other results. And we only need our results later on. So let me state them. So R bar Ts is degree dimensional of dimension e squared degree F over 2 plus 1 no longer brackets brackets and yes I think I haven't stated like this. So the points in the pseudo-deformation space such that rho x0, this semi-simple representative, is Humor irreducible. Irreducible, they are dense in X bar. Yes, and I'm cheating a bit because we didn't fully prove this, we only proved it in some cases. So E was also E also uses input from they work with the They work with the Auschwanometers. And so the analogs of A and B for P S generic fiber, and that's also not quite true, they are U2 shedding. Okay, and uh yes. Maybe one comment about the change of dimension. I mean what is d squared minus? There's a d squared minus one missing here, but d squared minus one is exactly the dimension of d G L D, which you kill when you go from representations to pseudo representations. Okay. Okay, um ah but so now this looks all very good because we have some place where we understand the dimension and we could try to go up. But there is still a problem, namely the map from RPF to our framed robot. This is not of Of finite type. So it's, I mean, these are two more formal objects, and the map is between formal objects. And also, this map is typically not formally smooth, which is maybe the only case which you would understand at hockey. But this map can be complicated. So, well, you have to manage it. Very the situation and now what is the What is the way out? You look at more general type of representations. Maybe you consider a functor x gen from R t s Algebras to sets and so an RPS algebra so homomorphism so I a phi from R plus to some D, family D, and we want to consider our PS RPS times of the homomorphisms from the completed group ring that we saw before when you were describing pseudocharacters now to the matrix algebra of D by D matrices over E. And you also want to fix the The pseudo presentation of Rho B to be the one coming from the universe ring and now that I'm standing here, maybe I have to ask these do I have to quote out to for the Kayleigh Hamilton property. For the Kaylee-Hamilton property, or did I do this right now? Anyway, we go on with this, and maybe there was a reply, maybe not. So, anyway, so maybe so suppose our row bar is Bar is no, no, let's not do this. All I want to do is I want to describe what is x gen of our field F and these are representations from From Gf to G L D F such that the semi-simplification of rho is equal to rho bar. So this x gen, I mean, we only remember the correct wisdom polynomial of things. So we only remember the semi-simplification of things. Simplification of things. And so, in a sense, if you have a rho Bargo Bargo semi-simplified, and then we look at the variety of our presentations that have the same semi-simplification. Okay, and now so Now, I can quote a result from Carol. Namely, there exists an F finite type on R E S scheme and then equals expect equals x a gen. Well, representing, ah, yeah, I guess I already wrote x gen. So by this I guess I mean that the stag of A represents this functor. RTS, final tab R T S. Let me say algebra. A gen, I said the above x gen is represented by spec of A gen. Then what does this have to do with the rings we want to study? If we take any rho bar. R in exgen F. But if this is a closed point, we can complete the ring at the maximum ideal corresponding to this point rho bar and that gives us our framed deformation ring for rho bar. I now I need more room. I have I need more room. Um and because a diagram so we have a map from X gen to xgen to xps, I mean in the sense that hen is an RPS algebra. Let me call this pi. And I put bars there for a special fiber, because I'm only interested in the special fiber from now on. And here I can form the GFD quotients. Then there is a net here, induced one, and this alpha is a universal homeomorphism. And that means at least if you want to understand. So, so yes, so so now. So now let me formulate the next and then the defining result I want to mention is that the dimension of x gen, only I guess x or equal or equal. Can't be smaller. Can't be smaller. That's okay if you formulate it like this. So this is bounded by this plus one number. And this implies, I guess this will eventually imply theorem one because of this property B. You know the dimension of this ring, the component Of this ring, the completion at any maximal ideal will have at most the same dimension, and that's the dimensional vertical. And now why is this diagram important for us that we have something about a PIT quotient then being a and here we have a universal homeomorphism. So Homeomorphism. So we want to prove a bound on the dimension by decomposing the base into useful sets, whatever this is. And then over each useful set you want to study for a generic point, kind of the fiber, and you want to bound the fiber dimension. And then you want to have a result that says, oh, if you take the dimension of space times the bound for the fiber dimension, this gives you. Bound for the fiber dimension, this gives you the bound at the dimension of a chunk of this, and then you pull all these chunks together. And if all of them have this bound, then you win. But the point to, I mean the problem maybe now to implement this is, well, if this would be some random map, it might be difficult to say something. But the points we have here are also the points we have there. And it is a GRT quotient, so we can produce results from for GRT quotients. And that will be important. Coaches and that will be important for the dimension bounds. So, input from GID theory. This is so sharply and I mean we also have to rework it so that it fits our situation. So for x, a point on x bar ps or a point, I mean as points points in a X gene model. GLD, if you can bound the dimension of the fiber as the dimension of the tension space. And now we have a point here. This is a silver representation. pseudo representation, you choose the semi-simple representation giving rise to it, then you look, and this is an element in the x-bar, this is a point in x-bar gen, and then you look at its tension space, and maybe we don't quite use it like this, but we also maybe decompose x gen a little bit, but at least it's important that we can bound this y, this tension spaces. And then now, why should this, oh yes, and now this should be computable. This AS and now this should be computable in terms of X group namely rho not X if you can think of Because you can think of this as a block diagonal matrix where all the blocks are absolutely reducible presentations. And now, let's say rho near rho x0. Well, this rho has to look like a block diagonal matrix, but if you're in the vicinity, well, you can deform entries. Entries, I guess, in this unipotent radical of a certain parabolic. And I guess there are lots of choices. I mean, I wrote down one ordering of these blocks, but you could certainly reorder them and then get another choice. But then for each of these finally many choices, you can compute things in terms of exponents. Of X groups. And so this is basically the idea of how to compute the fiber. And now we stratify UPS. This is remove the closed point meaningfully That's not the next term, that's then you have to read off the details. As U T S is a disjoint union of Ui such that for each I there exists a bound di for For the dimension of the fiber whenever x is ui and oh yes and the the i so i is obviously a finite set. Not obviously I should say this, but otherwise this could not be so. But otherwise, this would not be so useful. And we also show that the dimension of x-bar gen is bounded by then the maximum of the dimensions of the ui plus di, that's the fiber dimension, oh, and then therefore plus one and the fiber above MPS is. is in the closure of the other n of other files so you don't have to understand this and yeah maybe I want to maybe mention one thing if you have a local ring and you remove its maximal ideal from the spec that I mentioned with rock pi one and that vibration By one, and that roughly explains the plus one we have at the end here. Now, how many seconds do we have left? Um I let me try to I mean, then you have to, yeah, yeah. They didn't really say what meaningfully the composing means. So if D is 2 and let's say T bar is trivial and then how would we decompose the Decompose the UPS. There are irreducible points. There should be lots of them because you need to improve. There are lots of irreducible points. There are reducible points, but they are of a nice kind, and they are reducible points of not so nice points, you know, nice type. And so we have a point. We have a point. So here, rowlight nod is irreducible. Maybe I don't know if I get to out of this. And for the bounds of these UIs, I should say this here, in case I get lost later. So this uses the results. The result with Yushka is UI are pseudo-deformation rings, and so that's how that part comes in. Okay, now let me go again to this part here: irreducible pseudo presentations. Then here are the rho x0 are of the type one zero zero Chi 1 0 0 chi 2 with chi 1 not isomorphic to chi 2 maybe plus minus 1 yes plus minus 1 and then here we have rho x 0 isomorphic to chi 0 0 chi 1 the minus 1 case doesn't really show up because you switch the two and then it becomes a plus 1. Okay, and now what is the dimension of this space? And now the irreducible locus, this was also proved in the work with, I guess this followed from what I wrote earlier. This is d squared would be 4 times f over pt. Then there was a plus 1. Plus one, but I remove the closed point, so it's just this. Then here I have 2f over qp. So here I have two characters, and for each of these characters, the work with the bound f over qp plus 1. So twice this, but minus 1 for the closed point. Of the closed point. And then here we get F over Qt, the correspondence I have one character. And then, yes, now what is the shape of the maximum fiber? So here, the fibers, you take any point and then you have TGL2 orbit. But it's the full orbit. So here, well, a maximal point will A maximal point will look like chi1, a star at 0 chi2, and the star is non-zero. But then you can still act with TGL2. And let me write the times. Maybe this is not really right theoretically. But these are the things relevant for dimensions. And then IFNOR, obviously, TGL2 times the lower triangular one. One and then here, same as on the right, yes, if chi is not one second, if chi is different from chi one. Because if chi is different from chi one, then you have distinct characters and then the centralized distribution. Characters and then the centralizer is trivial. But if chi is equal to chi1, then in fact the centralizer is bigger. And then you have to else somehow there is a minus one coming in. Okay, now you need the fiber dimension. So the fiber dimension of TGO2 was 3. PQL2 was 3. Here we have a PQL2, that's 3 plus. And then here's an X group coming up. And the X groups here, they have the dimension F over Qt. And then there is a minus one because the X group during the representation loses one dimension. And then here on this side, you get three plus, and then here's F over Qt. There will be a plus one, minus one, so this would be okay. So this would be okay. And sometimes you have something minus one. So sometimes if chi is really equal to chi one, then we have an action of TGL2 modulo degree centralizer. And now you just add the total dimension. This is the sum of these two terms, and so you get 3 plus 4. 3 plus 4 F over Qt. Then here you get 3 plus 3 F over Qt. And here you get 4 plus 2 F over Qt. Um and possibly a minus one. Um why is the forward? Sorry, where does the word come from now? Sorry, where does the word come from now? Um did I it's one thing, one second or maybe the four was on the previous slide. You have a good point. Why do I have that four? Do I have one? Do I need a three unit? I don't see the four actually. I thought it was a very close call, but I maybe I did something wrong in the last computation. Yeah, I'm not sure. Okay, let let me just finish up anyway. Maybe it's going to be a question for over time. Sorry, because then I'm really going to go over time. And my main point was, so here you see, if you add plus one, this is the dimension we want. And these two dimensions, they're less than dimensions we have. So this means that this is actually has to be the dimension of the space, and these two dimensions are. So I mean, they do not control. I mean, they do not contribute anymore to the upper bound or the GIF, and that's the end of the talk. Sorry, thank you very much. Any questions from the audience? What's the significance of this comer, irreducible? Or exactly why is it? I said something was smooth, but so. Um so the I don't think I can give you the details of it so if row X is common irreducible then it follows that then you can check that H2 Gf Gf at rho x at zero row x. Sorry. That's important. And this is really important because so this is important maybe I'll do a Yeah, I think this is important when p divides the degree and I guess, yeah, and maybe either a zeta p is in f or some other things. And I mean one important thing is if p divides d, then the sequence add number bar, add rho x not to add rho x to whatever is not Is not split. And then you can't deduce anything from this vanishing for the other vanishing. So you have to analyze what can happen. And in fact, I guess this age can be quite large, this number. Although maybe... I mean, one can give examples, but yeah, yeah. And I couldn't give you any remote example. Yeah, somehow like the bulk of the dimension is maybe not sometimes not surprisingly coming from the irreducible part, which is you already computed the dimension in the pseudo-information world. Yeah. I don't know if you said how you do. Did he say how you get back? Oh, oh, oh, no, I didn't say anything about it. I was thinking it's a different talk. But in some sense, like in some sense, that means the reality was only computed on the superformation. Like that's the truth. Definition. Like that's the truth. It's like living, either computation that increases your definition. So was it kind of known that was it always kind of a known thing that might be difficult in understanding these dimensions was somehow irreducible locus? I'm not sure. I mean, once we knew this, I think maybe the aim of the work with Sushka might have been to prove a result like this, but you still have to go from the pseudo-representations to the representations. To the representations, and also maybe Vitas will say something in the afternoon. Maybe you can say something in the other direction, also. That is just take A L that has dimension F, right? And act on it by GM by multiplying every coordinate. You take a GIT quotient, you get a point. Knows nothing about your F. Dimension zero. In the irreducible case, these things are the same. I mean, I'm not. Are the same. I mean, still. What I'm saying is that you can have like fibers which are massive. Yes, that's because of their useful stuff. Was it known that the introduction to animation was always coming to you? Was that like a known thing before this work? I mean, I don't think so. I mean, maybe you have to analyze the fiber dimensions. I think only once you understood the fiber dimensions, it was clear how to deal with this. I mean, I think that's an important point. That's maybe why I try to stress that you need this TIT machinery. You need the CIT machinery to really understand that the further dimensions in terms of index. Does it kind of answer this? I mean, let's take our speaker again. So folks there's lunch now. I just want to remind everyone that the if you printed a schedule earlier, the time of the first act of retop is changed. It starts at 3.15. Change it starts at 3:15. There's also copyright here that is scheduled to start at 3:40. Yeah, well, that's not a good idea.
