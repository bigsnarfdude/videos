Okay, hi, thank you. Let me as well thank Barbara and Bill for inviting me. As Avna said this morning, I wish I was there, but believe me, I'm paying for it. It's 105 degrees today. And well, I'm sure you have a better weather over there. Okay, so I've been asked to give a kind of a survey of what we've been doing for fractional diffusion. For fractional diffusion, and in particular, related to the Dunford-Taylor method. So, this is what I did. Let me just put it. And okay, so voila. Okay, so there are many, well, several applications that involves non-local operator. And as you will see, I'm going to focus on what is called the spectral applaution. The spectral Laplacian, which is kind of a prototype of a non-local operator in space. So I listed a few references for different applications going from image denoising, fluid dynamic or geostrophic models, purse media, turbulence model, electroconvections. You have a bunch of applications and you will see, well, you will not see, but. Well, you will not see, but one way or the other, you have a non-local operator, and one way or the other, you can use some kind of a fractional applaution to model the non-local phenomena. So, more related to what we've been doing, so I selected the three applications. The first one is electroconvection, so it's the motion of a liquid crystal on a very thin crystal. Crystal on a very thin amount of liquid. There's an application in American, perpetual American option pricing. I did in particular with Abner, gave a talk, the previous talk. But I think today I'm going to focus on the surface quasi-geostrophic flow at the end of this talk, and I'll mention a little bit what we did in that direction. Okay, so let me start with the basic definition. Start with the basic definitions and then I'll go with the numerical methods. So, what is the fractional Laplacian, the spectral Laplacian? So, in this talk, omega is going to be a domain of Rd, typically Lipschitz or polygonal, bounded for sure. And D is one, two, three. The dimension is kind of irrelevant as long as you can do finite element on this dimension. The usual notation for the functional. The usual notation for the functional space, symphyd compactly supported, L2, H1, restriction to vanishing traces in H1 is would be H10, and the dual of H10 is H1S1. And as you can imagine, the key, the star is kind of this Laplacian that maps H10 to its dual. Okay, so to define the spectral Laplacian, you start with an You start with an orthonomic mal basis of L2 because the inverse of the Laplacian is compact in L2. So you have an autonomous basis in L2. And I deduct this basis psi i, so it's element of h10. And the corresponding eigenvalues are lambda i. So just clearly what I mean is that the minus Laplacian of psi is lambda i. Laplacian of psi is lambda epsi in omega. And of course, psi is zero on the boundary. Here, I just wrote what I mean by orthonormal and orthogonal, just to make it clear. It's L2 orthogonal and orthonormal, and it's H1 semi-normal orthogonal in that sense. The gradient gradient is not necessarily delta ij, but it has the lambda that comes up. Okay, so now if you have a C infinity function, So now, if you have a C infinity function compactly supported, you can write in its basis using this autonomous basis. And then comes the definition of the spectral fractional Laplacian, which is just acting on the frequencies. So if you want the fraction S of the spectral fractional S of the Laplacian applied to V, you just take the Fourier decomposition of V and instead of lambda. of v and instead of lambda i that we would have that you would have for s equal to one the usual applian you just put lambda i to the s okay so at that stage it's just a definition and the the model problem that we're kind of going to look at is you're given f with a certain regularity and you want to find u satisfying minus laplacian to the s of u equal to f with zero boundary condition it's slightly different It's slightly different. Well, it's actually quite different from the Laplacian that Juan Pablo discussed during the first talk. I'll come back to his, well, the other Laplacian at the end of this talk. But something to be said maybe right now, I started this talk by saying, oh, there are all these applications. I never seen any physical equation coming from physical. Physical principle that will involve something like this. I mean, this to me, I don't, well, I don't foresee this coming from basic principle, physic principle. But you will see that we have an alternate representation that would actually be more kind of physical, if you want. So just bear with me a little bit. Okay, so if you want to understand the fractional Laplacian or its mapping property, well, you have a few spaces that needs to be defined. That needs to be defined. The natural one, I call natural one, because they are really the one that you would expect when you look at these Fourier decompositions, are the dotted space, which I use a dot in top of it. So the HR dot, which really should be understood, the HR0 dot, at least when R is bigger than one half. The function in L2, such that this Fourier representation, where you have the frequency to the R is You have the frequency to the R is finite. Okay, and as you can imagine, the fractional Laplacian defined here is a natural mapping between those spaces because it just acts on the frequency. Okay, so in fact, you can define the fractional Laplacian to dHR by density. But these spaces are not very interesting, except that, well, they are nice for the mapping property of the fractional Laplacian. They're not that interesting because they are not the regular. Regular regularity space, the natural regularity space where we know we have interpolation, estimate, these type of things. And the standard regularity space are those sovereign space that I just defined here, just the interpolation space. So HR0, without the doubt, this time, is the space that interpolates between L2 and H10 with index R. So that's the real method, but you can do it with the complex method as well. It with the complex method as well. Okay, and when the minus r, of course, is a dual of the hr zero. Just a few notes, one note for those who are maybe more knowledgeable about intermediate space. Usually HR0 when r equal to one alpha is not denoted hr0, it's denoted hr00. But I'll keep hr0 not to have so many notations. But for me, those hr. But for me, those HR space are always going to be the interpolation space. And if you want to go higher than one, because this was just for R between 0 and 1, or minus 1 and 1, then I'm going to consider those spaces. So they are the interpolation space between H1 and H2, again with the index R. So that would give me H1 plus R. And I want to impose the boundary condition. So I intersect with H1 0. Okay, and as I said, the H dot space are nice because of the mapping. The H-dot space are nice because of the mapping property of the fractional Laplacian. The HR space are nice because we know interpolation or we know all the regulatory property. And it turns out to be equivalent. So it's not a big deal. At least for R between minus one and one, they are equivalent. And it's easy to see because they are both interpolation space and they match at zero and at one for r equal to zero and r equal to one. So it's not a big deal. They are equivalent. Equivalent. And in particular, since you have the correct mapping property, Lax Milgram tells you that if you take F in the dual of HS0, there exists a unique U in HS satisfying the fractional Laplacian problem. So existence, uniqueness, continuity with respect to the data. Okay, now if you want to do approximation, so if you want to approximate your solution, usually you need a little bit more. Usually, you need a little bit more regularity. That gives you the approximation power. So, the natural question is whether we can go above H1. And for that, we need some kind of elliptic regularity assumption. So, what is the elliptic regularity assumption? Is that you assume that the Laplacian is not only a mapping or its inverse, is not only a mapping between H minus 1 and H1, but you can actually go a little bit above. So, if the right-hand side is in H1 minus 1 plus alpha, then the solution. plus alpha then the solution will be in h1 plus alpha okay so that's an assumption and at that stage it's really an assumption on the domain so if the domain is uh convex you have uh yeah you have uh if the domain is convex you have alpha equal to one if the domain is lipschitz you you know that there is an alpha but it might be rather small okay um and the And the good news is that if you make that assumption, if you under this regulatory assumption, which I should say it's about the Laplacian, not about the fractional Laplacian, so it's the regular operator, then those dotted space and those regular spaces again are equivalent, isomorphism. Right, so the bottom line is that not only you have the That not only you have a unique solution in HS, but if the right-hand side is a bit more regular, you can even go above HS. So the Laplacian really gives you a 2s regularity property up to 1 plus alpha. Okay, so the Laplacian inverse, the fractional Laplacian gives you a shift of 2s as long as you end up in a place that is smaller than 1%. In a place that is smaller than one plus alpha. It cannot go above one plus alpha. Voila. So now comes to the Denfort-Taylor integral because, well, you want to approximate this fractional Laplacian, so you have to find a nice representation. And we think that, well, we saw that this was a nice representation. It's really based on what you teach in complex analysis. It's just the Cauchy theorem. It's just the Cauchy theorem. So the Laplacian or minus Laplacian spectrum is on the real line, bonded away from zero. So you can actually you have the formula, the residue theorem, if you want, for any function of the Laplacian, if you integrate over a complex contour that goes around the singular point. And this is And this is true for a bounded operator. Of course, the Laplacian is not a bounded operator, so you have to be careful which contour you take. But a contour that works in that case is just taking this one here. So you go around here and you go here. So these are the singular value of the Laplacian. This is the branch cut of the absolute value, because if I want to evaluate minus Laplacian to the minus s, if I use the standard done for Taylor integral, you will have a z to the minus s times the resolvent. To the minus s times the resolvent. So you have to you what I mean by z to the minus s is the regular expression so that you use the bench cut that is in the negative real line. So you have to avoid this negative real line. So you integrate over that control that goes like this. Okay, so that's well defined. So it's well defined for f in H minus S. It gives you something in HS. You can check the dose property. And that's actually. And that's actually what here is a nice representation of the formula. In particular, if you take the limit when theta goes to pi and when r goes to zero. So you see, if I take the limit when theta goes to pi and r goes to zero, what really I'm doing is integrating from minus infinity to zero and then go around the branch cut and go from zero to plus infinity. That's just this contour. And if you put everything together, you end up with a very nice, simple. Nice, simple, I should say, real integral expression. Not the change sign, there's a minus sign instead of the plus sign again because I was in the negative line and I push it to the positive line. Okay, so that's what it's referred to, at least in, I think, in Yoshida, as the Balachristian formula. And just for later use, I'm just going to use a change of variable instead of mu that I had before. I use e to the y, so now I have. Before I use e to the y, so now I have an integral from minus infinity to infinity with a different factor here and e to the y instead of mu. At this point, it's just a detail, it's just better for the approximation. Okay, so so yeah, so now the next step, now that I found a nice representation of my solution, I need to approximate it. So what do we propose to approximate the solution? The solution. Well, I just rewrote the expression here. And the first step is to take care of this infinity integral. So the integral on y that goes from minus infinity to infinity. And it turns out that there are nice quadrature formula that are actually designed kind of for that purpose. They are called synquature. So it's just you take a step that is one of the square root of n. So you give an n number of snapshot, if you want. Of snapshot, if you want, the number of time you want to evaluate the integrand actually is more than 2n plus 1. The time, the step is 1 over square root of n. The snapshots, yl, where are you going to evaluate the integrand is l times k for l go to minus n to n. So it's a uniform decomposition from minus n k to n k. Okay, it's uniform, it's uniform with the exponential value. But it's uniform with the exponential variable. That's what is important. It's not uniform with respect to the original variable, it's uniform respect to the exponential variable. So, actually, it's actually exponentially spaced out. Okay, so the sync query, as I said, is very simple. Instead of the integral from S infinity to infinity, you truncate at mk, at minus mk, so and you replace the truncated integral by a finite sum, which is kind of the rectangular. By a finite sum, which is kind of the rectangular formula, you sum from minus n to n, you evaluate the integrant at the point, and you multiply by the spacing k. Okay, so that's called the sync quadrature. And it's, as I said, it's kind of already analyzed in a sense. At least all the tools are there. The main ingredient to understand how well you approximate the exact representation with this sink water is. Is the main ingredients are the exponential decay of the integral because you have this exponential guy here and also the decay of the resolvant, but together with the fact that this is an analytic function in y. Okay, so for instance, the tail estimate, you can simply use the fact that you have this exponential decay and you can estimate the truncation with something that is exponentially decaying. Exponentially decaying in K. Okay, so I don't want to give you the details, but basically, again, exponential decay and analyticity allows you to get an error estimate for the quadrature error. So the quadrature errors between the exact integral representation and the sing quadrature is, as stated in this theorem, decaying exponentially with respect to the number of points that you use in the quadrature. In the curvature. Now, to understand a little bit more the regularity that is here, so let's go a bit slowly. So, if I want to understand where I need to, why do I need this regularity for F? Is that a natural regularity to expect? So, let's forget about the maximum between gamma and zero, but just gamma. Assume that f is in h gamma. So, if f is in h gamma, then the minus. then the minus s Laplacian minus s of f is going to bring me into gamma plus 2s remember it's a shift of 2s so this is the regularity that i will have on that guy and of course i measure the error in h r so i better have that this is greater than r otherwise this will not be even in h r so this is really the basic regularity that you you you need even to make sense of this this expression sense of this expression. So the AR in HR is bounded exponentially, exponentially decaying as long as F is in this as this regularity. Okay, I'm not going to show you experiment because that would just show you well it's exponentially decaying. So let me skip this. Now the next step is once you have this expression, you know, oh, that's a very good approximation. You know, oh, that's a very good approximation of my original representation. I still need to approximate the integral because I have this inverse Laplacian or E y L minus Laplacian inverse that needs to be approximated. And this is the bread and butter for, say, finite element method. And that's what we suggest. So each of these integrands will be approximated using a finite element method. But you can really pick the method you wish to use. Method you wish to use. Oops, twice. So the point is that the integrant, I rewrote the integrant, or at least part of it, I call it UL because it depends on the snapshot YL. So the integrant satisfies this equation. And as I said, this is a typical equation we know to solve using finite element, but you can use finite difference, depends on your domain, whatever numerical method you want to use to approximate UL. We like finite elements. We like finite elements, so we assume that we have a sequence of conforming quasi-uniform subdivisions. So, h is kind of the maximum diameter in the string relation. The finite element space is globally continuous, zero on the boundary. This was polynomial degree one, subordinate to this partition. And the approximation, the final approximation to our solution u, remember it was this finite sum, is that instead of having Is that instead of having the UL that I would have here, this expression here, I put a UHL, and UHL is simply the finite element approximation of UL. So in other words, it's all this linear system that I wrote here. Okay. So very simple. So at the end of the day, what you have is a bunch of reaction diffusion problem to solve. We can find solver in any reasonable Over in any reasonable library, and then you have to accumulate all these solutions that you find. And that gives you the final solution. Now, to give you a little bit, at least a sense of the error that you get if you do that, well, as far as the quadrature goes, we know already that it's exponentially in n, so that's the quadrature error. And then you have the final limit error that appears. And what we appears and what we got is h to the two alpha so remember that we had this as a regularity assumption elliptic assumption of order alpha and i claim that you cannot expect more than h to alpha why because um uh if you say if f is in r plus two alpha star minus two s doesn't matter what alpha star is at the moment as i said the laplacian minus s is going to bring you to h r plus two alpha bring you to HR plus two alpha. If you measure in HR, then you have an excess of two alpha star, and that's everything really that you can hope as approximability. So you really cannot hope more than that. Now, this alpha star is not quite the alpha from the elliptic regularity. This is a bit technical because it comes from a duality argument and you don't necessarily have two alpha when you use duality argument, but it's actually sharp, at least if you use finite. But it's actually sharp. At least if you use finite elements, you cannot get better than this. Anyway, at the end of the day, two types of error: coordinator error, exponentially converging, and finite element error. That is optimal, at least for quasi-uniform meshes. Now, advantage of this method is, well, it's easy to parallelize in a sense, but that's what I saw at the beginning. I thought, well, it's actually quite easy. Beginning. I thought, well, it's actually quite easy to send all these finite elements over in parallel and then you sum them up at the end. But it turns out that we did a few experiments and for complex system, it's actually better to do parallelization in space and then some afterwards. So do all the snapshots sequentially, but parallelize in space. So this is to be taken with a grain of salt. But I think. But I think more interesting, especially for those that are not that much into numerical approximation, but they may want to test the conjecture or to test something or see the behavior of a model, of a system. This is really very simple to implement. You really have advection diffusion problem. Again, you can find it in any approximation software or the finite element software, and you really have to sum up contributions. So you have an external loop that's So you have an external loop that sums up all the contribution and you solve a bunch of reaction diffusion problem that you can get this from out of the shelf. So very simple to implement. Preconditional, this is maybe more detailed. And I also wanted to mention that what you have to do is to approximate a bunch of fraction diffusion problems. That's what I said. So what you really need. So so what you really need is uh it would be nice to have a nice solver or fast solver that approximate for every y, this the solution uy ul, I call uy of given by this, this ey minus Laplacian minus one half. And this is this is a typical problem in say radius modeling, a radius basis. So there are nice radius basis that are actually doing this. So you can actually have quite of a speed up. Quite of a speed up actually in exponential approximation property, even for the finite element method. This would not be an advantage if you were to only solve for one fractional diffusion, but if you were to solve for a bunch of them, for instance, when you do an inverse problem, you try to find the fractional power that you don't know, then you could use this technology because you will have to solve a bunch of fractional diffusion problem and you will have a very fast solver to do it. To do it. But again, this is kind of the subject for an entire talk. Okay, so let me just give you some numerical observations. So as I said, typical fractional Laplacian, you equal to zero on the boundary, you take F to be a checkerboard, so omega is a square, f is one in the upper right and lower. Upper right and lower left, I think, and zero otherwise. Measure the error in M2. And I'd like to point out that this function f is actually not, well, it's not smooth, it's in H1 half minus epsilon. And according to our theorem or the regularity, if f is in h1 half minus epsilon, the solution gets 2s. So it's h one half plus 2s minus epsilon. At least, so you should get the power h to the one-half plus 2s if one half plus 2s is smaller than 2 alpha, and alpha is 1 in that case. So if s is smaller than 3 quarter, you should get this order of convergence, what the theorems predict. And otherwise, you're using H2 and you get H square regularity. For the experiment, the number of single actors is large enough, so it doesn't affect the Is large enough so it doesn't affect the space approximation. And what you see is, in case you don't believe in theorems, is what the theorem predicts. So here, these are results for different value of the fractional power. So if S is smaller than three quarter, you have a different regime. If S is greater than three quarters, you have another regime. What the theorem predicts is the second line, and what we observe is the first line. And as you can see, it's quite a match. So it's not an adaptive method. So, it's not an adaptive method, so there's no refinement. And as Juan Pablo said this morning, of course, there's probably, well, I'm sure there are ways to refine the mesh and to get optimal order of convergence in L2. In L2, I'm not sure. But that was not the point here. Okay. So, numerical result as expected, well, as predicted, I should say. Okay. So, to give you. Okay, so to give you yes, no, no. So to give you just an idea of how the solution looks like, well, so as I said, it's a checkerboard. And if you imagine s equal to zero is kind of the identity, minus La Passion to the power of zero is the identity. So you don't have any not much smoothness, well, no smoothness at all for s equal to zero. So if s is small, you have very little smoothness. So that's what how the solution looks like. So that's what the solution looks like: the stiff gradient. If s is close to one, it's really close to the Laplacian. So you have quite a bit of smoothness. That's this case here. And that's the square root, which is in the middle. Maybe the better graph is that if you plot how the solution looks like in one of the, I don't know, in the middle here, you will see that for s small, you really have this stiff gradient. For s squared of s. For s squared of s, you have a smoother solution, and s close to one, you already have a smooth solution, like the Laplace. That's what is expected, and again, that also suggests adaptivity on the boundary, or at least whether the solution is not smooth. Okay, let me briefly discuss other methods. So, and that goes back to the question about, but where can you find from, well, how? find from well how from physical uh principle are you going to find this uh power of frequency that you sum seems seems rather mathematical and uh i i would i would argue that it's indeed the case but there are there is a nice representation uh a different point of view if you want or maybe that's where it started i'm not sure um and it's called the harmonic extension so i'm just going to describe it for s equal to one half so the Describe it for s equal to one-half, so the square roots, but you can do it for any power of s. This is something I think originally done by Caffarli and Sylvester for different operator, but what I'm discussing here is done in Stinger and Torreya, by Stinger and Torre in 2010. So I would like to suggest to look at this function w now that lives in Rd plus one, that is harmonic in Rd. That is harmonic in Rd plus one. So I'm looking actually in omega cross R plus. So omega is going to be the base of my domain, if you want, now. And I'm going to extend in the Z direction. So I have this cylindrical-like domain in Rd plus one. So I want my W to be harmonic in this extended domain. I want that the normal derivative at the base is minus F, so the derivative on omega. So the derivative on omega is minus f, the derivative respect to normal direction, which is z in that case. And I want omega to be zero on the side of this cylindrical, it's not cylindrical, but extended domain. Okay, so why I do that? Because I'm going to show you that actually you can recover the fractional Laplacian. And how you do that? Well, you use the spectral decomposition in x, y. So remember, we have this psi that were the eigenfunction of the line. The eigenfunction of the Laplacian. So I'm going to write this w that depends on x, y, and z as a function in this Fourier basis. The Fourier basis is x and y, and the coefficient are going to be z, a function of z. But that's a typical separational variable. Okay, and now if you check what it means to be harmonic, well, when you do harmonic, you have two Laplacian, you have a Laplacian with respect to X and Y and the Laplacian with respect to Z. When you perform the Laplacian with respect to X and Y, When you perform the La Persian respect to x and y, you get the lambda because of the eigenfunction, the use of the eigenfunction. So you get lambda psi back. And when you do the La Persian respect to z, well, you just differentiate twice the zi components. That's what comes here. So if you use the initial condition now, you actually can exactly find the coefficient. And the coefficient is fi divided by square root of lambda i, and that is exponential. And fi is the component in the free decomposition. Component in the foul decomposition of F again with respect to this basis. Okay, so you can actually exactly solve for the Zi's. Now, if you look at what happens when you restrict this W, so of course now you know W, W is the sum of the psi times the Zi. Now, if you restrict it to Z equal to zero, so you take the trace on Z equal to zero, so on omega, well, then you just lose the exponential. the exponential, you end up with fi square root of 1 over square root of lambda i times subsi i. Okay, so now if I were to take the fractional Laplacian of W restricted to z equal to zero, that's this guy, what should I do? I should take the Fourier decomposition of w at zero and multiply it by the square root of lambda. So every coefficient in the Fourier decomposition, I have to multiply by the square root of lambda. So you see that it kills the square root of lambda and I end up just with the f. And I end up just with the f. So the morality is that the square root of Laplacian square root of omega equal to f corresponds to the trace of a function that is harmonic in the extended domain and for which we are given the normal derivative to be minus f. Okay, and that I believe that it can come naturally in physics. You may have harmonic function, you're given the harmonic function you're given the Neumann value the the tray the Neumann derivative on on the flat region and you're interested on the on the function the Neumann to Dirichlet now okay so if you happen to have this turns out that what you're looking for is just the square root uh well square root inverse of of uh of f and as i said you can do for for different powers of s there's different weights that come within but i don't want to to go too much into the detail that that goes That brings me actually to maybe the first method that was used to approximate fraction model diffusion, at least one of the first methods, was by No Chateau, Otarla, and Salgado. It was using actually this extended property, and they were actually proposing a method, a finite method that would solve on the extended domain. And taking advantage of the decay in the Z direction, we were able to recover optimal conversions out there. Optimal conversions are there. So, I don't want to detail this more than that, but as you can imagine, now you have an harmonic problem in Rd plus one, so you can use a finite element method for that problem. Okay, there are other methods which I will not describe too much. You could also have said, well, really, what you want is you just have to compute this lambda i to the s. So, if I were able to compute the We're able to compute the spectrum, the eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the Laplacian, or at least an approximation of it, then computing the fractional Laplacian would be simple, very simple. And this has been also implemented. So you kind of use a finite element or that kind of method to approximate the Laplacian. And then you end up with a matrix. And then you can compute the eigenvalue eigenfunction of that matrix. So you have the spectral approximate spectrum. And then you can use this to compute. And then you can use this to compute the fractional operations. This is the first type of method. And you can also use some kind of a hit-semi-group strategy where you, instead of an extended domain, you actually have a time dependent and you look at the derivative. I don't want to say more than this on this, just to tell you that there are other methods. A few extensions that I'd like to discuss. I have 10 minutes, so I don't want to do too much. First, you don't have to look at the Laplacian, you can look at the regular different elliptic operator. It works exactly the same way. The Dunforteller or the Balacrucian formula holds not only for the Laplacian, but for any elliptic operator. But this time, the pickup regularity, the elliptic regularity, may depend also on the operator and not only on the domain, as for the Laplacian. You can also look at the Laplace-Beltrami operator if you're interested. Laplace Beltrami operator, if you're interested in, say, the Laplace Belt, the square root of the Laplace-Beltramy operator, you can use exactly the same technique. If you have a finite element solver for the Laplace-Beltramy operator, then you can do the square root or any power. This is an example where actually the domain is this corkscrew shape, and you solve for this U that has F equal to one everywhere. Everywhere. Okay, so it's very simple. I mean, again, if you have a finite element solver for the regular problem, then you can use it for the fractional problems. You can also do something that is, I don't quite see how physical, when you can see this in physics, but you can do fractional power of a non-symmetric operator, so sectorial operator, the same way you would integrate over the spectrum as long as it's. Of the spectrum as long as the operator is sectorial. And for instance, and it's the same formula, you end up with the same Balakrishnan formula. So, for instance, here when A is advection diffusion on the square domain, then you can take the square root. That's what we hear. Yeah, this s equal to 01 as S equals 209 power of this operator, and we set it equal to. Operator, and we set it equal to one. And as you can imagine, if the power was one, it's advection diffusion. So you have kind of a boundary layer. And the boundary layer, interesting enough, the width of the boundary layer does not depend on the fractional power. What depends on the fractional power is the kind of the strength of the boundary layer. So for s equal to 0.9, it's very smooth in case. So that's how. Very smooth in k so that's that's how the boundary layer would look like. And if you take s to be 0.1, that's the boundary layer would look like this. Okay, if you if you have a vection in the one uh you can do time time fractional as well again, you have a representation formula using the eat semi-group or the Mitteg-Loefer function if you do with fractional in time. But I don't want to spend too much time. But I don't want to spend too much time on this either. Again, you have a representation formula, you use sync water, and you solve for a reaction diffusion problem. Let me move on. And I also would like to mention that you can do the integral Laplacian. So that's the Laplacian that Juan Pablo talked about the first talk. So I'm not going to repeat what he said. So this is the definition of the integral applied. The definition of the integral Laplacian, and you have a bilinear form that actually you can write the bilinear form like this, which happens to be related to the Fourier transform of your function u and v. So if you want the weak formulation of the fractional Laplacian, the integral fractional appression defined like this, you multiply by v, you integrate, and it turns out that what you end up at the end is the integral to the r d, the psi to the two. The psi to the 2s and the multiplication of the two Fourier transform with a complex conjugate. So the weak formulation ready, if you want to see it, you can see it as this equal to this for all v in h tilde s. And if you recall, h tilde s are the function such that when you extend by zero, it's h l sinal d okay, just let me skip through this, but the bottom line is and why you can use the Don-Fortelon method. Fortelon method for this problem as well is that the binary form has actually a nice representation in terms of the Forteller. So you can actually use the same technique, a similar technique at least. And the idea is that you cannot get a representation of the solution, but you can get a nice representation of the action of the bilinear form. And you kind of see it here in a sense that if you think of the Denfort integral, that would be the fraction. That will be the fraction s minus one, because you have the resolvent here, times the Laplacian. So it's really the Laplacian to the s that this expresses in the weak form. But you can use the same technique and you can approximate the spectral integral Laplacian as well. Okay, so let me quickly go to the application. I'm not going to give you too much details, but at least I wanted to show you that, well, you can actually apply it to a certain physical problem. To a certain physical problem, so and the physical problem here is the surface-quadi-geostrophic flow. So, you start with the Navier-Stokes equation, so the usual assumption for the Navier-Stokes equation. You assume that the main constraint are rotation, so Coriolis force, and you assume that it's actually quite stratified. And you have a certain scale typically of poles, and you end up with what is called the surface quasi-geostrophic. The surface quasi-geostrophic flow for the potential vorticity. The difficulties of the equation that you get is that there's a strong transport and there's very limited diffusion. And in fact, the solution developed discontinuities, which is quite physical, is called frontogenesis in atmospheric science and also fine structure. So if you want to know the equation, If you want to know the equation, so theta is the temperature potential or buoyancy. It satisfies a kind of a transport equation with certain velocity u. And it has a kind of a diffusion term. And as I said, it's rather small. Kappa here, the coefficient is rather small. And this is set on a torus. Really, it should be, well, it should be on a 2D domain, but just for simplicity, I use periodic boundary condition. So it's in 2D, if you want. So it's in 2D, if you want. And that's for the time zero to infinity. And of course, you give an initial condition. So here the computations are done on a torus or in a periodic domain, if you want. And the fractional Laplacian that you will see everywhere is the actual spectral fractional Laplacian defined on a torus. But again, it's the same type of idea, except that you don't have maybe the first eigenvalue. You have to assume that the mean value is zero. You have to restrict yourself to mean. You have to restrict yourself to mean-value zero functions. Anyway, to understand a little bit more those terms, as I said, this is the transport of the temperature with a certain velocity. This term here is called the Ekman pumping. It has to do with the stratification and the pressure force that actually pulls you up or down because of the different stratification. And the velocity that the temperature is. The temperature is moved with satisfies this equation. And basically, it says that you are in equilibrium between the Coriolis force and the pressure. So actually, the temperature or the velocity goes along the isobars. That's the gist of it. Okay, so again, I don't want to spend too much time on this because I don't have enough time to do that. Time to do that. But the bottom line is you see that the fractional Laplacian appears in two places as a diffusion term coming from the equine pumping, but it also appears as the definition of the velocity, because as I said, the velocity goes in the orthogonal direction of the geopotential, and the geopotential is given as the fractional Laplacian of the temperature. Anyway, you have fractional Laplacian everywhere, so we used our technique to solve, to approximate this. To approximate this system. But the issue here mainly is because of the transports. If you know a bit about transport, the difficulty is not to get an estimate in L2, but really to control variation in L infinity. You have a lot of spurious oscillation if you don't do something. So we use something that was developed by German and Popov. So it's called an entropy viscosity to be able to capture these continuities, I think, properly. Discontinuities, I think, properly. And to give you an example, this is my initial condition. It kind of looked like a saddle. And it was actually proven that that's the way that the solution exhibits sharp discontinuities. And you see how well we are able to approximate those discontinuities with our model. But maybe more to the point or more what look like what you would expect in those regimes. What you would expect in those regimes. This is an initial condition that is kind of an exponential, a little bit shifted, and you see that if you let it go, you see those vortices typical of development at the poles. Yeah. Oh, I don't know why I get the second one. Okay. And just as to brag a little bit about our meta, the point is that we. Our meta, the point is that really with a rather small discretization, we're able to capture a very fine structure, which you actually see in practice. And finally, which I found interesting is a turbulent study. So the turbulent study is to know how fast the frequency are dissipating. So the idea is that you take random initial conditions. Uh, random initial condition like the picture here, and then you let the equation go. And what you should see is our vortices that should build up, eventually, they should grow, and eventually everything should dissipate to one single vortex. And then you can track the frequencies when you do that. And that's the free decaying turbulence. If it were a three-dimensional Navy-Stokes problem, the slope of the decay of the frequency Of the decay of the frequency will go like minus five-thirds. And what we see here, if it was a 2D problem, it would be minus three. And what we see here for the SQG system, it's like it starts a little bit like a three-dimensional problem. And then for high-frequency, it has the behavior of a two-dimensional problem. So it's really a problem that is in between. It's not a 2D problem, it's not a 3D problem. Problem, it's not a 3D problem, it's something in between, which I found quite interesting. Anyway, so to conclude this talk, I had to rush a little bit at the end. So the message here is that if you want to do fractional diffusion, there's a very nice representation at least for the spectral for the solution, which is the Dunford-Taylor representation or the Ballacusian formula. And it's very nice, I think, because it's easy to approach. I think because it's easy to approximate, you just need to apply a simple quadrature in the y variable and then solve a bunch of elliptic problems, which again, you can do it easily these days. It extends, and I presented for the Laplacian only, but as I said, it extends to any elliptic and even sectorial operators, operators on surfaces, on manifold. It extends to the integral Laplacian, and we apply. And we apply it to the SQG equation and also to the electroweak convection and the American option pricing. These are the references I gave at the beginning. Okay, so these are just a few references of a work that I didn't put during the talk. And there are three references that I didn't mention during the talk. These are three reviews that appeared talking about different Talking about different fractional operators and how to approximate. With this, I thank you for your attention.
