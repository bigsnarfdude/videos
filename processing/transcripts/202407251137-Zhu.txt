 Wait, if I send it, it's gonna be on this laptop? Oh, maybe it's also you can start the plot. Okay, yeah. Okay, perfect. Our next speaker is saying because I don't use him. Okay, I'll just start. Okay, thank you very much for this opportunity. I'm a PhD student at McGill in quantitative life sciences, and it's my great pleasure to be here. And just to show of hands, how many people. And just a show of hands, how many people have heard of proteum-wide Mendelian amazation? Just a show of hands. Okay, okay, so more than half. That's great. So I'll just jump into it. So the human blood proteome, why do we care about the blood proteome? Essentially, proteins are the vector molecules in many biological processes. And they're important drug targets because most of them are really accessible. Their circulating proteins are in the blood, and they're really. Proteins are in the blood and they're available as druggable targets. And combined with genomic evidence, proteomics and genomics together, studies have shown that this increases the success rate of these drugs undergoing clinical trials. So recently there have been two major studies kind of doing this proteome-genome-wide approach for proteins. In 2020, Nature Genetics, Zheng, assessed an older protein. Assessed an older proteomics cohort where they looked at proteins to the phenome. And what they found was they found 111 putatively causal effects. But in 2022, so essentially in 2020, this was just in European ancestries. So in 2022, GBMI, they worked on a paper where they also did proteome-wide endium randomization, but they only looked at eight disease outcomes. However, they had Outcomes. However, they had African and European ancestries. And here they found 45 European putatively causal protein phenotype pairs in Europeans and 7 in Africans. So there are actually current unmet needs for proteome phenome-wide MR studies. For Europeans, for example, the last study was from 2022, so we need a more comprehensive, up-to-date proteome phenome-wide kind of atlas, whereas in African ancestries, Whereas in African ancestries, we have PQTLs available. So we have a few cohorts that are listed here with PQTLs available as exposures or PQTLs available to test these proteins. But we have a limited number of outcomes. As we know, a lot of GWAS and Africans aren't as accessible. TBGAP, for example. And then East Asian ancestries, we have a lack of publicly available PQTLs at the moment, whereas we have outcomes available. Whereas we have outcomes available. So we have Biobank Japan, we have Taiwan Biobank. And the reason we care about multi-ancestry analyses is because if we leverage the differences in genetic architecture between these ancestries, we may be able to use, for example, minor allele frequency differences, the number of genetic variants, and also magnitudes of effect sizes to essentially try and instrument more proteins and find more protein disease fits. Does these fits? So, what we want to do is, we, in this talk, what I'm showing you is our study where we're trying to create this comprehensive atlas of protein-queotype associations. So, what did we do? We took three ancestries, seven total proteomic scoroids in European and African occupations, and we wanted to assess the entire phenome for each of these ancestries and try and create this kind of avarice protein disease associations. Associations. So, here are the seven pro-Yamis cohorts that we're using from three ancestries. So, in Europeans, we have four cohorts. I think some of you know the Biobank, UKB, Biobank cohort, Decode, and FLED, which all came out around 2021. And in Africans, we have the ERIC. We're using the ERIC study and the UKB. And in East Asians, this is really the novelty here. We have this, so right now, they're not really. So, right now, there are not really any PPTLs available for East Asians. China Kodori has pre-printed a study, but that data isn't accessible. Whereas here, we have data from Kyolu University. They have this cohort they let us use where they're measuring almost 5,000 proteins, 1,800 individuals. And from these seven cohorts, only the UKB is measured on the O-Wink platform, whereas all the other ones are measured in SUMOLAGIN. And so Sumo Logic measures around. And so, Sumologic measures around 5,000 proteins on the V4 platform. OLINC measures 3,000 proteins. So, to kind of run our MR study, we need sysputls. We're working with sysputls. We don't need sysputls. But essentially, I think most people are familiar with the sys PBTL. But here we're defining a 500 kilobase region within the protein-coding genes transcription start site. And the reason we care about this is because, as previous talks have. Because, as previous talks have discussed, we want to mitigate horizontal power. So, one more thing: we don't just use cis PPTLs here, we're actually looking at what we term strict cis PBTLs. And what this means is we're actually trying to mitigate horizontal plyotropy, because you can imagine in a scenario here where we have this cis-PDTL in blue, but it's actually also a cis-PDTL for another protein protein in green. And what we do is in our study. And what we do is in our study, we're actually not using this variant as an instrument because we're worried about horizontal biotropy. So we would remove this cis PPTL. And so essentially what we're using are only cis PPTLs that are cis for a single protein coding gene. So this is kind of a strict definition as one term. And we also add on another layer to try and mitigate horizontal clotropy. Essentially, we're using Open Targets, the Open Targets platform. The Open Targets platform, they have this variant-to-gene score where for each variant you can search on this platform and they aggregate kind of evidence from four different data types. So you have different XQTLs, web promoter, capture high CF and so-called like VET predictions. You also have distance to the transcription star site. And what they do is they aggregate this information and they try and assign variance to genes. And so what we do is, here's an example. And so, what we do is: here's an example. Here's a variant for the sauce gene. And if you query this, it's a bit hard to see. This variant is the, if you search this variant up, the top data is saucy. But if this variant was a top data for another gene, for example, MST1, we wouldn't consider this variant. So we're essentially applying this really stringent criteria to try and ensure that we're not at risk of horizontal biotrophy. The horizontal biotrophy. And so let me show you some of the results that we have. So we have three different ancestries, European, African, East Asians, and here I'm showing you the instrumentable proteins that we have. So in Europeans, we're able to instrument around over 2,100 proteins across four cohorts. Africans, 1,100, and East Asians, we're instrumenting around almost 600. And what's really interesting is that if you look at the 119 in green, these are actually. 19 in green. These are actually proteins that are instrumentable specifically in Africans. So they're not instrumentable in East Asians nor Europeans. And when we looked at the variants that these proteins were instrumented by, we saw we basically plotted allele frequency of the minor allele in Africans versus the non-finished European allele frequency. And what we see is that most of these variants that are instrumenting these proteins specifically in Africans are actually rare in Europeans. Europeans. We do the same for East Asians and we find the exact same thing. So, of these 17 proteins that were able to instrument specifically in East Asians, most of the variants are rare in Europeans. And of these 19 that are common to East Asians and Africans, they're rare in Europeans as well. So, this really kind of highlights the power of multi-ancestry inclusion because we're able to instrument these additional proteins that we wouldn't have been able to find if we just were. We wouldn't have been able to find if we just worked with your fields. European hand species. And so, yeah, we have our proteins. Now we want to look at the outcomes. What are we testing? So we try to curate the largest group of outcomes. So we did a phenome-wide approach. And we didn't actually just go to GWAS catalog and download this. For Europeans, we try to get the largest GWAS available. So this was really a manual curation. We just Googled any disease we thought of, and we tried to get. Thought of, and we tried to get the GWAS summary stats downloaded and then format everything. So, this took a few months. It was quite a bit of work. And then, Africans, we did the same, but a lot of the GWAS was behind DB GAP, so we weren't able to really get those. So, that's why we only have 26 GWAS for Africans. And then, East Asians, we really leverage the BioBrain. So, BioBrain Japan has all the summary stats available, so we just downloaded all of them. And here we have a group of 300. We have a group of 355 phenotypes and essentially 24 phenotype categories as we see. And so, what did we do? We did Mendelian randomization and colloquialization analyses. Here I'm just showing some sensitivity tests that we ran. So, we wanted to ensure no false positives and try and mitigate that risk. And we also do co-localization with two methods, two of the newer methods, PWCo-Crow that was introduced in 2020, and then SharePro, which was recently published. Which was recently published in 2024 in bioinformatics, which one mean here will discuss this after. And here's a summary of what we found. So overall, we found almost a million protein disease hits. But as we know, we don't know if these are false positives or not. So we went through our FDR p-value correction, sensitivity analysis, co-localization analysis, and we Localization analysis, and we arrived at our final numbers. And here we're counting unique protein phenotype pairs because, as you remember, we had four cohorts in Europeans. And so, what we're essentially finding here is almost 4,000 protein-phenotype putatively causal associations, 55 in Africans, through 25 in East Asians. So, that really increases the number that was previously known from Zang's Nature Tonight's paper, which was only 111. Which was only 111 in Europeans, and the SHAO paper in 2022, which only found 45 in Europeans. So some of our key findings, we found that 459 of these proteins were unique to European ancestors, and they accounted for almost 2,500 of the period that we causal protein phenotype pairs. And 10 protein phenotype pairs were really from these ancestry-specific proteins to the Africans. Proteins to the applicants. 69 of the pairs were specific to were based on proteins instrumentable by East Asians only. And we also found a lot of proteins that are pleiotropic. Pleiotropic in the sense that they are associated with many different outcomes. 49, 5, and 58 were some of the proteins that had the most outcomes they were associated with in each ancestry. And of 62 unique protein phenotype pairs that are common between all three ancestries. All three ancestries, we found the majority had concordant effects across ancestries, which is also what we expect. And so we had a lot of associations. We try to kind of digest this. So we worked with Adrian Vandergraaff from Zolting Cuthilloid's group in Bausan, and he helped us create this kind of protein network plot. But here we're actually only showing cardiovascular outcomes. And as you can see, it's not really readable. There's a lot going on. It's not really readable. There's a lot going on, so I'm not going to try and go into this. But we try to make this accessible to everyone. So we collaborated with Jason Flanick from the Broad Institute, and he's kindly agreed to help us host all these protein disease associations on the Common Metablog Disease Knowledge Portal. But it's not on yet, so if you search, you're not going to find it right now. But we're in the process of putting it on there. And so, which of these printing field type associations are druggable? That's really what we care about. Associations are druggable. That's really what we care about, right? We want to find druggable targets. And essentially, we incorporated three druggability databases. The druggable genome from Vinnen in 2017, they have a list of 4,500 kind of genes and they classify them into three different tiers of druggility, where tier one is essentially these proteins that already have existing drugs. Drug Bank, which has proteins or targets and also their affiliated drugs. Affiliated drugs, Open Targets Genetics, which has kind of these protein-drug disease triplets, where they have clinical trial and phase and status information, trial information. And since there are a lot of hits, and I wanted to keep it simple, here I'm just showing East Asian ancestry cardiovascular proteins. And there's a lot going on in this figure, but essentially, we subset it to Tier 1 and Tier 2 drugable candidates. And tier two druggable candidates, where tier one are basically these targets that already have existing drugs available. And we looked at cardiovascular outcomes in green, in red, anthropometry traits, and biomarker traits in blue. And we have some nice positive controls. For example, ALDH2 on row 2. We see that this is associated with so many different outcomes and fesions. We also see, for example, PCSK9 on row 4, where it's associated with. Row 4, where it's associated with low, it's increased PCSK9 is associated with increased LDL cholesterol. And we also, of course, we care about the novel findings. So something, for example, MAMBA, we're still sifting through this, but MAMBA on the last row here is it's actually known to be associated with CKD. But here we're finding a hit with myocardial infarction, where increased MAMBA also increases risk of myocardial infarction. A myocardial infarction. And as you can see from the druggability analysis, it's a tier two druggable target, but there is no available drug for this at the moment. So kind of a summary since I'm getting close to time. So essentially, we performed the largest, most comprehensive multi-ancestry proteome phenomenoid MR study to date. We leveraged seven proteomics cohorts across three ancestries, and the East Asian cohort is a novel cohort that. East Asian cohort is a novel cohort that hasn't been published yet. And we manually curated the most recent largest VMTB GWAS for European and Africans. I don't put it here, but we also try to implement mitigate risk of horizontal plow trophy by implementing the strict variant score for the instruments. And we identified over 4,000 associations for Europeans, 55 in Africans, 325 in East Asians. 25 in East Asians. And we assess the drug ability of these targets. And some of them potentially could be repurposed. Some of them could be new targets. And we're actually doing a second project where we're doing some drug target hunting where we're actually going into the thousands of associations and trying to find something. So all our results will be available, but they're not available yet. So just a disclaimer. And just some final thoughts. If we want to increase the power to detect these associations while lowering the false positive rate, their future. False positive rate. There are a few things we need to do. We need to measure more proteins. So the proteome encompasses almost over 20,000 protein-protein genes. Whereas right now, the maximum we can measure is 11K and SOMASTAN, and I believe 7K in OLI, 55K or 7K. And we need diverse cohorts, so like what we're doing here, we're leveraging the speciation cohort. We need larger sample sizes as well, since we're moving towards biobank analyses now. We need better methods and We need better methods, and we want to look at a broader range of diseases. So, as more and more GWAS come out, hopefully, we can encompass more and more diseases. So, with that, I'd like to thank all my mentors, so Satoshi, Yoshiji, Tian Ren, Siri, and Minsinusra, and Mikhail, who really mentored me during this project, and my master's supervisors, Bern Richards and Joel Pinot, who really motivated me and kind of pushed me into this genetics field, and then some of Into this genetics field, and then some of the colleagues from and some of the five. Thank you. Well, one quick and one maybe not so bad question. So you had said druggability E-station sample, something like that. You're not arguing that these are only druggable targets. No, no, no. No, no, no. I was just showing the decision. Sail the H2, yeah. We know the mechanism why it's related to all kinds of only instruments. We're using this more as like kind of discovery instead of neglecting, we're saying like this isn't found here, so it's not wasn't there with this. And then you did, I do appreciate all the work that went into Googling these G17. Are you making notes available today? Making the GWAS available? They're all publicly available, I'm assuming. Yeah, they're available. We have all of them, but I have to talk to some of the higher apps if we want to release those. But yeah, what do people think? Should we release that? I don't know. We need to spend another, say, five months to fill it. Yeah, it took. Yeah. Yeah. Even like a Google spreadsheet of like, here's the curation and hardware latest. Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll put that in the supplementary table when we're talking about it. Yes, that would be good. But also, that wouldn't work like a harmful. Yeah, you've got to match to the switch. Yeah, we did all of that, like lifting, formatting columns. I was sort of a politic question. You use the term Africans a lot. I wasn't sure if you meant Africans. Oh. Because did you ask the Africans? Oh, because the Jewish are necessarily mostly in African Americans, not Africans. Yeah, that's a lot of European ancestry and African Americans. So I just want to make sure how you wish you were. Yeah, that's a good point. So the ERIC cohort is African Americans, UKB. I mean, not for the UK. Yeah, but the GWAS are a bit heterogeneous. So some are like Caribbean, some are African-American. Well, all those groups are European ancestry as well as African ancestry. So European ancestors. So European variants, whatever, you're European specific lives are going to be true of African Americans as well. Just not sure exactly. The East Asians probably don't add some other things. Yeah, they're all so far. So just follow up with it. How did you deal with your stage one millennial organization? When you plan to PQDL, basically you have those two groups, you know, African British and African Americans. You have their corresponding, I guess, data, right? I guess data, right? How do you combine them? What do you mean by combining them? Because you only have a result for African, right? Yeah. Okay, when you said they're African specific, I think that's right, because regarding Florida African Americans, you're not going to find other ones. But in European Americans, you might be specific to Africans. Because they're going to be showing up in African Americans also. But even for Edward, you have Erica data and you have Euclid Bank, right? You have course money voting make the data, right? Protein-mega data, right? Yeah. So you have corresponding PQTLs. You have to combine them, right? Yeah, exactly. We didn't combine them, so we didn't do any meta-analysis. We ran all of them single color at a time, and then we aggregated the results, and we looked at which ones are kind of in the same direction. So to the alpha mineral analyzation, so you combine whatever is opposite parameter estimate? We didn't combine them, we just kept them. As in no further analysis was done. So we have, for example, a table with the error. Example: a table with the error cohort, the UPB cohort, and then the common kind of code's outcome. So, you want both to be significant, so it is significant. We didn't require that because, for example, UKB is measured on OLIN, whereas ERIC is measured on somus cancer. There's some different proteins that they both measure, so we use everything together as desserts. And of course, some of the proteins overlap, so some outcomes are gonna protein outcomes are the same. At least one significant. Yeah. One practice in giving it. So, if I understood correctly, that means that you could have made your beautiful Venn diagrams cohort by cohort. Yeah, I have that as well. Yeah, and from the ethic, yeah, right. From the ethics point of view, that would be a better thing code. Yeah. Because, yeah, you're just like this classical thing of essentializing these biological groups which don't exist in reality, whereas showing them as the Whereas showing them as the cohorts, then you can clearly explain the ways in which they're different. And you can also maybe spot some interesting things about things which are not it are incompetent, aren't in common between the cohorts. That's a great catch, and we actually did do that. And the way I wrote the paper, I did it that way, and then it got so complicated, we had to switch to just ancestry-level findings because with seven cohorts here, and then you're also talking ancestry-level, it's like cohort-level ancestry level. Core level, ancestry level, kind of harder to read. But we have all those triggers in the supplements. Just a comment about your 500 KD window when transcription starts. I think the largest human gene is 2.1 megabases. So in that case, you're not even going to go out of the coding sequence. Now I want to think in future about a more adaptive approach based upon the end of the longest transcript. The longest transcripts right now. That's a good point. That's a good point. So, in the literature, some people are doing 500 KB, some people are doing one megabase. And actually, these seven cohorts, aside from the Kyoto cohort, some of them are one megabase, some are 500. So we had to essentially define our own syspls by doing the clumping and finding the depending variants ourselves. Instead of just taking like publicly available from the supplementary table. So that's the distance from the transcripts. That's the distance from the transcription to start the second as opposed to the length of the genome. Thank you. We still have a 50 minutes, so we should go to the next session for discussion. Thank you very much. We can discuss all the contracts in this morning. So if you have questions, you can. Or you can have a question that can ask for our speakers. Yeah, I have a very big picture question in light of, I felt like most of this morning's speakers have said these really beautiful, increasingly complex models. And I just can't help but wonder like the the trajectory that the field is going and whether we've got the wrong research questions and need to. Questions and need to adapt. And another way to put it would be like 10 years into the future, wherever we've got back to where maybe the research paradigm has shifted a bit. Like, what are the ways that it needs to shift in order to have the impact that we're hoping to have? Because it seems like eventually these models are going to get so complex that there's no data that we could ever hope to have that would ever answer the questions that we're asking. Comments at all? Well, I mean, I appreciate always asking the question, why are we doing this anyway? But I will hazard one guess, and I think actually the last thought was a good example of this, is we're trying to understand biology better, and some that's going to involve some involved
