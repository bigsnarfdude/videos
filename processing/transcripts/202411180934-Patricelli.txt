and the presentation is on behalf of the CTA Consortium. So let me start with a really brief introduction. All of you already know that on August 17, 2017 we saw the birth of multi-messenger Sun with gravitational waves and in this date Advanced El LARG and Advanced Elbior made their first observation of a binary neutral sun spiral, GW170817. And in association with this event we saw many electromagnetic counterparts Many electromagnetic counterparts that are summarized here in this image on the left of the slides. So, first of all, in the pink box, we have the coincident short gamma ray burst that has been detected in gamma rays by integral and Fermi, and this observation represents the first direct evidence that at least some binary mutual cells are progenitors of short gamma ray bursts. Now we add the detection here of an optical infrared ultraviolet counterpart identified in the OS galaxy NGC forty nine ninety three. NDC 4993. And thanks to spectroscopical observations, we were able to identify this source as a kilonova. So this was the first clear spectroscopic identification of a kilonova and the first observation of a kilonova in association with a binary submerger. And finally, we also observed an X-2A and Rodeo counterparts. And thanks to the long-term monitoring of this emission, we were able to understand that this emission was consistent with the aftergreen emission. Consistent with the afterglow emission from the gamma ray bursts, but for the first time we had evidence that the radiation coming from gamma-ray bursts come actually from a jet that is not a uniform jet but a structural jet. So it was a really really important discovery. So what's missing in this very beautiful scenario? We didn't detect any significant emission at high energies and very high energies. Well for high energies I mean energies about 100 MB and very high energies I intend energies about 100. Energy scientist energy cable 100 GB. So, what happened in these energy bands? So, for high energies, we had Fermilat that unfortunately was centering the South Atlantic anomaly at the time of the gravitational wave trigger, so it was not observing the sky region of GW170817 at the time. It was off, not taking data. But later on, it started to observe this gravitational wave sky region, but unfortunately, no electromagnetic counterpart was detected at this later time. About what was detected at this later time. And what about ovarian energies? We have two different observatories performing an electromagnetic follow-up campaign. We had the HAS telescopes that are located in Namibia and the MAGIC telescopes located in Ela Parma in Canarian Island. So HESS was able to perform both the prompt and long-term electromagnetic follow-up campaign, but they didn't detect any significant barrier energy emission during this campaign. For magic, magic suffers. For MAGIC, MAGIC started the observational follow-up campaign later on, let's say in January 2018. And here, in this plot on the left, you can see here we have the X-ray radio light of the afterglow emission of GRP17017A, and these pink vertical bars represent the night during which we were able to observe the sky localization area with our magic telescopes. So we performed the observations for a total amount of time. Observations for a total amount of about 10 hours in 10 different nights from January to June 2018, but we didn't detect any significant very high energy counterfactual. And we were only able to put an upper limit that is shown here with this black arrow. And for comparison, I'm showing you here with this red region the predictions for very high energy emission coming from synchrotron self-contromptor radiation. And this prediction has been. And this prediction has been done, taking into account the fact that we have a structured jet with the parameters that have been constrained thanks to the observation of Gerby 17017A. And we also took into account these data that are data taken at other wavelengths. So basically with the current instruments such as Magic and S, we are not sensitive enough to put constraints on models like this one. So we need more efficient instruments. More efficient instruments to be able to say something more in case we had another detection like this one. But the question is: do gamma-ray bursts have such very high energy emission or not? Well, we performed searches for very high energy emission associated with gamma-ray bursts for decades, but only from 2019 our detectors started to observe gamma-ray bursts at these very high energies. And here in this box, you can find the list of gamma ray bursts that have been detected. List of gamma ray bursts that have been detected so far. So, in the first ballot, you can see these are the four gamma ray bursts observed by the magic telescopes. And among them, I wanted to highlight the second one in green. This is GRB 160821B, because among all the gamma-ray bursts detected at very high energies, this is the only short gamma-ray burst observed so far. Then we add another couple of gamma-ray bursts detected by us, and finally, we add these gamma-ray bursts. And finally, we added this gamma reverse. This is actually a very famous gamma reverse, 2210 Zional name. It is also known as the Volt, the brightest of all time, because it's very huge, energetic, of the order of 10 to the 55 varieties. And for this specific gamma ray burst, we have a very high energy detection with the LAS observatory, that is a very huge observatory located in China. So, thanks to these observations, now we know that gamma ray bursts can have this very high energy mission. Can have this very high energy emission, but there are still many, many open questions, such as which are the specific conditions that are required to produce this very high energy emission, and how common are they? And then, do binary mutocell and mutocellocol mergers can have such a very high energy counterpart? And here's this variety energy emission depending on the progenitor system, which can be a binary merger or a coccolaps massive cell. And finally, how does this variable energy? Finally, how does this very high energy emission depend on the environment of the source? So, we have all these open questions and much more, and to answer to these questions, we need, of course, to have much more detections. And in this sense, I think that we can take advantage of joint gravitational wave and very high energy gamma-ray observations. Because, from one side, the search for gamma-ray versus very high-energies can take advantage of gravitational wave alerts because our gravitational wave detectors are. Our gravitational wave detectors are, first of all, sky observatories, but for the current generation of detectors, we observe the sky basically through low ratios, which means that if we have an associated very high energy gamma radiation, it will be not severely attenuated by the extragalactic background light. And at the same time, the search for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational rays can take advantage of very high energy detectors because the gamma-ray sky is less The gamma-ray sky is less crowded with respect, for instance, to the optical sky, as Michael already shown in his talk. So, if we have a candidate counterpart, it would be easier to make a clearer association between the transient event and the gravitational wave event. So, in the future, if we have a joint gravitational wave and very high-energy gamma-ray detection, this could allow us to prove that binary neutral sub-neutosa converges, and possibly, why not? And possibly, why not even binary global mergers can have such very high energy gamma counterparts and could allow us to better investigate how this very high-energy emission depends on the progenitor system and its environment. So, let's hope in the future to have this kind of joint observations and possible detection. So, let's have a look into the future. So, this is the LIGO of Yoga Cargo observing plants. So, here you can see in this plot the timeline and the sensitivity over. Timeline and the sensitivity over the tactos, and each colour marks a different observing round. So, as all of you already know, we are now in the first observing RAM. We are in the second part of 4B that is currently ongoing and will run until June 2025. Then we will have a couple of years of break here, and finally, we will have the first observing run of five, which will see our detectors working with a very high very high sensitivity. By very high sensitivity. For instance, the two LIBOD detectors are expected to operate with a sensitivity between 240 and 225 megaparsec. And an interesting thing is that the first observing round of five matches the timeline of the Charlencov Telescope Array Observatory. So what is CTAO? CTAR will be a ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very high energies. And CTAR will be composed by two arrays. Composed by two arrays. One will be located in the northern hemisphere in La Palma, so very close to the magic site. And the second one will be located in the southern hemisphere in Chile and Panoral. So the fact that we have two arrays will allow us to have quite full sky coverage. Then each array will be composed by a different combination of different size telescopes. We will have the large size, medium size, and small size telescopes, and all together these And all together, these instruments will allow us to cover an energy range between 100 GV to 300 TeV. So, actually, with these observatories, we will have a quite wide energy coverage, wider than current experiments operating at very high energies. Why I believe that the CTAR will be a key instrument for the detection of very high energy counterfacts to gravitational wave events? Well, first of all, as I already mentioned, CTAR. First of all, as I already mentioned, CTAO will have a coincident observational schedule with O5. And then CTO will have a quite large field of view. So for instance, the large size telescopes will have a field of view of 4.3 degrees. And it will be able to operate in survey mode, which means that we will be able to scan large portions of the sky with all our telescopes. And these two points are, of course, very important if we think that gravitational wave events are not always. Wave events are not always well localized. So, in the majority of the case, we will need to scan very large portions of the sky. Then, the CTAO will have a quite rapid response. So, for instance, this viewing time of our LST telescopes will be less than 30 seconds. So, we are able to move these telescopes in a very fast way. And finally, CTAR will have a very, very high sensitivity. So, in this plot on the right, you can see this is the differential sensitivity as a function of. Sensitivity as a function of this portion of time. So, in blue, we have the expected sensitivity of CTAO for the northern side, and in green, the sensitivity of Fermilat. And each line refers to a different energy from 25 GB to 250 Gb. So, as you can see, independently on the exposure time, CTAO will be orders of magnitude more sensitive than Fermi L. So, this is really, really promising because it means. Really promising because it means that possibly we will be able to detect also very faint sources. So, within the CTAO Consortium, we decided to investigate the capability of CTAR to detect very high-energy counterparts to gravitational waves, and we decided to study different observational strategies in order to optimize the probability of catching an electromagnetic counterpart if such a counterpart is there. And in order to perform this study, And in order to perform this study, we proceeded with several steps. So basically, we used the synthetic population binary neutron submergers, and we simulated both the gravitational wave emission and the associated short gamma reverse emission at very early energies. So I'm going to describe a bit the detail of the work now. So the first step, as I mentioned, is to have a synthetic population of binary neutral star mergers and their gravitational wave detection and skydiving. Gravitational wave detection and sky localization with our gravitational wave detectors. So, for this first step, we decided to use a public gravitational wave catalog of simulated binary mutual submergers, that is the one produced by Pertov and Michael and other people in 2022. So, basically, to produce these catalogs, they assume that binaries have an homogeneous and isotropic distribution in space. And they consider the gravitational wave detectors at the sensitivity that is expected. Sensitivity that is expected to be reached in phi. And then they consider two possible configurations for the gravitational wave detector network. The first configuration is called O5, and here basically they include in the network only the two LIGO detectors in the United States, Virgo and CADA. Then they considered a second configuration that is called O6, in which they added to the network, also like OINDIA. And here I'm showing you just an example. Here, I'm showing you just an example of the gravitational wave sky localization from one of these simulated events. And this sky localization has been obtained with the BIASA, that, as you know, is one of the official LIGO New Kaka pipeline to produce low-latency gravitational wave skylaps. And all this data, this catalog, are publicly available in Zenodo. So, this was the first step. We have catalogues of pyramidal cell merging systems, and we have the associated gravitational wave emission and detection. And detection. The next step is to simulate the associated very high energy gamma rail emission. So we needed to do several assumptions. So we started with a very optimistic assumption, which means that we assume that all the binary nutritional cell mergers have an associated short gamma reverse, and then each of these short gamma reverse also have a very high energy emission. And then to simulate this barrier energy emission, we use a phenomenon local approach. So first of all, Approach. So, first of all, we assume that the relativistic jet from which the gamma-ray burst emission came from is a structured Gaussian jet, as we understood from GRB 170817A. So, here we have just a schematization of our jet. So, basically, we have a uniform core with opening angle theta core, and this uniform core is surrounded by a lateral structure in which we have a decrease in the radiated luminosity by increasing. Radiated luminosity by increasing the angular distance from the jet axis. So, of course, we need to associate to each gamma reverse an opening angle for the uniform core and also a viewing angle to understand if we are looking inside the uniform core or if we are looking inside this literal structure. So, for the core opening angle, we associate to each short gamma ray burst an angle that is extracted randomly from the distribution that has been inferred from short gamma rays. That has been inferred from short-grammary burst observation. And the viewing angle is basically given by the orbital inclination of our binary systems. And then the emission that you received by an observer depends on the viewing angle, of course, and this dependence has been estimated following the prescriptions by Lambda Kobayashi in 2017 and Samuelson 2003. Then another key parameters to simulate the gamma reverse emission is the I. The gamma reverse emission is the isotropic energies, which is basically the total energy that is emitted during the prompt phase, the initial flush of gamma rays. And for the isotropic energy, we randomly extracted it from the distribution that has been inferred from short gamma ray burst observations. So, just to have an idea of the parameter of space that we explored here in this plot, we have the isotropic energy as a function of the jet opening angle for all the gamma rivers associated with. Gamma reverse associated with the binary mutosome mergers for the O5 card along. So now that we have all these ingredients, we have to simulate the light curve and the spectrum of our gamma radius. So for the light curve, we model it, taking into account that the temporal decay at very high energies is very similar to the one that we observe in soft X-rays. And then for this spectrum, we assume that it is well described by a power law with a photon index extracted. With a photon index extracted from a Gaussian distribution centered on MUS 2.2. And we chose this value because this is the best fit value that we found for GLB 19014C that so far is the gamma reverse with the best spectral data at very high energies. So given all these ingredients, we were able to simulate a population of gamma ribbons associated with our binary submerger. So the last step is of course to verify if Is of course to verify if we are able to detect these sources with the CTLO. And this, of course, depends very much on the observational strategy that we want to put in place. So let me present you first of all the more generational. Okay, so when we have an electromagnetic transient, typically what happens is that the starting of the electromagnetic follow-up observations of the transient source typically doesn't coincide with the onset of the gamma-ray versus emission. The onset of the gamma ray burst emission. And this depends on many factors. So, for instance, there is a latency needed to send the gravitational wave alerts to the zone that is typically over a few minutes. Then, we have to take into account the fact that we have to move our telescopes into the correct direction of the sky. And these take us a few tens of seconds. So, for instance, as I mentioned before, the zeroing time of the LSTs is on the order of 30 seconds. And then we also have to take into account the uncertainty in the To take into account the uncertainty in the sky localization of the gravitational wave event. Because, for instance, if you look at this cartoon, this is an hypothetical gravitational wave sky map. So, all these circles are all different pointings that we expect to perform with CTAO. So, these are all different sky regions. So, let's assume that we start from here, then we go here, here, here, and then the pink circle represents the sky region in which the soul sees. In which the source is. Of course, we arrive to observe this specific sky region late with respect to the first point. This adds additional latency between the onset of the gamma reverse emission and the starting of the observation of the correct regions of the sky. So as a consequence of this, what happens is that the exposure time that is needed to detect our source, of course, vary depending on the gamma-reversal luminosity and depending on this latency. So, as I first said, Latency. So, as a first step, we decided to estimate the percentage of gamma reverses that can be detected by CTO considering different possible values for this latency T0 and different possible exposure times. And now we estimated these exposure times. So, if you look at this plot here, this blue line represents a simulated gamma reverse like. So, here we have the flux and here we have the time. So, we consider different possible values of Tz. Possible values of T0. So here I have just an example of T0 of a few hundredths of seconds. So this red arrow represents the time delay between the onset of the gamma reverse emission and the starting of the observations of the correct region of the sky. Oh, I think that at the point where it's not working anymore. Okay, anyway. So starting from this T0, we start to integrate our LICO over the exposure time and we stop our integration. And we stop our integration when the exposure time allows us to have a fluence that is equal to the minimum detectable fluence by CTAO at a five-signal level. So we did this procedure for all the gamma reverses in our sample and these are some preliminary results that we got. So in this plot, it's working again. So in this plot, we have on the y-axis the exposure time needed to make a phi sigma data. Needed to make a phi sigma detection for a given latency time T0. And the column bar represents the percentage of gamma reverse that we are able to detect, with the lighter columns that represents the higher percentages. So these two plots refer the one on the left to on-axis gamma reverse, which means gamma reverse from which the viewing angle is less than the opening angle of the uniform core. So we are looking inside the uniform core. We are looking inside the uniform hole of the relativistic jet. The plot on the right we first said to the case of axis gamma reverse, so cases in which the viewing angle is greater than the whole opening angle. And both the distributors refer to the CTA north and array. So just to give you some numbers, what we found is that, for instance, if we assume a very optimistic value for T0 of the order of only 30 seconds, with CTAR, we will be. With CTAR, we will be able to detect 80% of the anoxis gamma ribbons and 13% of the opharxis gamma ribbons with an exposure time that is very short, of only 5 minutes. If we increase T0 to 10 minutes, we still have a very high percentage of detected events. In fact, we will be able to detect about 70% of the unoxis gamma ribbons and 14% of the ophaxis gamma ribbons with very reasonable exposure times of only 10 minutes. Exposure times of only 10 minutes. So, these numbers are telling us that CDRO will be a very promising instrument because it will possibly be able to detect almost all the on-axis gamma ray bursts and some percentage of off-axis gamma ray bursts. So, these two plots are for the northern side, but we found very similar performances also for the southern array. So, these are basically the same plots that I showed you previously, but these have been obtained with the sensitivity. But these have been obtained with the sensitivity expected for the CTA saturn array. So, for instance, you can see that for a TZ of the order of 10 minus, also with this array, we will be able to detect about 70% of the unaxis gamma reverse and about 14% of axis gamma reverses. So, these are really, really promising numbers. So, what I show you so far is just a general picture of what we will be able to do with CTER, but now we have to face All, but now we have to face with the real observations. We have to find which is the best observational strategies in order to get this very high percentage of detections. So, we worked to set up an electromagnetic follow-up observation scheduler, which basically is a pipeline that determines the visibility windows and computes the most favorable sky coordinates for our observations. And the optimization of the observations currently. Of the observations currently are based on several steps that are listed here. So, first of all, of course, we add that the sequential order of our observations, of our pointings, takes into account the contained gravitational wave source sky position probability. So, we start from the highest to the lowest because we want to observe first the regions in which the probability associated with the gravitational wave event is higher. Then we favor the loads and it envelops. We favored low zenith angle observations because we wanted to achieve lower accurate thresholds for our observations. Then, for each observation, we estimated the optimal exposure times with the strategy that I showed you before. And in estimating this exposure time, we also took into account the evolution of the zenith angle of our source. And finally, we also take into account the visibility condition. For instance, if we are in darkness condition or in moonlight and so on. Moonlight, and so on. We take into account all these things. So, the output of our scheduler is a set of pointings that we should perform with CTAO, and for each pointing, we will have also an associated optimal exposure time that should guarantee to detect the source if the source is there. So, just as an example, I'm showing you the full chain of electromagnetic follow-up simulations for one binary Newton cell merger. So, we selected one source. So we selected one source whose associated gamma ray burst is an an axis gamma ray burst with an isotropic energy of the order of 10 to the 50 hertz. Then we considered an initial T0, an initial latency of 220 seconds that basically accounts for three minutes to send the gravitational wave alert to the astronomical community plus 30 seconds for the first viewing of our telescopes. Then we also consider an inter-schooling of 20 seconds. An intense viewing of 20 seconds, which basically is the time needed to move our telescope from the first pointing to the second, to the third, and so on. And we apply our scale to this event. So, if you look at the plot here on the left, we have the gravitational wave sky localization of the event. So, this is a very optimistic case in which the 90% credible region was of only 40 square degrees. So, in the center panel, you can see these are the Panel, you can see these are the four pointings that are scheduled with our scheduler. So each of these circles represents an observation performed with CTAR. And here we have this blue star represents the two positions of the source. And for each of these pointing, we have an associated exposure time that is shown here in this plot on the right of the slides. So here we have this black solid line is the simulated light curve of these events, and the vertical orange bars. And the vertical orange bars represent the exposure times associated with each of these observations. And what we found analyzing our simulations is that with our scheduler, we had an observational strategy that actually allows us to detect the source in two pointings, in this one and in this one, with very reasonable exposure time. Because accordingly to our scheduler, it took us only two minutes to cover the Only two minutes to cover the whole sky localization area. So our scheduler seems to work. It allows us to properly cover the sky localization area and also to detect the source. So this is just an example of one binary mutosomalgus, but of course we need to apply our scheduler to the whole sample of gamma reverse that we simulated. These are very, very preliminary results. So what we found applying the scheduler to all the Applying the scheduler to all the sample of simulated sources, is that with CTAO we will be able to follow up 80% of the total population of binary neutral cell mergers. And for about 50% of them, we will be able to cover the two locations of the source. The remaining percentage of the total population is not observed, for instance, because of the visibility condition, because the event happened during the day, and so on. Now, if we wanted to focus on the viewing angle of our To focus on the viewing angle of our gamma reverse, you can look at these two plots here. So, on the left, we have the histogram of the events as a function of the viewing angle. So, in orange, we have the population that is not observed, and in blue, we have the populations that we are able to observe with the spectrum. So, this histogram on the left refers to the unaxis gamma-revers, and the histogram on the right refers to the off-axis gamma-reverse. And what we found is that if we focus only Found is that if we focus only on the on-axis event, we will be able to follow up 18% of the total population, and for 10% of them, we will be able to cover the two locations of the source. If we focus on the off-axis gamma-rivers, of course, the numbers are a bit lower. We will be able to follow up only 7% of the events, and for 4% of them, we will be able to cover the two locations of the source. Now, these are very, very preliminary results, and the next. Very, very preliminary results, and the next step: we are still fixing some bugs in the code and so on. But the next step will be to combine this percentage to the gravitational wave detection rates so that we can get also the rate of possible multi-messenger detections. So, just to conclude, I presented a study on the capability of CTAO to detect very high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational wave events. And I hope that I convinced you that CTAO will be a key. That CTAO will be a key instrument to detect gamma reverse both from axis sources and off-axis sources. And I show you one of the possible observational strategy to follow up gravitational wave terms and events. And we have some future developments in mind. So, as I mentioned before, we want to perform a detailed estimate of the joint gravitational wave and gamma ray detection rates, but we are also working to investigate. We are also working to investigate other different possible observational strategies. So, for instance, one of the things that we are investigating is the divergent pointing, because as I mentioned at the beginning, CTA observatory will be composed by two arrays in which we have a large number of telescopes. So, a possibility is to point various sub-samples of telescopes in different regions of the sky so we can cover the sky localization in a faster way. And finally, we plan to extend. And finally, we plan to extend all this work also with the considering third-generational gravitational wave interferometers such as the Ansen telescopes. And that's all. Thank you. Thank you, Margaret.
