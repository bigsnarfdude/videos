Yeah, it's fine. My pleasure to announce the second speaker of the morning, Ganhi Cho, and he's going to speak on stochastic backward geometry. Please. I really appreciate this moment, especially I got really privileged to be part of the conference right now. So just in terms of if there are any questions. So this is the june work with the So this is the joint work with Jihan Young and I guess CCGS also. And this work is indeed trying to do something new as a postdoc. So still I'm really not satisfied with what I have done, but I really learned a lot and I try to share the procedure of this research and sharing the sort of failure and the some success. So I cannot make any further discussion after my talk, but I shall be after my finishing in the efforts. So if there are any like the So, if you have any comments or questions, so feel free to contact me by email. So, I'd like to start from some concrete examples in complex geometry. So, complex geometry plays with not only Riemannian geometry, but also archive geometry. So, that changes especially the end space from the Riemannian network. So, if we start from just the XQ, so we are happy while we know what this is. But as a complex network, But as a complex manifesto, we'd like to regard this as a CP1. So if S2 is homeorbic to P1, then it's very known that there's only one complex structure, so orbits they are as partial orbital as a complex framework. So that if I choose the homogeneous coordinate, the P1, then I can naturally find some value into the in a way that I can just take x squared with xy with y squared. And it turns out that this is the logical embedding and it actually preserves all necessary geometric data so that I can indeed regard S2, which is P1, as the initial disease. And if I use the homogeneous coordinate from this P2, say I need to calculate three components for P2, then you can realize that this is the same as the zero stat. Of y square minus xc. So that in the preference of the algebraic geometry, one wants to describe the space in terms of the polylinear equation. So if I give you one more example, say tori. So that tori is just nothing but, let me just use C1 instead of R2. So taking the portion by the X, which is isomorphic to just a C2. So in such a case, we know that it's just an Such a case, we know that home is just nothing but the same home to be just S1 cross S1 in some sense. So that as long as we are talking about the natural function in complex geometry, so there is no non-construct holomorphic function. So one need to look at, so for the notion of the heromorphic map, and there is a very non-map for the ion stress stress little kid function which has a Which has a following power series expansion, which should be written as 1 over z squared because summation is taken on the outside of the lattice and it is written as 1 over z minus 1 over 2 of the lattice. Then one should be able to show this function is meromorphic first of all, and this is doubly periodic that preserves the formula of the muscular structure of each S1 and S1. What restructure of each S1 and S1, and one can define in such a way also that embedding from P into P2 by using the white stress equation. So rather than I define this in P, let me first define this in C, so that for each C, I can simply just use, say, one with iStress Q function with the derivative. This matter. If C does not This matter. If C does not belong to the lattice, and if T belongs to the lattice, then I will simply just take the input. Then one can show that this map can be defined in this is the map into the prime, and this indeed becomes the embedding so that one can also investigate. Embedding so that one can also investigate the corresponding algebraic equation of the torite. So, if we start from the torite, this is isomorphic in any sense to the image, and this would be written as the zero set of so-called highest stress equation. So, it is written as xy squared minus x squared minus ax. And in terms of the homogeneous coordinate, I just need the corresponding power. So, this is a very known elliptic declation, or this is either Elliptic equation, or this is either terminal mysterious equation. So, the major difference with the future of Riemannian geometry compared to the compact geometry is that we like to use the ambient space instead of a declined space, not like the matches isometric embedding. We want to use the projective space as an ambient space because, in such a case, we should be able to describe the IRA equation of a given complex killer member. And it turns out that what I described was two bits, those two. Describe those two with this two example is actually really general. So if I start on the complex manpower and take the holomorphic line line bundle in order to describe the such functions or the holomorphic sections, then depending on the numbers of the independent holomorphic sections, then one should be also able to define the MATLAB locally via the local trivialization of the line model. And one can show that this does not depend on the local trivialization because we take the homogeneous. Adjustion because we take the homogeneous coordinate, and it turns out that there is a big theorem in complex strategy made by the diagram. So that one can show that we can define the embedding if and only if we just need to look at the first chunk class, and that should have a sign. So if I just change, for example, the line bundle by the either the determinant bundle or the canonical line bundle, then the corresponding first chunk class condition exactly coincide with the least curvature sign condition. The leech curvature sign condition. So, if there's some least curvature design condition, then we can describe such an embedding. So, it turns out that by using this embedding theorem, first any complex projective member that is defined as a closed summary of the CPN is nothing but RGRN, meaning that locally it's always written as a zero-set of polynomial members. So, this has a lot of the emphasis in algebraic geometry. But I'd like to do the differential geometry, so I'd like to put emphasis on the fact that this comes up with that particular career. And this constant definitely cannot, because if I have a projected manifold and we have a canonical metric here called by the Paulinsky metric, which is an Einstein, so it has a constant for Losexual curvature, then we can simply just take the proof back. Then, as well as we start from the Keller metric, then Keller is just a local property, so we can use the Keller metric. So, this is fair enough. But today, I wanted to emphasize one interesting factor. To emphasize one interesting fact in the differential per second. So, in fact, if I already have the embedding via this line bundle, then the perfect metric is not just the killer. This is actually called by the Vorgon metric. So, let me first introduce the definition of Vorgon metric, and let me share the intuition how to do it. And please let me know if you have any questions. So, this is the general framework to define the Borgo metric for the arbitrary complex manifold, but this is. Artificial complex manifold, but this is nothing but taking the abstraction from the bounded domain in C. So the intuition, and we will today only talk about the bounded domain in Cm. So that if I just note bounded domain by omega, so this is just bounded domain without any boundary mark here, then I can look at just the error state, really spectacular just the ligand measure. Then I will just Then I will just take because it's a boundary domain, there are lots of holomorphic functions which are non-constant, so that I will simply just take the intersection with the holomorphic functions. Then we start from the Huber space, so even if we take the intersection, still this is a close subspace of the Huber space, so still this becomes a Huber space with respect to anti-narcotic space. So then I assume this is separable, so that there is the post-linear basis. Let me throw this by SI from my crop over here. And I will denote my top this by H square of B on my house, so that I have all sorts of faces. So that one can define so far the Orman counter that takes a pair from the bounded domain. This is nothing, but a series of taking those Osera bases. And one need to take the R here. To take the R here. So, in terms of the Z component, this becomes holomorphic, and for the omega vertex, this becomes anti-folomorphic. And one can show that this is verified independent of the choice of those matrices. This is the Boreman corner, and this is a verified function. And one can simply define the Kayla metric that we will cover by the Borybond metric as nothing but I mtar of the log of V. We put in the same component. Component. So at least there's a non-zero function here. So if I choose the same component, this is always at least positive. So then the log of this Borgman coin is very defined. I take the complex S n, that will be defined as a Borgman metric. In the case of the bounded domain, and there's a general framework to define the Borgman metric on the complex manport, but this is just an arbitrary abstraction from here. So this is definitely sufficient for us to understand. So before I go further, I try to Before I go further, I'd like to address the important point that if I start from the projective manifold, then it ables to find the large dimensional complex projective ambient space so that if I just take the curveball, then it turns out that this is surprising that this is coincide as a workbank metric. So like the partial is algebraic geometry textbook. So usually people just know the perfect metric behaves as a calendar. Purdy metric behaves as a Keller metric, but this is actually more special. And all of the names of the Keller metric that you might already heard of is just nothing but special kind of a virgin metric. I should say concurrent metric, voidistinometric, all metrics are nothing but, except the Euclidean metric, those are all vertical metrics. So then one might ask order. So this case is the case of the compact bandwidth. And if I look at the boundary line, equivalence is not compact. So then one might ask, then is it possible to describe such an embedding? Possible to describe such an embedding in a way that if I take the result metric from here, I mean from this extrinsic geometric point of view, then can I also obtain the some character metric? And it turns out that I actually already proved this quite a long time ago, that let us start from the RH value. And I just need to make the numbers of the basis here to be infinitely many, or the projective many for this finish in the finite many times, but they are just infinitely many. But still, we can define the infinite. But still it can define the embedded exactly in the same way so that this now embeds two infinite imager projective space. I'm actually operating on getting the question that was the definition of the infinite measure projective space. So this is just a project variation of the human state, and still this is the infinite measure manifold. You might still wonder what's the definition of the infinite banana, and I will just give it a reference. I can explain these things for me. But anyhow, you might be able But anyhow, you might be able to believe that this CSR server influenced the network so that one can also define the Fourier study metric in some natural sense. Then, what he showed is that still the true bad of the Fourier metric can be realized as a borrow metric. So, this is some odd function. And from this framework, what he showed is that the key notion in complex strategy, you know, the curvature is of long-section correlation, that is always between negative integration plus 2. Possible. So, many reasonable classes of the boundary domain, usually the Borderland metric, has the curvature across the boundary as just a major sign, but this is the general effect from this framework. Because we know how to describe the Fogistic metric, then we should be able to write this one. So, let me give you just a complete example. So, if I look at the over model of the complex projection space, then you can just regard the inside of this model as the Bergman card. And stop working on curve. So, this is a concrete example. And you can actually show that this is the concrete or just the example. This is the concurrent metric that we curve. So, these are constant forms actually on curvature. It depends on the dimension. And the Bernard metric in this case is nothing but the concurrent metric. So that at least the framework today we discussed somehow covers the compact complex manpower and also the framework of non-compact complex manifold. So before going further, I also want to share some like the geometric intuition from the complex analysis that I already somehow shared this money. So we are familiar with the strategic right now. So then if we just regard the expression of the Maybius transform as the geodesic distance. Transform as a geodesic distance of temporary metric. Then you can, in fact, notice that any holomorphic function from the uniqueest in C1 to V0 has the so-called V contraction property in terms of the fun parametric. So this is an astonishing fact in a way that holomorphic structure preserves all necessary geometric data. So that if you look at now the automorphic function, meaning that f and f inverse are all holomorphic, then you can fill it in inequality. So it turns out that this inequality must be equality. So this is the way to really So, this is the way to realize the concurrent metric as an invariant metric. And you might be able to believe that, in fact, the Borger metric is invariant in a way that it does not lose anything via the proofback of the bio-morphine. So, but the Borger metric also behave something like this. But in order to show this type of procedure, so first we establish certain inequality and we introduce the inverse net and we put the inequality to establish the equality. That's not the case for the volume metric in general. For the volume metric in general. So, the most important technique, hyperbolic complexity, is the Yao and Royden's Schirstman. So, that we want to put the curvature either lower bound or the upper bound, but those are negative. Then, one should be able to compare the perfect metric and the metric of the domain in this manner. That depends on the pervasure parameter. However, as I already said, the case of the original metric, we have no sign on the order metric in general. So, it is the rate. On the organometric in general, so it is the range was from minus infinity to positive two, so that we are still do not know how to apply the Schrocel lemma or the organometric to show this type of the so-called contraction program. But still, we know that at least for the eye flow marking, we have the RSI call. But the procedure is applied to shortcut. So, what I thought about more than a year is that I really actually talked about the correct setting because. Talking about the correct setting because at least we change the setting like the Nash's isometric embedding into the large dimensional Euclidean space. So the motivation is still not clear because we'd like to describe the algebraic equation. So that's why we changed, replace the ambient space to the n-dimensional complex projective space. And this is sort of the reasonable analog I can or so agree. But at the same time, this looks not that good in the following reason. So now let's turn from the two arbitrary boundary domains. Say omega 1 and omega 2. So both are bounded domains in the same CM. And I will just look at arbitrary format boundary. And if we have the perspective from the choice lemma, LSD scan C1, we expect certain conviction property. But there are many examples. That's not the case for the organometric in general. For both bounded domains are sort of compact Taylor metaphors. And I can always invent by using. And I can always in that by using the obiacis pizza to map over here. So then I can recognize at least the burger magic here as a true vector. That's what I explained. But as long as we have such an extrinsic embedding, what I think it is natural is to define this map that makes this to be commutative as far as this is. As far as this is some measure dimension or so viewpoint. However, if you really think about the definition of the CP infinity, we have no idea. How to even define any map? I really have no idea. So for example, if I just have the P2, 2 P2, then still the map can be quite tricky in a way that I might be able to define something like this. But the reality is I just take the barrel working function of each component preserving the homogeneous. Component preserving the homogeneous structure here. However, for the safety infinity, I really have no idea how to define even some non-trigger map so that I cannot actually play with this extrinsic like the framework. Otherwise, I accept the fact that I can suggest the fact the boreometry can be recognized as just a true graph. So, this makes me wonder that I might actually have the correct ambience-based setting, so that there might be the other possible setting that this might be much like the beneficial. Might be much like the Ben Fisher in terms of a competitive diagram. So, what I try to recognize is the follow-up one. So, I will just look at the bounded point for a moment. And let's just assume the reasonable class would be just a simply connected, concrete end-dimensional reminder for whose remainder section curvature state of future. So, at least this is degromorphic to the boundary to AER. And in that case, we know from the classical research of Anderson, Chuen, and Yang, those famous electronics, so that we know how to describe the We know how to describe the plotting term and we know how to serve the user problem. So, in such a case, so let me just give you the concrete example. So, if I take the n-dimensional real height of the space, then in this case, the topological boundary just becomes the n minus network sphere. And the macarometric, sorry, quantum corner can be described as something like x minus theta here, something over here. I kind of forget. Something over here, I kind of forgot. So that the digital problem can be solved as something like with the boundary condition over the worker boundary. And this framework, at least works for the class of such a manifold. So the reasonable reason, the reason to care the causal corner there is that if you replace the boundary data with equal to one, then you can show. Boundary data with equal to one, then you can show that this behaves as a, first of all, the probability measure, so that one can look at the ambient space as a space of the probability distributions. Moreover, you should be able to define at least one natural embedding that might be able to replace this frame. So that one might be able to use for each point over here, then you can use the cotton corner to map this in the space of the current efficiency. And it turns out that this is somehow nice from the information geometry. Guys, from the information geometry, QW, innovative, if we start from the n-dimensional rank one symmetric space of the non-converter, so the metric is already given, then I should be able to solve the view-shaped problem with the Poisson corner that depends on this metric. So that if I look at the notion of the fission-entropy metric that I will introduce in a second, then one can also take the truth back. Then it turns out that this metric is exactly coincides with the given metric up to the constant. And this constant turns out to be the same. Constant, and this constant turns out to be the same as the volume entropy, which was our topic yesterday. So that this might be the correct framework that preserves the geometric structure. At the same time, what's the benefit to look at a space of the parameter? Let me just curve in this manner. Then this map, so what we know is as long as we have a measure of function, then we should be able to define the push-forward measure. Be able to define the push-forward measure. So, there might be some natural map here, as long as we know how to actually define the space of the private defense disk. So, let me introduce this one as possible. But before I go any further, so let me introduce the notion of the issue information matching from the statistics and information challenges. Yep. Alright, so this is the abstract definition, but rather than talking about the abstraction, let me try to persuade you, convince you, how this. To persuade you, convince you how this is actually powerful by providing the concrete example that all of us ordered a thousand times. So now let me just look at the one dimensional remote basically so that we know we need to just roll the real line and we have a function function. And we know how to describe such a function function as something like it depends on the the implication, so let me just put it to two pi or four pipe. So that such a form of the Gaussian function only depends on the mean parameter with the standard deviation. And the funny thing that you can notice here is that if I put mu, sigma by f, then this is the point on the operator plane. The point on the operator plane because this mu can be any real number, whereas sigma should be plastic in our intuition. So that we'd like to interpret the collection of such a Gaussian density as an upper plane in the Riemannian geometry sense. So what I can do is that I will define the notion of coefficient from a matrix. So let me not give any questions. And let me just take this to be theta one with theta two. Bit there. Then I can simply take each component by looking at the integration for each step. So I'll take the corresponding measure here that corresponds to this guy. And I will simply take the derivative in the corresponding indices. So let me for this guy, g d i and I will put the natural. And I also put j. I think your t is also your six. I think your key is also your signal. And if you now look at the formula here, then there's a just natural law, so that you can just cancel the exponential function. Then it's not that difficult for all of us to check if you really just calculate these two bytes metrics. This indeed coincide. So that this metric is. So, that this metric is indeed the same as the concurrent metric, and this is just an abstract definition of the Pichoker metric or the general framework of the parallel institutions. And surprisingly, you might wonder, then, well, this is just one specific example which is somehow bigger. But it turns out that I can generalize this to the n-dimension. So, any n-dimensional hyperplex space can be achieved in terms of the noir distribution, first. And you can also find the n-sphere as a work. Find the end sphere as a mortal error family of whatsoever, so that you can find at least the Riemannian model space as a family of the state probability distributions. So that what I already introduced is that if I'm able to define the embedding into the space of the probability distribution first, then at least I have a one natural Riemannian metric in this evening measurement. If I take the natural truth back, if this behaves as a polygonal metric, then I would be happy. This is what I try. So, from here, this is a new return. So, I will try to define the notion of the reaction, but the intuition is somehow really clear because I just need to make the target to be a probability measure. In order to do that, I see the normalization. So that the integration should be equal to what? So, up to here, up to here, the procedure is exactly the same as provided. So, for each point, I will just take. So for each point, I will just take the implemented sections and put it that into the homogeneous coordinate, even though it will not add in the case of the boundary domain. And we have the research representation on the hero space, so that I will just take the viewer space here. So I start from the viewer, and I'll just take a border viewer here. So that in this your space from the reuse representation, this can be written explicit in this map. So that I start from here, and I map over here. Then by using this description, I can also map somewhere there. Map somewhere there, then I will just make it into the probability better. So I'll just take the natural normalization to make the integration to be printable. I think this is somehow really natural. So once I'm trying to really write each stages, then in terms of the Holocaust sections, then you will get such a description. Then what you can notice here is that this was exactly the definition of card. And also, this part is the four-continuous clear, so that it has this. So that it has this interesting form of the probability distribution. So that in summary, what we observe is that we should be able to at least define one natural map from the bounded domain to the space of the probability distribution defined on the same bounded domain that maps in this manner, which can be purely described in terms of the Born colour, which is always verified on the boundary domain. So, and the reason that I care this framework is if you look at the even If you look at the, even in the case of the number distribution, the space that we take the integration and the parameter space are in general different, but I do not like that. So that I want to match the space of distribution defined on the same space here coming from the quantity. So that's the new frame. So now we should first care that measure not this immediately becomes the property measure. And it turns out that there was already the name, even though the investigation was fully different direction. So this should be called. Direction. So this should be cleared by either the plus one or by corner, or there's also an admin, but let me just call this by the plus corner from now on. So there is a reason, like the boot property of the baryon colour, so-called the reproducing property. And by using the reproducible property of the baryoma colour, first one can show this looks exactly like the design. So one can sort of adjust a future curve to establish this app, but this app should be flomorphic and it should be empty in the given vibration space. In the given hub space. So by using this, if you replace this function f by the constant one, then we can definitely say that this just becomes a proper function, although I already parametered. But the thing that I was really disappointed was the definition here. So first, if I look at the term, each one. So as I said, for arbitrary point.c, this is always always positive. This is guaranteed. However, if I vary the pair here, there is no guarantee that this should be positive. There's no guarantee. Should be positive. There's no guarantee. It can be zero. And even the reasonable classes of a bounded domain, Cm, there are lots of counter-examples, to be honest. So that in order to make this map to be very defined, I should put in positions the additional condition this should be positive. In other words, organic conditions should have no zero. And it turns out that for any compact killer values, this is not the case. So for any compact killer values, it wants this credit or cornerstone. So I cannot use it. So this is one of the points that I was totally disappointed, and still I want to know how to organize. Component and still, I want to know how to work on it. But if P sit inside of the interior of the integration, so if this becomes zero, then I have no control. So I just need to restrict my attention to just bounded domain, meet the condition, and there's no zero. And there's a famous thing in separate from this error, this sort of domain is provided by Luchikin domain. So I'll just consider it. Yeah, so this is version. So I start from now a banded domain in CN, but Bounded domain in CN, but I should have the very defined such a map. So this condition is quite strong. So Ubisoft's previous regard does not actually require such a condition. So our class is more restricted. But still, under this condition, if I start from the obviously sorry, vision direction metric here, then the proof bank exactly realizes the Bergman metric. So this proof is totally new, and it's so elementary. So the proof is so easy, but I'd like to just point out the point of the curve. The point of the term. So if one just take the derivative on each log of p, then this has a structure so that one will back as well. So then I will replace this expression in the initial variables with the proofback. So the proofback plays a role with the description of this key. So that if I replace this part by this one, then I just have a two terms coming from here. Then I can simply take those two derivatives outside, and it's a foreign measure, so this will be gone. And I need to take now the derivative on the p. The derivative on the P, and the definition of the P was this guy. And the Verga Connor is, let me write button this center. So the Verga corner is for the first component and anti-proverbing for the second component. And we are taking the derivative on what? And we are taking the derivative from what V dot C and V C. So all the third surviving terms should just be denominated. So each term in numerator should be gone from the homorphicity and antiolems. So all you have is just this guy. And it turns out to just take outside from this measure, and it's equal to one. And the description here is just called. And this description is super simpler than the previous event. But here is some sort of point. So as long as we are saying, So, as long as we are saying that the true fact or coefficient remain metric is the same as the Burma metric, so we are not just talking about the remainder metric. So, this is permission. This is more special. And if we look at the space of the appropriate measures, there's no complex structure. Whereas the bounded domain must respect the complex structure. So, this part is somehow tricky. So, this does come from the calculation. So, the calculation might be there. But this is somehow useful. Right, useful and interesting in a way that this actually suggests if you compare one and two, this is actually vibrant. So, expectation of the product of those two first-order derivatives becomes the order metric of the component. But this is a Hermitian part. So, this part is a non-Hermitian part. And there's no idea. I take the complex derivative, so the efficient information metric, if it behave as a Hermitian metric. So, in that sense, this is somehow really interesting because the decision-information metric, you can Because the historical metric, even though this is the real permit metric, still somehow respects the primitive function. And other identities should be used somewhere at all. So now let me now try to compare the framework of the white chip. So oops. So, the left-hand side just means the flow section curvature. So, as I said, US already proved the fluorescent curvature has a range between minus infinity plus 2. And if you just write down the expression of the fluoride section curvature in this case, then you will just get this one in the holomorphy node form. And this is clearly non-positive. So, this already says this is the case. So, another second. The case thing. So, another second point of my point one is that the litch curvature really should be important. And I also tried to write down the litch curvature of the program machine because I already know all its description. I didn't get anything. So it's just a body and I didn't get any like a useful identity whatsoever. But in order to establish this identification, one needs to just calculate this parts of the identity in order to get the package description. And I also want to put emphasis. And I also wanted to emphasize one of the interesting observations: so the previous approaches is to use the embedding from the boundary domain to the CP infinity. So the rate finance and the injectivity of such a map turns out to be the same, turns out to be the same as the property of the so-called Columbus gas function, which was invested by the Columbia in his dissertation, that this D is defined in this manner in terms of the part by Connor. This should be always positive. This should be always positive. And in such a case, this map should be embedded. And the map that I construct has the same property. As long as this is embedded, this must be embedded. Of course, providing this map is very proper. So still, I need to put the additional condition, but still it's embedding. And if I weaken the context, it just emerges still those two facts at the same time. And one of the interesting facts from the Kalabis Gascon function is that, so in the Riemannian geometry, so in the Lower coordinate, we know that. So, in the lower coordinate, we know that we can always write the expression of the metric as the head sign of the geodesic distance, locally and the geodesic coordinate. And in the Borderman metric, this can be always written as I times the d bar of the color-based density function. This is very important. However, I realized that I can actually define the one-parameter boundary from the information structure. This is nothing new. However, what I discovered is that, so if I I discovered that, so if I look at the eigenfamily of such a so-called divergence, then it is still the same for any other. And so this is new. And it turns out that all those artifact families, which was never investigated in this information geometry, so those also respect the complex function. So those are preserved by the change of the vital organism. And even for art is equal to plus or minus one, those destiny functions are exact. I mean, those divergence are exact same with the Clavius Design function. So, this is some interesting part. So, now let me move on to the main actual topic. I really tried to put quite effort, but it turns out that I actually felt really disappointed for this observation. So, now let me try to look at this competitive, this diagram, I should not say complete diagram. So that I first have the bounded domains from omega 1 to omega 2, I mean this remote function first, and I have a map, and I just assume those maps are right. And I just assume those maps are very defined. So then, now, like the CP infinity, now I can define the natural counter map here by using the measure push forward in a way that I will simply just take the just the measure push forward by just taking the inverse image and just take the Radon Equin derivative with respect to the reference measure. So as long as I have this map, then I can simply define this kappa in this manner and take the Radoniklin measure, defines the perpetrator from 0 to Q. So this is the major difference from the previous setting of a bioche. From the previous setting of the batch. And if I need to assume firmware, in order to write down this, I don't need to measure the algorithm nicely. And I just need to assume f is surjective properties function. In this case, I can always write down at least locally the cut parameter in this user manner. So those are the n print image of the Q. So the next result we got is that so I start from the two-body domain, the very defined division map. So as I said, from the known short landmark, so there is no contraction property. It was never known. Because we do not have no idea what the curvature, like the range of the vertical matrix in general. At least those are not in general negative. But what we can actually prove is that there is a contraction property in a way. And if I have the omega 1, then I have embedded here, so that I embed this space of the current measure. And I have a proper surjective function here, then I can also embed this into the space of properties on omega 2. Then by using the measure push forward, I can induce this method. Then, first, I can start from the fission volume from here. Then, I have the two gap. So, let me call this I yeah. So let me call this by just a v1 and v2. So take the throughback of the initial information metric here, and I have an in this metric here, which is nothing but the order mark. And I can also take this through back. So that take the project from kappa from this which I'm measuring too. And then I can take the order project. So that I have this guy. And it turns out that. And it turns out that this is already true. But the funny part, I was disappointed, is that this is not compatible. Even with the simplest example, so that I actually never use any data of the omega Q and this map. So this is also a contradiction property between the Verdun metric and the metric that I have no idea in general. But this is just one of the metrics which would be in this current set. This from the set. And this inequality is actually the famous thing in information and statistics. This is called by the Kramer-Rau inequality. The description is slightly different, but it's an incredible description. So we just really prove this equality first in the language of the Briton counter first, even though this is already known. But the interesting part is about the equality. So what we expect is that equality should only happen when f becomes a bi-framework function. So that's the exact case. So that if this is equality, then it's not. So, that if this is equality, then it's mostly quite homogeneous. So, such an equality is not sure in general information structure. And one of the reasons is that our equality is quite special in a way that we always just restrict our attention for such types of probability measures. And for such family of the state of probability measures, so we have the equality if I only need x multiplied by so that as a space of the probability distributions, so as a static metaphor, those are isometric if I only need the bound. Those are isometric dependently, the boundary domains are hyperlogic. And this is just coming from the Kush-orgin equality products. So, as I said, so at least I was happy because there is some natural map from the measure theoretical point of view, but I was not happy because I cannot make this diagram to be connected. I cannot quite believe. So, this is one of the last things that I wanted to have to release. It's preference. So, as I said, the most disappointing part was about the part. And another part is this is nothing to do with the Another part is this is nothing to do with the low malt tree. So I cannot make the comparison with the Burger matching over sheet. That was my true intention, but I just failed to compare the matching over sheet. So for last five minutes, so let me just introduce my last measure of this query. So this is usually covered by the asymptotic normality in information geometry. So this just means, let me just write it. This doesn't meet. Let me just draw the picture. So there's some result of the Kayla entrane metric. In the case of the complete Kayla network with the anti-chemical line bundle, but this is totally new. So if I have a bounded domain, then I will start from the one fixed point, C naught. Then I can define the corresponding party measure. Then I will just regard this as a problem measure, and I can make the sample from here. I can make the sample from here. Then I can just pick the random points from here. That depends on the problem measure. Then, if I take the certain procedure, then I can show that the sequence there converges to the Loma distribution with the workout metric covariance. So, this is some interesting results. And this is also not the And this is also not the typical application of the information geometry, because information geometry requires lots of the regular convexity or the convex function from X domain, but we do not have the convexity at all, so that we need to reprove everything, and this is somehow controlling. So I just want to put emphasis about this new direction. So the intention that I care is that I just want to change the ambience based like this because I might be able to take circuit to. This is because I might be able to take certain at least a new benefit and some new perspective. So let me just share the recent progress on stochastic complex differential geometry that I did. So these results are also done from the classical geometrical argument, but the method from the stochastic point of view is actually super simpler. So for example, if I define the notion of the Opsona Lich curvature as a litch minus floor section curvature, so in this case, if I assume the flowing section curvature and the Osona Lich curvature lower bound at the same time, Then one can get the gradient estimate of harmonic function. And this type of the estimate was even or not. And the condition here is much stronger than the least curvature one because of the presence of the complex structure. And the proof can be also done from the classical geometry of analysis. But the proof by using the stochastic method is too simple. And the proof here, which is from the reflection top plane, is essentially the same with the two-point maximum principle that was the analysis yesterday. The answer is yesterday. And I also get, for example, like the eigenvalue estimate by using the exact same crystal casting method. So for the lower bound, when the convect header with the correlation occurs, it's lower bound. So this type of lower bound was also shown in the similar period by also other expectations, but okay, this true simple. So one of the biggest topic for this. So, one of the biggest topic for this conference is about the fundamental gap, and I'm working with Professor Wei. So, one of the open questions that we heard yesterday was about the case of the CPM. And at least the two-point maximum principle is the contradictional argument, which is just simply failed. So, what I'm now currently trying to do with RAI is just try to recover the ordinary get SP in the case of the NSP because the case of the RNA is for right now. So, I just try to. RNA for it now. So I just try to get the same estimate by using the stoke essay method. And this is not the contradiction argument, but it's essentially saying with the two point maximum principle, so that give five plus totally new direction to prove the quality gap on CPN, but it seems not really positive, to be honest, but still I'm trying to work. So that's what I prepared. Thank you.
