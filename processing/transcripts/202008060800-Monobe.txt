Unfortunately, actually I wanted to visit to Canada because I have never been to there, but unfortunately, so next time. Okay. And in this talk, we are going to talk about the fast reaction limit of three components. And this talk And this talk is a joint work with Hirofu Mi Izuhara and Chang Huang Wu, who is speaker yesterday. And this is maybe a photo of Glimini in Marseille, by the way. So, anyway, okay, and also I am co-author of the first to speak, Professor Shimojo. Shimojo, yeah. Okay, so before stating my problem and results, let me explain the background of the first reaction limits. And sorry, disappoint. Okay, so fast reaction limit is one of the singular limits of the partial differential equations, and which is Equations and which is related to free boundary problems for such as Stefan problem and porous medium equation and so on. So let's see some example. A typical example is the one-phase one problem. And the hit host, Wanderhout, and Peridia and EMAD and them consider some. Consider some two-component system as force. So let me explain the notation slowly because these notations are very important when I explain my main result. And omega is a boundary domain like this in Rn. And this boundary have a sumus. Boundary is sumus. Boundary is smooth. And Qt is a power walling cylinder. And capital T is some positive constant. And S T is a part of the boundary of Qt without bottom and top of purple X cylinder. And mu is the outer normal into vector of the boundary of omega, like this. And the k is. And k is a positive parameter here. This parameter is very important in this talk. Eventually, we take this positive constant k into infinity. Then we consider the behavior of solution u and v of problem q k. And also u and v are defined in this region q d and this is these functions. And these functions are a scar function, and u0 v0 are non-negative functions. So, let's consider the behavioral solution u b as getting to infinity. So, u is a satisfies parabolic equation. This delta stands for the Laplace operator, and this is the reaction term, so negative effect, because now we assume that initial data are positive. And second equation has no diffusion terms. So the second equation is ordinary differential equations. And then, sorry, sorry. Okay. Then for the sake of ease, we assume that initial function a support of initial function u zero. Of initial function u0 and v0 are separated. And moreover, the positive part of the initial function u0 does not touch the boundary. Under this condition, as k ten to infinity, the limit function u star and v star satisfy this condition. Actually, u star is. Actually, I used that as a solution of one phase problem. So there are a lot of notations. So let me explain. Okay. Just a moment. No, no. And ah sorry. Yes. And so omega one of t a a stand for the positive part u star. The positive part to the u star. So, as you can see, the u star times v star is always zero. And this means that the positive part of u and the positive part of v are separated. So, omega 1 t 1 of t omega 2 of t is defined. And omega 1 of g is yeah, positive part and omega t uh two of t is a positive part of the fun uh limit function b star. Fun limit function B cell. So in this figure, the inside omega 1 over t is inside and omega 2 over t is outside like this. And Qt 1 is a parabolic region, but this is not straight because omega 1 is a change of shape depending on time. And also the Qt 2 are defined like this. like this. So limit function u star satisfy the heat equation in this region. And the limit function b star keep an initial value in this region. Now how does how does the domain omega 1 over t behave? Here we prepare the three notation. Gamma over t boundary of one boundary of one omega one of t and n is the autonomous unit vector of gamma of t here and v n is the autonomous velocity of gamma of t. This is a scalar function, not vector function. Then the domain is controlled by this row. This condition is called the Stefan condition. The effect of the function v The effect of the function v is appear here, the latent heat. So this means that if the value of v is large, then the motion of the omega 1 becomes slow. So anyway, what I want to say is that if k goes to infinity, the solution is close to solution of the q k. QK is close to the solution of Stefan problem, one-phase one problem. And so let's see some example. The initial data and u0 is cosine by x like this and from 0 to half and from half to 1 is 0 and b 0 is 0, 1 like this. one like this then under this condition so we uh if k is 10 so then the solution behave like this so the important thing is there is a common region in which is the function u and v are positive part positive but if k is 1000 then the Then the common lesion is become narrow. So if k tends to infinity, the common lesion vanished. This is shown by the Hill Horse and their collaborators rigorously. And for another free boundary problems, for two-phase step-by-step problem, Danza, Hill Host, Mimera Pelitia, and Hill Host Eida. Pelletia and Hilhost ida mimera anomia showed that there exists some reaction diffusion system approximating the approximate two-phase one problem. Also for porous media equations, Nakaki-Burakawa find the reaction diffusion system approximating the proximating equation. So from this So, from this, fast reaction limit method can, in some sense, remove the singularities like this. So, singularity means a free boundary. So, yeah, relaxed like this. And we can reproduce a numerical simulation for some free boundary problems by linear diffusion system. So, from this, the fast reaction limit is very, very powerful to. Is a very, very powerful tool when we consider when we do the numerical distribution because we don't need to take care of the motion of boundary. We just only solve the reaction diffusion system defined in the fixed domain. In recent years, Professor Ninomia developed a new direction of the fast reduction limit problem. So let me So let me explain one of the part of cutting edge in this research field. This is, okay, for integral differential equation, Ninomiya Tanaka Yamamoto showed that there exists a reaction diffusion system approximate integral differential equation. So this is interesting because integral differential equation is non-local information, it's composed Information is composed of non-local information, but they show that this equation is approximated by some reaction diffusion system, which is composed of just only local information. So, this is my image of the research. Okay, so free boundary problem is a linear diffusion equation is connected by using the passive reaction limit. A fast reaction limit, and also this desire to mean that connected to the integral differential equation and linear diffusion equation. And moreover, Ida Ninomiya Yamamoto showed that the wave equation is also approximated by a reaction diffusion system. So, this result is brilliant because a wave equation is no longer a parabolic equation, but they showed that. but they showed that the hyperbolic one of the hyperbolic partial differential equation is also approximated by the parabolic equation so we naturally encounter the fluid question can we find another free boundary problems or integral integral differential equation or hyperbolic equation and so on which is represented by a faster reduction limit of linear diffusion equation The extraction limit of linear diffusion equations. So, in this talk, we answer this question partially. Okay, so our problem setting. In this talk, we consider the following three boundary problems. This one. Okay. Okay, so QT1 is domain. Qt1 is domain of free boundary. So please remember the notation this one. Qt1 is defined by omega 1 of t and v is also defined in omega 1 of t so please note that the two there is a two function is defined the same lesion and u v zero on the UV zero on the free boundary and the motion of controlled by this law. So H1, what is okay. So every coefficient are positive and function fg satisfies blah blah blah. So anyway, so please imagine that f of u is 1 minus u and z of v is r is some positive constant times 1 minus. positive constant times y minus p. So remarks why we consider this problem p. So if we drop v over u, which is either one is okay, and p is a classical one phase one problem with the action term. Fortunately, which is related to a mathematical model describing population dynamics, which is proposed by Du and Li in 2010. And another example is And another example is mathematical model, very similar to this problem, which is proposed by Jung Seng Guo and Chang Hong Yu in 2012. And moreover, if we replace this reaction term minus A to U by the plus A to U, it's opposite sign, then the problem P is related to Then the problem P is related to Play Plasita model, which is proposed by one 2040. So, anyway, what I want to say is that the problem P is related to some mathematical model. So, but please note that this problem is not classical, two-phase problem. So, essentially different because when the way the two-phase class problem is the problem is one component is outside, but this problem P is both components in the same defined in the same region. Okay, so our purpose is to find a linear diffusion system approximating the free bundle proven P. So here we consider the following three components to the action diffusion systems this PK. Uh this PK okay so different point is uh here uh last term uh k b one w times u is we add this term and also we add this term and also we add the function w like this there is a parameter k okay and u v Okay, and Uv satisfies homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Here we assume that Abel coefficients are positive and omega is defined like this. Omega is a bounding domain such that which includes the initial domain of the free boundary, omega 1 of 0, like this. The arbitrary one is please take away. Arbitrary one is please take one of them. Then, eventually, uh, it is shown that as k goes to infinity, k is here, here, and here, then the solution of p k converts into the solution of the problem p. Problem p is a free boundary problems, as I said, in some topology. This is our claim. So, remark that the problem P Remark that the problem PK is a special case of the three-component local border competition system. So if we add the diffusion term here and the reaction term here, then the program pKa becomes a three-component of the carbohydrate composition system. So we improve, sorry, the idea of the proof is mainly based on the Hidden. Are mainly based on the heat host in Imbra and Ninomir 2001. Oh, sorry, this is a mistake. No, okay, so anyway, so notation, UK, VK, WK is a solution of the problem PK. So we okay, let this one. Then Riemann one is existence result. So if initial data below child data belongs to this function, sorry, this space. And moreover, the function u0 times w0 is 0 and v0 times w0 is 0. Then there exists a positive constant capital T independent of k okay such that there exists a unique There exists a unique solution of P, UK, BK, WK. And lemma too is that this is important when we show the segregation. That means, okay, so anyway, there exists a positive constant C1, C2, C3, such that this norm is bounded to C1 over. C1 over K. And also, next norm, sorry, second norm is also the same, second and third norm has a similar estimate. So please focus attention on the first estimate. So if k tends to infinity, the right hand side becomes zero. So this means that, of course, this value is. But of course, this value is uk wk is non-negative function. So from this estimate, we easily imagine that the uk times the limit function u and limit function w are separated. So this norm is also implied the similar situation. Then we get the following theorem: let you get Theorem, let uk bk wk be a solution pk, then there exists a subsequence uk and bk and wkn and limit function u star v star w star like this sorry i have uh sorry i have no time so okay uh so more uber uh u star b star w star satisfies uh this condition uh u times w star uh and b star And V star times W star is zero. And limit function satisfy this condition. This is a weak form of the free boundary problem P idea of the proof of theorem one is for second so okay so second claim is directly obtained by using lemma two as I said and and first claim and third claim are obtained by using a priori estimates by using maximum principle and the column colour for this flash serum which is LP version of the asquale alternum so compactness serum and then we get the following result assume that Assume that limit function U star W star omega 1 omega 2 are smooth and omega 1 is a positive part U and V and omega 2 is a positive part of W star and then W star is keep the initial value in the region Q T 2 and limit function u star base that omega 1 over t is satisfies the 1 V T satisfies a free boundary problem as I explained. This is the relationship between coefficient and L1 and L2. Okay, idea of proof. Okay, repeat. Yeah, basically, idea of the proof of serum is standard, so repeating the integer by parts and showing that this one. This is a key point or key point. Or key point to obtain our theorem. Okay, so lastly, I would like to explain the numerical result. So we consider this problem, this three component system, and let FU is 1 minus U, Z V is R times 1 minus V. And again, so parameter is like this. So here, K is. Like this. So here K is 1500, like this. And initial data is here. And okay, so U0 is 0.7 and V0 is 0 and 0, sorry, 0 and 0.6. And W0 is 0.5 and 0 like this. Then the solution behaves like this. Behave like this. Okay. So let me demonstrate that. Sorry, is this? Okay. Can you see? Oh, sorry. Okay. It's one. No, no, you have to share the movie. You have to share. Okay. How to see. Ah, okay. How to share this one. What you should close the power. Ah, okay. Share again. Okay, thank you. Just a moment. I'm sorry, I forgot to make a video, so ah, no. Ah no. Uh this can you can you see? So first, okay, so okay. Sorry, I'm really sorry. Uh, yeah, this is a numerical result of the function u and the function v and w. So, first, I thought that this is close to traveling waves monotone, but after Monotone, but after time passes, this trapping wave becomes a non-monotone. Oh, sorry. Okay, so I so anyway, sorry. Anyway, anyway, I would like to stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Oh, nice talk. So are there any questions or comments? So you do you do you prove the uniqueness of the weak solution? Not yet. Yes, because when I show the existence of solution, we take a subsequence. We take a sub-sequence and so we didn't show the uniqueness of solution. Oh, really? So, but you can prove that the UK we convert to the solution? Yes, one of the solutions. One of the solutions. Okay. Can you prove the case for the H1 or 2 is negative? Yes, also. Yes, I'm sorry, I forgot to explain. Even though if we change the sign, then we can show that. Oh, really? Okay, okay. So you mean that you didn't use the comparison principle for the other system? Ah, adjustment. Adjustment composing principle. Yes. This is a competitive system, right? Yes, composite system. So if we take a pre-preditor system, can you get a CSM result? Maybe yes, but like what? Yes. So if we fix the time key. We fix a time key, then maybe we can, but okay. I will check this later. Okay, are there a question or comment? If not, let's thank speaker again. Thank you very much. So we resume after two minutes.
