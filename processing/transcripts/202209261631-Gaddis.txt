Talking about quantum GWAs acting on quantum GWAs, this is joint work with Rob Wong, who insists on always using my official Miami photo on any talk he gives that's joint work with us. But for Rob, this is the only thing for that long. Oh, he knows. Yeah, he's the best. Okay. Please go. Okay. Okay. So let me tell you the general goal of what we're doing. So working over a field, all algebras are K algebras. So the idea is to work on hop factions in the Z graded setting. So the canonical example of something like this, which came up in Jim Kenny's talk earlier. In Kenny's talk earlier, is the Bile algebra. So it's z-grade by just setting u to be degree 1, v to be degree negative 1. And unfortunately, or fortunately, I guess depending on your perspective, this thing has no finite dimensional quantum symmetry. This is a result of Quadra, Edingroth, and Walton. So if we're interested in studying Hop algebra actions, please. Algebra actions, at least finite dimensional ones, this isn't a good place to look, but it might give us some inspiration. So I'm going to look at a larger class of algebras, these generalized vial algebras, over a polynomial ring, one variable. I'm not going to give the full definition because I don't really need it here, but I will mention that these algebras are all known to be collabial, or at least twisted collabial. This is a result of loop. Result of blue. So, one way that we can think about this is a natural extension of studying actions on connected n-graded twisted collabial algebras, which are exactly Arden-Schelter regular algebras. So, we're trying to extend this to the Z-graded setting. So, the algebras we're looking at, this isn't maybe the most general definition I could give of a GWA, but it's Give of a GWA, but it's sufficient for our purposes. So, what's hanging around here is a works. Okay, some sort of non-zero scalar, some polynomial. This is our defining data. We have generators u and v, just like in the Vile algebra. T, we're thinking of, we have a base ring that's this polynomial ring. And u and v both skew commute in opposite ways. With t, v u is this polynomial, and uv is skew. And UV is skewing this polynomial by Q. And just so I'm getting interesting actions because I think for just these classical GWAs in general, which I haven't put the full definition, but you look it up, I think those, sort of the classical ones, the ones that were studied by like Hodges and Jordan, these like type A non-commutative climate. Non-commutative Kleinian singularities probably don't have any finite-dimensional quantum symmetry either. And even these, if Q is not a root of unity, I'm not sure. I sort of suspect that there's probably not there either. So if we want interesting stuff, we need to work in this setting. These are all Z graded. If you set U to be degree 1, V to be negative 1, and every Negative 1, and everything in the base range get degree 0. So some classical examples. If h is t, we just get the quantum planes. And if we set t to be negative 1, we obtain the quantum vowel algebras after maybe scaling something. But we get lots of other things too. The actions I'm going to look at are a certain class of pointed Huff algebras. Pointed Hopf algebras. These came up in Chris's talk, though I'm looking at slightly more general ones. So, in general, a pointed Hopf algebra is something where every simple co-module is one-dimensional. It took me longer than it probably should have to realize that they're called pointed because the simple co-modules are one-dimensional, so they're like points. I don't know. I feel like I should have figured that out sooner than I did. So, what we're looking at here, we have two parameters m and n, two integers where m divides n, and some primitive nth root of unity. And the corresponding generalized half-talge to that is this guy here. That is not right. I just pushed something up, or I held down. No, or I held down on it to one. There we go. Okay, so the difference with a regular TAFT algebra is just that n and n in that case are the same thing. That's the only difference here. So these are slightly more general objects. So previously, in a project with Wan and Yi, we classified linear actions of tapped algebra on quantum planes. Algebra is on quantum planes and quantum biology. So linear in the sense that u and v are mapped to the degree one subspace spanned by u and v. So we classified those. And then in work with Klein, we sort of extended this more generally to quantum affline spaces or skew polynomial rings, whatever you want to call it, and quantum matrix algebras. We also generalized Algebras. We also generalized it to generalized Taft algebras and their higher-dimensional analogs, these bosonizations of quantum linear spaces. But in this case, we're going to be looking at Z-graded actions. I'll say what I mean by that in a second. And generally, they're distinct from these. They're genuinely different actions, except in a few trivial cases. So if I have a So, if I have a Z-graded algebra and any hop algebra acting on it, we say it's C-graded if each A sub I is actually an H module. So that's the normal definition of C graded. But in certain cases, this doesn't capture all the actions that we really want. So we define a slightly weaker notion called weakly Z graded. If A naught and then also A negative i plus Ai Plus AI, each one of those is an H module. So the weekly Z-graded setting sort of captures the fact that in Z you have this automorphism that switches one and negative one as a group. And it turns out that in most cases we get just genuine Z-graded actions, but occasionally we'll get actions that need this weaker notion to really get all of them. To really get all of them. Okay. So the classic problem here, of course, is that if you're looking at an algebra, you want to understand its allomorphism group. You want to understand which groups act on it. So this is the classic problem. Groups that act faithfully. So the quantum problem then might be if you have an algebra and you're looking at taft actions on it. Looking at TAFT actions on it or generalized TAFT actions, which groups appear as the restriction of the group of group-likes to this? And I have to thank the anonymous referee. If you're here, thank you. Yeah, quite possibly. So the referee gave us this term that such a T-action. That such a T-action can be viewed as a quantum thickening of an action of G. So you're sort of like taking your cyclic group action and then you're making it slightly bigger by having this Taft algebra act on it. I have a guess. And that also reminds me of my favorite quote from a Marvel movie: Do you guys just put the The do you guys just put the word of everything? And yes, Aunt Man, we do. Okay. So this slide is sort of annoying. I'll just warn you about it ahead of time. But it helps us sort of set things up. So if I take one of these quantum GWAs and I write h just in terms of its components, and L is going to be the difference of i and j where i and j where h i and h j, the coefficients, are non-zero. If h is a monomial, I want to set c sub l to just be the group of scalar, of non-zero scalars in my field. And otherwise, I want it to be the subgroup of lth roots of unity. And for each gamma and c sub l and just u any non-zero scalar, I can define an automorphism. Now, the exact form of this automorphism isn't super important. Isn't super important, but what is important is that it's scaling t, so it restricts to an automorphism of the polynomial base ring, and it's scaling u and v by something corresponding to u and gamma. And it turns out, this is a result of Sora's Alvarez and Vivus, that when Q is not negative 1, these things comprise the entire automorphism group. Group. And there's relations on how the eta, gamma, mu play with one another. We have these written down explicitly in a paper I wrote with one of my undergrads, Wang Ho, who has a super fancy job at Amazon, but I'm sure pays more than what I make by now. When Q is negative 1, there's this extra order 2 automorphism, omega, that still fixes the polynomial base ring, but actually interchanges. Base ring, but actually interchanges u and v. And in this case, every automorphism is either some eta or some omega compose omega. So what's happening is that in the q not equal to negative one case, every automorphism is genuinely z graded, but in the q equals negative one case, we need this weaker, it's weakly z-graded. And this is exactly why we need this. And this is exactly why we need this weaker notion of Z grading. And specifically for this case. Okay. So because we see that all these automorphisms restrict to actions on the polynomial base ring, it turns out whenever we have a Taft-alpha action, then it's also going to restrict to this. So we needed to study actions first on the polynomial base ring. This was something. Base ring. This was something we felt probably was written down somewhere, just generalized half-actions in the polynomial ring of one variable, but we couldn't find sort of anything that explicitly said what this was or what the conditions were. So we worked this out as sort of a preparatory result. This might be standard, but we define the support of a polynomial to just be the indices of the non-zero coefficients. Of the non-zero coefficients. So let's take one of these generalized half-algebras. Gamma is just going to be something not 0, 1, and phi is going to be a non-zero polynomial. And here's the conditions. So if the polynomial ring is a T-module algebra with this action here, where G scales T, now if G acts as a finite order. If Gx is a finite order automorphism, which it must, then it doesn't have to look like that, but you can always diagonalize it to look like that. But the Taft algebra actions will actually, when a Taft algebra acts, it will turn out to always act that way on T, so it's not much of a hypothesis. So the conditions are that gamma is a primitive at the root of unity, lambda and gamma are related in some way, and the support. And the support of this polynomial that you get from x acting on t is contained in a single congruence class, mod m. And because we require that phi not be zero, this action is interfaithful if and only if m and n are equal. Meaning, it's only you only get interfaithful actions on the polynomial ring when you have. Polynomial ring when you have a genuine Taft algebra acting. Now, conversely, if you choose gamma and phi satisfying these conditions, then there is a unique T-module algebra structure where g and x act this way. Okay, so now that we have the actions on those, we can actually talk about the actions of T on a quantum GWA. On a quantum GWA. So, first, sort of an existence statement: there is an interfaithful, at least weakly Z-graded T module structure on A if the support of H is contained in a single congruence class mod M. And then there's some numerical conditions. So, there's some integer K coprimed M such that I get the security warning. Go away. Okay. We've become experts on this. Exactly what's happening isn't super important, but the point is that the order of Q, the order of M, and the order of N are all related in some ways. There's some sort of intertwining between all these relations, or all these parameters going on. All these parameters going on. Now, assuming the conditions are satisfied, assuming this existence statement, we can parameterize all of the actions. And the conditions that come up on these parameters are very similar to the ones from the previous slide. There's some condition between the order of gamma, how lambda and gamma are related. That comes from these come from the actions on the polynomial base ring. Actions on the polynomial base ring. These orders are all related. Again, the support of phi is contained in a single congruence class mod m. And then there's some relation between mu and q here. Now, I stated this, actually, I stated the theorem when q squared is not 1, but in fact, as long as these conditions are satisfied, we get actions in the q equals negative 1 case. I just didn't want to clog up a I just didn't want to clog up another slide because those actions get a little more complicated and it's just messier. But we do have that classification as well. But these actions are all genuinely Z-graded. In the cube equals negative one case, we get some weakly Z-graded actions. So now, just sort of reframing our results in actually a much nicer way in terms of this idea of quantum thickenings. So I take a quantum GWA. So I take a quantum GWA, I take a cyclic subgroup of the automorphism group, which is just a bunch of these etas or generated by one theta. And then G is actually the restriction of a generalized half action, if and only if we have these conditions here, which appeared on the other slide, but we have this integer k such that this mu q to the k is. This q to the k is an nth root of unity. We can construct a t module that restricts to g. And conversely, sort of if you have a generalized half-algebra that acts, then the restriction, the cyclic subgroups that you can get are parametrized in this way. In this way, by non-zero polynomials of degree D satisfying these two conditions. Okay, so the last thing I'll mention is just the invariance of this action. So the standard definition of the fixed ring by a Hopfalge action. So let's say we have a quantum GWA, we have a Taft algebra acting on it, generalized Taft algebra acting on it, and A is an Acting on it. And A is an interfaithful weakly Z-gridded T-module algebra. And G is acting by one of these etas. It always does, except when Q is negative 1. It might be something else. So just as long as that's the case. Then the fixed ring looks a bit, first of all, it's commutative. And second of all, it sort of looks like a Kleinian singularity. And singularity. It's not quite because this polynomial may not necessarily be a monomial, though when H is a monomial, you get a genuine Kleinian singularity, and its associated graded ring under the standard filtration is. So maybe I'll just end by saying that there's some additional results that I didn't put slides on because I don't hate myself. I don't hate myself. But there are some extensions we have written down about this. One is to sort of higher rank quantum GWAs. You can make that definition pretty easily. And then you can, sort of in the same way that Klein and I did, you can sort of patch actions together a little bit. You can look at the restriction to each sort of Sort of subalgebra that's just a quantum, a rank one quantum GWA. Results we didn't put into the paper are looking at sort of higher ranked taft algebras that act. And so you can do something like that, but it was a little preliminary and we didn't really like those results as much. But you can certainly look at some of these bosonizations acting on them. But maybe a more interesting question. But maybe a more interesting question that we haven't really got a handle on yet is: of course, you could look at different pointed Hop algebras or different non-semi-simple Hop algebraas and whether they act. But one thing I'm curious about is whether there's actually any semi-simple Hop algebras that act on these things, other than just the standard like group algebra things. So I don't actually know. I don't have a good example yet. Have a good example yet, but it'd be interesting if there were hop algebras that acted, especially if they acted respecting the Z grading on these things. And since I recognize that I'm the only thing holding you back from dinner, I will end a few notes early. Thank you very much. Questions you just want to do. Yeah. Um, so it if you does the congruence class of that polynomial, like, tell you anything, like, say, about this invariant ring? I mean, I guess that's the degree of the H, I guess, right? Or is it related to the degree of the H? No, the degree of H is actually going to be, so all that is, is it's the H here, but then. H here, but then you have the cyclic group action on the polynomial ring. So it's just the usual invariant under, it's, you know, the base ring is basically this, but fixed by that automorphism that scales t by gamma. Yeah. The congruence class condition is just one of these things that comes, you know, you're looking at the relations on the Taft algebra and the relations on the algebra itself. And those, you know, in order to have. Itself and those, you know, in order to have an action, they have to work out together. And this is just one of the things that's forced by that. Well, and you said you could basically have any polynomial, so any congruence class could show up, right? Yeah, right. I mean, as long as all the conditions are satisfied, yeah. Yeah. So have you checked the Oslander theorem works in your case? Oh, dear. Oh dear. Um um no, um, I don't know much about how like Hauslander's theorem works outside of like the semi-simple Ha case. But I can't remember. I feel like there's something written. I feel like there's something written down in Montgomery about this, but I'm not 100%. I don't 100% remember what that is. So, no, but that would be an interesting thing to study. Questions or any questions on Zoom? Question, you can hear me. Yes. Which is, did you check the did you know anything about whether the extension of the inheritance has got? Extension of the inheritance has got a law? No, I haven't checked that, but that would be interesting to look at. I feel like this is also related to whatever's written down in Montgomery about when this holds. Yeah. Yeah, I think we checked something that wasn't so for me to check, but it did something to check or need to check. Okay, thank you. Our next activity is dinner at 5:30, so let's thank all the speakers for today. Recording. I'm recording stuff.
