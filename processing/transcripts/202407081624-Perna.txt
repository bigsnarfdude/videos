I prepared something else. Now I changed to everything. Let's see how it goes. But anyway, the topic is socially insects, which I just as a reminder, I don't go to insects like ants and termites that live in colonies. And they're interesting for us, I think, here. Yeah, because they build infrastructure. They're the only animals, practically, that are able to. Practically, that are able to build the structures in the environment that can be quite large and complex. And here I have three examples that I classified according to my feelings, pits or traits, and then there are built structures such as nests that can be built or excavated. And as an example of each of these structures, I'll show you some of the most impressive ones. For trades, I think the most impressive example are the trades made by Hermian. The trades made by army ants, which are ants that live in big colonies of about one million, two million ants in South America. And every day they go out foraging for prey and they make this sort of shape as they explore the environment that resembles a little bit the Delta river. And you have different species of these ants, and different species make different structures, which I think is something that I wanted to. Which I think this is something that I wanted to point out, because i if you study these structures for biology, then of course there are the mechanisms that lead the the structure, but you can also think about the function. And I would guess, I'm not sure, but I would guess that maybe this species based on larger insects or larger animals, and this is why they need to have like a more concentrated flow at specific points. points. In terms of uh nests, built nests, the most uh known and the most impressive are the nests made by termites and often seen from a distance look like just mounds in the environment. But if you take time to actually open them, as some researchers do, then you can look inside and you see these indicate sponge-like. Sponge-like structure, and I think this is the reason why I was in this session because you have two networks here. You're often you have like a network of galleries that are inhibited by ether mites, and then you have the dual of this network, which is the built fraction. And there is a lot of variability in the structures made by the mites and other insects. This is a different species, and a small fragment we can see tiny galvans that grow in all directions, and these are really men. All directions, and these are really meshed. Here is another species again where we have curved surfaces, and again, you have like galvis that move with many loops, which is the characteristics of all the beef structures. While the excavated structures, the typical example are the nests of ants that usually look like this when we see ants. When we see a nice column, that's their nest. But if you take time and pour some cluster inside, you can see that they can be quite big and complex. And in general, they don't make many loops. They just make loops, I think, when the galleries intersect. We can also repeat this kind of experiment in the lab to see the galleries grow. We see that they branch a lot. And looks like this. And looks happening in this case, but I think it's more because of the confinement in 2D, so that there is little space, the galleys collide and they intersect. Even if in theory they would have the ability to sense the presence of another gallery, maybe not ants, but some insects produce vibrations that they could sense through the ground if there are if there is an open sent somewhere else, or even tiny children for the air. And the branching often for these kinds of galleries is explained in terms of crowding. So when there are many mites excavating, at some point they start traffic jam, and at this point they start excavating on the side. But this kind of phenomenon which you have direct interactions between the insects are quite rare. We think that for most of these structures actually the direct interactions are not needed. And what really is Needed. And what really is the main method is what is called stigmatry, which is an idea that was put forward by Japan Grass√© in 1959. And the idea is that each individual insect just moves in the environment and finds cues in the environment. For instance, maybe a parallel of clay somewhere, and it will have like an instinctive response which consists in pay picking that parallel. Consists in picking like pilot. And maybe it finds another seamus which is a small pillar, and it will have the instinct of adding the pilot on top. But then maybe at later time, when this pillar has been grown, because many insects have the same sort of stimulus response, they will start forming a roof and so on. So by having a certain number, which could be potentially small, ideally small for us, of this stimulus response. Of these stimulus response actions, you should be able to produce complex structures. One example is the network of trains I showed you before, the one of Hermione's, but even others, smaller columns produce traits that move across space. And this is a topic that received a lot of interest because of an experiment done by other researchers in 1990, by John Jalen. As in 1919, by January and Burr and collaborators, in which they connected an ant's nest to a food source through a binary bridge, and they found that after some time, all the traffic of ants took place on a single branch. So, randomly, it could be on the branch A or B, but all the traffic went on a single branch. This was interesting in particular because if they go with two branches of different lengths, all the traffic goes. Length when the traffic goes on the shortest path. And so the computer scientists were really excited by this kind of method. And it happens because the ants move to space and they also release some ferromond where they go, okay? Which is like a chemical that attracts other ants. So when the first ant crosses the beach, it has to choose randomly. But by choosing, then it leaves some pheromon on one of the two. It leaves some pheromon on one of the two sides, and then more and more pheromon accumulates, so that in the end one single part is formed. First thing, if there is such a strong decision for one option, then it's very difficult to have not even loops, but even branches, you know, because there is a lot of amplification for one single part. And the idea was that one way to get this was that at the individual level, the probability for one anti-to. The probability for one to go, let's say, to the left, dependent on the pheromone, on the left and on the right of the branch, but with some non-linearity, with some strong exponent, that means that as soon as there is a little bit more pheromon, say, on the left, I will go to the left. And this brings the amplification. And one thing that we did some years ago now was trying to look empirically from experiments. Empirically from experiments, what was really the response of ants to pheromones. So we release 1,000 ants here, here is the exit of the column, and they come out, and then they start exploring the space, and they form this sort of trace that you see. And because it's a small arena, and we can film everything, and we can try to reconstruct the amount of pheromone at any given time based on the previous. Based on the previous passages of ants. Here is not very clear from the image, but it becomes dark, let's say, where the ants go. And then we can include some evaporation or not of pheromone. And then, once we have this map, we can look for each ant what the ant does in terms of changing direction depending on the pheromones, just in two regions, on the left and on the right. And we see that this. And we see that if there is, this is the difference between left and right, and we can see that if there is a lot of fermion on the right, it will turn to the right with a certain angle, and if there is a little less difference, then it will turn a little less, and it is linear, it's proportional to the difference between pheromone on the left and pheromone on the right. Okay, and then we can repeat this analysis for different amounts. Analysis for different amounts of total pheromones. Maybe I'm at a place where there is a lot of pheromon everywhere, or maybe I'm at a place where there is very little, okay, and do the same type of curves. And what turns out is that, yes, they turn in the direction of the highest difference, okay, but this response decreases. If there is a lot of pheromones, this turning uh is uh less. Is less steep. So, the actual relation that we can find is one that is similar to this, in which the turning angle depends on the difference and depends inversely from the total concentration. This is something that, as a biologist, we know that it's quite common in all animals. All sensory systems of animals tend to follow such a proportional relationship. I show you an example with like An example with like with a stimulus that you can also realize, like numbers. If we have to tell the difference between say, okay, here we have different groups of dots and they look, we can easily tell that here there are more and the difficulty of this task is similar when we increase the difference in proportion to the total number. Okay, this is what. Number. This is what is called Weber's law for sensory systems. And so again, I increased both, I had to increase the difference, I had to also increase the potential. And okay, there is something that is not entirely clear to me, but in a sense, one relation that we find is that if everyone applies this sort of Lebesgue, we get a probability for the individual to The probability for the individual to go, say, to the left or to the right, that is proportional to the attractiveness of the destination. And the attractiveness is described by this law, which if we try to implement this law, this rule for all the individuals in the population, what comes out is a term that is similar to an anti-diffusion. I don't know if it is you know, if it is just a random thing or or if it is something that is important in the sense that That is important in a sense that it's something that is as neutral as possible relative to the typical diffusion that you could have, but reverses it. So maybe this way of climbing the gradient that living systems have could be important or could just be just a random factor. I don't know in terms of modeling, you know, instead of just a time in proportion to the gradient, but in proportion to the gradient, but divided by. Proportional to the gradient, but divided by the local concentration. In any case, in this case, events, the response was linear, as Kippin slide, and we can still simulate the trail formation. This is the simulation, this is the real numbers. In the simulations, all the parameters are exactly measured from the experiment, so there is no uh freedom even in in the noise, and what we can see is that the the big difference is that really this there is more noisy. There is more noise in these movements. Because somehow ants probably have a proper perception, they can integrate movement over time. And so they don't, if they move left randomly at one time step, they are more likely at the next time step to compensate. If we reduce the amount of noise in the simulations, we can reproduce what is real, but here the amount of noise was really the one that we got from the data. Data. Another example of a structure that I showed before is these nests. And here we have the structure inside one of the thermal nests, the species of the termites. And you can see that these are really looping networks. The actual networks from the point of view of thermites is the galleries inside, but the scaffold is also a little bit. The scaffold is also a looping network. And also, in this case, the question is: what could be the stigmatic stimulus, the local feature that induces the mice to build a structure in this particular way? So there is an idea for which I should credit the fan in the first place. They go on by themselves, but it's fine, okay? Which is that, okay, if you want to build like a scaffold, but also uh surface. But also surfaces or other structures like these that join space, the growth is likely to happen at the tip of a killer, for instance, to grow this gill. If you want to have nest with surface, the growth should happen again at the edge of the surface. So all the places where there is a lot of local curvature. Okay, the most curved places should be those. Curved places should be those that draw more. And this qualitative idea was implemented by Giulio Fartini, who is in the audience, but I think he's not going to talk about this, or not exactly, in the computational model some time ago, in which essentially the structure is represented as like a phase field in which we have like empty space, which is essentially. This space, which is essentially zero, and this space, which are the walls of the nest, which have values, say, one. And this structure grows on the surface, so at the point in between these values of one and zero, through a certain function. And this function is the local curvature. So here we have a laptop. Here we have the Laplacian, but the regions with the highest curvature determine the depositions. And then you have this F times minus F is a saturation because you don't want the growth to happen in the open space. They can only happen at the surface. So where this phase field is is around uh zero five in meter. And then there was a smoothing ingredient. And there was a smoothing ingredient. And this model looked like promising from the point of view of growing this type of structures. So you have pillars going, they branch, which is good, and they also reconnect. Yep, five minutes, but it's fine, I think. The question is, okay, can we prove then that this is actually the model that corresponds to what the Correspond to what the mice do. So, one way to do this was to try and test in the lab with some artificial stimuli that have particular features. For instance, pillars or walls. Why these features? Because, for instance, in the pillars, you would expect the region with the highest curvature to be the top of the pillar, and in fact, Of the pillar, and in fact, the positions that are here in the different columns tend to happen in those regions at the top. In a wall, you have two possibilities. If it was just the elevation that was important, all the depositions would happen at the edge on the top. But in addition, the corners here also have a higher curvature. So the fact that the depositions happen here at the corners also mean that Also, mean that curvature potentially is a good stimulus. So, this made us very happy seeing this draw at the points of higher curvature. Except that there were also many depositions here when the edge of clay is almost completely flat, but still the mice preferred to deposit pellets of clay. And here, the same. Okay. So what was a possible stimulus that there might sense that is not curvature directing, but it correlates with curvature and could explain this pattern of deposition. The stimulus that we identified was the gradient of evaporation. So the regions here at the tip of the pillars have those with higher curvature, which in different Which in diffusive regime are also those where the evaporation is stronger, at least. And the edges of the caves are, of course, flat from a point of view of curvature, but because there is an edge between a dry region and a wet region, they act as curved features from the point of view of evaporation. So one way to test this was to repeat the experiment, but without using edited mites and just putting some And just putting some salty solution inside the clay so that when the water evaporates, the salt forms crystals, and the position of these crystals matches the growth of the genus in the middle. So in this example, we have a stimulus which is evaporation gradient that matches with the curvature. But I think we wanted to talk about this here in this audience because I think. Here in this audience, because I think there is still something that you know doesn't work completely because we are at the interface between the model of like diffusion-limited aggregation or something similar in which you would then form loops and only when you look at the curvature alone you have these loops. So there is still something that probably if this was completely diffusive, you wouldn't be able to. If you wouldn't be able to produce structures with lobes, that must be something else at some point in the explanation. I'm quickly finishing, but I just wanted to because I think it's my task to talk about social instincts, just I wanted to summarize what I think about these structures in general that we can try to generalize. In terms of traits, so what we see is that What we see is that we observe for sure branching phenomena. Loops tend to be a bit rare, perhaps, because of this reason. It's very difficult to have at the same time a mechanism where you converge all the traffic on one single branch and where you have two branches persistent. But this mechanism that they should, in which they respond to Fermi, by Weber's law, Fermon by Weber's law means that when the traffic on both branches is high, so the denominator of my Weber's law is high, then a small difference wouldn't change things too much. So once if there is a branch, then the branch is likely to remain stable once it is well established. But it's very difficult to explain the formation of branches. And the mechanism that intuitively could bring to this are collisions of Are collisions of some traits coming from different directions. And the other thing is traffic targeting, which has been shown in some circumstances when there is a lot of traffic on the train and maybe some obstacles at the sides, that means that they are obliged to find another path on the other side. And then there is all a story about branching angles in the literature, but there are too few data, which I think could be relevant in the Which I think could be relevant in relation to what has been done for rivers, but has never been studied, really. Not just because of the quantification of the angle, which is more like a technical thing, but also because there are reasons to believe that ants can use these angles to orientate themselves on the trail. You know, when you move here, they don't even know if they are coming from the nest or they are coming from the food source. And the branches are often asymmetric, like this. Often asymmetric, like this, and this could provide you some different parts. So, this is a not to explore story. In terms of the nests, there are many different forms, and so it would be interesting to find a common mechanism that can explain all these different forms, maybe varying parameters. And in general, there are many loops in all the build structures. And this is quite the opposite of. And this is quite the opposite of what we have for like excavated structures, in which, yes, we have branching, but loops are very rare. Even if in theory it could be possible to produce more loops, because they can sense vibrations through the ground, they have totisections, so I can show it here today. But if they are going in one direction, excavating and there is an obstacle, then they turn the obstacle and then continue in the right direction. So they could probably find. So, they could probably find the same way to come back and make a loop, but they don't do it. And so, this is another story. There are no loops next to metrics. And I have to say, everything that I wanted to say, a bit confused because I didn't know before or now what I wanted to say, but thank you. So what would happen if you switched on a fun above the clay experiment? Yes, so if there are external stimuli, I know that in this clay experiment, I don't know, but I know that for instance the galleries inside, if there is a trunk of tree with the mats inside and there is wind from one direction, they sense in the the way of its damage. So they are they are very sensitive to That that makes sense if you have to add patterns. Because I was saying that, yeah, for example, affection of hair would impact the lock evaporation. Yes, it would. It's difficult to do in the experiments in the sense because it would be possible to do in future buttons. But in a way, we also have reached because you mentioned about this problem: that the attachment problem produces the loops, and we suddenly the diffusion of evaporation, then. then it wouldn't produce loops, but if you have, for example, out of action in the system and you only have an operation like the change of the community would Julia wants to reply I think because it's not easy that if you do you want to already reply or should I finish you can finish anyway I guess who knows but it's a very good question yeah yeah so you So I was saying that if you have wind, then the change of humidity will be very close to the end. In a way, the two branches, the two structures will not see until they are actually so what we explain the order of magnitude. Of course, the first thing you go with the The faster you go with the wind, let's say, your boundary area will be smaller, so that this pillar, the TD would be more than the distance of the boundary area. But actually, even in normal conditions, with no wind, there is natural convection. This is true. And what we estimate, which is quite intriguing actually, is that the thickness of the boundary layer here is of the size. So the boundary layer here is the size of the termites, which is what actually allowed termites to survive. They stay in this diffusive layer, which is almost like 100%. So actually, this could be one of the reasons why you could have this reconnection, even if you are in diffused news. I mean, you can say that they go out with the anti-bounded layer, and so they can do the requirement. And so they can do the reconnection. Of course, at some point, you can also say, okay, there are still animals that have some capabilities, and maybe when there is another, just above your head, and you can just reconnect because of behavioral modules, not because of just the same mechanism that has to work every time. But uh I understand that Kerr might have built quite intricate large-scale compilation mechanisms to do mask changing regulation. Yes. Is that all sort of held within the rules that you're finding? Or do you need to get this? So everything that I showed today is not directly related to the species of the mice that make ventilation channels. I guess the main difference is the scale, because the size of the peeler, we are close to the boundary layers, we are in almost a viscous regime. While there are some species of termites that make mouths like four or five meters of height, and then they have like some ventilation channels, and they are sensitive to air currents as well. So I guess it's the same thing on a different scale and A different scale, and so the difference of scales means that you cannot really speak about that because it's not equivalent anymore, it's a different thing. But yes, I guess it's the same idea that they probably keep implementing. I think it might have started evolutionary from the very beginning when they were, you know, escapating wood. And even at that point, there is a benefit if you have a palette to close the whole. If you are the pilot to close the hole because they are very sensitive to the situation. So probably it started from little like Daniel girl. Opening up the discussion to all of our speakers. I could, I guess, thinking about the growth of the cells from and then in the nests that were confined in 2D, we had collisions. Confinement and loops seem to be is that a is that a Is that a relationship that we can probe? Even in Tolmash's experiments, the tendency is to repel one another, but then if you're confined in some geometry, then you run into one another, it's going to play nicely. Forming a circulatory system, well, early on there is a process, a different process, but later on, like wound healing and later stages of development, these sprouting angiogenesis, in other words, vessels form sprouts. And so to form a flowing pathway, a sprout has to find another vessel somehow. And in two-dimensional models, that's rather easy. Models that's rather easy because any vessel growing has a high probability of colliding with another vessel eventually. And actually, when the vessel does find another vessel, it does form what's called an anastomosis with it. In other words, it does form a patent flow pathway with it. So, in our earlier menu, I'll talk tomorrow about this, but in early 2D models of angiogenesis, that's not such a problem. But in three dimensions, generically, Mentions generally a sprout will never find another vessel if it's just growing stochastically. And in the case of endothelial cells and growth of sprouts, there is a special kind of endothelial cell at the leading point called the tip cell that has philopodia that are exploring the territory ahead of it. And in our model, we have to assume. In our model, we have to assume the ability of a kind of homing mechanism where that growing sprout can find within some reasonable radius, which is not extremely small, well, it's 50 microns, not 5 microns, put it that way, that it can find any other vessel in that neighborhood and latch onto it. So that's the situation as far as I understand for blood vessels. And I think any other network. And I think any other network that grows in three dimensions by sprouting, if it's going to have loops, there must be such a mechanism. I don't know what it can be, but there has to be some kind of holding mechanism because otherwise it's not going to work. There is also the opposite problem that networks that have to grow in confinement but they don't want to loop, they have, I guess, anti-homing mechanisms where they Mechanisms where they sense when there is another vessel and they stop growing, like the I think the lymphatic system does that, and there are other neurons, for example, when they grow, they don't anastomose, they don't want to anastomose sense, I guess, and they stop growing. So yeah, there is of course a complete difference between systems that are essentially tree-like and systems that are essentially circular. Systems that are essentially circulatory systems in that sense. There is some sort of a mystic. Panzer, could you please speak louder? Yes. Okay. In the images of the blood vessels that we have seen, and also in the models, we tend to forget that there is a tissue around the vessels. Tissue around the vessels, the tubes, they are not floating vacuum. They are inside a sort of a beat, a tissue. So, you see, when you speak of confinement, you have endothelial cells, but the endothelial cells, they are not walking around in business just in the hope that they are going to touch another cell. They are going across a thin mass. A thin mass of clusterized cells which are granular, and when an endotegeneal cell goes across that maze, it adheres by addition molecules to the clusters of cells which are there, and it basically tends to loop around. So, in the first place, the normal propagation of endotel cells across a layer of tissue consists Of tissue consists in making an enormous quantity of roots, about the cells which are infracted. So, the very fact that the tissue before devascularized granular favors a tendency of the material cells to make little loops allow the cell. But now, there is another consequence, is that since there is this tissue in between the cells, when you The cells, when you do a modeling of growth of blood vessels, if you forget that there is tissue in between the cells, you forget the interaction between the tissue and the adotierial cell and the vessels. And typically what we see at least in the gut, in the colonatoid membrane, in the retina, I don't know because I don't know of any time-lapse imaging of retina formation, but in the colony membrane, you can very clearly see. Membrane, you very clearly see that there is a metabolic activity in the tissue which is related to the presence of the blood vessels. So, if you think of blood vessels, blood vessels is sea water, sea water, but the tissue is fat. So, basically, the metabolism of
