These schools and the animal model that we ended up selecting was zebrafish. So, zebrafish, I've seen a lot of talks on zebrafish as well, it's a pretty good animal in the sense that it has a lot of advantages that make it very amenable for using it in the lab. The one that was most important to me was that it is a highly social. That it is a highly social animal. Indeed, you can observe that they display sociality even as they interact with animals from different species. And that was actually pretty good for us as we wanted to integrate robots. Then they also have, they are cheap to maintain, they are less efficient than other animals. You can maintain them pretty easily. They don't require a lot of work. Require a lot of work and they have a lot of homologies at genetic and neural levels with humans. The ones that are very, very important are those related to diseases. So even though genetically they may not be very similar to us, when it comes to the genes that are involved with diseases, they have a lot of similarities, as high as 90%. So people have used them for tons of studies in which they tried to dissect and To dissect and disentangle the etiology of different diseases for humans. Then they reproduce pretty well, although I struggled always to reproduce them in the lab, but it is possible. Then the intergeneration time is shorter, which is pretty nice if you want to study development. So if you want to include to understand the effect of, for example, Effect of, for example, specific drugs on the developmental trajectory of an animal, your development is short. So you can do these high-throughput experiments in which, in a short time, you can learn and understand how a specific drug can impinge on a specific developmental trajectory. And then there are a lot of exciting things which are above my pay grade, which relate to the possibility to genetic manipulation. To do genetic manipulations, and something that I think is really exciting is that when these animals are young, when at the larval stage or early juvenile, you can actually see their brain. The skull is transparent. So, people have come up with experimental techniques in which they can add dye in the brain and then be able to map behavior into neural activity. So, that is really exciting. It's not what I do, and it's pretty different. And it's pretty different, but I think it's a very nice path forward for the use of these animals. All right, so there are tons of studies which are conducted with zebrafish spanning from oncology, toxicology, developmental biology, and cardiovascular research. Tons of papers, about 10,000 per year are devoted to studying zebrafish. Among those, the ones that we're interested are in the area of behavioral neuroscience. So we do behavioral work. So we are not doing many, many. We are not doing many, many manipulations. So, by setting the stage on why we do zebrafish work, let me go back 15 years, so many, many years when Nigo was a student actually with me and we came up with this wonderful robot that was the state-of-the-art technology in the lab. And yes, it was really nice. We were all very happy. So, we had this biology student. So, we had this biology student, Giovanni, who came to visit. It was spectacular. He came up with a lot of ideas on how we should build a robot that would be easily integrated with animals. So, what he came up with was making the pigment coloration brighter. So, having something really, really bright in yellow, making bigger stripes, because stripes are an indication of social behavior. Then, he also came up with the idea. Then I also came up with the idea of making a bigger belly for the animal, because the bigger belly would resemble a fertile female, which based on studies on interaction between males and males, males and females and females and females, ended up to be a more conducive way to reduce aggression in the group. But then he joined a group where the robotics was not the main strength. So this was me and Nicole doing the design. Was me and Nicole doing the design, and the ultimate thing is this robot that is five times the size of a live animal, and that's the best we could do. So we were a little skeptical on how this would work, because while biologically it had a lot of features that were good from the biological point of view, the size was so big that we were worried that it would just scare the hell out of the animals. In any case, Animals. In any case, we ended up doing the experiment. It took a while, we had different approaches to do. And the way we ended up doing the experiment is within what is called a preference test. So in a preference test, what you do is basically... This is not, is it running? No. Okay, so believe me, I'm gonna pretend I am a fish. So, what will happen? Fish. So, what will happen in a preference test? You have two tanks, you have two compartments, one on the left and one on the right, and in the two compartments, you place your stimuli. So, in this case, what we do, we put the robot on the left compartment, and on the right compartment, you create a visual background that matches whatever is on the other side, except of the robot. And then you have a focal subject. Then you have a focal subject, an animal, which is swimming in the central compartment, and we measure the position of the animal in the tank. And what we say is that if the animal spends more time in the vicinity of the robot, then the animal likes the robot more than the empty compartment. So we somehow study what is called special preference. Special preference. So we try to interrogate the animal on what it likes by seeing where the animal spends the time in the tank. So that's how you do the experiment. There are many, many covers and cares that you need to place when designing the experiment. Very importantly, we need to run the experiment for a while because initially the animal will just be attracted toward the robot no matter what Attracted toward the robot no matter what, and this causes a novelty effect. So the animal may be curious of seeing what's going on and go to the end to the robot no matter what. So even if it were, even if it was appraising the robot as a predator. So when we run the experiment, you run it for 20, 25 minutes, and the first 10 minutes you need to trash because that is just exploration. Then you want to have this compartment so that you can see that there are. So that you can see that there are walls. The walls are actually useful because you don't want the animal to hide below the fish, below the robot. The robot is big, so you don't want that the animal ends up finding shelter behind the robot and then not operating the robot as a stimulus, but just as a rock behind which you want to hide. So the compartments are useful. Yes, and then the compartments. Yes, and then the compartments also they prevent the stimulation through a lateral line. So, what you do by adding a wall, you can try somehow to separate visual cues from flow cues and enhance the visual simulation with respect to the flow stimulation. So, that was the rationale for the experiment. And now, if you look at the data, the results were actually surprisingly good. Actually, surprisingly good. What we found is that the animal is happy being in the vicinity of the robot. What we do in order to score preference, we divide the central compartment into three blocks. We have two blocks which are about 10 centimeters, and then there is the central one which is the indirect, so it's 30 centimeters, it's a little bigger. And what we observe, we are comparing the time spent. Are comparing the time spent in the vicinity of the robot compartment with respect to the empty compartment. And what we find is that there is indeed a strong preference toward the robot. The animal is spending twice the time than the empty compartment. Interestingly, if you put a group of four, preference is a little reduced, but is not abolished. So there is some inertia of being in a group, but you still see that the group is. Will see that the group is spending time in the vicinity of the robot. So, this is surprising, it's exciting. So, the robot is actually doing something, but it's attracting the group. Then, the natural question is, is the robot seen as another animal? And then you get back to reality. You do the experiment by putting a live animal in the empty compartment, and you are able to see that the robot is indeed able. Is indeed able, the animal is indeed able to tell the difference between the robot and the fish and is spending more time in the vicinity of the fish. So the robot, this robot here was far from being perfect, but is an attractive stimulus. It has a lot of caveats. And then over the years, we tried to fill those gaps by taking different routes that can help. Different routes that can help us closing the gap between a robot that would be attractive and a robot that could actually be seen as a live animal by other fish. So there are a lot of gaps. Let's go around them. And so, number one, the visual appearance. I mean, this guy is five times the size. So, certainly, you want to do work to make it. Certainly, you want to do work to make it tighter, to make it smaller. That's for sure. Then, also, the robot that you see here, the only thing it does, it beats the tail with one degree of freedom. That's not how an animal swim. It's much, much richer. I mean, here we are basically putting the robot on a stick and then it beats the tail. Locomotory pattern is something much richer. The animal will engage in a much more complex way. So, how do we do that? So, we want the So, how do we do that? So, we want the animal to be able to swim. And then, also, the robot that we tested so far is completely unresponsive to the animal. The robot will beat the tail at a certain frequency no matter what. It's not responding to the animal, which is also a big limitation. If you have two animals interacting, they bi-directional exchange information. I give you something, you give me something else. Give me something else. In this case, that's not the case. The animal responds to the robot, and the robot doesn't do anything. So, over the years, we tried to fill this gap, and we have done a lot of work in this direction. So, the latest platform that we have developed is borrowed technically from what a 3D printer would do. So, think about a two-dimensional Cartesian manipulator. Manipulator where you have a motion of one point, and the idea is that you take a tank in 2D, you place this machine below the tank, and then with a magnet, you move a robot that is inside the tank. So it's a very simple idea, and this is a commercial thing. I mean, what you buy is just a Cartesian XY platform, so you can buy it off the shelf. There are some tweaks to do. There are some tweaks to do, but technically it's not a big deal. And you can see on the right that this is without the tank on top. You can see that we have a little replica there. And we are able to move the replica in two dimension. And we are also able to rotate the replica in place. You can see that, right? There is a little replica. My screen is, yeah, I cannot point. Let's see. Yeah, I can. You can see here. you can see here so that's the replica here i can play it again so here you see the manipulator moving right which is this part and then later on we show what happens if you add the replica on top which we can move it as well so by doing that we can get 2d motion which is great and with the 2d motion very very refined we can have the animal swimming together with the robot which is great Together with the robot, which is great. The robot, we can make it very, very tiny because whatever we do is offload the labor outside the little replica. The little replica will become just a puppet. It just moves from the outside with a magnet. So the replica, we can actually make it really, really nice. So what we can do, we can make it in silicon so that it will kind of offbeat the tail by passive drag. By passive drug, we can make something that matches very closely the animal in coloration, in size. We can put the 30-bear eye to look like the animal, and then you have the base, and then you move it around. It's pretty good. Then, what we do in real time, we can track the position of the animal, and then we can use that position to feed into the platform. Feed into the platform and be able to control the motion of the replica in real time as a function of what the animal is doing. So that's the idea. So you have a closed loop system in which the replica is just silly, it's just a little plastic thing. You track the position of the animal in real time, you feed it into a control system that moves the platform, and you are able to implement these interactive experiments. Interactive experiments. So, the first interactive experiment that we have done is actually pretty nice. It's a model-based feedback control. So, what we have done, we have implemented on the platform a set of stochastic differential equations that we developed separately to describe the collective behavior of zebrafish groups. So, in this sense, we are some In this sense, we are somehow trying to experimentally validate the accuracy of mathematical models of collective behavior by running them in real time on some of the elements of the group and seeing how the other animals are appraising this behavior and responding to it. So, it's somehow a nice way to test the validity of a mathematical model by intervening on the biological system itself. So, the experiment. So the experiment that we have done is only with two units. One of them is the robot, the other is the fish. And what we do, we control in real time the turn rate and the linear speed of the robot. And we do that with a model that is based on the collective behavior of the animals. So let me show you how the model works. So the model is based on the very, very early work. Based on this very, very early work that we did in the lab on modeling the behavior of individual fish. So, what you see is that if you take an individual fish and you track the turn rate of the animal, you observe that this turn rate has this gentle oscillation that are related to the tail bit motion of the animal. And then sometimes there are these sudden turns, a U-turn or a C-turn, that reverberate. That reverberates into an extreme event of some sort in the time series. So, if you plot the time series of the turn rate, the red lines here are three standard deviation. So, what you observe is that there are many, many instances in which the animal is changing the turn rate above what a Gaussian would prescribe, which suggests. Which suggests that a classical Angevin model wouldn't work, because if you get a standard Gaussian, there is nothing you can do to capture the distribution. There are tails that require a special treatment to be captured. These tails are these events in which you exceed three times the standard deviation, and they are very, very frequent, actually. Okay, so based on that, we introduced what we call the jump persistent turning worker. The jump persistent turning worker, which is a stochastic mirror-related jump diffusion process. So you can see that there are two terms. The one there is this term that you see here, which is just the reversion. So you have that if there is no noise, the animal will end up swimming with zero turn rate, meaning just swim straight. Just went straight. Now, if you start perturbing it, the animal will start to oscillate somehow. And the perturbation that we are adding is in the form of additive noise, which has two contributions. One contribution is white noise, which will be what you get with Brownian Moshe, for example, which is a Langevin process. And that one will give you a Gaussian in terms of distribution. And then to that, And then to that we add the jump process, which you can think about it as a series of Gaussian amplitude that happens with a Poissonian clock. So at every time step, you have a Bernoulli variable that tells you if the jump, if there is this kick or if there is not this kick. And if you have that kick, And if you have the kick, the kick will have a Gaussian amplitude. So, in total, you have four parameters to estimate. Two of them are related to the basic Langevin equation, which are the relaxation rate and the strength of the white noise. And two of them are they pertain to the jump process. So, the addition of this jump process is actually pretty nice because if you look at Because if you look at the QQ plot, it allows you to get details of the distribution. If you don't put the jump process, you will have that this guy will deviate really fast. It will go like this, because you don't have a mechanism to capture the tails. The tails of the distribution are the C-turn and the U-turns, which biologically are very, very important because most likely it's what you want to use. Likely is what you want to use to signal a change in direction to the others in the group. So we really cannot miss them. They are important because they trigger social behavior and social response. In the group, this is the commodity that you may want to use to change the response of the collective. Okay, so this is the model of a unit. And what we do is we integrate them in the group. So if you put it in the context of the group, we are doing a couple of The group, we are doing a couple of things. Uh, we are making the robot. So, if you go back with the robot, this is the robot model. So, the robot is adjusting the robot is adjusting the angular rate with jump process, the inner process, and then there is a relaxation. However, we add some more stuff because we want the Because we want that the robot is adjusting to the presence of the fish. This one is captured by the social interaction, and the social interaction encapsulates repulsion, alignment and attraction. Then you want that the robot is not hitting the walls, so you also add wall avoidance. And then you also want that the robot. Want that the robot doesn't go ballistic, meaning when the robot has to do a turn, you want that that turn happens at a low speed, right? It's like when you drive the bicycle, if you have to make a turn, you don't want to accelerate during the turn. So what we want is that we want to modulate the noise as a function of the speed. And then we have a separate equation for the speed. For the speed, what For the speed, what we would like is to also accelerate and decelerate as a function of what the animal is doing. We also want a social interaction there, and then we want to go slower when we are making the turn. So, this is basically the model that we implement. I will not show you the details of the internal cavity on the social interaction because they are ugly. But technically, what you do, you do attraction, repulsion, and alignment. You do more or less, you repel from the. More or less, you repel from the wall and then you slow down when you make the turn. That's the idea. All right, so now we are, we can, yes, so now we can implement our experiments. So these one are experiments with two fish. So that is the control condition. The two animals swim in together. You can see what they do. So you can see when there is a big change, it's really when they start interacting. So the tails in the distribution. The details in the distributions are important. That's how the control condition will look like. And then, in a bit, you will see what happens when we have the experimental conditions. We have a couple of them. One of them, we have the robot swimming in open loop, and then the other, the robot swims in closed loop. In open loop, the robot is unresponsive to the animal. To the animal is just implementing the stochastic differential equation to zoom, and then you set all the gains for attraction, repulsion, and alignment to zero. And that's how the experiment would look like. So you see, the animal is happy to see this robot moving around, but the robot is not doing anything to respond to the animal. It's just swimming by itself. And you see, the swimming is very natural. It looks like the animal, more or less. There are this interaction. When he goes close to the wall, he avoids it. Close to the wall, he avoids it. There are some sudden changes, and now if you close the loop, we are able to actually do much, much better. So, you can see how this looks like. So, you can see that the robot is engaging the animal and responding to it, similar to what two fish would do by implementing these pseudo-stochastic differential equations. Yeah, there are some instances. This one we cannot do much where there is the turning in place, but beyond that, I think we were very happy with this. Yes. Okay, there you go. So if you compare time series, you will see that the animal is indeed sharing very similarly with the robot, they swim similarly. If you compare the distribution, although distribution matches very well, we are able to replicate very closely. We are able to replicate very closely the locomotory patterns of the animal, which is great. Then, when we talk about social interaction, things get a little hazy. So, let's see. So, you have that polarization is excellent. Like the two of them have perfect agreement. So, you can be very happy. You can say, look, the robot is doing the same as the live fish. But you need to take with a grain of salt. Need to take with a grain of salt because the experiment doesn't show any instance of alignment. So the values that you get for polarization are the same as chance. So the experiment doesn't show that the two animals are schooling. The interaction is primarily some form of schooling. So the graph on the left, it looks good, but biologically, it doesn't tell you much. It tells you that the animals don't school and the robot and the end. Don't school, and the robot and the animal don't school. So it's like, okay, but nothing special. On the right-hand side, instead, you see that if you compare the distance between the two live animals and the distance between the robot and the fish in open loop, and the distance between the robot and the fish in closed loop, you observe that all of them are less than chance. That all of them are less than chance, which means that we are able to replicate some form of cohesion, of shoaling with a robot, similar to what happens with live animals. However, the robot doesn't do as well as the live fish. If you look at the two fish swimming, they maintain a distance of about five centimeters. If we do the experiment in Sorazar, In sorry, there is a if we do the experiment in a closed loop, that distance is 15 centimeters. So the robot is, yeah, Alicia, Aleta, go tell me. I just had a question. So when you talk about the distance, are you doing center of fish to center of robot? Okay, so because it looks like the replica is a little bit bigger when you consider the base? Yes, it's a little bit bigger. Yeah, there may be a factor too. Yeah, the base is a little bigger. Yeah, the base is a little bigger. Let's see here. Yes, the base is a little bigger and it also stretches forward and backward. Still, it's I don't think that explains. I think the explanation is more that we did a good job, but not a spectacular job, in the sense that we are at 15 centimeters in distance compared to five. So I think we can gain a couple of centimeters with the platform. Couple of centimeters with the platform argument, but I think there is still a factor telling that the replica is still not perceived as a live animal. However, it's much better than before. I mean, there's wind similarly, there is a good interaction, but I think there is still a gap to fill. And is it a 2D distance or 3D? 2D. This is purely 2D. Although you can, yeah, I tried all that because I, yeah, we can argue that there is a some other. Can we can argue that there is some other uncertainty with the water depth? I can gain a few things, but from 5 to 15 is good, but it's not, yeah. So, but that I think it was, I call it success. I think it's good. And now, what we have done with the replica, we actually did a couple, we did one experiment, which I was really, really happy. And the experiment was about seeing if this replica can teach something. If this replica can teach something to the animals, so we wanted to understand if it was possible to have social learning. So the experiment is very neat. What we have is you have two doors, door one and door two, and you have a live animal that is in a beaker. And what we would like is that the animal knows, understands what is of the two, the correct door. Correct door only one of them will open so that they can gain the reward. Reward is seeing the other friends that are over here. So this is a very typical experiment that you do it with mouse. Mouse, however, are able to pull a lever. These guys can't put a lever, so we have to do some labor so that we have a non-contact system that can open a gate if the animal is in the vicinity of the door. Is in the vicinity of the door. Now, what we want to do, we want to add the robot in the loop so that the robot can demonstrate which is the correct door. And what we want to understand if that demonstration can actually help the fish recognizing the correct door. So, there are two pieces we want to show. First, that zebra fish can learn, and second, that the robot can. And second, that the robot can facilitate the learning. So the experiment looks like this. There is an ampiduation phase in which the robot is swimming outside of the tank, outside of the beaker, so that the little fish is able to see the robot around and it gets used to that. So that's the habitation phase. And then you see there are this. Then you see there are this part, and this part are the two transparent doors. The same animal, we do 20 trials on them in multiple days so that we can get their memory up and recognize which is the correct door. So, for each animal, we know which is the right door. All right. So, you see now the robot is demonstrating what is the right door. So, the robot is what the robot did, the robot. The robot did the robot sat in front of the door and showed to the animal that that's the right door. Stay in front, it will open. Then it goes back, the door closes, and it does it a few times. So there is this social demonstration. Then after everything is done, after the ambiguation stage, yes, I don't remember how long is this. I hope it's not 10 minutes, but But we will see at a certain time. I mean, these are long and then they happen many times. Yes. So, yes. So, now you see the robot is there. That doesn't open. I mean, you try to make it easy for the animal. Let's see. At a certain time, no, no, no, we don't want to start it again. Yes, wait, wait, wait, wait. I have to do something. Wait. I have to do. How do I do? Oh, here it is. I can do here. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. All right. Yes. Yes. So at the end, the robot takes this position. The robot takes this position, where the robot is symmetrically positioned with respect to the two doors, the bad and the good. And now we release the bigger, we take the bigger out, the fish now is free in the environment, and now the easier exploration. And now we want now what you want: you want to measure the time the animal takes to find the right door, and also we want. Right door. And also, we want to measure the time that it spends in front of the right versus the wrong door. So these are the two metrics. One is, yes, you saw, and it did it. So, yeah, he did it. The animal is very happy. And now we'll go on the other side and join the friends. Eventually. Yes, I mean, these are not smart as a rat, but they can do the task. Okay, good. The task. Okay, good. So, if you look at the data, what is nice is actually we can experimentally see that the animal is able to learn. It takes them 20 trials to get to improve the result. Initially, they start 50-50. They cannot tell the difference between left and right door. You do 20 trials and they reach 60. So, I mean, there is something. Then, with the presence of the social internet. Presence of the social interaction with the robot, there is a tiny improvement, not as much, but there is something. So they are able to better point and orient faster. So that was a nice demonstration of the platform in a different context of social learning. Now, more lately, what we have been doing is something that it's a little different in the sense that we wanted to get rid. Wanted to get rid of the mathematical model. It doesn't mean that we wanted to do some machine learning stuff, which I'm ethically not there in favor. We wanted to do something which was a fish-based. So it's different. So the idea is we wanted to do Star Trek. So what we do, we want to teleport one animal from a tank to the other one so that it will behave like the robot. So the idea is very cool. So you have here. Is very cool. So you have here is the fish, fish is here, and it's with me with the replica imagine. And now the replica is not driven by a mathematical model, but the replica is copying what another fish is doing in another tank as they interact with another replica. So you basically can have two, like yeah, it's really just like subtract. You have two animals, two objects, two entities that are in. Two entities that are interacting through some physical medium while not being in the same physical space, and that one is actually pretty neat because you can start to disentangle stuff. You can, for example, do some kind of mismatch between appearance and behavior. You can have a fish that is very big that behaves like a fish that is very small because you are copying the behavior of something that. Are copying the behavior of something that doesn't match what you look like, so that was the idea. So, that is the behavioral teleporting experiment. So, you have on one side of the tank, we have a replica and a fish. And the replica is copying the behavior of a fish that is on the other tank interacting with a replica. So, you are basically coupling the two fish by making them. By making them swim as if they were in the same place, but in reality, they have two robots in between mediating their interaction. So what we can do with this concept is we can do these mismatches, which are really nice. So what we can do is stuff like this. Let me show you first what I want to show you. Yes, so we have criteria for the excluding experiment, but I don't think that's too interesting. Experiment, but I don't think that's too interesting. I'll show you this instead. So, for example, what you have is in the control experiment, I have a big fish swimming with a small fish, meaning that I have a fish, say, of two centimeters swimming with another of four. So, bigger, small. And they swim together. And you want to understand who is influencing more the other, hypothetically. Now, I can do the match condition. In the match condition, I have the big. I have the big fish swimming with the small replica. In the other tank, I have a big replica swimming with a small fish. And now I copy the small fish on the small replica and I copy the big fish on the big replica. So in this case, I should be getting the same experimental result. The same experimental results as the control condition. The only thing I am doing, I am adding the hardware layer in which there is this behavioral teleporting. What is instead really cool is now you can flip big and small replica and you can do something like the one on the right. In this case, what I can do, I'm done, in this case, what you can do is you can have the big fish swimming with the big replica. Swimming with the big replica, but the big replica is behaving as a small fish. So, this is kind of nice. You can start mismatching behavior with visual appearance. And by making these dissonant, by creating these dissonances, you can try to understand what are the basis of a social interaction. Yes, I'm done. I'm done. Oh, okay. Yes, so that's the so basically we are able to, if I look at basically we are able to if i look at the influence i am able with the match condition to replicate the same as the control if i do the mismatch instead i can flip it's kind of nice all right so i'm done over time as usual and so these are all the people that work on the project these are the three papers i showed there are more if you're interested but the minis are kind of nice because they show a nice story so thank you thank you very much and sorry for the lateness for not being there for everything The lateness for not being there for everything. Alejanda. Sure. I have a bunch of questions, but you should ask one or two while Mark always sets up. Sorry. I couldn't hear that. You can ask, want to ask a couple while Mark sets up the next talk. Yeah, just one of, that's fine. With the tanks, did you try with any bigger tanks or with... Try with any bigger tanks or with any more fish? Uh, no, on this one, on this one, no, because this one, the experiment that we have for this one, it's only two fish and bigger tank, I cannot, I can only do smaller tank, and we did smaller, but bigger I can't because the platform has a working space and we take all the working space. So that I cannot do. We have done 3D though. We have done 3D, though. We have done 3D. I have experiments in which we flip the platform and we have another thing that moves them up and down. So we explore a bigger space. Ah, okay. Okay. I don't want to take too much time. Thank you. So I'll ask you separately. Thank you.
