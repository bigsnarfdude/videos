As the central question at this interface of cosmology and string theory, I apologize for not being very broad in my coverage. A few minutes is not enough for this subject, which after all covers the entire history of the universe, as well as one speculative takes, but that of string theory on it. To my thinking, there are three categories of obvious questions for this interface, and then there are a number of questions that arise that are possibly very. That are possibly very interesting, but less obvious. Three obvious questions are: what, if anything, does this theory have to say about dark energy? What, if anything, does string theory have to say about what came, you know, early in the universe, I would say maybe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which may be our last really solid anchor on early universe physics, but it could be much earlier than that. You know, probably there was an electroweak transition, possibly there was unification. So, what came before Big Bang? You know, what led to the hot Big Bang? And then finally, there is a question. And then finally, there is a question that quantum gravity aficionados should never forget, which is: suppose something like inflation is true, there's still a prior question. What came before inflation? How does the universe originate? It's not completely obvious that this is scientifically addressable, but I have to say it wasn't completely obvious when inflation was proposed that it would lead to experimental tests, and it's led to a really rich suite of tests. So, this is a good question to keep in the back of your mind. Now, why did I pick these three questions as opposed to zillions of others? Well, these three in particular are at least very naive. Particular are at least very naively sensitive to ultraviolet physics of the sort offered by a completion like string theory. There are many other very interesting questions that can or cannot be sensitive to ultraviolet physics depending on what happens. But I think these three questions almost without a doubt are sensitive, and I'll talk about why. So there's a reason string theory or some other ultraviolet completion might be relevant. So I'm going to take these questions. I'll work in reverse chronological order starting up here. And I have to say, I'm not going to say anything about how the universe originated. It's a great question. I don't think we. It's a great question. I don't think we have any theoretical frameworks in which to address it. Okay, so what do we know about the dark energy? Well, the easiest way to get accelerated expansion of the sort first seen in the supernova experiments in the late 90s is by postulating the universe is filled with some kind of fluid with pressure equal to W times rho as an equation of state. So W is this equation of state parameter. And whenever W is less than minus one-third, which is a little bit unconventional, you get accelerated. Dimensional, you get accelerated expansion. Now, that leaves the big set between minus one-third and roughly speaking, minus one, which is where most physicists of taste cut off the allowed equations of state. Some of my colleagues occasionally vary past that, but there are good reasons to think minus one is sort of a good limit. And constraints from a variety of data, this is not even the most recent thing. I haven't included DES data, for instance, but combining CMB with supernova studies, with VAO observations, W equals minus one sort of. You know, w equals minus one sort of fits nicely in the overlap of observations, it's theoretically simple, and so I'm going to restrict attention to the case when w equals minus one, which is also known as a cosmological constant, a fluid whose equation of state doesn't make it dilute as the universe expands. So the first thing you should do in the presence of such a fluid is you ask, what is the maximally symmetric solution of Einstein's equation? We obviously don't live in the symmetric solution, but we imagine that we are a sprinkling of stuff in that symmetric solution. That we are a sprinkling of stuff in that symmetric solution. Okay, and at wait times, if there is a component with w equals minus one, it will dominate the expansion, and so that should become an ever better approximation to how the universe works. So it turns out that is something that was studied by Einstein and de Sitter and Lamatre and others. And Lematre first understood that it gives an exponentially expanding space. So here's some interesting questions about descendant space. First of all, how do you make First of all, how do you make decider solutions in string theory? If we find such solutions, is there a mathematical structure in the space of such solutions? A second question that I think is very interesting is what is the definition of string theory in the sitter space? Now, that can sound like a funny question. You take your supergravity theory and you find solutions, and well, isn't that your definition? Well, no, what I have in mind is a more satisfactory answer of the kind that we have for De Sitter's cousin with the sign of the cosmological constant flick, where we have an auxiliary object to conformal field theory. Auxiliary object to conformal field theory, and really we can repackage all the answers about string theory and anti-desitter space in terms of data of that auxiliary object, which is a great merit because A, the auxiliary object, the CFT, is something we already know how to define. And B, in many situations where we can't analyze the space-time physics, maybe the conformal field theory gives us additional data. So answering that question for desider space is conceptually challenging and interesting. Of these two, I am going to focus for the rest of my few minutes on the first question, not because I think it's more interesting. First, question, not because I think it's more interesting, but because it seems to be a subject of frequent discussion in this community, and in some sense, it's a prior question. So, let's, you know, let's try to figure out how we'd make solutions. Well, if we take our guidance from the case of ADS, the cousin, which has been much better studied, there's a sort of prototype simple solution. And this works in 10 dimensions and gives you ADS5 times S5, but maybe the simplest place that it arises in frequent literature is starting from six dimensions. Is starting from six dimensions. So, suppose you were handed a six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. That's the minimal matter content that I know how to work with. Well, the 60 Lagrangian would have an Einstein term and a gauge field kinetic term and then higher derivative terms. And you can make an ensatz, let's suppose we reduce this theory on a sphere. So GMN is going to be a round metric on a sphere, R squared is the radius of the sphere, and we try to find the effective theory in the lower dimensional, four-dimensional space-time beneath the scale of the KK modes of the sphere. Beneath the scale of the KK modes of the sphere. But in addition to reducing on the sphere, we thread it with units of flux and units of flux. Now that's important because if we just had a curved sphere not threaded by flux, it turns out the solution of the Einstein equations would actually demand that the sphere shrink and shrink and shrink. But when you thread it by flux, the flux provides a counteravailing force. Flux lines don't like to be ever more highly confined. They cost energy. And so you find a balanced solution where the flux quanta providing positive energy. Flux quanta providing positive energy counterbalance the negative energy coming from the curvature of the sphere in the lower-dimensional effective field theory. And there's a solution where the radius of the sphere ends up stabilized at some value depending on the number of plexiglottes. Okay, this is a reliable solution at large n. Your approximate reduction makes sense there. And this is basically the prototype for the solutions that are used widely in, for instance, holography. So the first question you could ask is, are there analogs of Freund Ruben? Ask: Is are there analogs of Freund-Rubin? That, and what I mean by that is you just use classical energetics exhibited by some simple objects like fluxes and brains, and you find a sitter space. Okay, now there's a simple set of ingredients you need to figure this out. An important thing here was the scalings of the flux and curvature energy as a function of the radius of the internal dimensions in the four-dimensional effective field theory. So, you can go through this analysis for all the ingredients in your favorite string theory. If you start in the critical dimension, nine plus one. Critical dimension nine plus one, and you use the various p-form field strengths that we have from Ramon-Daron and Nevo-Schwartz fields, you'll see that the scaling with the radius of extra dimensions goes like this. This is a simple exercise in going to Einstein frame. And similarly, if you have brains or O-planes that wrap a Q cycle in your internal six dimensions, if we come back to ply to four, say, then it turns out the energetics of that brain or O-plane will scale like a one over R to the 12 minus Q. The negative. Q. The negative sign, as far as I know, is mostly relevant for o-planes or for things with large induced negative charge. So, with just D-brains, O-planes, and RRNNS fluxes, if you imagine you're really asymptotically stabilized at large radius, as would happen here with a sufficiently large N, then these should be the scalings, and you can look for solutions that come out of energetics with these scalings. And with just these ingredients, d-brains, o-planes, RR, and NS fluxes, in the critical dimension, the answer. In the critical dimension, the answer seems to be negative. There are old no-go theorems due to people like DeWitt and Harry Doss and Waldo Sena and Nunez. They didn't include this full list of ingredients. We did in 2007 and found simple scaling arguments that say, you know, in these very simple cases, there don't seem to be such solutions. Now, that's a little too simple. String theory, you know, has, in addition to D-brains, O-planes, and R on NS fluxes, we have curvature and we have NS brains. If you include curvature, Nebuchadnezzar. If you include curvature, Nebo-Schwartz brains, and this list of ingredients, there is certainly no known obstruction to such solutions. And there are, in fact, proposed examples, which, you know, to my knowledge haven't been poked and prodded that much. But since there's no no-go theorem a priori, there should be solutions here. Now, there's another class of solutions that I think has been poked and prodded a lot, and that's, I think, particularly interesting in connection with string phenomenology, which are those that use ingredients familiar in the same class of vacuoa that have been used for a few. Same class of vacua that had been used for a few decades to study supersymmetric string phenomenology, including the possibility of low-energy supersymmetry breaking. There are different avatars. The one that I know best works in type 2B string theory, compactified on a Calavia threefold. You orient a fold to break half the supersymmetry to get down to four-dimensional n equals one. In the process, you typically introduce some O-planes and some wrapped D-brains. And here I schematically called something standard model brains, not because it will matter in my construction, but that might be your eventual. Matter in my construction, but that might be your eventual goal. And in addition, you can thread the background with some background flux consistent with the tadpole conditions that account for, for instance, the total four-form charge. So my thinking about these backgrounds was greatly influenced by some work I did with Polchinski and Giddings, and there were earlier papers and later papers that certainly add a great deal. In these backgrounds, you can get potentials for the Calabia moduli, for complex structure moduli. They can arise if you turn on fluxes. There's a classical formula. There is a classical formula which just takes the three-form Ramon and NS flux, it superposes them with a value of the axiodon tau. You use the holomorphic three-form on the Calabi L omega, and this gives some function of the complex structure moduli on the collabi L. Okay, and then this is notably independent of K-more moduli. You can understand that in detail at the classical level. But potentials for K-more moduli can arise. This is a very old story. Their partners in these classes of constructions are axions. Constructions are axions. So, for every axion, there is potentially a kind of instanton, a brain or string that can wrap an internal cycle of the collabial and generate the axion potential and the corresponding modulus potential. For this particular class of models, the relevant instantons were written down by Witten in 96, through Euclidean D3 brains, and they arise in particular circumstances. So they're not guaranteed to be there. It's model dependent. So it was proposed in various papers that in different regimes of parameters, Various papers that in different regimes of parameters, exactly this class of models with the O-planes and the three-form fluxes and the instantons can yield desider solutions. And I'll just talk about one proposal from 2003. Fernando may well talk about more. And the point isn't so much that I think this proposal is a model of the world. It's just a model of how you might play with this problem. Okay, so in this first proposal, there is a small parameter necessary to exhibit a controlled solution. Exhibit a controlled solution. At least theoretically, there's a small parameter, which is just as Freud and Rubin had this large n, a parameter that could play a role to give some control here is a small value of the classical flux superpotential in vacuum, okay, an analog of one over n. And in this paper, that was called by these authors. That was called W naught. It's the classical value of that flux superpotential. And the idea was that if it's much less than one, it lets you self-consistently make an argument that moduli could be stabilized. Argument that module I could be stabilized in a regime of some control. Okay, so I'm just going to take it as granted that there is such a parameter, then we can talk about it. So, with such a small classical superpotential and with generic further corrections, for instance, in the form of those instantons, but in fact, much more generic, to the low energy effective theory that you get from this class of models, as codified there, you actually find that the low energy theory exhibits a supersymmetric ADS minimum, and that that's drawn schematically here. And that's drawn schematically here. Okay, so there's some value of sigma, which is the radion in the radius axion multiplet in a model with, say, just one radion, and there's a robust minimum. Now, at this level, already, before we talk about the SIDER, we could ask: well, there's some assumptions here. Are the assumptions realizable? So, do there exist Calabia models that have the necessary non-perturbative effects or small classical superpotential that? Or small classical superpotential that are required for this discussion. So, partial answers to these questions existed for many years. People have understood how to compute these classical superpotentials, and we exhibited various features. And models with sufficiently many instantons to stabilize various directions in the K-mer cone were found in some work I did with Douglas and also in a beautiful paper from the Berlin group, now Munich group, I guess. But most recently, I think there's been what I would call success. Recently, I think there's been what I would call significant progress on this. The Cornell group, I think led by McAllister, who's our discussion chair, has developed techniques to sort of systematically analyze many, many toric collabia hypersurfaces and complete intersections and to search for flux vacua there using not a brute force search, but using some clever ideas. And as far as I can understand, they have actually, in published work, found models that can attain values of the relevant gauge invariant measure of the small parameter w smaller than 10. Or w smaller than 10 to the minus 100. So I think by any reasonable standards, that's a small value. We could argue about how small you want things to be, but certainly phenomenology wouldn't want smaller values than that for reasons we could discuss. And with small string coupling. Now, this is classical physics. This is a classical set of constructions solving equations that you can find very explicitly spelled out here. So at this level, the only poking you can really do is say maybe they made a mistake computing period integrals. Like all physics, if they made a mistake, then it's Like all physics, if they made a mistake, then it's wrong. But that's classical and you can just check. Now, the particular models studied here and in these earlier works are also chosen for another reason. They exhibit sufficiently many of these Euclidean D-brain effects, codified first in 96, that at least under reasonable assumptions, there are enough effects to generate potentials that span all directions in the K-R cone. And so the models get stabilized values of the radius. And this sort of construction that I described in L. And this sort of construction that I described and outlined seems realizable. There's a small parameter and there are instant on effects. Now, I'm going to leave this and take the next step. Well, I'm not really supposed to be talking about ways to get anti-de Sitter because we already know how to do that with Freud-Rubin. I should point out that these solutions are interestingly different than Freud-Rubin because the size of the internal dimensions is much smaller than the size scale of the cosmological term. So you really get a separation of scales, but still, this is ADS. Scales, but still, this is ADS. Well, the next thing you realize is: let's just think like a physicist in back of the envelope physics for a minute. If you have a construction like this, and you can do small perturbations with some small amount of tuning of the parameters, you know, small changes to a potential that give that anti-desiter minimum can actually change the anti-desitter minimum to a desitter minimum. If the change is too small, of course, it keeps you in ADS. And if it's too big, instead of getting a desitter minimum, you just get to run away to infinity. But there's You just get to run away to infinity, but there's an open set where you end up with a desider minimum. Now, why would you add a small change? Well, in high energy theory, starting from a supersymmetric vacuum with a small parameter, in fact, a small classical superpotential, such tunably small perturbations to the potential were proposed for years starting in the early 1980s in the guise of something called dynamical supersymmetry breaking, which both introduces a tiny scale of a perturbation compared to the Planck scale and lifts the vacuum energy through supersymmetry breaking. Okay, so one of many, many possible Okay, so one of many, many possible examples of dynamical supersymmetry breaking that could be realized in this context has involved the study of some very particular thing, anti-brains probing of warped conifold geometry. Why? Because that's a convenient, very well-known solution found by Kubanov and Strassor. And with Pearson and Berlinda, we were able to show that in the non-compact limit, where the fluxes can be made very large and the analysis is reliable, there are non-supersymmetric states there that can decay to the supersymmetric states. They're related by. Indicate the supersymmetric states. They're related by tunneling, and so they're metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum. Now, that can be made arbitrarily reliable in a non-compact limit. So, in other words, local constructions can be controlled. You could ask, can you glue that into a compact collabiow and put it in this setting? And okay, so we could debate that. And I think all I'll say here is gluing into a compact collabio can and likely will be analyzed in great detail. But exactly, this kind of question of taking local constructions and gluing them into global constructions is. And gluing them into global constructions is a standard subject in geometric analysis, so you don't just have to yell about it, you can actually do some work. Okay, what came before BBN? That's the next topic that I had raised that I actually plan to briefly discuss. And I think the leading idea clearly is inflation. So cosmic inflation, it's a great idea put forward by Guthlande Albert Steinhardt in the early 1980s. It may well explain the bigness of space, also called the flatness problem by sophisticated. Also called the flatness problem by sophisticated people. And it may well explain the quantum perturbations of density that eventually collapse to form galaxies. Now, the classic scenarios are sort of in two types. There's large field inflation here. You know, there could be an M squared, phi squared potential. Phi starts at a super Planckian VEV and rolls down. Or there could be a flat plateau and an otherwise smaller scale potential, an almost false vacuum, not quite a vacuum. There's a small tadpole and the field rolls and eventually reheats the standard model when it condenses. Reheats the standard model when it condenses. That you know, the first such scenario is called new inflation. Now, in my mind, the main a priori merit of inflation, as opposed to many things you can see discussed on the archive, is the genericity and simplicity of the ingredients involved. There's one or a few scalar fields. There could be hundreds as mentioned before, but one or a few is enough. And there should be a positive potential with a region of small slope. And under these conditions, at this stage, people are starting to prove theorems that Messadandra Schwasi. Theorems at Messandonda Shplassi in the Stanford Math Department with some collaborators that inflation will happen and persist. These theorems need to be strengthened, but it's heartening. Okay, now, unlike many aspects of the field of high energy physics, this inflationary theory is very clearly sensitive to very ultraviolet physics, including physics of things like quantum gravity and string theory. And the easiest way to see that is that the simplest inflationary observables depend on parameters like the epsilon and eta slow roll parameters written here in terms of the inflow. role parameters written here in terms of the inflaton potential v where primes denote derivatives with respect to the field driving inflation and because there are explicit powers of m Planck in the definition of these slow roll parameters you can see that order one shifts to the potential from Planck suppressed operators i.e. those due to stringy or quantum gravity physics could qualitatively change the predictions of inflation or even destroy inflation completely okay and that was certainly a subject of the previous talk by Zabala and it's just true So, why do I think inflation is true beyond these sort of generic reasons? Well, there are semi-quantitative predictions that have already been verified. At the time the original papers were written, the omega total of the universe was demonstrably less than one, and people were arguing that it was going to stay that way. Instead, it's converged beautifully to one once the discovery of dark energy and other effects were included. And here's again some beautiful data showing that. Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of perturbation. Harrison Zeldovich spectrum of perturbations, meaning basically a Gaussian spectrum, but with slight deviations from scale invariance, is predicted by inflation. It's not postulated. It comes out of the simplest models and is in beautiful agreement with the data, including the discovery of the slight deviation from one in a range that's easily accommodated by various models, though it's not clear what model should be selected. And then finally, there's an even more qualitative thing, an inflation. Because the universe expands so rapidly, Universe expands so rapidly, inflationary modes leave the horizon and then collapse back into the cosmological horizon from super horizon scales. And that collapse of super horizon modes is precisely responsible for really qualitative features of the observed spectrum of fluctuations, like the acoustic peaks. Okay, so I think there's actually strong experimental evidence that something like inflation is correct. There have been no shortage of stringy models. We heard about some very interesting models in the previous talk, and we'll hear more about. Models in the previous talk, and we'll hear more about models, I think, at other parts of the conference. There are two classes that I personally was particularly interested in, and so I'll talk about them. And, you know, further work on robustness of these classes or variants would certainly be merited. And I see strategies that are sort of well-defined for research on both that could approach mathematical physics. The first idea that sort of came to the fore was the idea that brain dynamics in a compact model, right, involving something like Something like the D-brains and antibrains already present in these constructions could lead to inflation where the inflaton is literally the separation mode between brains. It's a field that lives on d-brains. And the obvious thing there is when the brains whack into each other, if they, for instance, annihilate, that leads to a natural large release of energy, the energy and the tension of the brains. And so brain dynamics could release a waterfall of energy coming from brain annihilation, and maybe that could be used for inflation. And there's a beautiful early. Could be used for inflation. And there's a beautiful early review by Fernando. There's a book by Bauman and McAllister that goes through the details of this subject very nicely. There's a recent review by Silverstein. I think this is a good basic framework to play with. It geometrizes inflation. I'll give one ad for a class of models that I think are particularly quantifiable. If you study local models of holography, kind of like that warped conifold throat I thought of, but there are many such local models, you can really precisely parametrize the sets of operators and coefficients you need. Of operators and coefficients you need in the low energy effective theory to make inflation occur or not, and you can precisely quantify their effects on inflationary parameters and how they connect to supergravity fields. And the reason you can do that is by general principles, gluing such a model into a bulk collabial into quantum gravity, all it can do as long as the geometry of the local model remains stable, which you can again parametrize in terms of known effects, is induce the coefficients of such operators with estimable coefficients using. With estimable coefficients using effective field theory. And so, with Bauman and Daimarski and Liam and Igor, we tried to make this into a precise subject. I think this is a framework that can be made arbitrarily precise, and so I like it. Okay, and then a second class of models that certainly deserves added attention and was discussed widely at the end of the last talk is large field inflation involving brains. Axion monogramy is one example, or axion fields more generally in string theory. Once you discuss large field inflation, axions are the natural home because you Axions are the natural home because you need a shift symmetry of some sort to guarantee viability of a super Planckian field range with some theoretical control. The main interest in these models isn't purely theoretical. It's that David Leith proved in 1997 by a few-line argument that any models that generate observable tensor to scalar ratio of the sort bicep and other experiments are looking for will exhibit either Planckian or super Planckian field ranges. That's a special thing about where we are now in history in the detection of this tensor to scalar ratio value. detection of this tensor to scalar ratio values bigger than about 10 to the minus two or 10 to the minus three require this super string or Planckian field range. Okay, so delta phi over M Planck is the measure of merit in generating R. And examples of models based on axion monodromy or other dynamics of axions do exist. And I think refining them will become extremely interesting, particularly if Bicep or its successors actually detect R. Unfortunately, Bicep just produced another slightly stronger limit, but there are next generation CMBs. But they're next generation, you know, CMB stage four and other experiments. And we have our fingers crossed and we're looking forward to it. So, thank you. That's all I had to say. Thanks very much, Shama, for the excellent talk. Now, since we have discussion time coming, if there are questions that urgently need to be directed at what Shama has already said, we could take one or two now. But unless there are such questions, I suggest we have Fernando go, and then we'll have an open discussion. We'll have an open discussion. Okay, for now that we can see your slides, let's see how the full screen goes. But you're muted. Looks good. But we, yeah, you're still muted. This doesn't commute. Okay, okay, now we can hear you. Okay, now I can see. Okay, now you can hear me and you can see the slides. Yes. Perfect. Okay, thank you very much. Please go ahead. Yeah, well, well, thank you for the organizers for inviting me to participate. For inviting me to participate on this. I have to say, I'm one of the organizers officially, but I didn't do that much. So I thank Saul, Oscar, Nana, Maria, Peter for putting this together. Too bad we couldn't have this in private, in person, because this is my area of the world, so I would have loved to be there. But hopefully, we can find another time to do it. Do it. So I'll try to complement what Shami had said with this small, very small overlap, I would say. So I think Shami gave a very beautiful perspective of the field. And so I just tried to add up to what he had said. Well, let me start first remembering one of the great heroes of our field and someone that I really like and admire very much, Brahman Rose, that unfortunately left us a couple of weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago, and that left a big hole in our community. He was an energetic, gentle, sharp, and deep person. And I really enjoy all the time that we spent together. I really had a big admiration for him. And I'm sure many of you share my feeling. So, yes, too bad. He is not with us. He is not with us, but I think he left many things that we are working on following up his steps. Okay, so as Shami said, in string cosmology, it covers essentially everything. And so the questions are very clearly framed in the sense that, well, we want to understand that the big challenge is to understand the Big Bang or what happened just before. Or what happened just before inflation for us, if inflation is the right perspective, or how to describe inflation, something that solves the problems of the Big Bang as inflation does and produces the necessary perpetuations as inflation does. So the national thing to specialize is inflation, but we have to keep an eye on potential alternatives. I don't see that many real competitives, but I think it's good to keep an open mind. And then after inflation, immediately after inflation, After inflation, immediately after inflation, people say that it's preheating, reheating, or what then would be the increase of dark matter and potential the source of variance over antivariance and so on. And then today, dark energy, and of course the future that we can ask. So in principle, there's plenty of things that can be asked within the string theory context. And I think it's a great opportunity. A great opportunity for string theory to have something to say about any of these questions in cosmology. And so, and cosmology is probably the right subject for string theory to be important, to be relevant. So, as Shamin said, the important thing is that at some point, we started from the standard picture of string theory in 10 dimensions, we have to first stabilize the moduli. That has been a major Stumbling block for many years, and I think that's one of the things that we can say in this century made a big difference compared to the previous century. So, in that sense, this is this shows that the progress that has been made is just model stabilization. And examples are this KKLT and large volume scenario that Xiaomi mentioned. And essentially, they were built, keeping in mind what is called the dynamic. Keeping in mind what is called the Dynesiber problem. And nowadays, people relate it to this Sondon conjecture at large fields, asymptotically large fields, but essentially we know that if how the potential for a field sigma, sigma can be the volume of the extra dimensions, it can be the string dilatant. We know essentially because of say broken scale invariance or something that the field had to go to. To infinity when the potential goes to zero, and there will be the 10-dimensional with coupling limit. So that's the generic situation. And then Daniel Sauer concluded that otherwise you have to go to strong coupling to otherwise to have a minimum, you have to see this, the quantum effects would have to be relevant. In that sense, you have to break the perturbation theory and a strong coupling will be the natural thing to, but we know that. The natural thing to, but we know that we don't live in a strong coupling. The natural thing is that all the tendencies that the couplings of the standard model and gravity are weak. And so that made a big challenge to find minima in the regime where you can still trust perturbation theories or weak coupling expansions, and yet you don't go to the runaway. And fortunately, the string theory provides you. String theory provides you elements to do that, and the elements are discrete parameters. And discrete parameters are like the Hodge numbers of the compact manifold, the fluxes that Xami mentioned, and so on, the curvature principle of the extra dimensions, and so on. So, in that sense, these are the elements we can play with to find the minimum. That's why it makes this. This is very challenging. It's very challenging, but we have ingredients to do it. And so we cannot just assume that the generic thing will be the only solution, but there will be the solutions which stabilize the model. And that I think has been a big development in the last 15, 30 years. Very good. So, and this is what you need to do in cosmology because. To do any cosmology because once you can stabilize the model, you can start asking questions about inflation and you can ask questions about dark energy and so on. And in particular, this is what gave rise to the Buso-Polchinski, Weinberg, and et al. anthropic argument for the cosmological constant, which is and the whole picture about the landscape. And then you have a huge number of this minimum given by the. Of this minimum given by the fluxes, and then you have so many solutions, and the solutions then you have to then phrase what is that situation. So, the natural thing is that you have many minima, our universe will be one of this vacuum. And so, that could be a vacuum transition from quantum mechanical vacuum transition from one minimum to another minimum. Minimum to another minimum for one vacuum to another, that will be the beginning of our journals. So you don't have to go to the big band, the big band may be the beginning of something else. But our own journals may be just a transition from another journal. So that's interesting because you can still be able to use the techniques we already know from field theory and gravity to learn something about the beginning of the universe and also maybe about the end of the universe. And also, maybe about the end of the universe, because our universe eventually you can have a vacuum transition towards something else. So, and luckily for us, this has been a study before string theory, but from free theory. And the hero here is Sidney Colliman. And essentially, I would like to emphasize that there are two ways of doing this transition. So, one is the standard thing that you take a potential and you go from one minute. Look at potential, and you go from one minimum to another one, you consider scalar potential and just stoic solutions that give you the transition in terms of the Euclidean quantum gravity, semi-classical gravity. But there's another alternative, very closely related, which is due to Brown and Theta 1 in 87, and that is related to just brain nucleation. You just have one space-time, say the sitter, another the sitter, and you can go from one to another one by just brain nucleation. Another one, but just bring the creation. But so at that time, it was not called a brain, it was probably just a wall or so. And so, essentially, you have one space-time geometry, M1, and then that will leave you to when you go from M1 to another geometry, M2, you have at the end, you have the whole picture, the two geometries, and the world that separates the two. Okay, so and for that, you don't. Okay, so and for that, you don't need a scalar potential to follow, and you don't need an instant or to work just directly. You can try to explore the transition between the two. Interestingly enough, in the effective field theory for string theory, you have both. So you have the Kolmander Lucia, for instance, from going from here to there, from the sort of minimum to the zero, to the decompatification minimum, for instance. But you can go from one minimum to another minimum. And in here, there's no barrier or something because they are just dependent on the flux. Are just depending on the fluxes, yes, these different discrete fluxes. So, and so you can have the Kolmand dilution in this way and the brown tetelon in this way. So, it's important to study both. And people usually simplify things and consider one bigger big potential for several fields, and then one transition will go in this direction, and then the transition will go into another direction. But literally, you want to use effective field theory for the description. For the description, the right picture is this one. So here you have the barrier, and here you just have transition from one flux to another flux. Okay. And that already gave rise to something that could be called, I don't know, maybe a conjecture. We are using this kind of terminology, is that in the Colman-Delussia picture, the natural thing to get The natural thing to get is you go from the center to the center, but you get the bubble that you create and where our universe would be hosted, it will end up to be an open universe. So that means people could have even claimed, they have claimed in the past that there will be a prediction from the landscape that our universe should be an open universe because it comes out from the scholar mandate which. From the Scalimantelucci bubble. That's something it's important to, even conceptually, to make sure if it is correct, because being open and being closed may be just washed out because of inflation, if inflation is the right theory. But it's conceptual, it's important because the closed universe is finite and open universe is infinite. And so in that sense, it's important to know if the universe is closed or not. If it is the universe is closed or open. And then we need even some remnants eventually that people may get enough precision experimentally to distinguish between the two. And at the moment, it looks like following in the brown tetherboy in following a Hamiltonian approach, you have to use this issue that the citizp, this is the pedro diagram of the citizen space, you have several slicings and And this slicing is the one that you get from Coleman Deluche, which is that will give you the open universe, and this will be the inflationary region, for instance. But you use the Hamiltonian approach that is useful for this brown theta one. You have to use the slicing, which is a fixed time, because that's the Hamiltonian approach. And then in the fixed time approach, you have the slices are closed universes. The slices are closed universes. So, in that sense, this is what you will get naively. Furthermore, you use the brown, the Hartley-Hawking wave function of the universe, the natural framework on that is also to get a closed universe rather than open. So, this issue about an open or closed universe is an interesting and is not yet settled situation. So, just to say, the standard for back-end transitions is that you use a you feeding up. Transitions that you use the Euclidean approach. The non-standards to use the Hamiltonian approach. Hamiltonian approach was pioneered by Poczynski, Fischler, and Morgan in the 1990s. And the Euclidean is the one by Colma de Luce. And there are some differences. For instance, here, you use only instantons which are non-singular, you cannot go from Minkowski to the sitter. You can go from any desiter to another desiter, up or down. But once you get to the limit of Minkowski, Limit on Minkowski, you need a singular instant to go from Minkowski to the Ziter. That Polshinski et al. managed to do it in the Hamiltonian approach. So, in the sense, they get Minkowski to the Ziter without any issue about singularities. But as I told you, here you get naturally closed universe, and here you get naturally not universe, so something to sell. And then there are different trajectories that you can get from going from one minimum to another one that need to be explained. That needs to be explored. I have to say that the continuum approach is very elegant and very nice. However, it's only available if you have this transition of one brain to another one with other scatter field. So it's only in that limit where you can do the calculations. So in that sense, there's plenty to be learned in both directions. And I emphasize these are important questions. Okay, that we can say is what we can call before inflation. Before inflation. Now, after inflation, I think I don't have to say that much. I think Yvonne gave a nice talk earlier, and Shami summarized it very nicely previously. So I have to say that this plot should give us all of us so excited just to see the precision that cosmology is getting, which is very, very good at angular scales. And notice that here there's some uncertainties. That's always good to keep an eye that maybe there's room to do something there. But for inflation, But for inflation as itself, as Shavi said, there's no theory behind. You need a theory behind inflation, and that's what string theory could fit that gap, which I think is important for string theory. And over the years, there have been several proposals of inflation. I think it's only after the model stabilization was settled in the terms of with the starting with the work of KKLT that we could actually ask. That we could actually ask this question about inflation because then, then, once the model is stabilized, then you can see which are the directions that you can have inflationary domains. And then, without surprise, there were several proposals of inflation that came out during the next several years after Click ALT. And there are these two numbers, the NS and R, we have been mentioned already before. And so, they're very. So they're very well determined experimentally. So NS is very limited between 0.96, 0.97 or so. There are bounds on R. So there's this brain anti-brain inflation that Jamie mentioned. You have the prediction for what NS is and what the tensor modes also are usually very small, more than a 10 to 105. Then there are inflection point inflation, Devia inflation, and so they have the Devia inflation and so they have their own predictions. Here, I wanted to call attention to these two: action monodromy that Shami also mentioned, and fiber inflation, because in both cases, R is not that small. It's 0.007, smaller than 0.007, and it's smaller than 0.07 at that time. And all the other ones are very small and they are usually not achievable in the future, in the new future. Future and the new feature. So there's nothing wrong with them. It's only that for pragmatical reasons, it would be good to concentrate on the one that can be ruled out. I have to say that none of the models of reflection are, I would say, are totally satisfactory. And you have to implement them into different frameworks. You have to see about what kind of amount of fine-tuning you have, and so on. But these two have been standing out in the last few years. Few years, and then I want to say, Well, this is a summary we wrote in 2013, so it's uh, and I think not that much has been changed into this, probably slightly the modification of these parameters in the last few years. And I have to say also for question of for question of string theory, just as a curiosity, in 2015 or yes, 14 or 15, I forgot now. 2014 or 15, I forgot now. There were this big announcement from BICEP that they had discovered tensor modes and that R was you know 0.02 or something. It would have been rule out essentially all of these models except for axiom monogamy. So that sense that that's a good thing that there is some predictability within classes of stream models. Unfortunately, the experiments were turned out not to be the right interpretation, and there is no yet. And there is not yet a discovery for tennis remotes. However, there is recently, as Yvonne mentioned, there is the bicep and Craig results. They announced on the given new bound, R, which is less than 0.036, which are, it's just an interesting bound. It's a factor of four or so, smaller than before, if I remember correctly. And they even mentioned in the paper itself, not in the abstract, the Not in the abstract, they give a value of r, not only bound, but a value 0.014 plus or minus something. So you are over optimistic. You say, well, this is the discovery, ruling out r equal to 0 to 1 sigma, but none of us take this too seriously. But it's interesting that they mention it in that way. And that makes, for instance, the axiom of aluminum in particular that are large is closer to Is closer to be tested. I think people have been playing now with variations of it, and which I think is interesting. But I think we are very close to actually be able to fully test those kind of models, axiomatically. And hopefully for fiber, which is 0.007, it will take a little bit longer. But there's some models that can be rolled out. I took this one with this recent paper of colors and linked it basing on this. That basing on this talk by Flauger, which puts here several of these people, what people call alpha tractors, and Ivan mentioned, these are not stringy models, which are probably string-inspired models. And this is the fiber case. And I think Michele had an objection to this plot, but I think essentially the value of R, I think, is within the right region, probably which are the values of NS. Which are the values of NS that cover the network? Yeah, it should be more on 0.97. 0.97. Okay, very good. If you want, I can comment afterwards. Probably a little bit narrower, narrower, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. If you want, I can comment afterwards. Okay, very good. You comment after my thought. That would be nice. Yes, thank you. Very good. And okay, so that was inflation. But then Shrim can tell you even more about post-inflation. And post-inflation, there is this. There is this, what it used to be called the cosmological moduli problem. Now it's called moduli domination. And the reason is that this moduli, if after inflation happens, so after inflation happens, the moduli can be trapped in another minimum, not their own minimum, and then they start rolling. So this field is not the inflatone. This field is something else, another field. There are plenty of fields that people have mentioned before. Fields that people have mentioned before. So there are many of these multi-like fields, and once the inflation finishes, they are displaced from the menu and then they start oscillating. While they oscillate, they start dominating the energy density of the universe. And this was done, I think now that we're honoring Graham Ross, it was this paper of Koflan et al., but Graham is one of the et al. in 1983. So it was before the string theory, essentially. In century. But it was pointed out for what at that time is called the Spelony field. It was one particular supergravity field that this was happening. But then in the 90s, these two groups, Weinstein and our groups, realized that this is, you look for something generic in string theory, this is very close to that to be as essentially once you have supersymmetry in your background, in your solution. On in your solution, like a calamayo, then this is a general thing. For any solution where you have low energy supersymmetry surviving, you will have this problem. So in the spirit of having general results, this is as general as you can get. And unfortunately, it is a problem because it was a problem because either you overclose the universe or you ruin a nucleosynthesis. If the field is very light, it has to be lighter than a bigger amount, not to overclose. Lighter than a bigger amount, not overclose the tumors. And if the field is heavier, it decays, I mean, in the case in nucleosynthesis. So, for not ruining nucleosynthesis, the field has to be heavier than 30 TeV. And now it's not a big deal before because this may be the scale of supersymmetry breaking. So it may be, but now since supersymmetry has not been discovered, so it's still fine. But it will mark a new phase in the history of the universe. Once inflation finishes, the standard way, the inflation finish, you get. Standard way to say inflation finishes, you get radiation domination and then our time. Now, inflation finishes, then you get this period of model domination, and then our time, and then things change because of that. So, I think that's worth taking into account that the spring theory can say something after inflation. Furthermore, when these fields are oscillating around the diminution, they can create inhomogeneities. These inhomogeneities will have their impact also. And they're coming to the names of cubals or oscillons, depending on the field is real or. Balls or oscillons, depending on the field is real or imaginary, or complex and sort of. Or if gravity is involved, you can call them Boston stars. We call them moduli stars for the modulate fields, or oscillators being a common name. This is a subject which I think is getting more and more interesting recently because they provide one of these exotic compact objects that can be alternatives to black holes or something or neutron stars that when people are searching for gravitational waves. Searching for gravitational waves. And they come out naturally in this case. Just to give you an example, we have here potential for blow-up modes for large volume scenario, again, the KKLT. And so KKLT is this one. And you can see that while the field is oscillating, it's creating this inhomogeneities. You can see them they are not spherically symmetric, so they can produce gravitational waves. And then this is the large volume scenario with the blow-up modes, where you can. Senior with blow-up modes where you can see them fastly produced. So you can even distinguish it between different scenarios by just by the effect of this kind of inhomogeneities that are being created. And the natural thing they produce is gravitational waves. And this is the spectrum for the KKLT and this is the spectrum for the blow-up large volume. So they look different. But what they have in common is that the frequencies are very high. 10 to 9 Hz here, 10 to 9 Hertz here, with a different kind of amplitude. Here with a different kind of amplitudes. And so then you say, well, but can we test this? No, no, I can just realize that no, gravitational base instruments, the central parameters are bound to only test the frequencies of the order of the kilohertz. So that means that these predictions are way beyond what people are searching now. Are searching now. Okay, so in that sense, you can try to adjust or tune things in order to bring your numbers to smoother frequencies. But another alternative is to take it this seriously and then explore what happens with ultra-high energy gravitational waves. After all, LIGO took 40, 50 years before it started running with an idea how to detect gravitational waves. So we started inquiring with Francesco Muñoz, my collaborator, Enui Francesco here. I know Francesco here. And a couple of years ago, we decided to search for the community who were interested in gravitational waves of high frequencies. And then we started an activity on this. We had a workshop in Trieste in 2019. We had a second workshop two weeks ago at CERN. And there's a growing interest in the community about the potential to search for high-frequency attentional websites. So you can search. We have a web page here in Cambridge and this is the web. Have a web page here in Cambridge, and this is the web page of the workshop at CERN. And we had this white paper that came out. I always said I'm very proud because, at my old age, this is the first time I read a paper with experimentals. So, and there are some interest actually in exploring that. Of course, this goes beyond string theory, of course, because now you can see anything that can be producing That can be producing high-frequency gravitational waves will be relevant. The good news is that essentially all the objects that we know that can produce gravitational waves, black holes, neutron stars, I think, they have a bound and the bound on the frequency is of the order of the 10 hertz, kilohertz, I'm sort of. And so anything beyond the kilohertz will be essentially new physics. There's a there's a plasma background that can be considered from the standard model. Be considered from the standard model, which would be interesting to search, but the rest will be new physics. Either will be this exotic compact objects if it is late time, like boss and stars and so on, or can be something cosmological. And what kind of cosmological things you have? You can have, well, inflation, preheating, reheating, osynons, as I said, phase transitions on the universe and so on. And so that you have here the different cases for them. Cases for them and what kind of frequencies they can cover. And you can go all the way from the kilohertz to very high. But a particular interesting one is the 10 to the 9 hertz, which is the gigahertz, because that will explore the frequency that the corresponding source will be of energy of the order of the gas unification scale, so 10 to the 17 GeV or so. So since this will be a new way to search. A new way to search for physics beyond the TV. Imagine at CERN that were struggling for getting an order of money to more. You can use try to search for gravitational frequency, rotational, high-frequency rotational waves. The challenge will be just to reach the gigahertz instead of the kilohertz. It doesn't look that bad. Unfortunately, it's not that easy neither because people have been trying and the question is the sensitivity. The question is: the sensitivity is not that yet. We are several orders of magnets, six orders if you're optimistic, away from what people can actually do experimentally. But I suppose there are several experiments proposed. I'm sorry to interrupt this beautiful talk, but could you turn toward wrapping up so that we can go to the discussion in a couple of minutes, please? I'm wrapping up right now. Okay, very good. So, this is my last slide. Okay, so essentially, so. Last slide. Okay, so essentially, so that I wanted to leave you with the idea that this high-frequency radiation always have a big future, and I may not be alive when they will be searching that. But I think it's good to start thinking about it for the younger generations, because the timeframe may be decades and not centuries, I would say, to get to the gut scale. And we may be even being luckier, depending on the difference. Depending on the different experiments. And for that, also, the size of the experiment can be small, not big. So the size is inversely proportional to the frequency. So in that sense, you may have table top of experiments to do it. Anyway, open questions to the discussion. The nature of the city, as Shami emphasized, we know that at best is metastable, so it's a lot to be understood. There's plenty of discussions in the last years about it. I like the idea that. About it. I like the idea that it could be a resonance, like we are using in high-energy physics. But also, recently, the studies on the black hole information laws have been giving new insights into horizons in geometry. In particular, the city has a horizon, in islands, and this new technique that people have been finding be useful to understand better the city. Be useful to understand better the city and to understand phase transitions and so on. That's, I think, something very, very interesting. And people are trying already to explore that. There are papers of Mutasen et al., Hartmann, and Vance Ransnut, and so trying to explore what all these new developments can say for cosmology, in particular, for the city. The population of the landscape, there's a well-defined question that people, I don't think there's yet a good answer, is that trying to use Colman the Rulesha to go from one minimum to another minimum. To go from one minimum to another minimum, this paper by Larfors and Johnson, they naturally tend to bring you to the runaway instead of going from one to another one. The solution that brings you from one to another one brings you to the runaway. So that I think is a concrete question that should be addressed because we want to populate the landscape and not all the minimum to go to the runaway behavior. If they're transition from Minkowski to ADS or to the CETA, that's also. To the CPAR, that's also an open question for inflation to do properly. Action monotony, I think, with the old model stabilized, I think it's important and it's timely because action monomy is going to get closer and closer to be tested. The combination of inflation, gravitino mass, and the city, I think, is important. Why is it that we get only either we get inflation to run or just lower range of supersymmetry, but it's hard to get both. Was hard to get both, and that I think is an important question. After inflation, of course, properly study overheating, then dark matter, biogenesis, etc. I think there's very little done in biogenesis. I think Michele wrote a paper with Francesco, but there is plenty to be done. Today, dark energy, I think as this is the big discussion, you can see we have to still open the cosmological constant versus quintessence picture. Maybe both can be worked somehow. And I think Michele will say something in his talk. Think Michele will say something in his talk later on that I'm looking forward to it. And as I say, for the future, I don't know the universe, but at least for us, I'm very excited about gravitational waves to test string theory in the future, something like listening to the shape of the extra dimensions or something like that would be wonderful. Okay, thank you. I finish here. Thank you very much, Fernando, for that beautiful overview. Let's now turn to questions, comments, discussion points from the audience. Comments, discussion points from the audience. Okay, well, while people are thinking of what they might want to ask or say, I have a general question to our discussion leaders, but also to all the rest of you. So we've seen a range of physics targets laid out, and there's been a development of an Been a development of an array of models that, in some way, matched to those targets, but most of the developments are broadly phenomenological. And what I'm curious about is what concrete calculations in string theory or very near to string theory do any of you foresee that could actually bring us closer to testing these sorts of ideas in any of the frontiers that were mentioned by Fernando and Shana. I don't know if I get the point. Concrete string calculation? Yeah, what really? Calculation. Yeah, what are the places where rather than exploration to try to find new kinds of models, it's really essential for parts of the community to buckle down and dig deeper in computations. Shaman? Yeah, I mean, I've already spoken too much, so I hope other people say something, but I have my own favorite answer, which is I think a question that begs for an answer and should be answered. Begs for an answer and should be answerable, and it's clearly been answerable since the mid-1990s is to find techniques that can give us exact superpotentials in string theory. The flux superpotential is classical, and there's a beautiful non-renormalization theorem to all orders by Fernando and Cliff Burgess and others. And then there are these instanton effects, and we can estimate them, and you've done a good job of doing that, and others have done it. In quantum field theory, we learned in the mid-90s that you can solve n equals two models by finding a prepotential. And if you look at the history, it was actually done first in string theory by Ken. History was actually done first in string theory by Candelis et al. They didn't phrase it that way, but they did it first. And then, soon after the field theory developments, it was understood how that's really also part of string theory. Exact superpotentials were also computed in the 1990s in certain field theories by people like Cyberg and Introlliator. And there's been very little effort in string theory, and for good reason, it's difficult to compute really exact formulas for superpotentials in supersymmetric models. But for all kinds of moral reasons, that's a problem that's within reach. You know, much of what we'd like to do. That's within reach. You know, much of what we'd like to do is not within reach. Classify all non-supersymmetric string vacuum. I have no idea how to do that. Computing exact superpotentials more or less should be within reach. And so I feel like that's a problem at the edge of sort of spring phenomenology and mathematical physics. It would have interesting mathematical implications for algebraic geometry that a really dedicated group could probably solve in the lifetime of a PhD student, four or five years, in simple enough models, just as mirror symmetry worked. Symmetry worked. And, you know, I'm old and have my own interests, but I think this is a direction somebody should pursue. Very good point. Can I add also the complementary to what Shami said? I think there's plenty to be done regarding the perturbative corrections to scalar potentials, for instance, and that means perturbative corrections to the Keller potential. And so, and I think that. And I think that that is not undurable. I think that you can say alpha plan corrections, loop corrections. You can be systematic and develop some techniques. I think that's something we have been working recently with Michele, Rafael Savelli, and Veres Schakner and Roberto Valandro. And I think it's, and other people have been doing that for years, and this well. Years and there's some information already there. And I think, but it is very challenging to get some information about so this ordering in alpha prime and this ordering in loops, just it's a lot of work to very small step. But I think each of these correlations are very, very important because they determine essentially how much trust you can have in your potentials to determine most. Your potentials to determine model stabilization and so on. So, I think that that is something that can be done with a lot of effort, but there are many techniques already available that it requires, I mean, as Jamie says, a set of people together to work. So, I don't think that is undoable. It's something that it can be done. Michael? Michael? I have a very naive question to Sharmit's comment. Are you hoping to get also something for non-supersymmetric models? Or are you saying, okay, if we understand the supersymmetric exact superpotential well enough, that's already a big step and then maybe gives us the right answers? Yeah, thanks for your question. I mean, you know, what were the great motivations to compute these superpotentials to begin with? I think one of the driving motivations, just in quantum field theory, where we've seen Just in quantum field theory, where we've seen the story play out, was the spontaneous dynamical breaking of supersymmetry. If you know the exact superpotential, you can try to study minima. And then using the kinds of self-consistent approximations I described, even if the minimum is non-supersymmetric, you may have confidence that the minimum exists. And so in string theory, although I think computing exact superpotentials would have all kinds of spin-off implications for mathematics, and those themselves are interesting, one big motivation would be with that exact. One big motivation would be with that exact formula, you could have more confidence that the non-supsymmetric string vacua that you find that spontaneously breaks supersymmetry. You know, what I think Fernando and I think of as these desider models, they arise in theories that also have supersymmetric vacua. They can decay to supersymmetric vacuum. And so you should be able to find such minima as minima of a supersymmetric theory with some formula for its superpotential and KOR potential, and by just solving the F and D term conditions. Just solving the F and D term conditions. So, in that sense, I think it would have big implications for our confidence in non-supersymmetric string constructions. Non-supersymmetric in the sense that they're non-supersymmetric vacua of a supersymmetric low energy theory. I think a next step that you may be asking about is, what about something that breaks supersymmetry at the Kaluza-Klein scale or the Planck scale? And there's no supersymmetric low energy effective theory and no packaging in a super potential. I think it would be spectacular to get a handle on such models, like played with such models. A handle on such models, I've played with such models myself. I do not have a good idea for a research program that would weed to a deep understanding of that, except for one that I think is beyond reach, which is develop the bootstrap to the point where we can understand ADS vacua that way. I think that problem is far out of reach for the current bootstrap to get to non-supersymmetric CFTs dual to large volume ADS with separation of scales, but you can phrase it there naturally. And so, conceivably, you could attack it there. I don't see how to attack it directly by doing string perturbation theory or. Directly by doing string perturbation theory or something like that. Was that your question, Michael? Yes, more or less. I mean, I'm just wondering, I mean, there will be always SUSY breaking effects, and they are usually less controllable than, you know, just a supersymmetric theory. And then, of course, they can sort of accumulate in a certain way. I mean, you have to sort of break Susie in some hidden sector, perhaps more badly. And I'm always wondering or worried about the cosmology. Well, probably there could be effects which are harder to. Be effects which are harder to control, but I don't know. I mean, I think you raise actually an important point, which is there's there is string theory really does have an interface with math where you prove things rigorously. And then there's low energy effective theory and self-consistency. For understanding non-supersymmetric vacua, even in a supersymmetric theory, I personally think we'll always have to use some aspects of low energy effective field theory and self-consistency that expansion parameters are small. And I personally think that's highly wrong. And I personally think that's highly reliable. I invite you to think about how we've analyzed the standard model. Sure. But yeah, in the standard model, of course, it's very not super satisfying because you have all these parameters that you adjust to give what you want and ultimately you want to understand them. And well, okay, you know that better than me. Yeah, maybe one thing that could be computable and it would be nice to compute are modulated definitions and the facts in general which give rise to desequestering, for example, from alpha prime corrections or threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions. Because these things could be very important. For example, if we discover low energy. We discover low-energy supersymmetry and tensile moments. And then there is a big hierarchy between the scale of inflation and say the mass of the software. And we have seen that in all these models, the gravitational mass tends to be something that really could help in this case or not. I think people could try to compute these things and it would be nice. And it would be nice. Other comments, either on this point or new issues you wanted to raise? Yes, with just something that may be obvious. I mean, Fernando raised the important point. We need to calculate the K-Lock potential with high and high precision. This is a bridge between the two questions. I mean, there's a recent paper by Cliff and Fernando saying, or emphasizing the, I think, important and true point that if you know the Taylor potential well enough, then you can describe even models with broken supersymmetry and even all the loop corrections there through that quantity. And so this, of course, is a challenging question, but it should be doable, right? The Kela potential with all its corrections and the normalization of W and gauge unit functions together should allow. Functions together should allow us, in principle, to approach Michael's question. You and Fernando both, what approaches do you have in mind that would allow people to systematically compute to reasonably high orders in alpha prime and G string, the corrections to the Keller potential in, let's say, Calabia compactifications, Calabia orientifolds, or something like that. How would you actually, of course, I know how one can do things at one loop, but that was pretty laborious. But that was pretty laborious, even in toroidal oriental faults. And so, how can one get past that? Yes, I mean, there's things that at some point we have to be a bit more humble and then concentrate on things which are, for instance, just concentrate only on the overall volume dependence instead of the whole thing. So, you can use a lot of combination of calculations with the scaling rules so that you ask the relevant question. In that sense, I think that we can get. Sense, I think that we can get a little bit further than just, I mean, of course, doing a calculation in full Calabiado looks hopeless. So I think that I think simplifies a bit by just using constrainting on the right dependence, volume dependence and dilatant dependence. And that's, for instance, this paper we wrote with Miguel and Rafael Etel essentially wasn't going in that direction. So trying to use some of the techniques that people have used before, but also the scalings and trying to then classify the terms. And you can get relatively far just by having, you know, exactly the Dilaton dependence, the overall volume dependence of every order in. Of every order in the expansion. So you say, well, let's see what is the coefficient of this expansion parameter. So in that sense, that question is probably more reachable than we say. I have a completely different question, completely unrelated to what you had to say. And I'd like to know what. And I'd like to know what you think, guys, about models, stray models without supersymmetry in the cosmological context. Because all the tools that you have mentioned so far, and Yvonne mentioned as well, have to do with supersymmetry. But there are several models that can arise with phenomenological properties from the point of view of particle physics that arise from string theory. And we don't know how to deal with the cosmology of them. What do you think? Well, I think so. Totally open question is very interesting. I think I don't know if Keith is around, but Keith had been thinking about for years and there were interesting results at that time. But there was also the work of Eva and collaborators by studying competitions, which are with negative curvature, but as Shami said, you can get the CTR very easily. So, but I mean, it's difficult to do calculation. I mean, it's difficult to do calculations there, but I think that the possibilities are totally open. I think it's very good. Maybe Keith, would you like to say something? I don't know that I have much to say. You're right. I've worked on this a long time. But yeah, I mean, there are a number of interesting issues about the cosmological constant in string theory, of course, the one-loop vacuum energy, the zero-point diagram. But getting it to be zero without supersymmetry, I would not say there are symmetry arguments. There are symmetry arguments. There is something called actin-lanar symmetry, which Greg Moore talked about in the late 80s. And there have been various approaches, as you mentioned. Eva and Shama and people have done things like that. But as far as I know, you know, there's always higher loops. Even if you could get it to be zero at one loop, without supersymmetry, things are not under control at higher loops. And so there's always that issue. One thing that is interesting that I don't think a lot of people talk about is that there is a huge degeneracy. Is that there is a huge degeneracy in the space of cosmological constants for non-supersymmetric strings, by which I mean many different string theories with utterly unrelated gauge groups, particle content, and so forth have exactly the same one-loop integral, the same cosmological constant. What happens? I mean, almost all string models fall into classes, equivalence classes. So the values are. So, the values of cosmological constants that you can reach numerically are sort of quantized. I don't want to imply it's a regular pattern, but it seems to be only certain values, and therefore all different models fall into classes, equivalence classes, as measured by the value of the one-loop amplitude. What's happening there is that are these tachyon-free, Keith? Sorry, all tachyon-free. Because if it were tachyonic, then the value would be infinite, and so you couldn't have. Infinite, and so you couldn't have, yeah, of course, you know, yeah, sure, right. So, what ends up happening there is this old idea that um, the actin-lanar symmetry, the idea was that if you had a theory whose one-loop partition function, I'm talking about perturbative heterotic, of course, if you had a theory with a one-loop partition function that had this actin-linear symmetry, then its integral, the partition function would not vanish, but the integral of it would. But it had been proven after Greg Moore a few years later, 91 or A few years later, 91 or 89, somewhere in there, it was proven that you cannot have any self-consistent string model. Of course, perturbative, everything I'm saying is perturbative heterotic. You cannot have any such theory, which has an Akkin later symmetric partition function. So therefore, you cannot get a vanishing cosmological constant through that means. But what I found, I think it was 1990, I have a PRL on this in 1990, that you can find pairs of models whose partition functions differ. Whose partition functions differ by an actin-laner symmetric function. And therefore, they yield the same one-loop amplitude because the difference would be zero. And so there are these huge degeneracies. This is something you would not expect. You would expect from a landscape point of view that if you were to plot, say, the number of models you look at at the landscape different, and I don't mean different in their construction, I mean different in their actual space-time phenomenology. There's many different construction techniques. There's many different construction techniques yield identical models of space-time. But I'm saying different gauge groups, different particle contents, no relation. An SO10 level 3 model with 16 generations and whatever versus an S, you know, some other model with E6 cross, you know, one generation and so forth have identical cosmological constants because their partition functions differ by a machine-linear symmetric one. There are these classes, and almost all models are part of these classes, by which I mean that if you were to. These classes, by which I mean that if you were to do a landscape study, and in 2006, I had a landscape paper on non-supersymmetric strains where I talked about this. And I actually have a plot of the number of different models you can look at and the number of different values of the cosmological constant that you accumulate in your bag of values of cosmological constant. And it is not a one-to-one function. It is extremely suppressed. It is extremely suppressed. I mean, it's exponentially suppressed. So, that is not something you would expect in field theory. And that is definitely a stringy effect. Anyway, 2006, I had a paper with all these details, but there's a lot of surprises there. I mean, both Busso-Polchrinsky sort of give us an interesting perspective, but I think it needs to be reconciled with these other just on-the-ground facts. One of the nice things about Facts. One of the nice things about perturbative heterotic, of course, free fermions, you can construct models and actually look at them in the absolute detail. And when you do this, you find these surprises that you wouldn't have expected from kind of low energy EFT approaches to string theory. So yeah, but still solving the trying to get a zero cosmological constant doesn't seem yet to happen. In 2015, I had a paper with Steve A. I had a paper with Steve Abel at IPPP Durham, where we showed that you don't need to necessarily get a vanishing cosmological constant. Never mind, when I say vanishing, of course, I'm talking about a tiny number, you know, consistent with present day observations, but you don't even need to get that because if you can get it to be exponentially suppressed, then that's good enough because that would mean it's kind of a metastable. It's on a Diletton tadpole diagram is not vanishing, but it's such a small. Not vanishing, but it's such a small slope that you roll, but you roll only on cosmological time scales. That's good enough. And so that's effectively stable. And we showed that those kinds of models you can build easily where you exponentially suppress the cosmological constant. And so we opened up the whole kind of way of thinking about it where we were doing it with exponential suppression of the cosmological constant. That we can do. And that is phenomenologically as viable as anything. Is phenomenologically as viable as anything else, but to get it to be zero doesn't seem there's an obvious answer. I'd like to make one comment, which is it's never clear to me whether we're discussing sort of abstract string constructions, which is an interesting thing in its own right, or the real world, which is also an interesting thing in its own right. For the real world, we all know supersymmetry is broken, at least at the TEV scale. We can all go and do the one-whoop calculation of The one-loop calculation of what QED effects would contribute to the cosmological term. I have never seen a string theory argument that a low-energy estimate of the uncertainty we'll have from having to do field theory loops on top of what we see from supersymmetry breaking can be argued away. And so I think it's really interesting to try and make string theory models. And I worked on this where at one loop or two loops or whatever order, some model has a small vacuum energy. I think that has to be kept in mind separate from this real issue of in the real world, we know. Real issue of in the real world, we know there's a certain particle content, we can do one-loop diagrams, we know what the contributions are to the vacuum energy. Um, and an idea for a precise cancellation of effects we really know are there from some kind of magic of high energy physics. I say this with all respect to the audience. Maybe many of you have worked on this, but I've never seen a plausible idea for how that happens. And I don't think anyone here would contradict me, but if they would, I'd be happy to hear why. I agree, it's a challenge. I agree, it's a challenge. To answer the question that I got, these are tachyon-free models that I'm talking about, but I don't mean that they're SUSY broken in any low-scale way. I mean that they are non-supersymmetric at the string scale. There is no SUSY in them from the get-go. The GSO projections, if you will, all that old terminology just does not have a massless graviton at all in the theory. And so I have always really loved the. I have always really loved those models because I think they provide a different perspective on hierarchy problems. And I had a paper just a few months ago with Steve Abel where we actually did honest to gosh string theory calculations of the Higgs mass in these theories and looked at the running of them. And, you know, it's really interesting because there's all sorts of dualities that people just don't even think about. Of dualities that people just don't even think about, like there's a scale duality, mu to one over mu in the running, so that there's an UBIR symmetry, of course, as you would expect, which comes right out of modular invariance, which constrains these things. And so, again, the way we think about hierarchy problems is by throwing out all these infinite towers of states, which I always worry about. And then we say, oh, now look, there's a hierarchy problem at low energy, so we need supersymmetry. And my answer is: string theory. And my answer is: string theory gives you finiteness without supersymmetry. And it does it by having infinite towers of states whose masses and statistics are finely balanced. I mean, you know the story I've been talking about for years, but I think, you know, we did this actual Higgs mass calculation just to look at what happens in these theories. And for one thing, it doesn't diverge quite radically the way you would expect in field theory. It diverges logarithmically, which is a very much softer thing. Very much softer thing. Modular invariance already kills a certain number of degrees, a certain degree of divergence in this quantity. And so we found a lot of surprises in just how you should think about even passing to an EFT. One question I would love if people would talk about is this, how do you pass rigorously to an EFT from a string theory? People usually throw out infinite towers of states, look at the massive degrees of freedom, write an effective field theory. Degrees of freedom, write an effective field theory, and turn the crank. Well, this idea that you can integrate out a state and it leaves behind an operator suppressed by a scale, you know, polynomial suppression. Okay, that's true for one state. What happens when you have an infinite tower of states? Or even worse, in string theory, we have an infinite tower of states whose degeneracies at each level are growing. Whose degeneracies at each level are growing exponentially. That's the Hagedorn behavior. How do you integrate that out and get behind a polynomial operator? And that already should raise a lot of bells, alarm bells. And then even worse, when you integrate that infinite tower out, you are treating UV differently than IR physics. You're saying there's a heavy and a light. You are throwing out symmetries that string theory. out symmetries that string theory loves and rests on like t-duality which says that compactifying on a heavy on a on a on a large radius is the same as on a small radius so you're you're you can't maintain these kinds of symmetries in the usual passage to an EFT but those symmetries mixing light and heavy are exactly the ones you would think say something about hierarchy problems so you know I'm just repeating themes I've said for a long time I'm just repeating themes I've said for a long time. I'm not working on string theory very much nowadays, occasional papers with Steve Abel. But he's working with me for 30 years always. But what about the Dixon-Kabnoski-Lewical calculation of the threshold effects? Because you're taking all the... Yeah, actually, we're going to have a paper as soon as we can write it where we do a similar analysis for gauge companies that we just did for the Higgs. The paper we had, I think it was June, on calculating the Higgs mass of strength. It was a huge thing because. Higgs master of strength theory was a huge thing because we really kind of wanted to take an honest approach. You know, if you think about it, most people throw out all those towers or states. If I think about where in the prior literature have people really respected that and taken those states into account, I think of Kaplanovsky's calculation of, you know, back to 1987, where he actually did an integral over the whole Tower of States. That was how he formulated the threshold correction for the gauge couplings. And we wanted to. Couplings. And we wanted to do that kind of calculation for the Higgs. The only difference is Kaplanovsky subtracts. I mean, this is getting into technical details that probably aren't relevant, but he subtracts the massless states, the contribution for the massless states. And at that moment, he breaks modular invariant because you can't just separate the massless states from the others in a modular invariant way. We wanted to do an absolute modular invariant, rigorous calculation. And when we did that, we got these symmetries that the running, you know, there's a symmetry. Running, you know, there's a symmetry. Mu goes to string scale squared over mu, and the running rises and then it falls. So the deep UV is the same as the deep IR. We even have a plot of the running of the gauge couplings, and it's just of the Higgs mass. And so we're doing it right now for the gauge couplings. We'll have an answer soon. We'll have a paper soon. But I think we need to be more respectful of, I mean, just to play with EFT ideas by throwing out towers of states. I don't know. I've been in. I don't know. I've been an Fernando, you know, I've been an enemy of this for years and years and years. My old work on missile and supersymmetry is based on the idea that this matters, these towers or states. You have a question, a comment on this? I have two comments that are quick. One is, I think it's important to keep in mind the distinction between world sheet and space-time symmetries. And I know Keith knows this well, but there are symmetries that we understand really well in space-time. Those last. Space-time, those last and they certainly preserve the effective action. And that's been studied in hundreds of papers after the duality revolution. There are world sheet symmetries that arise genus by genus. These may or may not last when you actually find the low energy effective action, including all effects. I have one second comment, which is a test of some of the aspects of matching string theory to effective field theory that's extremely powerful is to look at Calabiao compactification. We're at this stage, one can Where at this stage one can actually determine exact low-energy effective actions for certain sectors up to a certain number of derivatives. And I have to say that although some of those actions at one loop, for instance, have beautiful symmetries, I do not know of an example where in an n equals two model where we can compute the answer, there is a qualitative surprise from the viewpoint of effective field theory. That is where an estimate you would have made that Howard George I would sign off on as bona fide turns out to be wrong for a miraculous reason. To be wrong for a miraculous reason. Now, I'd love for it to be true, but I think really robust examples of string miracles that last beyond the world sheet and sort of last to all orders and last beyond dilettante stabilization or whatever, you know, string miracles are few and far between. And I'm not sure we have concrete examples of any. I agree at one loop, we definitely have concrete examples, Keith. And I think that's what you're talking about. I'm talking about one loop. I'm talking about perturbative. Hope to have made that clear. But already, if you see surprises there, it just makes you say. It just makes you think that maybe we should not be so quick about what we say is a problem or not. And without supersymmetry, I love the way to think about these things in a pure setting because a lot of these things are supersymmetry. But string theory do not require space-time supersymmetry. We always have to remember that, and certainly not at low energies. So, as far as I know, Hunter, did you have a comment? May I make a comment? Please, please. Yeah. Yeah, so. Yeah, so Keith, so if I cannot toss out these high energy states, string states and so on, and construct an effective field theory, I cannot even get Einstein's theory out of string theory. Well, string theory doesn't give Einstein. I mean, there are other states in the theory, and an honest thing is if you're taking the theory as an actual prediction for the physics, you know the partition. You know the partition function at least at one loop. I mean, you know, you know the spectrum, they're there, right? I mean, I would say that the right way to treat this, of course, we would want a string field theory if you really want to do it rigorously, right? But all, but all I'm saying is there's an infinite tower of states there, and you can put it into a string amplitude and calculate the whole thing. It's a mess, but at least then you know what. But at least then you know what your answer is. But what about, say, the beta function calculations for Dan and company? I mean, which seem to give you the leading terms there. I mean, it's basically an alpha prime expansion. The leading terms are the Einstein terms. I'm not saying that things come out wrong. I'm saying sometimes there are surprises. As I said, we're working on gauge couplings right now, Steve and I, so we'll have a paper soon. I don't know exactly how it's going to happen. Paper soon. I don't know exactly how it's going to come out because there are some subtleties in the mathematics. But yeah, when it works, it's fine. I mean, you can even say the Kaplanovsky result was kind of okay because it gave just corrections, stringy corrections to otherwise what would look like field theory. But when we preserved modular invariance, and I mean, you have to develop regulators that preserve the symmetries like modular variants. That's also what we did in our paper in June. What we did in our paper in June things change, and there are different kinds of symmetries that are there. Okay, as Shamit says, it's perturbative, it's one loop, but they are there. Every quantity that runs has to have a symmetry mu to one over mu in the running. That's already an idea that's not quite field theoretic. So I'm not saying anything is wrong. I'm saying we should try to always have a little bit more of an open mind than some people take. People take. So we're getting toward the end of our discussion session. I think we have time for one more question or comment if someone wants to bring up some, someone who hasn't had a chance yet, wants to raise a question on any point or make a remark. If not, can I ask Michele to make a point about the issue about the plotting inflation? That Michele promised to say something? Ah, yes. Ah, yes, right. Can you also tell me if you see the blackboard? Is it good? Well, it's a little hard to read. It's framed appropriately, but. Oh, yeah. Well, so the D is cut out, at least in our view of it. The D of D S. The D of DS and the B of baste is cut out, and swamp ends at it ends with swamp with an L. So that could be, if someone else sees it differently, let us know. I mean, otherwise I have also a tablet, which I can use. But it would be nice to give a Blackboard presentation. Oh, your presentation, your presentation will be a Blackboard. Is your favorite thing to do?
