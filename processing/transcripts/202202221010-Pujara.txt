The organizers for the invitation and for organizing the excellent workshop. Yeah, so I'll touch upon a couple of different aspects that Eric mentioned actually. But the main part that I'm going to talk about today is looking at negatively buoyant particles in surface waves. And this is joint work with Michelle and Laura, who are both here, and it's just come out in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. Depending upon how it goes with time, Depending upon how it goes with time, I'm going to talk a little bit about the work we're doing in my group here, looking at microplastic beaching and settling in turbulent flows. So, hopefully, we'll get to discuss that a little bit. And I'm happy to take questions on that as well. All right, so let's start looking at particle settling, in this case microplastic settling, in surface waves. And so, you know, the approach here is to try and make a simplification. And make a simplification of how particles settle through this kind of flow. And to do that, we're going to assume that we can describe our wave field essentially with small amplitude wave theory, linear wave theory. And that's just to allow us to make some analytical progress on how we might compute particle motion and, in particular, settling. So we can look at the velocity field under a wave field. Field under a wave field. And the free surface undulations here are characterized by eta with amplitude a, wave number k, and omega, angular frequency omega. And of course, for that, you know, we can write down the solution for the velocity field. And this is, of course, very well known. Now, if we'd like to compute the motion of this sort of particle, and everything I'll discuss today is, you know, assuming that the particle is a sphere, and we'd like to understand its velocity. To understand its velocity through this field, in principle, we can write down the dynamical equations of motion, right? So, f equals ma for this particle, and then essentially solve those numerically. And we can actually then track how this particle moves through this flow field. So, if we wanted to do that, we'd write down the dynamical equation of motion, which would be ma equals the sum of the forces. And so, v here is the particle. And so V here is the particle velocity. And then the forces on this particle include the buoyancy forces, the forces due to the flow around it, added mass effects, and then of course the hydrodynamic drag. So this is basically looking at particle motion in this kind of Maxi-Reilly framework of an inertial particle. And this happens to work actually really well for this kind of situation. Really well for this kind of situation. So, you know, the normal restriction on this kind of dynamics is that you assume that the particle is small. But because the relevant length scales here are going to be the wave amplitude and in particular the wavelength, actually this is a very good assumption. So the length scales of the flow tend to be much, much larger than those of the particle, even for quite large plastics. And so we think that this is a good framework in which to analyze the situation. To analyze the situation. Okay, but the problem we want to address is that can we actually compute this particle transport without having to go through a numerical integration of the full dynamical equation? So that's where we're trying to go. All right, so we can write down the same equation, but in dimensionless form. And so I'm showing here the same equation rewritten in dimensionless form. And for now, I'm going to assume that we're in this linear drag. Assume that we're in this linear drag ratio, which is to say that the particle Reynolds number is assumed to be small. And that means that the drag, the hydrodynamic drag, can be written as Stokes drag, which is linear with respect to the slip velocity. We'll relax this assumption towards the end of the talk. Because in fact, as you'll see, you know, most of the plastics, both micro and macro, actually don't fall into this regime. So we'll have to address that later. But okay, starting. But okay, starting with the linear drag regime, we can rewrite the equation in dimensionless form, and then we get a number of dimensionless parameters that I've listed here that help us characterize this problem. The first is the Stokes number, which relates to the period of the wave. So here the angular frequency is the inverse of the wave period. And then that's compared to the relaxation time of the particle. So over what time scale would the particle adopt the fluid velocity if the velocity If the velocity field itself were not changing, so that's the Stokes number. And then beta here is a fluid force thing coefficient that ends up in front of this material derivative of the fluid velocity. And then we have the density ratio of the particle. So how dense is the particle compared to the density of the fluid? Okay, so it turns out that over a wide range of the kind of applications we're interested in here, We're interested in here, you know, so plastic particles or particles of a certain size, the relaxation time scales tend to be small compared to the wave periods. This is true both in the laboratory and in the field, and it's particularly true in the field where, of course, the wave periods are larger than in the lab. And so, what this means is that the Stokes number is a naturally small parameter in this problem. Okay, and so that helps. Okay, and so that helps because in that case, we can do an expansion about the Stokes number, since it is a naturally small number in this problem. And we can insert this expansion into the dynamical equation and do the usual thing where we collect terms at each order. And that allows us to get some solution of the particle velocity without having to compute the full dynamical equation. So we've simplified it to a certain extent. So the first, you know, So, the first, you know, the leading order solution is quite intuitive. And this is what you might use if you were modeling this kind of situation, where you might say, okay, the velocity of the particle is going to be the velocity of the fluid plus its settling velocity. So Vs here is the vector that represents the bare terminal settling velocity of the particle. Now, the particle inertia, as characterized by the Stokes number here, adds further terms in this expansion, and we get And we get further terms in how the particle moves. So, this is the first bit of the inertial effect on particle motion. Okay, in our case, this problem is actually even more tractable since we know the fluid velocity field, right? So this is in the case where we're going to assume linear wave theory. So we know the fluid velocity field. So we can put that into this solution and just evaluate the different terms. And if we do that, we And if we do that, we get the equations at the bottom here. And so these are the horizontal vx and the vertical vz velocities of our inertial particle. And I've separated these out to kind of help us visualize the different terms. Okay, so this is in dimensionless form. And the middle bit here, which is fluid, is actually the same as the fluid flow. So this is the bit that relates to U. So that's the same as the fluid flow, but it's modified. Fluid flow, but it's modified due to the particle inertia in its amplitude by this amplitude factor A and in its phase relative to the fluid flow by this phase shift phi. And of course, in the vertical case, we also have this terminal settling velocity that's always present. There's another source of inertia in this problem, and that's to do with the fluid inertia. And that, or sorry, the And that, or sorry, the wave amplitude, and that and that brings about these second-order terms in this expansion. And already you can see that in this case, we've got this enhancement in the settling velocity from the non-linear wave effects, right? So this term is always going to be negative, which means it always adds to this bare settling velocity, its terminal settling velocity. And so already due to the inertial effects of the particle coming from the Stokes. The particle coming from the Stokes number coupled to the non-linearity of the wave, we already get this enhanced settling behavior of the particle. Okay, so let me go and now visualize these correction factors that help us explain what the leading order motion of the particle will look like. Okay, so like I said, this is all analytical. Since we have the fluid flow field, we can go ahead. Since we have the fluid flow field, we can go ahead and evaluate these functions. And so we can plot what this amplitude will look like as a function of the two parameters that characterize our particle, in this case, a microplastic particle, the Stokes number and the density ratio. Now, the way to, I think, think about this is that, you know, the density ratio, of course, picks, you know, helps you pick out how dense the particle is with compared to the fluid. And here we're only considering negatively buoyant particles. Particles. So it goes from one. And you know, when we were doing this work, we were not just motivated by microplastics, but also sediments. So the density ratio goes all the way to three here. And then once you have your density ratio, the Stokes number then fixes your particle size, right? So that's the way to visualize this parameter space. Okay, so what is this showing us? This is showing us that in the limit of neutrally borne particles, Neutrally borne particles that are small, where you end up in the top left corner of this figure, and it tells us that the amplitude is one. And the same for the phase. In the limit where the density ratio is one and particles are small, we end up in the bottom left where the phase shift is zero, right? So in this case, we recover our leading order image of what parcels of fluid do under waves. They trace out orbitals, and at the leading order, those orbitals are closed. So of course, at higher order, Okay, so of course, at higher orders, those orbitals are not closed. As Tom mentioned yesterday, we have a drift in the wave direction, but at the leading order, we have these closed orbitals. And now we can examine how particle inertia modifies that picture. So what we see is that as the density ratio increases or our particle size increases, this amplitude is dropping off to below one, meaning that the particle inertia traces out, it makes the particle trace out smaller orbitals than the Smaller orbitals than the equivalent fluid parcels at that location. The same thing happens in phase, but in this case, there's a phase shift as the density ratio increases or the particles become larger. And so that means that the particle oscillations are out of phase with the fluid oscillations. And if we think about this more intuitively, it sort of makes sense. We have a system that's forcing the particle in an oscillatory manner. And because the particle has Manner. And because the particle has some inertia, it doesn't quite keep up with the amplitude of that motion. And then there's a phase shift associated with that motion, too, with relative to the forcing. So that all comes from the particle inertia. Okay, but of course, what we're interested in also is not just looking at the leading order oscillatory motion. We'd like to compute the particle transport. And so here I'm just going to remind you again of the phenomenon of Stokes. Of the phenomena of Stokes drift that Ton already talked about yesterday. And, you know, in terms of looking at sort of a cartoonish explanation of Stokes drift, of course, it comes about from the correlation of velocity gradients and the particle positions, but if we can think also about it as the fact that on net, the leading order motion of fluid parcels is to trace out orbitals, but everything in waves decays with. Everything in waves decays with depth, right? The influence of the waves decays with depth. And so, if we follow this in a Lagrangian sense, we're going to have higher amplitudes of velocity at the top of this oscillation than at the bottom. And so, integrating this effect in time, there's a net drift of fluid parcels that makes it drift in the direction of wave propagation. Okay, so that's classical Stokes drift, and that has, of course, been known about for very long. Has, of course, been known about for a very long time. What we're going to see here is that if there's any vertical motion, as there would be for a sinking particle, you see the same effect in the vertical direction. And so, you know, this is a preview of the simulations that we've done. The particle is sinking and drifting at the same time. But in this case, as it sinks, it goes down faster than it comes back up because by the time it goes, Then it comes back up because by the time it comes back up, we're now lower in the water column, which means we experience a, of course, lower vertical velocity coming up. So, this is basically the vertical analog of this horizontal motion, and it comes about because there's some net settling of the particle. Okay, so this idea is not entirely new. There have been a couple of papers exploring this kind of particle drift with settling particles and showing this vertical drift. Our contribution here, I think, has been. Our contribution here, I think, has been to try to generalize this to a few different cases that weren't considered before and to sort of tidy a few things up. Okay, so like we said, the leading order motion is this oscillatory motion, and then there's a net drift that occurs on much longer time scales in this kind of transport problem. And so that suggests that we perform a multi-scale expansion where we isolate the fast time scales. Isolate the fast time scales from the slow time scales and try and isolate the oscillatory motion out of the drift and compute just the drift. So that's exactly what we did. We insert this expansion in the particle position about the amplitude of the wave, the dimensionless amplitude of the wave, put that into our solution for the particle velocity, collect terms, and then at the second order via the solvability condition, we find the drift velocity. We find the drift velocities for the particle. Okay, so these are the drift velocities that include the effects of particle inertia. And we see again that this amplitude parameter pops up as part of the modified drift. If we look at this carefully, we see that the horizontal drift is some pre-factor multiplied by the classical Stokes drift of fluid parcels. So USD here is the Stokes drift that's been known about for a very long time. That for a very long time. But the inclusion of particle inertia modifies it and, in fact, reduces the horizontal drift because the amplitude, if you remember, is always less than one. In the vertical direction, of course, at the leading order, we have that the particle is just settling at its terminal settling velocity through the flow field, but actually the effects of the wave field. The wave field is to enhance the settling velocity. And then this term here is just the same one rewritten that I showed you earlier, where that's the first thing that comes out of the Stokes number expansion showing that there's a dynamical increase of the particle settling velocity. And then we also see that there's this kinematic increase, which takes a very similar form to how the horizontal drift is modified, right? So this is the same kind of vertical Stokes. The same kind of vertical Stokes drift mechanism that I tried to illustrate earlier. So, both of these terms, in fact, contribute to the settling, and in total, that settling velocity is enhanced. Okay, so again, the advantage of doing all of this is that these are just functions that we can evaluate with the flow field that we already know. And so we can plot those functions. Okay, so doing so, we can compare how the Also, we can compare how the horizontal drift and the vertical drift compare to the Stokes drift for fluid parcels. So, that's on the left-hand side. And then on the right-hand side, this is the settling velocity normalized by the terminal settling velocity of the particle. Okay, so here again, you know, you picked your density ratio, and then the particle size is given by the Stokes number. So, we again see what we expect that for neutrally borne particles that are very small, they drift, of course. That are very small, they drift, of course, at the same Stokes drift that fluid parcels do. Essentially, these become tracer particles. But as the particle inertia increases, or you know, as the density ratio increases and the particle size increases, we start to drift away from this Stokes drift velocity, and we end up at smaller Stokes drifts for the inertial particles than we do for tracer particles. Tracer particles. So, you know, we can visualize this in terms of the mechanisms we've already talked about. Remember, I said that the effect of particle inertia in this oscillatory forcing is that it cannot keep up with the same amplitude of oscillation as fluid tracers. And then, you know, if we look at the fact that the mechanism by which Stokes Drift comes about is that there's this difference in This difference in horizontal velocities going in the wave direction and opposing the wave direction. Well, that difference really depends on the magnitude of the oscillation that the particles undergo, right? So anything that decreases that magnitude, and particle inertia does do that, will decrease that mechanism of the drift. And so that's why we see this reduced horizontal drift. In the vertical direction, we see that the particle velocities are all. That you know, the particle velocities are always uh enhanced, right? So, I've this is a minus sign, and we've normalized by the terminal settling velocity. So, numbers greater than one mean that our settling velocity is enhanced. And here we see something that's, I guess I have to explain it a little bit more, a little bit differently to the rest, and which is that as we become more neutrally buoyant and as the particle size decreases, that's when the percentage increase in the settling velocity is actually the highest. In the settling velocity is actually the highest, right? So you don't see the line here for perfectly neutrally buoyant particles, because, of course, in that case, there is no settling. So we leave that line out, but the highest percentage increase in the settling velocity is actually for the smallest and most close to neutrally buoyant particles. And then that percentage increase actually goes down as the particles become denser and larger. And again, the way to understand. And again, the way to understand this is to think about what the particle motion in the waves is doing. And if you think about the fact that the way the settling velocity is enhanced is by this mechanism where it goes through these oscillatory motions and catches the downward drifts more than it catches the upward drifts. Then that settling velocity enhancement requires that you undergo this orbital motion induced by the waves and then this vertical. And then this vertical Stokes drift type mechanism enhances that settling velocity, right? So if the particle is very large or it's very dense, well, what's really happening is that it's just settling through the flow field very fast and not really sampling that flow field of the waves, which is what produces that enhancement. So the largest enhancements are given in the top left corner here for particles that are barely settling and small. And of course, all of this depends on the way. And of course, all of this depends on the wave parameters, right? So, all these numerical values depend on the wave parameters, and so I've listed the wave parameters for these results. But the trends, of course, are the same for a range of values. Okay. So, the other thing that we found is that actually, you know, often we'd like to compute how particles might disperse in this type of flow. So, if we look at the So, if we look at the dispersion of particles, actually, we can look at these drift velocities. And then, if you compute the divergence of these drift velocities, that would give you the dispersion in a wave average sense. And if you do that, in fact, you find that there's no horizontal dispersion, and then there's a very slight convergence in the vertical direction. But that's not the full story. The full story really requires that you look at how the At how the decay rate works in the vertical direction, right? So, if you remember, Stokes drift decays very rapidly away from the surface. If you go down just a little bit deep into the water column, the Stokes drift is almost negligible. And so that means that the initial vertical position of the particle, things are going to be very sensitive to that initial vertical position for their horizontal drift. Horizontal drift. So, if we compute the wave average position of particles and I initiate some random Gaussian cloud of particles, and this is over a fairly small vertical extent, that cloud is sheared in the horizontal direction by the fact that there's large gradients of the horizontal Stokes drift in the vertical direction. So, I hope that makes sense. This is horizontal dispersion due to vertical shear. And so, really, when you're And so, really, when you're looking at the dispersion of these particles, you have a large horizontal dispersion as long as there's some variation in the initial vertical position. So this is using the wave-averaged solutions that we found. You can see the same thing if you look at particles initialized. So, if you have some constant input of particles into a wave field, let's say at this location, and let's compute the Location, and let's compute the trajectories of those particles in a wave-resolved system over one full wave period. You see that again, where they end up at the bottom of the seabed here, there's a large horizontal dispersion that takes place. And the reason for that, of course, is that you're releasing the particle at the same physical location at different points in the phase, but that gives you a different equivalent wave average. Different equivalent wave-averaged vertical starting point. So, I hope that makes sense. So, and these small differences in the vertical initial conditions make all the difference and result in this large horizontal dispersion. So, these two plots are in fact showing the same thing, but in slightly different frames. And so, the key point here in terms of the mechanics is that the initial conditions as projected onto the wave average variables are very, very important. Are very, very important, especially for the dispersion. Okay, so now that we've got some solutions of our particle motion, remember we started with a dynamical equation F equals ma for the particles. And then through an expansion and Stokes number, we arrive at a kinematic solution of just how the particle velocity varies. And then from that, again, simplified to a wave-averaged drift solution. Drift solutions for the particle. We can now compare how well each of these do, right? So here the blue is a full numerical solution of the dynamical system. The dashed yellow is the kinematic solution from the Stokes expansion. And then the black line is the drift velocity. And so in general, we see that this in fact works very, very well. So I'm listing the parameters here. And even if we increase Listing the parameters here. And even if we increase the Stokes number to almost order one, the solutions still track each other very, very well. The thing that really breaks this is if you increase the wave non-linearity, right? So if we increase the amplitude, then things will start to work not so well. But I guess we would argue in that case that then the flow field described by the linear wave theory is perhaps not so accurate anyway. So we're doing okay in terms of the limit so far. Okay, in terms of the limits of our starting flow conditions. Okay, so let me now move on to the drag question. So this is a figure showing how the Reynolds number of the particle calculated at its terminal settling velocity varies as a function of particle density and diameter. And this is given in log 10 units. And so, you know, if we're interested. And so, you know, if we're interested in microplastics, we're somewhere between, you know, a thousand and maybe 1700 kilograms per meter cubed. And of course, a full range of sizes from about 0.1 millimeters here to all the way to about one centimeter. In most of that range, the Reynolds number tends to actually be bigger than one, right? So one Reynolds number of one would be log 10 of zero. So we're looking for this sort of color. Most of this falls into a non-linear drag regime. To a non-linear drag ratio. And so, you know, if we want these solutions to be useful, we'd really like to extend them to this intermediate Reynolds number ratio. Okay, so the Schiller-Neumann drag model is an empirical parameterization given where the drag coefficient is given by this expression. And this captures the drag variations pretty well in the non-linear drag regime that applies to our problem. And I'm reminding you here that if it were linear drag, Here, here, that if it were a linear drag, the drag coefficient would just be 24 over the Reynolds number, which would in the end result in a drag that's linear with the slip velocity. Okay, so using this in our dynamical equations of motions presents problems because now the drag force is a function of the local instantaneous Reynolds number, and that means that we cannot a priori assume how it might vary as the particle travels through the flow, right? So, we can't do. So, we can't do all the analysis that we've done for non-linear drag. So, but what we realized was that, you know, if we wanted to have some effect of this non-linear drag within our model, but still have it be linearly dependent on the slip velocity, one way to achieve this is to just use the terminal settling velocity Reynolds number here rather than the local instantaneous Reynolds number. And that allows us to capture some effect of this non-linear drag. And of course, this is now. A non-linear drag, and of course, this is now a constant that can be pre-computed and absorbed into the 24. And we can now repeat all the analysis we've already done and use and extend it to non-linear drag, but still with this linearized drag model. Okay, so first of all, I guess I want to show you that this is important. So these are trajectories of particles settling under waves computed from our three different drag models. And I think this is for a one-millimeter microplastic particle. For a one millimeter microplastic particle of something like 1200 kilograms per meter cubed, something like that. So, the kind of experiment you might do in a lab to understand this process. This is assuming Stokes dragged, but in fact, here the particle Reynolds number is closer to a few hundred, so really we should be using the Schiller-Neumann drag, and that completely changes the trajectory and the horizontal motion of this particle, right? So, of course, this non-linear drag is important. This non-linear drag is important. What's nice is that this linearized version works very, very well. And so that means that we can extend all the analysis we've already done for simplifying the particle equations of motion to the velocity solution and a drift solution, and compare it against the full dynamical solutions using a non-linear drag model. And things still work very, very well. Right? So here I'm showing, you know, Reynolds. So here I'm showing Reynolds numbers of 200 or even 1000, and our drift solution, which calculates the enhanced settling velocity and the reduced drift, is able to predict the trajectories of these particles extremely well. Again, what really breaks this is if you increase the wave amplitude, but I've already mentioned that, so I won't do that again. Okay, so the final step in this process was to compare this. Process was to compare this against some laboratory data. And so Laura Clark had already done some experiments measuring settling velocities of spherical particles under different wave conditions. And so, you know, so this is an image from her PIV experiments, and I'm showing here the data compared to the theory. So again, on the horizontal axis here is the settling velocity. So numbers greater than the velocity. Velocity. So numbers greater than one imply enhanced settling. And then we're plotting this as a function of vertical position in the water column. So with zero being the surface. Okay, so and then there are three different wave conditions which correspond to different kh values and then the symbols and symbols of the data and the and the lines of the theory. So yeah, okay, so we see the same trends. We see the same trends. It looks like the theory doesn't capture the full extent of the velocity enhancements, but does capture the kind of shape of it. On the one hand, the data are quite noisy, but on the other, it seems that we're missing something in the theory. So there could be some more work to be done here. But also the other issue that we faced was, you know, we could, the experimental data were not directly comparable to the theory one. Not directly comparable to the theory one-to-one because we could not perform this Lagrangian type averaging that we did in our theory. In the experiments, this is an ensemble average of particles measured against the vertical position. So there is some issues there with the comparison, but on the whole, we're seeing that we're capturing what was seen, at least the trends in the laboratory data. Okay, so how am I doing for time? How am I doing for time? I think you're running one minute over. So if you could just one minute over. Okay, perfect. So let me give you just a quick conclusion and I'll give you a couple of slides just to show you what we're doing now. So overall, you know, we found that particles that are inertial will trace out smaller orbitals. The horizontal drift is reduced relative to Stokes drift and the settling velocity is enhanced relative to Stokes drift, relative to the terminal settling velocity. So the current work that's going on is we're trying to Current work that's going on is we're trying to look at particle settling in finite Reynolds numbers. I won't go into the various aspects of this parameter space that was recently nicely explained in an annual review. But just to show you the kind of work we're doing, there's a tall turbulence chamber where we're 3D imprinting different types of particles and seeing how settling velocities are modified by turbulent flows. A lot of work has been done looking at small particles and this trajectory bias mechanism. This trajectory bias mechanism is well understood. For these large particles, you know, there are these weird effects where the flow is locally disturbed, and that's not so well understood. And some of this applies to microplastics as well. We're also working on some beaching dynamics. And so this is some images from a field work campaign. So this is our toy ocean, Lake Superior, which is nearby. And we've done experiments looking at microplastics at different Looking at microplastics at different points within the beach and at different depths to try and understand the beaching dynamics in the field. And here are some sort of preliminary results of some fibers and things that we found. The same thing we're also looking at in the laboratory. So this is the skeleton of a beach that's gone into our wave flume, and we've been able to track some particles as they move through the swash flow. And you can see, for example, that in some cases, the particles end up beached and don't come back down. Are beached and don't come back down. In other cases, they do come back down and are not beached. And so, you know, much of my PhD work was in swash flow dynamics. So, we're trying to extend that to try and understand the mechanics of the beaching process. So, with that, I just want to acknowledge my co-authors for the main part that I presented, Michelle and Laura, and then Ben and Jewie Young, other students who are here working on the various aspects that I just touched upon. So, thank you. Sorry for going a little late. I'm happy to take Going a little late, I'm happy to take questions. Great. Thanks a lot, Yimish. Great talk and wonderful overview of some of your active research portfolio. So I see quite a lot of hands going up. First hand is from Ross Calvert. Ross, you're muted. There you are. Can you see me, sir? Thanks for a nice talk. Some nice work. Some nice work. I think, yeah, building on a few others. I guess the one question I had about the Reynolds number. So you've taken that kind of approximation of the Reynolds number as the terminal velocity, the new prediction of the terminal velocity. What happens if you instead look at, so there's that difference in the linear orbits, right? That kind of one minus A or A, I can't remember exactly how you defined it. Exactly how you defined it. And what is the, so if you get a difference between the actual orbits and then the velocities that they track out, is that Reynolds number larger or smaller than the one that you were looking at for the terminal velocity? Yeah, so I think I see what you're saying. I guess you're trying to get at, you know, how does this Reynolds number change over the phase of a wave, right? How does it change as a phase? How does it change as a function of kind of the position? Right, so because I guess it's because some things that we found when we did something similar on the floating particles, that the maximum Reynolds number was actually due to the linear velocities of the wave. And the difference between that kind of lagging of the particle behind the linear velocities was actually what induced the highest Reynolds number in our kind. Reynolds number in our kind of simulations. Yeah, yeah. So I can't remember off the top of my head now where, you know, at what point in the particle orbitals the instantaneous Reynolds number is the highest. But what I can say is that the reason this works really well, you know, and you see this in the simulations, right, is that it's essentially because the Stokes number tends to be small in these problems. To be small in these problems, right? The wave period is much larger than the relaxation times of particles. That's true even in the non-linear drag regime. And so essentially what's happening is that the local instantaneous Reynolds number is not oscillating too much about the terminal velocity Reynolds number. And so that's why we get away with this linearization and extending this solution to non-linear drag. So we have quite a few Yeah, we have quite a few hands, so okay. So I think maybe the meet the speaker is a good venue. Elizabeth, would you like to go next? Hi. Thanks for the talk. I have a question because you used the Gatiniol-Maxi-Rayleigh equation. And first question is: you didn't get, you didn't have the history force, I guess. So I don't know if. That's right. So I don't know if it's important, and since you have some dissociation, I wonder that that's one thing which maybe worth trying. We did that because we look at particles settling in vortices. That's right. That's right. It was an important, so it may be like that. I don't know. Now, this equation actually is an expansion at Low Reynolds number. So I guess we don't know what it's going to be. We don't know what it's going to be. As soon as you have a non-linear drag, I don't know what equation you should use. So, did you use just because I think what will be dominant is buoyancy and drag. So, do you get only, do you keep only that part or do you use other thing? Use the whole equation because I think just non-linear drag and buoyancy will be enough. Right, right. So, here non-linear drag and buoyancy. So here, non-linear drag and buoyancy, I guess, yeah, those were the dominant terms in the Taylor-Green vortices, right? In this case, you know, the equation that we're analyzing does have all of these terms. So it doesn't have the history force, but we do include the pressure gradient and the added mass effects. Yeah, but I understand that, but this equation actually is an expansion at the Low Reynolds number, and it doesn't hold as long as. As long, as soon as your Reynolds number becomes large. So, I wonder, I mean, it's a problem because I don't know what to use. Right, right, right, right. That's exactly right. So, we've taken, yeah, right, right. And I guess from my reading of it, you know, I thought that the strictest restriction on the validity of this Reynolds number is that the particle really has to be small compared to the length scales in the flow. And so and that assumption here is really well justified just because it's the wavelength tends to be the controlling length scale. Length tends to be the controlling length scale. Yeah. So I have a last question, if I can. I mean, you look, it's for spheres. Now, if you have an object which is elongated, which I understand is something that will happen for plastic, they're going to be, if you have inertia on the scale of the particle, you're going to have an additional torque, which can have the particle, which with the particle. which with the particle will rotate to uh to a direction which is perpendicular to the motion so um which was calculated by cox for instance do you think you can add that we i actually presented this at last year's dfd so i can i can tell you more about it we we've looked at all the models that you published in lopez and guazzli and and used them in in in waveflow to understand how this dynamic works Dynamic words. Sorry, for that. Plenty of scope for the meter speakers for sharing some papers. Thanks a lot. Quick question from Jacques. Yes, thanks. Another question about the Reynolds number and the non-yard drag. I mean, I'm really not an expert. I just was wondering, the Reynolds number should be based on something like the relative velocity of the particle with respect to the fluid, which must be much smaller, at least if the settling velocity is weak. Is weak, but rotative velocity must be tiny, right? So I just am a bit surprised of the relevance of this non-interdrag. I guess this maybe is the figure that answers your question. So this is the settling velocity computed using the cliff at all parameterization of the drag as a function of density and diameter. And so here we can see that actually the settling velocity is high enough in this. Is high enough, and this is in quiescent float, is high enough that non-linear drag is important over most of this parameter space. You know, I guess I just want to be reassured for myself that an expert agrees on the statement that if there was no distilling velocity, let's say we switch over gravity, then we can have pretty violent waves but still have a linear drag because the particle doesn't drag velocity is weak, is that correct? Yeah, that totally, totally, yeah. Yeah, totally, totally, yeah, yeah. Yeah, thanks. So we're running out of time, so Susan, perhaps you could use the meet the speaker venue for your question, then we can move on to the next speaker.
