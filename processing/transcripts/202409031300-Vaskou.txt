So you have some pictures on the edges. And these labels are letters at least two. And such a graph would be called a presentation graph. And this is given out. This presentation is given by what the old generators are the vertices of the graph. And then you have these gray-like relations whose length is given by The coefficient MAB, which is the coefficient on the edge between A and B, if there is. Okay, so I think we saw this convention several times already. Convention for this talk is that every alternative group will be large type, so we'll not be mentioning R. So it should be It's a match type, meaning that the coefficients are all at least three, so there is no committing relations between yours and the generators. Okay, so now about the motivation. So in this work, we studied several
