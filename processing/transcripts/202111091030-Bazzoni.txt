I'm going to speak about these locally conformal simplicity structures of the first kind of manifolds. And I'm basically going to expose, so to tell about the results that I obtained a couple of years ago with Juan Carlos Marrero, but I will also use some of the results contained in a joint paper with Daniel Angela and Marizio Parton. So I will put some references at the end. Okay, so I will. I mean, there have been excellent introductory talks, so I will maybe be a bit quick about the beginning. And then I will try to speak about some results, structure results for locally conformal symptomatic manifolds of the first kind, and some existent results for these kinds of LCS structures, and motivated by the search for. Motivated by the search for examples, which are not so easy to obtain in this setting of first kind, I will move to left-invariant searches on Lie groups and therefore on Lie algebras. And I will conclude with an example of the theory we develop. So I would like to introduce, I will introduce these LCS structures of the first kind, especially on compact manifolds, at least. I mean, I will also consider structures on leaf. We'll also consider structures on leak groups which are not compact, but of course, the main idea is always to obtain compact examples. And as we already saw appearing in many of the previous talks, there is a nice interplay of locally conformal symplectic contact and also symplectic geometry. So this hasn't quite come up yet, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe it has, but there is also a relation with There is also a relation with symplactic geometry coming up, at least for this first kind. So, let me just briefly recall that an SEA structure, also to fix notation, is a non-degenerate two-form for which we find a closed one-four theta. So, omega is the two-form, and theta, the leaf form, is the one-four such that d omega is theta wedge omega. So, it turns out that the format is the same. So it turns out that theta is completely determined by omega, and the closeness condition is automatic for complex dimension at least three, so Lira dimension at least six. And in general, we assume that theta is non-zero. I mean, if theta is zero, then we are going back to simplicity geometry, so not very interesting, or at least not in this setting. And also, this sort of local definition has. This sort of local definition has come up already in Libya's talk, at least for SCK. Manifolds. This is, of course, equivalent to the existence of an open cover with contractible bicontractible open sets on which each of the local one forms have a primitive. And then, of course, omega is conformally closed, from which the name. Of course, one can also give this definition with the simplest. The symplactic cover on which the DAC transformations act by rescaling the symplactic form. This is also possible. And concerning, of course, LCK manifolds, which have occupied some of the previous talks, they all have a sort of natural LCS structure. One object which is important in Which is important in the study of LCS manifolds is that of fixed an LCS form on a manifold, one can consider its conformal class, which is formed by all the two forms on the manifold, which differ from the given one by a positive, let's say, positive function e to the f, where f is a smooth function on m. And of course, And of course, the leaf form of some element of the conformal class differs by the leaf form of the original one by an exact form, which by the way says, as Levy remarked, that the homology class of the leaf form is well defined and independent of the conformal class. And we say that omega is globally conformal symplectic if there is some element of the conformal class with exactly form. With exactly form. These are the kind of manifolds that we usually want to avoid because they remind us of simple active geometry. This already comes up, came up already before the idea of Lutonovich, cohomology, or Marsh Novikov or Witten. It has many names. But it's defined starting with a manifold and a closed one form. Then one can deform or twist the differential by this theta. By this theta, then it's coerced here, so we have cohomology, and this is a twisted cohomology which is very, very different, as it was already said in the first talk, from the usual Durham cohomology of the manifold. So, for example, there is a point-readuality, but as far as I know, H0 is usually zero if the manifold is connected. So, is Hn So is Hn, maybe if you assume that a manifold is orientable, as it is our case. So it's a strange cohomology, which is not so easy to compute, but it's very relevant for us. And thanks to this observation, so some, let's say, almost symplectic two-form defines the NSCS structure, if and only if there is a closed one-form such that omega is, let's say, closed in the two-secohomology. So it defines a cohomology. Twisted cohomology, so it defines a cohomology class. So this Lichnarovich cohomology or Marshnovikov cohomology allows us a first difference, first distinction between La Sierra structures according to whether we can find a primitive, so to say, Eda of the closed, the twistedly closed omega. Which is, by the way, equivalent, of course, to the vanishing of the cohomology class. And then in this case, we call the SCS structure the SCS form exact. Otherwise, we say it's not exact. And the remark is that being exact is an invariant of the conformal class of the SCS structure. So the primitive of an element of the conformal class is just the rescaled or the yes, the rescale, the conformally rescaled. Conformally rescaled primitive of the original one. So, this is a conformal notion, examples. And these LCS structures, they are, I put like quotation marks, they're not too hard to find. I'm not saying that they are not hard to find because they are, but they exist. And there is a series of results. The first one is on open manifolds. And it is a result by Erilojo Fernandez. Is a result by Rilojo Fernandez, Pedro Freshlik, and partially David Martinez Torres. And also, they exist on closed manifolds with non-vanishing first battery number with a non-degenerate two-form. Sometimes this is also expressed in terms of the existence of an almost complex structure. And this is due to, firstly, to Eliasberg and Murphy. And it has been refined in terms of the embedding or the inclusion of the Embedding or the inclusion of the torsion-free part of the integer cohomology in the first Ramcohomology group by Menali Bertenson-Elgai-Meniac. So these structures, let's say they exist and they abund in some sense. So let's take another point of view on LCS structures, which was suggested by Weissmann already in his foundational paper of, I think, 1980. Foundational paper of, I think, 1984. Let's consider an LCS manifold with Lie form theta and call a vector field an infinitesimal automorphism of the LCS structure, SCS manifold, if it preserves or its flow preserves the two-four. In this case, we have this notation vector fields on m omega, this notation here. And in And in presence of this, we can define a Lie algebra homomorphism from this infinitesimal automorphisms to R. R is just the trivial Lie algebra, but just evaluating the leaf form on X. This turns out to be well defined. I mean, theta of X is constant, actually. This can easily be seen. So using automorphisms and Using automorphisms and symmetries in some sense, one can distinguish LCS structures as follows. We call omega of the first kind if this leave morphism is non-zero. So it is surjective since R has dimension one, and it's of the second kind otherwise. This is another way a priori not related to the distinction between or the partition between exact and non-exact. We'll see that it's actually a bit related. We'll see that it's actually a bit related. Um, it turns out that if there is an S structure of the first kind, omega is such a structure, then you find a unique vector, a unique vector field infinitesimal allomorphism, such that, of course, L of U is one, and we call U this anti-Lie field. The first remark is that actually SS structures, the first kind implies. SES structures, the first kind implies exact, and the converse is not true. So there are exact structures which are not of the first kind. So we are in a subclass, in a proper subclass of exact SCS structures. If you have a compact manifold with, so in particular, let me notice that this condition L of u equal 1 is actually theta of u equal 1. So u pairs or theta pairs with u. Particular, theta can have no zeros. And so if M is compact, then theta is a non-vanishing one cohomology class. And the first battery number of M has to be at least one. This is, up to my knowledge, the only topological restriction for compact manifolds with LCS structures of the first kind. Of the first kind. Weismann structures appeared yesterday in Leviel's talk, and the underlying SCX structure to a Weismann structure is of the first kind. So these examples come from Weissmann geometry. These SCX structures come of the first kind, come from Weissmann geometry. And here is the thing, the difference between, or one of the difference between first kind and exact, being of the first kind is not an environment. Being of the first kind is not an environment of the conformal class. So that's not a conformal notion. And in fact, one can show that in the class of, in a conformal class of a first kind, of an SEAL structure of the first kind, there is always an SES structure of the first kind, of the second kind. Okay, so that's not an invariant notion, a conformal invariant notion. And differently from what happens in the exact case, where we have precise existent results, there are no general existent results for LCS structures of the first kind. So one of the main problems is to have examples of LCS structures of the first kind. That's basically the motivation for the study we did, or one of the motivations for the study we did with Juan Carlos Marrero. With Juan Carlos Marrero. So let's see a little bit what the structure is, or the structure of SES manifolds of the first kind is. The idea is that since this condition seems to be more restrictive than exact, maybe something more can be said. So maybe there are, it's not so crazy to expect some structure results. And this is actually the case. So the first observation. The first observation leading to this first puzzle, piece of puzzle leading to the structure results is this observation or theorem by Weissmann in his foundational paper of 84. So suppose you have an SES structure of the first kind with leaf form theta, omega is the least SCS structure, and take U, the anti-leafield, contract omega with U, change the sign, and then call this eta. And then call this eta. Then it turns out that the differential of eta has around 2n minus 2, where 2n is the dimension of the manifold. And there is a non-vanishing notion, so a non-vanishing condition. So theta wedge, eta wedge d eta to the theta, sorry, to the n minus 1 is never is nowhere zero. That's a volume four. And also, omega is actually the differential of the twisted differential of eta. This, by the way, shows that exact, yes, the first kind implies exact. That yes, the first kind implies exact. But there is a converse also. So suppose M is a 2n manifold with two nov-vanishing one-forms, theta and eta. Theta is closed, and you suppose that the rank of the eta is smaller than 2n. And also this wedge product theta, which eta wedge the eta to the n minus 1 is nowhere zero. And then set omega equal to the twist differential of eta. Then, Differential of eta. Then omega is an SES structure of the first kind on M, and the leaf form is actually theta. So this is something that I think is known in the literature as contact pair in some papers by Band and Kochik. So this is another point of view on FCS structures of the first guy. We'll see why contact appears. Let's see how one can come How one can come across LCS structures of the first kind. There are no general results, as I say, system results, but there are some ways to produce them. The first one is a construction which is known as mapping torus, or actually suspension, as Baptiste was calling it before, which is a very general construction. So you can just take any smooth manifold and a diffeomorphism, and then you have a Z action on the product of P times. On the product of P times R, which sends M and the point PT on P times R to the Mth iteration of phi applied to the point P. And it just translates time, so to say, toward the right or the left by M, by the integer M. And actually, this action is very easy to see that it's free and it's properly discontinuous. So you have a question space, which is a manifold, and also you have a Manifold. And also, you have a fiber bundle structure. And the fiber bundle structure is just the projection on this T coordinate or the T class, so to say, modulo Z. And we call this the mapping torus of P and Phi, or the suspension of P and Phi. And if you have a contact manifold, that's the first time that apparently contact comes up in my talk at least. If you have a contact manifold, List if you have a contact manifold and a contact manifold actually defined by a one-form, so a co-oriented contact manifold, and take a strict contactomorphism, so a diffeomorphism of the manifold, which pulls back the contact form to itself. So it is more than just preserving the contact distribution, because to preserve the contact distribution, it would be enough to have phi star of eta equal to eta the f times eta. So this is more strict notion. Strict notion, of course. Turns out that this P5 has a natural SEL structure of the first kind. This, I think, was, I'm not sure where it was proven for the first time, but this is well known. Maybe it was Weizmann. I'm not sure though. And there's actually a kind of converse to this result. This is due to Baniaga in 2002, and Baniaga proves that if And Banyaga proves that if you have an SCS structure of the first kind on a compact manifold, then you find a contact manifold P eta, so contact manifold with contact distribution defined by a one form, and a strict contactomorphism, phi, such that m and the map intours are diffeomorphic. So up to diffeomorphism, all NCX structures on the first kind. Structures on the first kind of on compact manifolds are mapping Torah. But there is a subtle, or maybe not so subtle, but there is a point here. So let me just say that in general, any compact manifold fibring over S1 is diffromorphic to a mapping torus. And this is basically Tischler's result. So Banyaga has to work more, but basically Tischler's theorem, which already appeared, is a starting point. The subtle point, in my opinion, is that this diffeomorphism. Opinion is that this diffeomorphism has nothing to do with the given LCS structure. So the LCS structure of the mapping torus, which exists by the previous proposition, has nothing to do with the given LCS structure on M. So this is somehow a density or approximation result. And so this has nothing to do with the given one. And this is in some sense a little annoying. And this is in some sense a little annoying because you recover the manifold, but the structure is, of course, different. So, this kind of theorem, though, has a lot of interest because of, for example, it allows to compute the homology or the cohomology of M in terms of that of P and of the monodromy action of phi on cohomology. So it has lots of applications. It's very useful in some kinds. It's very useful in some contexts, for example, in topology, algebraic topology. So let's see a different structure result, which we proved together with Juan Carlos, in which in some sense, it's very similar in spirit, but we do not sacrifice our SEA structure to the altar of Mapping toward it. So the setting is that of a compact connected manifold with an SCS structure of the first kind, anti-Lie vector field U, and eta the contraction of omega with U with the minus sign. So we need to make some hypothesis on this structure. The first one is that the anti-Lie vector field is complete. And the second one is that The second one is that, so of course, the distribution associated to, so the kernel of theta is a distribution, which is also a foliation because theta is closed. And we require that this foliation has at least one compact leaf. And we denote by I the inclusion. What do you mean by you? It's on a compact map. It's on the compact manifold, no? Yes, you're right. I am seeing this right now. Sorry. So I think we have also a result in which the manifold is non-compact. And there you have to ask for it, but I chose to present only the compact case. So in this case, of course, the hypothesis is redundant. I'm sorry. You're totally right. So the crucial hypothesis is that there is a compact leaf on the foliation. So in this case, The foliation. So, in this case, it turns out that the pullback of this eta to L is a contact form, and that there is a strict contactomorphism of the leaf, which is, of course, a contact manifold. And the flow of U induces an isomorphism, so in the category of LCS manifolds of the first kind, between the suspension or the mapping torus and M. So, M is as an L C S manifold. Is as an LCS manifold the suspension. Okay, so this is, of course, we need more hypothesis. We cannot say anything in general. We need the existence of a compact leaf. So as Baptiste noticed, the hypothesis on U is unnecessary if the manifold is compact. But then we have something which respects the given LCS structure of the first kind on M. Okay. Okay, and the proof of this result is not particularly difficult, is just a little bit of foliation theory. So there isn't much technology involved. Can I ask here? So if I take in this case, like the lead derivative of theta with u, is that zero in this case? That's zero in this case? If you in the anti-Lie vector field, that's a constant. Oh, it's a constant. Okay, yeah. So I just didn't write it. I just said it. But it's because of this condition Lx of omega equal to zero, it turns out that also, I mean, theta is close. So this is a part of the lead derivative. And it turns out that this is differential zero. So when you take the lead derivative and you apply d, you get that at zero. So you're just saying that you're basically. You get that at zero. So you're just saying that you're basically the flow of U is preserving the foliation of the journal. And basically, in some sense, one way, at least the way in which I imagine is that if you flow along U, that's in some sense, this is at each time, for each time, so at some point you close this flow, and at each time you have a copy of L moving around this. L moving around this base circle, which has this S1. Okay, I see. And because you're on a compact thing, there's finite volume, so you have to wrap up. I see. Yes, you have to wrap up. But you do wrap up at some point. And I mean, you could have this sort of irrational thing on Torre or so on. But in this case, everything is avoided by this hypothesis that you have at least one compact leaf. Excuse me, do you assume that theta is not? Do you assume that theta is non as no zero? Yes, because again, this first kind condition says that L of U is one, but L of U is theta of U. So this means that theta pairs with U and gives one at every point. So theta is nowhere zero, of course. Okay, thank you. Okay. So the existence of the compact leaf of monster. The existence of the compact leafer monks to say that the cohomology class is of rank one. I guess. I'm not sure right now. Maybe you're right. But I'm not so sure. So I prefer not to. I'm not so sure. So I prefer not to say anything. Okay, maybe we can talk about this later. Yeah, thank you. Okay, so let's define another notion, which is probably well known. Given any SES structure on M, then the Lie vector field is the vector field. The vector field determined by the fact that it's that when you contract omega with it, you obtain the leaf form. Okay. In fact, V is in the kernel of the Lie morph homomorphism, and it's also an infinitesimal automorphism of the LCS structure. That's basically trivial. So, another structure result by Weissmann. Weisman is that if you have an SCI structure of the first kind on a compact manifold, and you take the Lie and the anti-Lie vector field V and U, and you consider the distribution spanned by those, and actually you can prove that this is a foliation on, you call it G, on M, and under certain regularity assumptions, which I don't want to say too much. Which I don't want to say too much about, then the space of leaves has a symplectic structure. And the projection to the leaf space is a principal T2 bundle. Okay. So does this regularity assumption imply that the leaves are Tori? I think the leaves are always Tori, but maybe they don't close to a foliage. They maybe they don't close to a foliate, they don't they don't uh close, they don't give a t2 bundle structure. I mean, let's say, no, this is not well expressed. The leaves could be R2 if you have something which is not located properly, okay? So, the regularity condition reflects on the fact that they actually give a complex location of R2 to T2. Okay, so you always have a principal R2 bundle. So, you always have a principal R2 bundle in some sense, but in that case, the quotient is probably not a manifold. So, you have this kind of orbifold things or something like that. So, this theorem says that symplectic geometry also appears in the context of or related to LCS structures of the first kind on compact manifolds. As a corollary, just a question. You said that, so like you have this R2 bundle. If I have just one, like, let's suppose I know that one leaf is compact. Is that enough to just conclude that every leaf is compact, right? You need more in this case. Like, is there any extra symplectic structure that's going on that's not obvious? I must confess, I don't remember. Weiss monk. I think not. Sorry. I think in Weissman. I think in Weissmann's papers, regularity means the classical Palais regularity. That is, for every point, you find some neighborhood in which the leaf through that point enters once. Okay, okay, so it's class, so it's just flowbox. That's his notion of regularity. And he doesn't work with quasi-regularity, which would mean that the leaf enters a finite number. mean that the leaf enters a finite number of times. Yes. And you obtain or be false. Exactly. In this case, you would obtain orbifolds and then you would have the Weissmann doesn't speak about or be false. He has regularity and quotient manifolds or not. Yes, that's all. I guess one can think about quasi-regularity in this I think like if you want to see a simple example, like just take A simple example, like just take if you take a contact manifold, then the leaves are just you take a trajectory of the red vector field times S1. And so when the trajectory is closed, then you have a torus. And when it's not closed, it is something absolutely weird. Absolutely wild. As one time are living. Yes. Yes. In the best case scenario, V would be the. Would be the rep field of the contact structure. And of course, so you would have to quotient by this S1 action generated by the rep field, and then you would obtain the symplectic manifold. And then you still have this extra U direction, which you collapse also. But the thing is that you can do that together and do that in one step in some sense, from LCS of the first kind to symplectic. Okay. Okay, so as a sort of corollary to this theorem that we proved with Juan Carlos, we have some existence, well, mild actually existent results for LCS structures of the first kind, which are based on this, the result of Martinette, which was and Lutz, which was already quoted in Melanie's talk. In Melanie's talk from yesterday, which is that, of course, this is now completely generalized, and we know that, or at least it's clear when some manifolds admit contact structures. But back in 1971, Martinette proved that a closed-oriented manifold of dimension three has a contact form. Okay. And the existent results, which very mild existent results, which I will Which very mild existent results, which I will present, are in dimension four. Okay, so they build on this Martinette results and on some of its equivariant, in some sense, extensions. So the first extension of Martinette result is from Makamishim and Suboi from 91 and separately Neder Kruger from in 2005. I'm sorry. And this says that if you have a closed-oriented manifold dimension 3 and you have some orientation-preserving action of S1 on Orientation-preserving action of S1 on L. Then we have a contact form on L which is an which is S1 invariant. And the other extension is due to Carson 2012. And it proves that if you have an oriented closed manifold of dimension 3, and you suppose that a finite group gamma of prime order X on L preserving the orientation, then you find a conduct form on L which is gamma invariant. L, which is gamma invariant. Okay, so you can have these equivariations of Martinette and Lutz theorem. So using this, we have this existent result for SES structures of the first kind on four manifolds. So now I don't assume the manifold to be compact. Now, I don't assume the manifold to be compact. And it turns out that under the hypothesis that you just have a closed one form without singularities, without zeros, and you assume that the foliation defined by theta F has a compact leaf, which you call L, then if M is non-compact, it does have a globally conformal symplatic structure of the first kind, which is globally conformal to the symplatization of L. So in this case, the picture is clear. In this case, the picture is clear. And this is the part of the theorem that was missing from my first result. And if M is compact, then we know by the previous result that you can identify it with a mapping torus, L phi. So you have a strict contactomorphism of the fiber, of sorry, of the leaf, such that which is identical in the LCL setting to M. M and if you have an action of S1 on the fiber which preserves the orientation induced on L and your phi, your sort of gluing map is a member of this action for some lambda in S1, then M admits an SES structure of the first kind. So this reflects the first So, this reflects the first extension of Martinet's theorem. And if you have some phi which preserves the orientation on L, induced on L, and also the discrete transformations on M induced by phi, so taking, we call it gamma, taking the powers of phi, and if it's finite. And if it's finite, and this is prime order, then M also admits an SCI structure of the first kind. So basically, this result is just putting together the previous structure result with this equivalent extensions of MACINET. We didn't really do much. We are not aware, or we were not at least. I'm still not, maybe Juan Carlos is, but I'm not aware if there have been improvements on the existence of. Improvements on the existence of, um, of course, uh, this kind of sort of equivariant extensions of Martinette theorem. So if there are, then you can prove that you can give further examples of or existence results on LCS manifest of LCS structures of the first kind. Okay, so these are some very general, I mean, general. Are some very general, I mean, general, but still of limited application results on existence of LCS structures of the first kind. So, in the second part of this talk, I would like to tell you how to actually produce examples of LCS structures of the first kind on manifolds. And these manifolds will eventually be some manifolds which already appeared in some of the talks. So, basically, NIM manifolds. We have some more general results on solved manifolds, but I will not speak. On solved manifolds, but I will not speak about those today. We have so far, so for the moment, we have the notion of a locally conformal symplectic Lie group, and you call G a Lie group of dimension 2n locally conformal symplectic Lie group if you find a left invariant two form, which is nowhere zero, for which there exists a one form theta such that d theta of omega d theta of omega so there is a little typo here it should be d omega minus theta wedge omega and is zero okay uh so so that the d omega is theta wedge omega okay in the left invariant setting and of course you have the difference or this distinction between first kind and second kind in the first case we require the existence of an invariant a left invariant vector field which preserves which Which preserves, which is an infinitizer, automorphism, and pairs with the leaf form. And in this case, as it happened before, if you contract omega with U and change the sign, then you obtain a primitive of omega in the Lignerovich cohomology. And of course, since we consider left environment structures and Lie groups, you can definitely move to Lie algebras and define the notion of locally conformal symplectic Lie algebra. Conformal symplectic Lie algebra. And this is just a two co-cycle, sorry, not two co-cycle, just an element of lambda two of the second axiom power of g star, whose nth power is non-zero, for which you find a covector theta, such that same type as before, d omega is theta wedge omega. So d theta of omega is zero. In this case, you call G and S Lie algebra. So the idea is that So, the idea is that to obtain examples, we will try to understand the structure of an LCS Lie algebra. We will have an L C S structure on the unique connected, simply connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is G. Of course, if it's simply connected, nothing really serious happens. So we'll have to compactify in some sense, and that's where we will consider new manifolds and quotient biolattis to make everything compact. Quotient by a lattice to make everything compact. And this quotient will have an SES structure of the first kind, and it will be compact. Again, you have this notion of first kind and second kind. In this case, you call U an anti-Elie vector if it preserves omega and pairs with theta. And again, you have a primitive in the twisted cohomology for omega exactly defined in this way. Okay. Okay, let me briefly, since symplatic and content already seem to be playing an important role, we want to move to Lie algebra. So let me just briefly recall what a symplactic structure in a Lie algebra is. That's basically, that is a co-cycle and is a two-co-cycle in the Lie algebra equal homology. So it defines a two-cohomology class and it's non-degenerate. So the nth x0 power is non-zero. And a content Lie algebra. And a contact Lie algebra is just a Lie algebra with a context structure. So here, I think of this context structure as an element of H, the dual, which has this non-degeneracy condition. And in this case, you have the Rib vector, which is uniquely defined by these two conditions. We have a few facts about unimodular symplectically algebras. Unimodular is by the result of, I'm not sure, maybe. Of, I'm not sure, maybe that's not what Alexandra quoted, but there is a result by Milner which says that if a Lie group G has a compact quotient of some kind by a lattice, then the Lie algebra must be unimodular. So if we want to obtain compact quotients, we need to start with unimodular Lie algebras, which basically means that there is a volume form, so that the volume form is not exact. Volume form is not exact. And it turns out that if you have a unimodular symplectic algebra, that is automatically solvable. And the only semi-simple algebras which admit convex structures are SU2 and SL2. So this will come up a little later, or not much later, but will play a role. So the second condition actually plays a role right now. If you consider, if you suppose to have a reduction. If you suppose to have a reductive LCS Li algebra, then you don't have lots of possibilities. Either G is the direct sum of SU2 plus R, or G is the direct sum of SL2 plus R. And the L C L structure is of the first kind. And we also have a complete classification of L C L structures on the reductive Lie algebras. This was also obtained in an independent paper by Vicente Cortes and collaborators. Vicente-Cortez and collaborators. Okay, so the reductive context is very poor for us. There will be no examples. So let's move to solvable and nilpotent. Before we do this, let me notice that SU2 plus R is just the Lie algebra of the S3 times S1, which is a prototype of SCS manifold of the first kind, which is not symplectic. Symplectic. So, as I said, we concentrate on, we leave the reductive world and we move to nilpotent. And we also have something to say for solvable algebras, but that's more complicated. So we'll stick with nilpotent. We'll have some general results and then we'll make them concrete in the nilpotent case. So let me say something that in general, if you have a Li Alto. That in general, if you have a Lie algebra G, you can take the direct sum of G with R, and then there are two natural ways to make this direct sum a Lie algebra. The first one is to, you need to start with the derivation of the Lie algebra G, and then basically you define a Lie algebra structure on G plus R by saying that if your vectors are of the form x 0, y 0. are of the form x 0 y 0 then the commutator is what you had before so this technically should be x y g comma 0 so this lives in the g summant of g plus r and the action of the generator of r or one generator of r on some vector is precisely the derivation and another way is you start with a co-cycle so general two co-cycle Two co-cycle sigma, and you can form the central extension, which is as a vector space r plus g, g plus r. And the real algebra structure in this case is the generator of r commutes with every vector from g and oops. I don't know how to make this disappear. I don't see what's behind. Okay. Okay. I'm half reading, but okay, now it's gone. The commutator of 0x and 0y is just sigma of xy, which lives in R, and the usual commutator in G. So the first construction is mimicking mapping tori, and the second construction is mimicking S1 bundles. So the first result is that how to obtain LCS-Li algebras from contact Li algebra. To obtain LCS Li algebras from content Li algebras, there is a one-to-one correspondence between LCS Li algebras of the first kind with content Lie algebras endowed with a contact derivation. And the correspondence is given as follow. If you have a content Lie algebra with a contact derivation, which means that d star of eta is zero, then the semi-direct product of H and R has a natural LCS structure of the first kind. And conversely, if you have an SCS Lie algebra of the first kind, you call U the anti. algebra of the first kind you call u the anti-leaf field and eta is minus contraction of u omega with u then um uh h so the contently algebra is the kernel of theta and uh the content form is just the restriction of eta to h okay so this is how you go back and forth between lcs and cont of the first kind and lie algebras um as i said so As I said, so H has a counter Lie algebra and it has a counter derivation, and moreover, when you form the semi-direct product of H and R with this derivation, you obtain exactly G. Okay, so this is analogous in some sense of Weissmann result. Well, I didn't really make the counter structure appear there, but that's more or less what it is, or Barniaga result in some sense. Okay. Okay, now we can try to go one step down again and go from contact to symplectic. It's a general fact that if you have a contact Lie algebra, then either the center is trivial or the center is spanned by the rig vector. So there is not a lot of choices for this. And we will consider contently algebras with non-trivial center. They are meant. They are meant to be, let's just say, bootbang constructions on symplectically algebras. So let's see how, again, these are circle bundles or central extensions. And that's exactly what I was, what I'm going to say, that this is very well known. Contently algebras with non trivial center are in one-to-one correspondence with central extensions of symplectic Li algebras. So if you have a symplectic structure on S, you can just do the central extension with cosycle sigma, the symplectic structure, and this has a Sigma, the Saplaty structure, and this has a contact structure. And if you have a contactly algebra with rib vector field R, whose center is therefore, since we assume that there is a center, must be spanned by R, then you can quotient. And this is a simplicity structure sigma. And if you do the central extension of S by this co-cycle sigma, you recover H. So that's the relation between contact. The relation between contact and symplectic. So we went up and down contact and LCS of the first kind, and we went up and down symplectic and contact. So now we are trying to put all of this together and do two steps in one. So if you have a symplectic Lie algebra as sigma, you call a derivation symplectic if it satisfies this condition. Okay, sigma of the xy. Okay, sigma of the xy plus sigma of x dy is zero for every couple of vectors x y and s and the sort of direct step, direct way from going for going from L C S of the first kind to symplectic is the following. You have a one-to-one correspondence between LCS Lie algebras of the first kind of dimension 2n plus 2, whose Lie vector v is central. Remember that the Lie vector is more or less Is morally the rib vector in some sense. And the other side of the correspondence in symplactic Lie algebras of dimension 2n with a symplectic derivation. Okay, so you can basically do two steps in one going from symplectic to LCS of the first kind. And you just need some symplectic Lie algebra with a symplectic derivation. Okay? And this recovers all LCS Lie algebras of the first kind of dimension 2n plus 2 with Of dimension 2n plus 2 with central Lie vector. How does this correspondence work? These are just a couple of formulas. If you have a symplectic, this is basically putting together the two previous results. You can just take a symplectic Lie algebra with a symplatic derivation. You form G R plus R plus S sorry plus R and define a Lie bracket on it just by using the data you have. So you have this co-cycle, sigma, and you have this derivation. Have this derivation, and that's what you do. Then, this is the Lie algebra. You can define theta and eta in G star by this way. So theta of Ax alpha is alpha and eta of Ax alpha is A. And if you set omega d theta of eta, you can see that omega theta is an L C structure of the first kind on G with central Lie vector, which is 1, 0, 0. Okay? And we And we call this sort of direct procedure an LCS extension. Okay, so this Lie algebra, G with the Lie algebra given by the first formula and the LCS structure given of the first kind given by the second formula is the LCS extension of S sigma by the derivation. Okay, so now the last piece of information that I would like to tell you, and I will be quite quick before I Quick, before I run this slide, it's a procedure due separately to Darier, Medina, and Dervois. And this tells you that basically every symplectic Lie algebra can be obtained from the abelian Lie algebra R2 by a sequence of an appropriate number of symplectic double extensions. Okay, so I will just put something down, and this will be. Down, and this will be quite. It's not complicated, it's actually trivial, but it's there is a lot of notation. So, it's just a procedure that allows you to go back and forth from R2 and a sequence of simpletic derivations to obtain a simpleted Lie algebra and vice versa. Every symplectic Lie algebra can be reduced to R2 appropriately. Okay, so the data you need are a simpleted Lie algebra, a derivation, some vector. Some vector, you have a recipe, not really important. You have first H0, which is a central extension, and then you have S, which is a semi-direct product. And the output is that this S is a symplectic Lie algebra. Okay. And it's called double extension because you see I've added an R factor to S0 here and another R factor. To S0 here and another R factor to H0. So morally, S is just S0 plus R plus R. Okay, we call this the simple active double extension. And the main result is that in the nilpotent setting, every simple acting nilpotent Lie algebra can be obtained by a sequence of simple active double extensions starting from R2. Okay, so whenever you have a nilpotent simple active Lie algebra, you can just perform this quotient, this construction on the other way around. Construction on the other way around and go back to R2, or you can reach your symplatic Nipodli algebra extending a certain number of times from R2. Okay, so this is, of course, more of theoretical importance. So let's converge now to some results on SES Nilpotently algebras. So a fact of Nilpotently algebras is that they have non-trivial center and that That basically the twisted co-homology of a new potential algebra vanishes. So, every LCL structure of an unilateral algebra is of the first kind. This is something very general. Now I don't remember who proved it, but it's an algebraic fact. This twisted homology, as we know, can be interpreted. As we know, it can be interpreted as homology with coefficients in a certain line bundle, which is in this setting just some non-trivial representation, some non-trivial module for the Lie algebra. And they are all shown to vanish for nilpotent Lie algebras. And also the Lie sorry, CS the Lie vector is in the center of the Lie algebra. So they are good candidates for applying our construction results. We're applying our construction results. Okay, and these construction results or this structure results that I presented to you sum up to this theorem, which says that every LCS nil-Ponley algebra of dimension 2n plus 2 may be obtained as the LCS extension of a 2n-dimensional symplectic nil-pottonli algebra s by a symplectic nil-podon derivation. So the key fact here missing is that you don't have to ask that it's of the first kind because it's already given. It's already given by this fact, and you don't have to ask that it has a center because it's already given. Okay, so our structure results apply perfectly to the nil potent setting. And in turn, if you now use Medina in Dadier Medina and Revoir, you have that your symplectic Lie algebra can be obtained from R2 by a certain number of symplectic double extensions, n minus one in this case, by a nil-potent derivation. This case by nil-putin derivations. So by nil-putin, it's a nil-potent derivation, it's a derivation with uh which is nil-putin in the sense of um of linear algebra. So if you if you apply it a sufficient number of times, then it vanishes. Okay, so uh we have, for example, we have a list, so six-dimensional new point algebras are classified, and this is some, you know, some And this is some, you know, some index, and it doesn't really matter what it is. We just have a perfect understanding of LCS structures on nilpotent Lie algebras. We know exactly what theta is, we know exactly some examples. I don't mean that we classify all LCS structures on six-dimensional Lipoten Lie algebras, but we do know exactly which of them admit LCS structures. And this is a comparison with the symplectic and complex case. So there are some six-dimensional dimensional. are some six-dimensional dimensional Nipolar Li algebra which admit neither symplectic nor complex structures and still admit LCS. And the example that I sort of promised at the beginning, how to obtain compact quotients. So we do everything algebraically. We start with the Lie algebra, abelian Lie algebra with a symplectic form and some symplectic derivation. We do the LCS extension associated LCS extension associated to you know first you have the central extension using the cosycle and then you have the semi-direct product using the derivation and this produces a Lie algebra which has a unique connected simply connected Lie group G and since it's simply connected of course this has an LCS structure of the first kind by construction left invariant and since it's simply connected it's actually And since it's simply connected, it's actually globally conformal sympactic, so we don't really care for it. So, this is so far, it doesn't seem like we did anything. But here is the key result. So, there is a very general result on the existence of compact quotients of nilpotent Lie groups. So, observe that this derivation is nilpotent. So, the Lie algebra G is also nilpotent. So, is the Lie group G. And you can just very easily. You can just very easily compute the structure constants of G. These are shown to be rational numbers. It's quite easy. And then you find a lattice. So you find by result of much of a gamma discrete and co-compact so that, as I mean, also Alexandra mentioned in her talk, the quotient is a compact nil manifold. And since the left invariant structure, GG. Structure and GTS structure, LCS in particular GCS, sorry, on G is left in variant. It goes, it descends to the quotient n, and in the quotient, it's not exact. I'm sorry, basically the one form theta, which is exact above, is not exact below. Okay, so this is genuinely an LCS structure of the first kind on the quotient. So using this theory and these constructions, And these constructions, we have a way to produce lots of examples of LCS structures of the first kind. We also have some other results on solvable Lie algebras where everything gets much more complicated. And we can also provide explicit constructions of LCS structure exact and non-exact. Okay, so and these are explicitly described in terms of Explicitly described in terms of Lie algebra and so on. But that's it, I am done. So here's some literature. Thank you very much for your time.
