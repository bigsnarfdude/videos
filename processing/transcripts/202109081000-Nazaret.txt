I also want to thank all the organizers for this very nice event. Well, as okay, sorry. As Mateo said, this work is a joint work with Matthio Banfolt, Jean-Balbo, and Nikita Simonov. And it gave rise to a memoir that was released on M. Was released last April. So, and it was concerning stability in Gagliadonia Bersubolev inequality with flow, regularity, and entropy method. So, this first lecture of the series of three will concern mostly the first chapter of the memoir, and it consists in revisiting a special family of Gagiardoni. A special family of Gagiardonian-Bersko-F inequality with variational method, but in the light of its link with relative entropy and entropy production inequality. So I will present those inequality, introduce the entropy object, then study the optimality in those Gary Adonium-Bersoboff inequalities. Those Gary Adonyman-Berso F inequalities, and I will end up with some stability results with variational methods, which will mean that it won't be constructive. So the constant that will appear cannot be known. It's by a tub. So let's start. So we consider a special family, a one-parameter family of Lagiardonian Blagin equality. inequality. So the 2p norm of a function f is control is controlled by up to a constant the square norm of the gradient times the Lp plus 1 norm raised to some power that ensures scaling in variance. So in dimension one and two, admissible p are the all one plus infinity as As for p greater than three, we are limited by a critical exponent. Okay, the function space is, as usual, the completion of a C infinity with compact support function with respect to a norm that takes into account the p plus one norm, the L to norm of the gradient, but degenerates as p goes to. As P goes to P star into the classical Bepo-Levy space used for the main Sovolev inequality. I will come back to this later. So for this inequality, equality case are known since the work of Del Pino and Dolbo in 2002. And we know that equality is achieved if and only if F belongs to a finite dimensional. Finite dimensional manifold obtained by scaling, multiplication by constant, and translation of a unique profile that is called that are called Obama Talenti function, even if it's a bit not exactly relevant. So this inequality, this family of inequality. Family of inequality contains, as particular case or limiting case, some celebrate inequalities, such as the Soberlef inequality in dimension greater than three for the critical exponents. If in dimension two, if you let P goes to plus infinity for some special profile, so you take G and you G and you perturb it by some function h, then you obtain the Euclidean honor free inequality. And the last limiting case is obtained as p goes to one. You see it will degenerate, but with an appropriate scaling, you will end up with the Euclidean logarithmic subar F inequality, both in scale invariant form or not. Now it is Now, it is the core of our approach. So, we will prove that the Gagier-Lodianberg inequality is equivalent to the positive deficit function law to be non-negative for a value of the constant which is linked to the best constant in Gagladonia-Amberg. So here, what you lose? You lose the scale, you fix the scale. So you take a function f, then you scale it in order to keep the L2P norm constant, then you optimize with respect to the scaling parameter, and you get that the deficit is greater than some function of f. Some function of f on which we will come back later because it will give us a first weak stability result. So you get the equivalence and just for the record the deficit functional is invariant if you take the absolute value. So from now on, we shall assume that f is non-negative almost everywhere. So we have this destination. So we have this deficit functional measuring the validity of the optimal inequality. And we will study now with standard variational method the existence of an optimal function function that realizes the equal T delta of f is zero. So we introduce We introduce this constraint problem with a mass parameter that makes this problem enter into the framework of the concentration compactness. So I1 is the KGNS. And if you change the mass parameter, then it is linked with the one with mass one by the By the mean of a power law, the fact that gamma is less than one, because we are subcritical, or I should have said that from now on, I will assume that I am subcritical, so I don't reach the suboleth inequality. As in that case, it's a bit more difficult. So, since we are subcritical, the gamma exponent Gamma exponent will be strictly less than one. Hence, we have the classical inequality on the value of the parational problems that tells us that there will no be mass splitting or mass going at infinity. So in the same manner, we have the so we just have to apply To apply some lemma of the concentration compactness theory of Lyon Saint, saying that basically there is compactness. So with this, we recover quite easily the fact that if P is subcritical, so in dimension greater than three, we take P strictly as an P star, there is an optimal function. There is an optimal function. Okay, so now we would like to, as I said, I want to revisit those inequalities. So I want to recover the Del Pinodalbo results on the identification of the minimizer. So using the Polyazego principle and symmetrization, we can prove that there is a radial minimizer, and if so, the following. And if solve the following PDE with a constant that we don't know since it's a constraint problem for the moment. And all we know is that if F is J, the Auburn-Talanti profile, then, well, the Auburn-Talanty function solve the equation with constant 8π. 8π. So, in order to get the fact that J it is a solution of the equation, but since we don't know the value of C, we are not sure that J is a minimizer. But the fact is that if you assume that F is a smooth minimizer, then solve the equation and you introduce some Some new variable capital P, which is which represents a pressure, which will represent at the end a pressure variable, then you get some rigidity result, which means that those two positive quantity vanish. With this, you can see that, so you ignore this part and with And with this, you see this term is a constant. So you see that Laplacian P is a constant. And then you get that if the mass is the same, if the norm 2p of f coincides with the norm 2p of j, then automatically f has to be equal than g. So So, as a consequence of this rigidity result, we get that G is a minimizer so that delta J is zero and delta J is zero. So, at this point, we only know that the urban tarantity profile, the standard one, is a minimizer. We would like to recover all the possible minimizer. minimizer so uh let's go now to um our uh entropy entropy production uh interpretation of this deficit inequality so we introduce two um two new functional the first one is the relative entropy of a function of a non-negative function f with respect to g which is a positive functional because Positive functional because of the convexity properties, and at this point, we know that it is not only non-negative, but there is a Caesar-Kullbach inequality that provides a more precise result since it controls the difference in L1 norm between F to the 2p and G to the 2P if they share the same mass. Same mass. We also introduced the relative Fischer information functional this way. And from the definition of this relative Fisher information, we get instantaneously by taking J equal to the open-talentity profile, by expanding the square, we get some non-linear extension of the Eisenberg uncertainty principle. The Eisenberg uncertainty principle in a very specific way, but it is in this very clearly. In addition, if we, so here we only have fixed the mass, now if we fix also the first moment, the center of mass, and the second order moment, then it's Then it simplifies the expression of the relative entropy by just up to a constant the difference between the Lp plus one norm, the integral of Fp plus one minus GP plus one, at the price of considering of reducing the space. We will also require that f to the two p has a second order moment. The 2p as a second-order moment, which is sort of coherent with the non-linear extension of the Eisenberg constant principle. So the reason behind this of fixing these three moments is that if you fix some f in the space wp, then you have a unique. Then you have a unique G in the manifold of the orbitality functions, such that this condition is fulfilled. You remember there was a mass parameter, a translation, a center of mass parameter, and a scaling parameter linked to the second order moment. So this fix a Unix function and this GF. This GF realized the best matching open function with respect to the relative entropy function. So it's the relative entropy of F with respect to this GF realize the distance, a distance, a non-linear distance to the urban talent manifold when the distance is measured in a non-linear Is measured in a non-linear way with the relative entropy. Okay, so remember, I have proved before that the deficit is larger than some functional of f. And the fact is that if f satisfies the inequality one here with Here with G equal to the standard profile, this bold G, then this residual functional behaves like the relative entropy of F with respect to role J square, which is some stability, which means that. Stability, which means that the deficit function will control something that measures the distance of such profile. The distance to the manifold such a profile, you see. So as an immediate consequence of this weak stability result, we get that G is the unique minimizer of the deficit. The deficit functional up to some invariants that I will not cover really here that link the mass parameter and the scale parameter. And then as a consequence, this Bo G is the unique minimizer for the GNS over F inequality up to the variance of the problem that is multiplication. multiplication with a constant translation invariance and scaling variance scaling invariance and in addition this is where I said that the deficit functional can be related to an entropy entropy production inequality since we obtained that if Since we obtained that if and j share the same L2P norm, and if is not very well written, probably here. If J is a no-boundality function, which is optimal in the deficit inequality, so it saturates the inequality, delta of is non-negative, then the deficit. The deficit functional is exactly the so-called entropy-entropy production inequality relative Fischer information minus four times the entropy, which is then non-negative. So, in particular, it works with the standard profile ball G. Okay, so from now on, I will change. Okay, so from now on I will change a bit uh the way I'm thinking instead of taking uh uh fixing F and then considering the best G, I will instead fix the some in some sense the projection, the result of the projection, and I will get interested in all the functions that projects to this to this G. It has some uh It has some specific consequence for the stability result that Jean-Will gave you at the end of his talk. So now let me talk about a stability result. Okay, since in the previous slide we obtain a stability with a square, but we would like to get this inequality with Inequality with a power one, a linear inequality. So the starting point of such a result is given by the Blanqui-Egnell result on the Sobolef inequality giving an answer to a question raised in 1985 by Bezis and Lieba asking. Besis and Liba asking whether it is possible to prove that the deficit functional associated to the Sobolef inequality controls some distance to the optimal function manifold. Okay, so they gave in 1991 a positive answer and in fact the strongest possible positive answer to this question because this is the strongest possible. Is the strongest possible norm to measure such a distance in this context. So, with this result, well, people spend some time to a lot of time actually trying to extend or improve this result. Well, in this special context, it is not possible to improve it since it is the To improve it, since it is the strongest node, maybe the, and this will be the core of our approach, there is only the fact that this alpha, since this is obtained by a contradiction argument, a compactness argument, it is not possible to get an explicit value for this constant. So, but there have been various extensions in two directions. The first one is extend this result to Extend this result to LQ norm of the gradient, which is really difficult when you lose the Hilbert structure for measuring the gradient. So it has been, there was a result by Kianke, Fusco, Maggi, and Pratelli in 2009. And then, quite long after this, it has been. This has been completed by Figali and Neumeier in 2018, then by Neumeier in 2020. And finally, I would say that the final answer was given by Figali and Dong in 2020, since they get such a result with the optimal exponent in the norm. Exponent in the norm, in the deficit norm here. But still, there is no, it's still a contradiction argument. It relies on very precise Taylor expansion results. So there is no explicit value for this alpha. Concerning the extension in the direction of Gagiadoni-Amberg-Subref inequality, partial result. Quality, partial result, or a very specific example. Result was obtained by Carlin and Figelli in 2013 and then by Zeuffert in 2017 and for some other norm by Nguyen in 2019. So here again, it relies on somehow on the Bianchi Egner results. So we still have the fact. Results, so we still have the fact that we don't have an explicit value for the constant alpha since their method are not constructed. So, sorry. So, for the last two minutes, let me just give you in the whole framework of relative entropy interpretation, a result. Is a result in the same spirit, non-constructive, because it will still be by contradiction, that there exists a constant CO positive constant such that the deficit functional actually controls up to this constant the relative entropy of f with respect to bore j for any function that share the same that project on the manifold. That project on the manifold, on the optimal function manifold, to this spatial profile. And as I said, it's a contradiction argument. It consists in assuming that this inequality is not true. So for any one over n, you can find some fn such that the quotient delta of f divided by the relative entropy is less than 1. Entropy is less than one over n goes to zero. And then you will linearize and end up with a spectral gap inequality that gives you first the fact that the deficit functional, the linearized version is non-negative, so you don't learn anything from the mass conservation, but this can be improved under the This can be improved under the constraint, the following orthogonality condition that came with a constant that is strictly above the standard constant. And a Taylor expansion of the quotient of the deficit functional by the relative entropy gives you under the condition of the Of the theorem, which after linearization give rise to this autography condition, you get that this limit should be greater than this positive constant, and then you get the contradiction. So now the challenge is to be able to get to To be able to get a constructive procedure that gives you such constants, which will be explicit, and it is the subject of the two next talk. So, thank you for your attention. Thank you, Bruno, for the very nice talk. Are there any Are there any questions, Marks? So if none, can you figure back to the previous slide, Bruno, please? Sure. Yeah, and previous, one more. So basically, just to sum it up, what you were saying is that with this first thing, you can. First thing you can characterize the infimum, right? Saying the infimum in this case is attained by the one that has the same mass, center of mass, and then the constant is left to the last part, for second part. Yeah. Okay.
