RNA depends on our spoken elements. Andy, can you hear? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, Andy. Hi, everybody. No, I'm really sad that I couldn't make it. It was a calamitous problem that arose at the last minute. I had to cancel. So, what? Noah and everybody let me do this. So, I hope it works. I've been very relieved to see that many of the talks have been at various stages of, shall we say, maturity and thinking about the models. And this is. About the models. And this is a particularly early stage in this discussion about modeling pi RNAs and transposable elements. So the first thing to observe is that transposable elements are essentially ubiquitous in eukaryotic proportion of the transposable elements, the different classes of transposable elements that they harbor, and raises the question. And it raises the question: like, what is it that determines this? Is it the elements themselves? Is it the host? What really is determining this balance of abundance of transposable elements within genomes? And way back in the early and mid-80s, there were a series of experiment or theoretical efforts to try to model abundance of transposable elements in genomes. Elements in genomes. And Chuck Langley, John Brookfield, and Norm Kaplan were among the first to do this, particularly from observations in Drosophila. So the early models typically had some form of Wright-Fisher drift. They had specified rates of transposition, and it was thought to occur as a sort of almost mutation-like process where there was a Poisson distribution of new insertions each generation with a parameter that depended on the. With a parameter that depended on the current copy number. In this particular model, they had a constant deletion rate per element, so there was no function of number of copies there. And there was recombination occurring just normally. And what they did with this model was just to try to generate, they did some empirical work and some theoretical work, some analytical work, as well as simulations, and came up with distributions of copy numbers. It looked more or less kind of, you know, with. Less kind of, you know, within the range of what you might expect to see. And it sort of stopped there. It was not particularly convincing that, okay, this really explains what's going on. It was just, we're starting to get some idea of the parameters that are important. Stan Sawyer and Dan Hartle then did a somewhat more, I would say, mathematically appealing model in that they outlined some key aspects of both the transposition and the consequence of copy. Consequence of copies in the genome. In particular, the previous model had no action of natural selection, whereas this one, individuals could actually die if they loaded up with too many transposable elements, which just on first principle seemed like it was probably sensible to consider. So they considered that a host cell with n copies of a transposable element, here, n copies of a transposable element would transpose at rate. Transpose at rate t of n. So there could be some function of the copy number that would determine the transposition rate. And that could be linear or not. It might vary in some way that depends on some relationship between the transposable element and the host. Similarly, the death rate was a function also of the number of copies. And initially, they assumed largely from relating it to Mukai's work that there was a sort of a Sort of an epistatic effect that too many copies would suddenly become much more deleterious. And this model then gave rise to a continuous time Markov chain where the states are the counts of the number of copies, so 0, 1, 2, 3 along this axis. Going from 0 to 1, that transition occurs at rate u, which is like an infection rate, having no copies to getting one. In the case of bacteria, this could be through, you know, some other, you know, just. Some other, you know, just acquisition of the DNA. And then going from one to two, two to three, and so forth was this function of t, the transposition rate. And then likewise, they would, they would, if they died, they would go back to, you know, disappearing from the population. For the linear case, they could get some very nice analytical results and fitting it to a bunch of data from E. coli, where they're very good now, estimates of copy number of the IS or insertion elements. Of the IS or insertion elements within the E. coli genome. And for different sort of specifics of these models, that's what these different Roman numerals are different sort of particulars of the model, they would get different sort of estimates, for instance, of the transposition to death rate that varied widely depending on the model. So this huge variation across models and across IS elements was sort of of some concern. Sort of of some concern. It indicated there was considerable sensitivity to the model specification, but other aspects of the model were much more stable. So they inferred that infection rates and fitness costs were fairly similar across CIS elements. Chuck Langley and Elizabeth Montgomery then realized: well, you know, we actually should collect a little bit more information about the sort of level of diversity within populations of relative abundances of different kinds of elements. Abundances of different kinds of elements. So they looked at three elements that are retro elements in the copia family of Drosophila melanogaster and got these sort of site frequency spectra, the number of X chromosomes. So in this case, I have one, two, or three copies. And what this let them realize was that the site frequency spectrum was skewed in the excess of rare insertions. So particularly in Drosophila melanogaster, you see lots of insertions that are found only. You see lots of insertions that are found only in one line and no other. And this is saying that the transposition is fairly active. These are recent insertions. And they must be relatively deleterious. Otherwise, you would see that site frequency spectrum filling up. So that was the first clue of a sort of measurement of, yeah, these things really are damaging to the genome. In this paper, Drusworth and Langley then took it one step further, which was to consider other aspects of the host and its response. Of the host and its response or relationship to the transposable elements. And they realized that these models can only come to a sort of a stable equilibrium, a sort of a standoff, if you will, between the host and the transposable elements, if there's either a balance between transposition and the transposition rate and the reduced host fitness, as we saw in the Sawyer and Horto paper, or if there's some sort of transposition. If there's some sort of transposition repression. So, this was the first clue that sort of conceptually, maybe there's some means by which, as the elements increase in number, the transposition rate decreases without even thinking about whether that's a property of the element itself or if the host is doing that repression. And so, they propose that there might be self-regulated transposable elements, or maybe there's some host transposition. And somehow or Transposition. And somehow or another, these processes can evolve as well. So, this brings us sort of to the question: why have transposable elements been so successful? You know, they're ubiquitous in genomes. Why haven't hosts just figured out how to just ban them from the genome? Particularly because of the fact that transposable elements introduce these loss of function mutations. They disrupt genes. They can often cause lethal mutations. They can cause genome instability through recombination. Instability through recombination across different elements that are inserted in different parts of the genome, so-called ectopic recombination. And the other thing that was particularly clear in Drosophila now with the P-element observations was that they can cause sterility because they can, if transposition is allowed to occur without any regulation, it can disrupt gametogenesis. So, this was the work of Margaret Kidwell in the late 70s. Actually, the topic of her PhD thesis was in. Of her PhD thesis was in normal flies, the ovaries look something like this, sort of like groups of bananas, nice ovarioles producing eggs. Whereas in some crosses, in particular, if the mother is of the M cytotype and the father is of the P cytotype, that is the father bears P elements and the mother does not, you can end up with this very rapid transmission of the P element, and that's accompanied by actual degeneration or dysgenesis of the Or dysgenesis of the gonads, and you end up with, in this case, ovaries, you end up with sterility. So, this is a case where very rampant movement of the transposable element during ametogenesis actually results in sterility. So, fast forward to a recent paper that I did with a postdoc, Jian Liu, a number of years ago, looking at a series of lines now, which is at the relative abundances of transposable elements. Transposable elements. You can compare the site frequency spectrum of SNPs. So, this is synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs. So, if you take synonymous SNPs as more or less the neutral site frequency spectrum, it's not quite. You do see some slight excess of rare variants for even synonymous. But the non-synonymous SNPs, you see the familiar site frequency spectrum where the number of strains with just a single insert or single non-synonymous variant at so-called singleton classes present. So-called singleton classes presenting much greater excess, indicating they're for large part deleterious. And even compared to the non-synonymous SNPs, you can see these transposable element insertions have an even greater excess of rare variation. In other words, they're kind of more damaging than your average non-synonymous SNP. All right, so fast forward then to just a few years ago, Brennicke et al. working with Alexei R. then. Alexei R. then found that pi RNAs are shown to be a potent means of host defense against transposable elements. And these pi RNAs now are a specific adapted system where the host has a mechanism where it recognizes transposo elements and actually degrades the RNAs of retro elements. And just a second, just to show you how this system works, it's quite elaborate, but it's extremely. Elaborate, but it's extremely effective because of this thing called the ping-pong cycle. So these pi RNAs are transcribed from regions of the genome called a piRNA cluster, and this results in a primary transcript, which then gets exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it's then processed. It's cleaved into small fragments, 23 to 29 base pairs in the case of Drosophila. And those fragments typically start with a U, a year or so, and they're further processed. They're further processed. They're bound to proteins of the class of PWE, hence the name pi RNA, the p we associated RNAs. And the initial one that is of particular interest is the peawe protein called obergine. So obergine binds to these particular transcripts. Now the piRNA cluster actually consists of fragments of a bunch of transposable elements. So these piRNAs are sequence matches to transposable elements. Matches to transposable element themselves. So when that piRNA bound to aubergine binds to a transposable element transcript, the aubergine itself actually has an endonuclease activity and cleaves the transcript, thereby killing that transposable element or that particular transcript. That also releases a bit of the RNA from the transposable element, which then binds to the AGO-3, another. AGO3, another element of the Pee We class. And AGO3 can then bind to the other strand, and you end up with this cycle running. So it is a true sort of amplification cycle that results in immediate doubling each round of the number of these transcripts that are going to be able to fight the transposable elements. So you can sort of think of it almost like an antibody. The antigen in this case is a sequence of RNA, so it's sequence-specific. Of RNA, so sequence specific to the transposable element. You need to make a pi RNA for each specific transposable element, but that happens because the transposable element can find itself in the genome in a place where it's perforce going to be transcribed and produce these pi RNAs. It's a really beautiful system. And if you actually look at the site frequency spectrum now of, again, starting with synonymous SNPs, the purple here, that's your sort of neutral site frequency spectrum. And then you look at transmission. And then you look at transposable elements that are not associated with pi RNAs, you can see there's this huge excess. So those are really deleterious. But if they are in the pi RNA cluster, the piRNA amplification cycle attenuates the deleterious consequence of that transposable element. And you can immediately see that in the site frequency spectrum. Quite a remarkable result. All right. So then one of the big questions we want to understand this system. We want to understand the system in a sort of a dynamical quantitative sense is how do those pi RNA clusters originate? And the initial idea was this trap model, as I already alluded to. So this is a situation where, let's suppose this yellow bar is a piRNA cluster. It's able to produce these pi RNAs to the elements that have inserted in that cluster. And then you have arriving a new transposable element, a novel transposable element. This genome has not seen before. Element, this genome has not seen before. And it can jump around. In fact, it's under no host control. So typically, it will jump at a quite rapid rate, sometimes with quite strongly deleterious consequences, until it happens to jump into a PIRNA cluster, which then assures that it gets transcribed and off you go. So that was the early idea. For years, people thought, okay, this is just how it works. There's this trap model, and pyRNEs are only made from these clusters. But the other possibility arose that. But the other possibility arose that, well, maybe an insertion of a single element can sometimes be, we'll use the term license to be transcribed to produce these pi RNAs. And if that were to happen, then you'd get this process going much, much faster. It would seem to be two advantage to the host to have some ability to produce iRNAs against these de novo insertions. And so we've figured before we could model this, we actually do need a lot more data. The data that's missing. Data. The data that's missing up to this point, really, was lots of work had been done on transposable elements, their regulation by pi RNAs, and how it works, and what the components are, what are the molecules that do the licensing, that guarantee the transcription of the piRNA. All that stuff had been done basically with one or two lines. In other words, the sort of population genetic approach of let's look across a whole series of lines at the level of diversity of all these features. Diversity of all these features of this system hadn't been done. So, graduate student Satyam Srivastov, working with Cedric Feshot and me, did just exactly this. So, we used eight of the lines from the Drosophila synthetic reference panel, made small RNA libraries from ovaries and testes. I'm only going to talk about the ovary data here. And these pi RNAs were then mapped to the genomes. These were extremely high-quality pack bio, hi-fi genome assemblies. Genome assemblies, and then use these data to quantify the variation. So, this represents, yeah, I don't know, two full years of work here. It's the each concentric circle is a different line. Each of these little line segments is a different pi RNA uniquely mapped to the genome. And what you're seeing are these regions where there's a high density of the pi RNAs mapping there are some of the well-known pi RNA clusters. So, Flamenco was the very first. So, Flamenco was the very first one discovered back in the early 2000s, and it produces a bunch of pi RNAs. There's also the 42AB cluster in this region right here, and so forth. But the key take-home from this picture is just you notice there's enormous variability among the lines. There are lots of, just as there were single transposable element inserts, there are single parts of the genome where that's the only line that makes pi RNAs from that part of the genome. makes pi RNAs from that part of the genome and so forth. And even these pi RNA clusters look to be quite diverse. If you look in more detail, this is just the 42AB cluster, one of the best characterized of these pi RNA clusters. It's a full 250 kilobase pairs in size. So many, many different classes of transposable elements have been inserted there. And what we're looking at are the pi RNAs that map to this 42AB cluster. And it's showing both the sense and the anti-sense. it's showing both the sense and the anti-sense strains or reads and so we're seeing bi-directional transcription of this particular cluster that had been well known so we're looking at two different replicates of the iso1 strain which is the standard reference stock whose genome was initially sequenced the b6 strain a1 strain and so forth two replicates and you can just eyeball sort of your sort of yeah assessment of the replicates look really very similar to each other but the shocking thing if people had been observing Shocking thing, people had been observing this sort of phenomenon. Lots of different regions are producing pi RNAs from these clusters. But look at strain A7, it's almost dead silent. So these very well-known pi RNA clusters are nevertheless showing wild variability among strains in sometimes they're transcribing a lot, other times not. And I want to point out also this strain A7 produces plenty of biRNAs from elsewhere in the genome. It's just this region is almost silent in that particular line. Silent in that particular line. Okay, so most of these regions where piRNAs are produced in the genome, and we'll call them pi RNA clusters, even if it looks like it's a single transposable element insertion, it's nevertheless producing pi RNAs. Most of them are active in only one or a few strains. So, this is the sort of single tendon, if you will. Most, and these three bars are just three different ways to call the pi RNase is quite a bit of. Is quite a bit of art, I should say, of colins. Because the pyrenase is so short, mapping them to the genome is technically challenging. And that's why you see there are some differences among these. But the pattern of this extreme excess of rare sites or clusters that are present in only one strain being the source of the transcripts is clear, regardless of how you call the pi RNAs. Another key thing is that if you look at Is that if you look at the sort of count of the number of strains that each cluster is born by, these are the sort of rare ones, and these are the ones where every single strain has that cluster. So this would be true like a flamenco or 42AB. They tend to get bigger. So the larger the pi RNA cluster in general, all else being equal, the more common it is in the population. And so this gives you a sense of the age. It's likely that. The age, it's likely that these things start out as a single insertion, and then if another element lands in or nearby and is also transcribed, you now have a pi RNA cluster that can grow and grow. And as it gets older, it can also expand in frequency in the population, either by drift or by selection. It might be favored, of course, by the genome if it's dealing with the transposable elements. Okay, so let's get back to the modeling. Many people saw pi RNAs as being now a really As being now a really important thing to add compared to those models in the 80s. In the 80s, remember, we had no idea of any kind of host mechanism for controlling these elements. And now there's a very clear, well-articulated mechanism for dealing with them. Can we model that? And we can assume some fixed number. The early models all assumed a fixed number of the location of the pi RNA clusters. The argument was made that the host had no defense against an initial or non-NAN Against an initial or novel TE inversion. When the TE inserts in a piRNA cluster, it can produce piRNAs with high probability because they're just transcribed clear through the whole cluster typically. And the focus initially was just to focus on the counts of the active and inactive transposable elements. Inactive ones are those that have a slew of pi RNEs acting against them, so they can't transpose anymore. And Rob. And Robert Koeffler, Aaron Kelleher, there are a number of papers of this sort. And they were all basically by simulation. And just to sort of show this is indicating an insertion of a novel transposable element at generation zero in one of Robert's papers. They rapidly expand because it's a transposable element that has a good transposition rate. Then it arrives in a pi RNA cluster inevitably. In every single case, they then stop transposing. So this is. Stop transposing. So, this is these red lines are indicating what are now totally inactivated transposable elements. And pretty much all these papers got a very similar finding to that. So, the main issue was like how many transposable elements do they get to before that happens. When this happens and an element is totally dead, I should point out, it'll now mutate away to the point where it couldn't transpose again, even in the absence of the pi RNAs. And the pi RNAs themselves, while they're contingent. While they're continuing to be transcribed in the piRNA cluster, eventually they too mutate. And if they mutate in a way that no longer produces an active pyRNA against that transposable element, it has no consequence if the transposable element is dead. So you can see there's this sort of stalemate that's arrived at where if the transposable element can still jump, there's selection against the dead pi RNA if that mutation occurs in the cluster. An aspect of this that we add. An aspect of this that we added was that there's a striking positive correlation between the abundance of a transposable element in the genome and the abundance of the pyRNase against that element. So again, this is saying we're mostly catching these elements that are in that sort of growth phase, that once it got to the point where it's sort of stable, this correlation should break down. And if it's in the very early stages, it might not exist either. But if you're in that ramping up stage, But if you're in that ramping up stage, the transposable element is still active. It's still jumping around in different locations in different lines, but the pi RNAs are trying to keep up with that element. And I should also point out that this is also kind of a secondary indication that the pi RNA cycle is running. A much more direct way to see that is there's the pi RNA and its sense and anti-sense copy have a 10-base pair overlap. And so just looking Overlap. And so just looking for that signature, you can say, yes, the piRNA cycle is running in this strain. And in this case, this positive correlation is saying, regardless of how many copies of the TE you have, if the piRNA cycle is running, it will catch up to the number of TEs, you see, just from that amplification cycle. Another cute thing to point out is the P element you think of as ubiquitous in lines of flies, and this is true in Zimbabwe. So what this is showing is where do the pi RNAs match. Showings where do the pi RNAs map against the transposable element itself, and they're particularly abundant at regions of the element that are critical for its transposition. But nevertheless, you do see pi RNAs pretty much throughout the whole P element here. But in Beijing, we didn't find a single P element that had active pi RNAs mapping to the middle. That is to say, it's as though the only P elements in Beijing are these so-called. Are these so-called non-autonomous elements? They have probably a deletion in the middle. And this has since been confirmed by looking at the genome sequence as well. Okay, so we need to model both the transposable element abundance. Ideally, a model would also accommodate the site frequency spectrum. We want to see the piRNAs are transcribed from single transposable element inserts, because that's what we saw in quite abundance. On quite abundance. The short pyRNA clusters are initially young and low in frequency. And then, as they become larger from other transposable elements inserting, they become more common. And eventually, they can even grow old in senesce and ultimately disappear when you compare between different species. They're not shared. So, I'm sort of running out of time, but just to point out a very simple sort of part of the model is going to be that ping-pong cycle. Model is going to be that ping-pong cycle. And almost any way you model this, if the ping-pong amplification is occurring, as long as PyRNA productions doesn't face some external limit, like running out of Aubergine or AGO3 or a foul up in that licensing procedure, you're always going to allow the ping pong cycle to keep on amplifying it till it matches the TE transcript abundance. So it seems like that's unbeatable, right? There's just the transposo element can't fight against. Transposal element can't fight against that. But there's one other twist to it that's kind of cute, which is work of another graduate student, is Kander Saeed, which is you can actually identify SNPs within transposable elements. And by looking at the correlation of frequencies of those SNPs, you can kind of infer haplotypes of different transposable elements, or if you were clades, lineages of transposable elements. And the interesting thing to think about, this is just showing the kind of, it's like a About this, it's just showing the kind of it's like a linkage disequilibrium. There are particular clusters of those elements that have a particular, you know, combination of polymorphic sites. An interesting thing to think about is that, you know, if it acquires a polymorphism that now is right under the pi RNA binding site, transposable elements can actually evade the piRNA defense. So you end up with a, it's a sort of like a, you know, host-pathogen sort of relationship with a chase away. With a chase away of the pathogen now from the immune system. It's evading the immune system by this evolutionary process. So, successful TEs could then now escape the piRNAs. They could jump around for a little bit. If they are then inserted into a piRNA cluster or otherwise transcribed, there would be new classes of pi RNAs now to this new clade. And you end up then with this chase away process. And that's consistent with many aspects of this whole system. With many aspects of this whole system showing positive selection, excess non-synonymous to synonymous divergence. So I'm really running over in time. I'm just going to leave this up. These are sort of things that we want to accommodate in the model. But let me end then with the credits that Satya Mshirstov is a graduate student who this work was just published in Genome Research. It was done in collaboration with also with Cedric Peshat. And I also just wanted to point out that Alyssa Cosgrove. Point out that Alyssa Cosgrove and Asha Jane also helped in doing this work. And with that, I'll be happy to take questions. And then I'll take questions. Just make sure to speak up. So yeah, I think you can hear them everyone. I'd be really curious, Andy, if you could just comment a little bit, because I don't, and this is just a really naive basic biology question. Could you comment on the sort of the ping-pong cycle versus the sort of siRNA amplification cycle? Well, yeah, so the ping-pong cycle is that. Cycle has that sort of exponential aspect to it where either you have the anti-sense to the sense strand of the transposable element, and then when it cleaves, you get both of those out. And so that they can then both continue the cycle going. And you end up with more and more copies of the pi RNA that can fight the transposable element. I think that the key contrast I would like to make, though, is. The key contrast I would like to make, though, is that as opposed to, say, our immune system and our production of antibodies. So, really, there is a pretty good analogy. So, you think of a pathogen having an epitope. The antibody can recognize that epitope. And so, it's in the host's advantage to make lots of those antibodies. So, how do we do that? We don't necessarily do it in proportion to the amount of the pathogen that's present, although more pathogen present does sort of raise. More pathogen present does sort of ramp up the system some, but not in this sort of exponential way. But instead of having amplification just of the RNA, which is on a very fast time scale, it requires amplification, so-called clonal expansion of B cells. So that happens over a period of days. So in that way, it's far less efficient, far slower than this ping-pong cycle. Thanks. All right, thanks, Andy. Excellent.
