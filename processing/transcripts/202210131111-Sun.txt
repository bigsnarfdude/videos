The speaker today of the morning session is Gotchi Sun from Georgia Institute of Technology and he will speak about a specific formula of multi-solitary waves of the Very Miono equation. Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. It is my great pleasure to present my work on the integrability of the Virginia-Ombl equation as an explicit formula of its multi-solitary waves in this. waves in this new trends in mathematics of dispersive integrable non-integrable models in fluids waves and quantum physics conference thank you very much and we begin by the introduction the benchmark ono equation reads as partial t u is equal to h r la plus to h r la plus u minus partial x u square where u is a real valued function in formula one hr denotes the hilbert transform on the real line it is a fourier multiplier of the symbol minus i sine function so if we don't use the fourier transform h r f can be expressed as the principal value of the convolution Of the convolution between f and one over pi x. So the image of any real-valued L2 function under the Hilbert transform on the line is still real-valued. So we consider only the real-valued solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation. And this equation was formally derived by Thomas Brooke Benjamin in 1967 and then by Hiro Akiolo in 1977. By Hiro Akiono in 1975, in order to describe the evolution of weakly nonlinear internal non-waves in a stratified fluid, such that the lower layer is infinite. And the BO equation is globally well posed in every subway space HS for every positive S or S is equal to zero. We refer to the work of Jean-Claude Saul for. Jean-Claude Saul for large S, and we refer to the famous work of Terence Tao to see S is equal to one. And when S is equal to zero, Ionescu and Kennig have firstly established the L2 global wealth positives. And then this result has been revisited by Morinabilo in 2012 and Yukien Tanaru in 2019, etc. And moreover, the Benjamin-Ono equation has the translation and the scaling invariance. If we define ucy to be ucy tx is equal to z times uc square t c times x minus y, then this transformation which sends u to u c y satisfies the either one critical property, which means Critical property, which means that the L1 norm of UCYT with respect to the variable X is equal to the L1 norm of UC square t with respect to the variable X. The Benjamin-Ono equation can be written formally in Hamiltonian form, like formula 3. Partial tu is equal to partial X named U capital EU. partial x nabula u capital eu capital e which is defined in formula three is called the energy function of the vengel online equation and the nabla u capital e denotes the free shared derivative free shape free share derivative of the energy functional e and the nabla and the partial x partial x nabla u capital e is the hamiltonian vector field also called the symplectic gradient Also called the symplectic gradient of the energy functional capital E with respect to the Gator Fadif-Zakharov Woisson structure. The Gatiner bracket between two smooth, between two, between any two sufficiently smooth functionals, f and g is defined as the L2 inner product of the Hamiltonian vector field of F and the pre-shared derivative of G. Of G under appropriate conditions. The Gardener bracket is just the bottom bracket of the following simple active form on some appropriate manifolds. In formula 5, we define the two-covector omega to be the L2 inner product of H1 and the primitive of H2. For any H1, H2 belongs to an auxiliary vector space, which we call W. Space, which we call W. W is the image of the Sobolev space H1RR under the operator partial X. And if we use the Fourier transform, W can be integrated as the intersection of L2RR and the homogeneous sub-level space H dot minus 1R. So this inequality. So this inequality is very useful to establish the symplectic form of the multi-solid manifold of the Benjamin-Onlin equation. Now we introduce the Shibu projector on the line. Let pi r denotes the shield projector, which is defined as the sum of identity plus i times identity plus i times the Hilbert transform on the line over two. So pi r is also a Fourier trans is also a Fourier multiplier. It's simple. It's the high reside function on the line. And pi R F, pi R, this shingle projector will cancel every negative Fourier mode. So it conserves every positive Fourier mode. And the next L2 plus R. And the light L2 plus R denotes the image of L2R under the shape of projector pi R. And the filtered sobolette space Hs plus is the intersection of Hs and L2 plus, which is also the image of the non-homogeneous sobolio space Hs under the Schiebo projector pi R. The image of any H2 solution of the Benjamin-only. H2 solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation under the Shiva projector will solve a special quadratic filtered Schr√∂dinger equation on the filtered Sobelief space H2 plus R, which means that the Jimmy O equation one, the equivalent is equivalent to the non-manual Schrodinger equation six, and this non-manual term is very special, and moreover. And moreover, since its phase space is defined, its phase space is the filtered sobonette space. We also call this Schrodinger equation the Schrodinger-Schiever equation. We refer to my other two work to see the long-time behavior and the asymptotic behavior of some other Schrodinger-Schiebel equations. We note that the shape of projector pi R, which sends L to R C. Which sends L2RC to L2RC is a surjective mapping. And if we restrict it to the subspace of all real-valued L2 functions, so when restricted to L2RR, the shield projector becomes bijective. And its inverse is given by two times the real part. So we have pi u plus the conjugate of pi u is equal to u for any u belongs to m2 rr. And by using the Pele-Winner theorem for the Hardy space, we can have the identification between Identification between the filtered L2 space, which is L2 plus R, and the hardy space on the upper half plane, which is denoted by H2C plus, by using holomorphic Fourier transform. So every L2 function whose Fourier transform is positively supported can be extended to a holomorphic function on the upper half plane. So we shall use the identity. So, we shall use the identification between the image of L2R under the Schego projector and the Hardy space on the upper half plane. And now, we focus on a special kind of solutions of the Vengelian-Ono equation, which is called the solitary waves of the VO equation, also called the traveling waves. A traveling wave solution of the Benjamin-Odo equation is a small. of the Benjamin Ordo equation is a smooth solution u such that u tx is expressed as c times capital R C times X minus Y minus C T where C is a positive real number and Y is a real number and capital R is a smooth function which solves the following non-local elliptic equation which is equation seven So in order to solve, in order to obtain the solitary waves, it is enough to consider its Lagrange equation, which is equation 7. The explicit formula of solid-trained waves were firstly found by Thomas Bukercheni and Hilo Aki Ono, but they have not proved the not prove the uh proved the uniqueness and uh the completely the complete classification of trailing weights have been done has been done by ami kind of tolland in 1991 at first and revisited by frank and the lensman in 2013 and the unique radial solution of equation seven is given by uh formula eight so chemical r Formula 8. So capital Rx is equal to 2 over 1 plus X squared. So the unique radial solution of the non-local elliptic equation 7 is the Bohr kernel of the upper half plane. Since the ground state of the elliptic equation 7, it is a symmetric, it decays to zero when the absolute value of x The absolute value of x goes to plus infinity, we also call the ground state a solitary, and the traveling waves are called the solitary waves. So we shall obtain the explicit expression of every solitary wave of the Vengean-Ono equation. If you solve the Benjamin-Ono equation such that its initial data is a solid. It's a solid, which means that it is a translated and scaled bottom kernel on the upper half, such that the translation, sorry, the scaling transformation will satisfy the ILO1 critical property. Then we have UT remains as a stresslated scaled Watson kernel on the upper half plane. On the upper half plane, and moreover, the scaling parameter, which is eta one, is a constant, it doesn't change as t as with the time. But the translation parameter, which is x1 plus t over eta1, it moves with constant velocity. So we have the explicit expression of the so much remember of the regime-order equation. Equation. And now we ask a problem: can we find the explicit expression of some more general solutions of the Virginia Ongo equation? In order to solve this problem, we introduce the notion of complete integrability in the Lubin analysis in the domain of Hamiltonian system. It means that if we can find, if we can construct the actual angle coordinates of the vengel-ono equation. Of the vengeance on the equation, then we will find the explicit formula of every solution. And now I'm going to introduce the multi-solvent manifold of the Benjamin-Omer equation. The multi-solid manifold, which is denoted by capital UN here, consists of all Consists of all the IO2 functions u, such that u is the superposition of n single subitans. It means that u is the sum of n translated scaled MOSCOM kernels. Here, xj denotes the translation parameters and etaj denotes the scaling parameters. And xj are arbitrarily real numbers. Etaj are arbitrarily positive real numbers. Positive real numbers, it actually must be strictly positive. And the main goal of my presentation is to establish global action-and we coordinates of the Benjamin-Ombo equation when restricted to every unsolvent manifold UN. So now I'm going to introduce three important properties of the unsoluted manifold capital UN. Manifold capital UN. And first, UN has real analytic structure. It means that if we equip with the subspace topology of L2, then UN is a simply connected, real analytic, embedded sub-manifold of L2RR of real dimension 2n. So it is some manifold. And secondly, we can construct a closed node degenerate 2-4 on the encellatomy. Two form on the enzymatic manifold u n we define omega u h1 h2 to be i over 2 pi, the integral of the transform of the Fourier transform of h1 times the conjugate of Fourier transform of h2 over psi. And for any h1, h2 belongs to the tangent space out of u and at u. At u. And we can show that omega u is effectively independent of the parameter u from the explicit formula of this two form. So we call it a translation invariant two form. As a consequence, we can show that it is actually a closed two form thanks to the dark dance formula. And moreover, it is And moreover, it is easy to show that the two form is non-degenerate. It means that if we fix H1, the map which sends H2 to omega U, H1, H2 is actually bijective. As a consequence, omega is a simple active form on the unsolicited manifold UN. And the real analytic. And the real analytic manifold UN equipped with omega is actually a symplectic manifold. So we can introduce the Hamiltonian formalism, the riborous Hamiltonian formalism here of the Virginia Order equation with restricted to the unsolved manifold. And the third property, which is also very important, is the invariance of is the invariance property of the Property of the unsovital manifold, which means that capital Un is an invariant manifold of the Virginia-Ongla equation. If U0 belongs to capital UN, then UT remains always in, belongs always to capital UN. As a consequence, when restricted to the money the multi-solitive money for the capital UN, Solitaire manifold capital UN, the Benjamin-Ono equation is actually a globally well-posed Hamiltonian system thanks to the global well-posedness of the L2 or H1 or large HS global well-positeness of the vegetables and this invariance property. And now I'm going to introduce the main theorem of my talk. Let omega n denotes the subset of actions. It is actually a polytop of dimension n, an open polytop. And the let mu denotes the candlestick form of the target space, omega n times r power n. Here, r1, r2, r2, rn denote the n the n coordinates in coordinates in omega n and alpha one alpha two until alpha n denotes the last uh denotes the last n coordinates which belong to r power n then the main result is as follows there exists a real analytic dependenomorphism phi n from the n-solutent manifold of Benjamin Ono equation u n to the targeted space omega n times r power n such that phi n preserves the symplex Phi n preserves the symplectic structure, which means that the pullback of new under by the pullback of nu by phi n is equal to omega. Omega is the symplectic form that we have construct that we have constructed for the multisolvator manifold. If we don't use the Fourier transform, then omega u is the energy inner product of h1 and the primitive of h2. And the second condition is the composition of the energy function law of the Virginia Omni equation and the immersed of the mapping phi depend only on the first n variables. And here we have the X basically the formula of the function capital E composed with Composed with the inverse of sign. So the main theorem means that we can construct such a diffeomorphism. And this diffeomorphism will send the solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation to a solution of some linear Hamiltonian equation. So let I So let I1, I2, until I denote the first n parameters, the first n components, the first n coordinates of the mapping phi n, it belongs to omega n. And the letter gamma 1, gamma 2, and 2, those are last n coordinates of phi n, which belong to r power n. Then the image of any solution of the Benjamin-Ono equation on the multi-solitan manifold capital Un will solve the following linear Hamiltonian equation, which reads formula 10. It means that the derivative of Ijut, the derivative of Iju is zero. It means that Ijut is equal to Iju0. Ijut is equal to Iju0. So Ij is actually a conservation law or conserved energy of the Benjamin-Onliner equation. And the derivative of gamma ju is equal to minus ij over pi ut. Since ijut is actually a constant, because ijut is equal to iju0. The derivative of gamma ju is constant. So gamma ju will move with. So, damaging U will move with constant velocity. So, we can see that the Benjamin overflow can be conjugated to this linear Hamiltonian flow under the action format fin. And we call the first n variables I1, I2, and 2, the action variables. And the last n parameters, the angle, the angle, the generalized angle parameters, because these. Parameters because this gamma j belongs to r power n. If gamma j belongs to the n-dimensional torus, we call it the angle variables. Here, it belongs to r power n, so we call it the generalized angles. But they will serve the same property. We shall have the explicit formula of every multi-solitary wave of the Vengi-Ono equation and. And since we have obtained the action angle map, we want to express every multisoliton V, which belongs to Un in terms of its action-angle coordinates, which means that we want to express V in terms of Ijv and gamma JV. In order to do that, we introduce the inverse spectral matrix, capital M. MKJ is defined by this Defined by these red formulas. Mjjv is equal to gamma jv plus pi i over ijv. And mkjv is equal to 2 pi i over ikv minus ijv. And this fractional times the square root of ik over ij. Then v is equal to minus two imaginary part of some polynomial qv prime over qv. And the qv is the characteristic. And the Qv is the characteristic polynomial of the inverse spectral matrix capital M. So we can express every n-solutent V in terms of its actual angle coordinates, Ijv and gamma JE. And moreover, if you remember the translation scaling parameters, which are x, j and the integer. Uh, integer which appears here. So every multi-sole return u or v can be expressed as the sum of 2 eta j over x minus x j square plus eta j square. So this x j minus i eta j are just the eigenvalues of the inverse spectral matrix because it is they are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of Polynomial of the inverse spectral matrix. So we have this kind of spectral connection between the inverse spectral matrix and the action angle coordinates. And moreover, we can show that the action angle coordinates come from the spectral analysis of some special operators. So we have the So, we have the following explicit formula. The explicit formula of every multi-solitary wave of the vengel order equation of the line reads as a red formula. So it is the two imaginary part of the inner product of mu0 minus x plus t over pi v u zero inverse power minus one times x u zero y u zero. Here, Here, V, X, and Y only depend on the action variables. So you see that the velocity matrix V is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are just the I1, I2, and UIN. And the X and Y, they are vectors which depend only on the action variables. Remember that the action variable don't depend on time, so they only depend on the initial data, U0. On the initial data, U0. And the time variable only appears in front of the velocity matrix. And if the time goes to plus infinity, we can estimate this matrix and u0 minus x plus t over pi v 0 by just the t over pi v 0 because when t goes to plus infinity. When t goes to plus infinity, mu0 can be neglected, can be ignored. And x can also be ignored if x is chosen, if x is chosen in a compact in a bounded subset. So we have the asymptotic approximation when the time t equals to plus or minus infinity. To be more precise, every isolate, every every unsolitive every multi every unsolitary wave can be approximated by the superposition of any single solitary wave okay every single solitary wave every single solitary wave we move with constant velocity so when times goes to plus or minus infinity this solitary wave can be approximated by this single solitudes which move with constant velocity. Which move with constant velocity. However, the true solution will not move with constant velocity. And moreover, we still have another very important thing to say. In order to construct the action-mo coordinates, the construction of action-mo coordinates mainly relies on the flux pair structure and the spectral analysis of the Luxembourg. Analysis of the Lux operator here. The Lux pair of the Vengean Order equation has a Lux pair, which was discovered by Nakamula and Bob Krusko in 1979. It means that there exists LUU and BU, such that if you solve the Vengeance Order equation, you solve the Vengeance Order equation. U solves the benchmark-ohmo equation if and only if LU and BU solve a Heisenberg equation of motion, which means that the derivative of LU is equal to the commutator of BU and LU. It means the commutator means BU and LU minus LUBU. And we have the X basic formula of the Lax operator. LUH is equal to minus I partial XH minus UH minus the image of UH under the image of UH under the shape of projector pi r the image of uh under the shape of projector pi r is also called the top leads operator on the hardy space l2 plus so actually lu is a self-adjoint operator and since we uh the x basic formula of vu is not mentioned here but it is not necessary in my talk we know that vu is anti-symmetric so So, LUT is unitarily equivalent to LU0 when you solve the Vengean-Ondo equation. So, the spectrum of LU is conserved under the Vengeant-Ondo flow. So, we can construct the conserved energy from the spectrum properties of the Lux operator. And if we split L2 plus to be the orthogonal director. The orthogonal direct sum of the spectral subspace H-continuous LU and HGPLU. We can show that H-continuous LU is just the HACLU, which is invariant under the shift the group. And HPP LUO is invariant under the adjoint of the shift summary group. It's another shift-themy group. And thanks to the spectral analysis. Thanks to the spectral analysis and the Berlin Act scalar representation theorem for the shift invariant spaces of the Hardy space, we have the following spectral characterization of the n-solvicent manifold capital Un. We recall that capital Un consists of all electron functions, which is the superposition of n single solutions. A function A function u belongs to capital Un if and only if u is a real-valued element function with respect to the measure of density 1 plus x square. And the spectral subspace HPPLU, which consists of all the eigenvectors, has complex dimension n and moreover, it contains the image of contains the image of u under pi which means that u belongs to the image of hpplu under the real part mapping so thanks to this result we can have the invariance of the manifold u n under the benchmarking on the flow and finally let me give a very short idea Give a very short idea of the proof. So, the eigenvalue variable is the action variables are just the eigenvalues of the next operator discovered by Takama at the Bulk Crosso. And we refer to the work of Yile Wu, Dr. Yile Wu, to see a very important auxiliary identity, which can help us to obtain the simplicity, the finiteness, and the negativeness. Negativeness and the negativeness of every eigenvalues of the Lux operator. And the end of operators, the generalized end of operators, are constructed from the analysis of the shift summary group acting on the Hardy space N2 plus. The shift summit group is defined by S eta F is equal to exponential I eta X times F. And we recall that H continuous Continuous the subspace H continuous LU is invariant under S eta, and the HPPLU is invariant under the adjoint of S eta. Then we can obtain the angle variables thanks to the infinite symbol generator of the shift semi-group, S eta star. And finally, we introduce the following generating functional generating functional which can be considered as the which can be considered as the Cauchy transform of the spectral measure of LU associated to the vector pi u. So since and h lambda is a conservative energy and together with the previous spectral characterization theorem we can show that the u That the UN is invariant, and moreover, H lambda U also satisfies a Lux pair. So we have the following two Brussels brackets. The Brussels bracket of 2 pi i lambda and j k is equal to the chronicler symbol delta k j, which means that it is equal to 1 if j is equal to k, and it is equal to 0 if j is different from k. And the lambda k and the lambda j. And the lambda k and the lambda j are in evolution. And finally, the real analyticity of phi can be given by the classical perturbation theory of for linear operators. We refer to the book of Toshio Kando and the four volumes of red sign. And the diffeomorphism property can be obtained by Adama's global inverse function theorem, which states that every Which states that every local diffeomorphism from a connected smooth manifold to a simply connected smooth manifold is actually bijective if this mapping is proper, which means that the pre-image of any compact is compact. And finally, the simple hydromorphism property of the action map can be obtained by proving that lambda L is a Lambda JSM multiple. Is a Lambron GSM by default, and we refer to the similar arguments of in the following references: the KDVKM by Professor Dr. Kapiller, Thomas Kapiller, and the Yuga Porsche, the book of Kumita Shield equation by Patrick Shiha, Sam Kekhale, and the paper of Oanda Pakuminiku from the Fumi-Shago equation on the real line. And we also refer to the book of Vanua Pek of Thomas Kabila to see the real. The construction of Birkov coordinates of the cubicle deposition Schrodinger equation on the Taurus. And we refer to the work of Jiha Kapiler Jiha Kabila Komalov for the construction of Birkov coordinates of the Benjamin Omni equation of the Taurus. Okay, thank you for your attention. Is there any questions? At some point, you say that the manifold capital MN is invariant, right? Mean by that? Excuse me, can you repeat again? Yeah, just the last sentence. Last sentence. Yes. Yes. What do you mean by invariance? Okay. Invariance means that if the initial data of the, for example, if U solves the Virginia Ono equation, and if U0 belongs to capital UN, then U T always belongs to capital U N, for any T belongs to R. So you mean that multi-solids in Benjamin Ono are? Multisolitons in Benjamin Ono are just sums of solitons. Yes, it means that if its initial data begins with the multi-solutence, then for any moment, the solution will remain as the multi-solutence. It will remain as the form of the superposition of this n single solutence. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. I'll take a look. Questions? So I'll move back to the speaker again. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
