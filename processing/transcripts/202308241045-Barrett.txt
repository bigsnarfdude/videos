Green now? We we do we do we do okay so great pleasure to be here uh virtually anyway. I think having this hybrid meeting format is a very good idea. Helps people who can't travel to participate. Um, so I want to talk about the relation between Euclidean quantum gravity and Lorentzian quantum gravity. And it's something that I've sort of wanted to talk about for a Something that I've sort of wanted to talk about for a very long time. But it's particularly important now we have non-commutative models. And I'm particularly interested in non-commutative models of quantum gravity because the way we construct those is as Euclidean models. And so we want to sort of understand the link between a Euclidean quantum gravity model and Lorentzian physics. Okay. Okay, so here's my sort of scheme for Euclidean quantum gravity. Fix a manifold, define some Lorentzian fields on the manifold, also define Euclidean fields on the same manifold, and I want to prove that the two functional integrals over these fields are the same thing. So that's sort of the plan for the proof. Of the plan for the proof. And here it is, I'm going to say this again in a technical version with notation, but it's the same thing. So on the left here, I hope you see this hand moving. We do, we do. Good. So here is the integral of e to the i times the Lorentzian action, and gamma is the Lorentzian geometry in some space of geometries, Curly L. Space of geometries curly L. And big phi here is a Lorentzian matter field in some space curly F. And we integrate over all of these. And of course, the problem is that's an oscillatory integral, which is technically difficult and may not converge without some further considerations. And on the right-hand side, here we have the Euclidean version here. So, Curly E. Um, so curly E here is the space of Euclidean geometry. So, gamma sub E is a Euclidean geometry, and phi sub E, Euclidean matter field, and I integrate over all of these. And I want these to be exactly the same. So this is like rotation of the contour in complex analysis, and the proof should be like that. Just about notation here, as I go through, all the Lorentzian things don't have any substance. All the Lorentzian things don't have any subscripts on them, and the corresponding Euclidean quantities have a sub E, that's how you know what they are, except for the space itself. L is the Lorentzian geometries and curly E is the Euclidean geometries. Okay. So I want to say from the beginning that this is not weak rotation. It is strongly related to weak rotation, but it's, you know, that's not what I'm talking about. So when people talk about weak rotation, So, when people talk about wick rotation, they usually mean some sort of correspondence between a Lorentzian geometry and a Euclidean geometry, which is a different geometry, and the physics thereon. So, and there are two popular ways of doing this. One is as real slices of some complex manifold. For example, well, Euclidean space and Lorentzian, Mikovsky space is the obvious example, but also. Space is the of this example, but also a black hole is there's a Schwartzhill black hole and there's a Euclidean Schwartzhill black hole, and you can put them both in a complex manifold. There's also another version of weak rotation called tangent space weak rotation, and this doesn't require any sort of complex manifold, but it's really where you take a Lorentzian metric, say, and you have a preferred vector field on the manifold. Vector field on the manifold. And then from the Lorentz metric and the vector field, you can cook up a Euclidean metric. And then you can somehow relate the Lorentzian metric physics to the Euclidean metric physics, although they'll be very different. So in WIC rotation, you compare different physicses on these two different geometries, for example, in the first case by analytic continuation of parameters, for example. Okay. Right, so back to. Right, so back to our project of the contour rotation. What's the motivation? Well, Lorentz in physics is generally known. I mean, you know, we can open a textbook and see what everything is. And so we know very well what we're doing. The problem is technical, that the Lorentzian integrals are not convergent. And in fact, typically to even in quantum To, you know, even in quantum field theory, to define precisely what you mean by Lorentzian quantum field theory, you have some sort of I epsilon prescription, Feynman's famous I epsilon, where you have to go around poles or a more modern way of thinking of this is a slight perturbation into complex space-time in order to actually make the integrals convergent. And in fact, you know, people in quantum And in fact, people in quantum field theory take this idea to the extreme and use Euclidean quantum field theory for the last 50 years or so because it's technically much easier. So, for example, if you do lattice gauge theory, you can actually do Euclidean lattice gauge theory like this, and it's related to the Lorentzian lattice theory by some kind of wick rotation, in fact, in that case, because the space-time is. That case, because the space-time is fixed. And in quantum gravity, now, as I said earlier, we know some Euclidean models, and so it's become an urgent question as to how to relate this to Lorentzian models. Okay. So here's the outline of the proof, and I'm going to say it again in more detail in a few minutes' time. But so here's what we do: we define some space of all complex. Some space of all complex Lorentzian geometries on the same manifold. And by complex Lorentzian geometry, I mean you just allow everything to have complex coefficients. If you have a vector field, then it has its coordinate component functions are real functions, and you just allow complex functions and so on. And so this is more general than a complex manifold. I mean, a complex manifold will give you some complex variants in geometries, possibly on the same. Complex Lorentzian geometries, possibly on the same manifold, or the slices actually might be different. But here we're just allowing arbitrary complex Lorentzian geometries on the same manifold. So we embed our real contour that we're trying to integrate over into these complex geometries. And then we define some new contour, curly L', also in the same space of complex geometry. So that's not a real contour. A real contour. And then what we want to do is rotate the contour, which means prove some equality of the two integrals over some with some holomorphic form W that you're integrating against. You want these two things to be equal, so you can deform the contour and use some multi-dimensional version of Cauchy's theorem to tell you that the integrals are equal. So that's what I mean by rotating the contour. I mean, you have two definitions and you prove that the two things are the same. You prove that the two things are the same by complex variable theory. And finally, the last step in this proof is to reinterpret my new contour L prime of complex Lorentzian geometries as real Euclidean fields. So if you choose L prime correctly, then it's pointwise isomorphic to a set of real Euclidean fields. Okay. So, um, yeah, any questions so far? Okay, well, feel free to interrupt me if you've got a question. Um, so here's a model problem in one variable. So, if I have these integrals here, uh, e to the ikx, but with some slight complex phase factor, e to the i epsilon, put factor e to the i epsilon put in to make this integral convergent, I can prove it's equal to i times the integral of e to the minus ky dy. And so you do this, this is equivalent to the Feynman I epsilon trick, because of course the expansion is one plus i epsilon and you take the limit epsilon goes to zero at the end of the calculation and then you show that the two things are the same. Well you can do this by elementary means but an means but and of course you we're interpreting this as the Euclidean integral and this is the Lorentzian integral here but you can of course think of these as a consequence of this identity that a contour integral around a closed circuit is zero where this is the Lorentzian thing with this slight angle diffraction of the contour away from the x-axis and here's the Euclidean And here's the Euclidean one. We're integrating the e to the ikz up the imaginary axis here. And you complete this with a contour at some large r, and then prove that as r goes to infinity, this integral goes to zero. So that's the sort of model you should think of for our quantum gravity problem. Okay, so now let's boot this up into gravity. So I'm going to specify. So I'm going to specify my geometry by a frame field. That's four vector fields on the manifold. So L0, L1, L2, and L3 are all vector fields. And between them, they form a frame at every point. And you can think of this actually as mapping the trivial vector. The trivial vector bundle with fiber R4 onto the tangent space of the manifold. And so this is sort of what Latham Boyle was saying yesterday about maybe one should think of the metric field like this. So also, I mean, technically, I have an independent spin connection, which is a bunch of one forms, and I'm hardly going to mention these in what follows. In what follows. So they're there, but they're part of the data, but I'm not really going to say much about them. And then the geometry is the vector space of all of these things here, the four vector fields and the four one forms, with no constraints on them, apart from the obvious things that this has to be anti-symmetric matrices and things. So that forms a vector space. Space. And my integration contour curly L is simply this geometric data, but where I'm restricting to the open subset where the determinant at every point of the frame is greater than zero. So it's a positively oriented frame on my manifold, which I'm assuming to be an oriented manifold. So So that's the basic setup of the geometry. And then we can define the usual geometric things. So the volume element. Of course, these vector fields here, if you tensor them together, you square them and then add them up, you get the inverse metric. So the inverse of that determinant is what you would normally write as root det G to give yourself the volume. G to give yourself the volume form for the manifold. And then with those definitions, you can then write down the Einstein action with dv here the volume form, lambda the cosmological constant, and R here the curvature scalar obtained from the spin connection one forms and using the inverse metric determined by these frame field here. So this So, this integral here, the usual 1 over 16πg, I'm going to abbreviate in what follows. Obviously, the integral of dv, and with this constant here, and I've called v the volume in sort of Planck units or something, and the integral of r dv, the Einstein-Hilbert term, I've written h for Hilbert here, and obviously divided by that constant, that's the scalar curvature term. Curvature term. Okay. And now the action. Well, so what is the action going to be? Well, so the first term, obviously very important term is the Einstein action here, but it can't be the whole thing. There are at the very least boundary terms if I'm on a compact manifold. And I'm just going to ignore all the boundary terms. They're there, but I'm not going to write them down. So if you like what I've So, if you like, what I say applies exactly to a manifold without boundary, which is a little bit weird, but in general, one should have boundary terms. And then there's some matter fields also in the total action. Typically, the bosonic matter fields at least just improve convergence. So, what I'm going to talk about just makes the situation better. I'll discuss a bit of. I'll discuss a bit of matter later on. And also, we need some Planck scale terms. And the reason is that the Einstein-Hilbert action of the cosmopolitical term really don't tell you much about what happens with Planck scale universes. If you take my universe and then make it very, very small by scaling the metric, then what happens is the action just scales to zero. Just scales to zero. You see, so I'm scaling the frame field by C inverse. So C is a sort of conformal factor. So that means the inverse metric scales as C minus two, and then the metric scales as C squared, which is what you normally think of as conformal factor. So the volume term scales like C to the fourth. So obviously this term will get very, very small as C goes to zero. Get very, very small as c goes to zero. And this term here will also scale to zero, but not as fast. So, in a Planck scale universe, this action here goes to zero, which so it means that the usual Einstein-Hilbert action is telling you very little about what's going on at the Planck scale. So, there will be, I'm saying any decent theory of quantum gravity will have to have Planck scale terms. Will have to have Planck scale terms. And so, this is sort of shorthand for if you stick to the notion of differential geometry and metric tensors and so on, you'll need some extra terms in the action, which come in at short distance scales or small universe scales, but negligible in the universe as we see it. Or, if, as you like, you've got some other theoretical framework, like, for example, non-commuter geometry or discrete. Commuter geometry or discrete methods or something, this is just shorthand for saying, well, the usual differential geometry doesn't even apply at Planck scale. You know, some other theoretical thing comes in, say, non-commutativity becomes big, and there's some terms to do with that. So that's all in that bin of Planck scale terms there. Okay, so now I want to talk about the complex geometry. So this was all just the standard real geometries. So now with complex geometry, Real geometries. So now, with complex geometries, I take my vector space of real geometries and tensor it with complex numbers. So all the coefficients can be complex. And the important thing is we require the action to be an analytic function now of these fields. So that's important for the control rotation. Obviously, we want to use complex methods. And what I've written so far is fine. So this formula of the these this formula of the uh the einstein hilbert is fine this is sort of uh polynomial in the in the spin connection forms and the in the frame fields and then the volume form here again is well it's one over this polynomial here but that's perfectly analytic so that's that's completely fine and I'm assuming all the other terms have that form as well okay so where are we yep So, where are we? Yep, so the action is analytic. And here's my new contour, L prime, that I want to rotate to. It's the contour in which the frame field, the zeroth vector field, it becomes imaginary. So the E1, E2, and E3 stay as they are, but the sorry, L1, L2, and L3 stay as. Is so I'm saying this backwards. The E's are real vector fields, so E1, E2, and E3 are real vector fields, and E0 is a real vector field. So IE0 is an imaginary vector field. Right. So I've said it right now. And a similar kind of thing goes on with the spin connection coefficient. Some of the components become imaginary, and I'm not going to describe that. The important thing about this new contour here is that the E fields. That is that the E fields should have they're all real and they should have positive determinant. That's so that's a again a restriction of these to an open subset of these this sort of vector space of this geometry is L prime. Okay, so that's my contour and now I want to reinterpret my complex Complex Lorentzian geometries as real Euclidean geometries. And it's very simply just interpreting E0, E1, E2, and E3 as real vector fields, if they are real vector fields, as a Euclidean frame for Euclidean geometry on the same manifold. Okay, you can see how this works here. So here's my formula for the metric, and this is the formula for the Lorentz. This is the formula for the Lorentzian metric. So it's minus L0 tensor L naught plus L1 tensor L1 and so on the others. And I've substituted in these values here involving the E's and then the L naught becomes IE naught twice. So of course those two I's here cancel that minus sign and giving me a sum of other positive terms. And that is the formula for a Euclidean metric in terms of the E fields. Of the E-fields. So, this is Samuel's tangent space wick rotation, in fact. And there's also a paper DeAndrea, Kirchhoff, and Lidze, which has lots of calculations with this tangent space wick rotation, which I'm kind of reusing and recycling their calculations in some of what I'm doing. So, none of the individual calculations here, or certainly for the bosonic fields, are really new. Fields are really new. It's stuff that people have known for a long time, and I'm sort of reinterpreting it here. So, for example, the Ricci scalar, the Lorentzian-Ricci scalar on this complex Lorentzian geometry becomes the Euclidean Ricci scalar for the real Euclidean geometry. And the Lorentzian volume form becomes minus I times the Euclidean volume form for the volume form for these E fields. These E fields here. And then, once you've done this, you can write the Lorentzian action on this complex Lorentzian geometry in terms of these Euclidean fields here. And lo and behold, when you multiply by minus I, comes out to exactly the form for the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological term, which appeared in the works of Hawking from about 1977 or so onwards. Or so onwards. So, this process of Euclideanization gives you exactly the right action. And with the right sign here, the minus one here is what Hawking tells us, and there it is. So, again, I'm going to use this shorthand here that Ve is the total Euclidean volume, and H minus, so HE is the Euclidean Einstein Hilbert term. Okay, so that's Euclideanization. So now we come to talking about the Euclidean integral and what is it. And there's a very big difficulty here, which I need to talk over here. And it's the reason why this project wasn't done decades ago. But anyway, so here's the integral e to the minus the function integral over these Euclidean frame fields e to the Over these Euclidean frame fields, e to the minus the Euclidean action. And here's the Euclidean action again. And I want to say, well, what would I need about this integral for it to converge? And of course, it's a functional integral, so it's heuristic anyway, but I'm treating functional integrals as if they're just very large finite dimensional integrals. So in that setting, So, in that setting, what would we need? Well, these frame fields can certainly get large. That's when the universe is getting small and getting to Planck scale. And there's lots of space, obviously, here in this integration regime here. So, I want this action to become infinitely positive as the frame fields go to infinity. And then, of course, this extraction. And then, of course, this exponential factor will dampen. You want this to go fast enough that this will converge at infinity. And the other thing is, if I look at all the rest of it at some finite region, I want the action to be bounded below, so that e to the minus s is bounded by e to the minus b, and then I can integrate the portion of the integral at. Portion of the integral at finite distances from the origin. And typically, this b will be negative. That's sort of the way gravity works. Okay, now in the literature, there are various other scenarios in which this integral exists, like Masura Motola and Loland Descopter, and other people on dynamical triangulations, for example. So I'm not claiming. So, I'm not claiming this is the only way to do it, but this is a way to do it in the way I'm doing it here. There may be other, more cleverer ways of doing it that make this still integrable, even if you violate this bound, particularly the second bound here. Okay, so here's the problem, the conformal mode problem, which goes back to Gibbons, Hawking, and Perry. If I do a conformal rescaling, so Scaling. So now my rescaling factor depends on x, the position on the manifold here. So it's a position-dependent conformal rescaling. And so I'm scaling the frame field here. So the metric, as I said before, will go like c squared, will scale like c squared. So that's the normal conformal factor. And what Gibbons, Hawking, and Perry tell us is that if you scale. The if you scale the action, the new sorry, you scale the Einstein-Hilbert term, the new Einstein-Hilbert term with calculated with E prime is obtained from the old one calculated with E. You take the old scalar curvature multiplied by C squared, and then you have to add another term, which is the square of the conformal factor, the gradient of the conformal factor squared. And in my language, that is you take the frame field vectors here, which are, of course, the unit vectors in the geometry, and to take the differentiation and add up this sum of their squares. And the problem of Gibbons Hawking-Perry is that this gradient squared can be arbitrarily large because you simply make C to be an oscillatory function. To be an oscillatory function, and if you make the wavelength shorter and shorter, then the gradient of c squared gets larger and larger. And so their problem is that this action isn't bounded below. And so they said, well, therefore, you can't use this Euclidean function integral. You have to find some other contour. And there was a decades long of investigation into various other contours for defining quantum gravity. Quantum gravity. So it started with them saying whether you can rotate the conformal factors. So I'll take some real Euclidean metrics, but then allow some imaginary conformal factor or complex conformal factor to take care of this problem here and changing the sign of this term here. And that's more or less complicated and so on and well. Complicated and so on, and well studied, but it's not what I want to study here. My main contention is that this problem is an unphysical problem because it relies on an arbitrarily short wavelength in the problem. But of course, in quantum gravity, we don't have arbitrarily short wavelengths. We have a Planck scale. And that means there's a minimum length scale at which any of this gravitational differential geometry physics makes sense. Geometry physics makes sense. And you can't talk about geometries that have a smaller length scale than that in the same framework and expect to get sensible answers. So that's the same thing I was talking about when I said plus Planck terms. All the Planck terms have to take care of this, what's going on at Planck scale. And certainly you won't just have this formula. There'll be other, you know, there'll be other terms that will now dominate over this. So this. Dominate over this, so this term will actually be irrelevant. So, what I'm claiming here is that this is unphysical. And the best scenario is, for example, in our non-commutative geometry models, what happens is that these modes beyond the Planck scale are simply absent. If you think of something like the fuzzy sphere, as you or I talked about yesterday, you only have harmonics up to a certain Have harmonics up to a certain cutoff, and then so you can only localize things to within some length scale, which is determined by your non-commutative model. So, the point is here that this Gibbons-Hawking-Perry problem, I claim, is completely unphysical. And one should seek a solution to this by saying that, well, this Einstein-Hilbert term is. This Einstein-Hilbert term is simply bounded. And so, for example, one could say, well, this gradient squared of the conformal factor will be just limited by some constant squared times the conformal factor squared. In other words, the gradient has a maximum energy or momentum for this gradient here. For this gradient here. And so if you argue in that way, then you can see that there is some kind of bound on the Einstein-Hilbert term. And the bound I want is one that's scale-free. So you remember earlier I had the scaling of these terms. Where is it? Yeah, here. So the Einstein-Hilbert term scales are C squared and the volume term is. Scales are C squared and the volume term is C fourth. Well, now this means I should take the square root of the volume to compare it with the Einstein-Hilbert terms. They both scale in the same way. So the solution is to have some kind of bound between the Einstein-Hilbert term and the, if you like, divided by the If you like, divided by the square root of the volume should be bounded by a universal constant C. And I also want that the cosmological constant is positive. I don't care how small it is, it can be tiny, but it needs to be positive. And then with these assumptions, you can show that the Einstein-Hilbert is indeed bounded below by minus c squared over eight lambda. C squared over eight lambda. So, as long as there is a bound, don't mind how low it gets, as long as there is one, then by some way, then I have the bound I want for my convergence here, this bound B. So, I've written this. I want to say a bit more about this, this bound on the conformal factor. You see, whenever you're talking about quantum. Whenever you're talking about quantum gravity and you say, well, large wavelengths or something, you say, well, measured by what? Because the metric's fluctuating. So what do you mean that you put a large wavelength? Because you need the metric to measure what you mean by a wavelength. So I think what I like to say is that what's going on here is that these rapid conformal oscillations here. Rapid conformal oscillations here are telling you that the difference between two metrics can't be an arbitrarily oscillating short wavelength conformal factor, if that makes sense. So in other words, the metric E comes in here in measuring what the gradient of C squared is, and that tells me something about the metric E prime. So it's a relation between two metrics. It's saying that one can't be. Saying that one can't be wildly high energy related compared to the other one, if you see what I mean. So it's a sort of saying that there's some upper limit to the amount by which one metric can vary relative to another one. That's the sort of thing that we're getting at. And again, that's what we see in our. Again, that's what we see in our non-commutative models, is some sort of limit like that, simply from reasons of harmonic analysis. Okay, and then so with that kind of bound, I can now sketch a proof of the contour rotation formula. So here it goes. And how much time have I got left? So I start. I started you have you have 10 minutes including including quag 12 minutes including questions yeah okay great so um so I start with the Euclidean geometry uh with volume one and I'm assuming that the the real geometries have some finite dimension space here dimension n um so maybe one can make an infinite dimensional version of this theory well An infinite dimensional version of this theory, well, you know, good luck. Um, so I'm constructing an n plus one cycle, capital K, which is in this picture here. And so I put back in the scaling factor for the volume. So I put it, I call this R here, as it's the inverse to the conformal factor. Um, so I rescale everything by R, so that will allow me to have arbitrary volume again. But I also allow another parameter, phi, so that I. Another parameter, phi, so I have e to the i phi, a phase factor for the first vector field. And that allows me to go into the complex metrics. And when phi reaches pi by 2, I get to the imaginary one, which will then be equivalent to a Euclidean metric. So these are Lorentzian metrics, but at phi is pi by 2, I get to the Euclidean metric E0 E1. To the Euclidean metric E0, E1, E2, E3. And these complex metrics are what's called allowable in the modern parlance of not all complex geometry is something you can have in or ought to have in quantum gravity, but these are perfectly good, according to Matt Visser. So here is the so what we're doing here is that we're going to integrate, so this is So, this is my integrand for the functional integral, the Lorentzian function integral, thought of as a holomorphic n form. And then I'm taking d of it, which makes a holomorphic n plus one form, but there are no holomorphic n plus one forms, so this is zero, so the integral is zero. And then by the usual Cauchy's theorem, it's just a boundary integral around the contours here, so I have the integral that I want along the I have the integral that I want along the Lorentzian contour here, possibly slightly deformed to make it convergent. L prime, this is going to be the Euclidean metrics here along this contour. And then an integral at large radius here, r equals b, and an integral at small radius, r equals a. Okay, so the r equals b integral, I'm going to say no more. This is Planck scale stuff. We know nothing about this. It's the integral at r equals a, which is The integral at r equals a which is of interest, and that's on the next slide. So the small radius integral, so r equals a. So here we go. This is the Lorentzian action. The scalar curvature you can split into the Ricci tensor contracted with L0 twice and the three space-like vector fields L1, L2, and L3. L1, L2, and L3. So there's the opposite sign with the Lorentz metric. And then that's the thing that rotates in the extra parameter phi. So this becomes e to the 2i phi going on here. But the volume form has a factor e to the minus i phi. And these conspire to give me an e to the two, e to the 1 i phi for this term and an e to the minus i phi for. And e to the minus i phi for the other two terms. And when you stare carefully at everything that goes on and look at the imaginary part of this action, you find the imaginary part is i times sine theta times this thing here, which is the Euclidean action. So it's a bit miraculous here that you want this imaginary part to be positive for the convergence when you go around this contour here. If it had the other sign, then it'll be. If it had the other sign, then it would blow up and you'll be dead, just like in Jordan's lemma. But this is the right sign, because remember, you're doing e to the i action, so the two i's will conspire to give you e to the minus sine phi i e. And this Euclidean action becomes positive as r goes to zero, because as r goes to zero, my conformal factor will come in and the cosmological constant will win, and that term is positive. So those are the principles. So there's the proof that this contour rotation with my physical bound put in, which is obviously the thing you have to check in your new physics, in your non-commutative physics or your discrete physics or whatever, you have to check this carefully. Okay, and finally, I'm going to talk about some matter fields. I think I've got a couple of minutes left. Scalar field. A scalar field. Well, the Lorentzian thing just turns into the Euclidean thing and it's positive, so that's what you expect. A fermion field, rather interesting. If you start with a Lorentzian Dirac operator satisfying the usual things and the Lorentzian Dirac action, you can write this using the bilinear form, which is the round brackets is the The round brackets is the Hermitian form, but with the J operator, the charge conjugation operator in the antilinear slot to make this bilinear. And you can write the charge conjugate of the Dirac field as psi bar. And this is the standard formula. It looks much like the physics formula: psi bar d psi minus m psi bar psi. Now, if you do this for a complex geometry, Complex geometry, then you have a similar formula except that you now have to think of psi bar as an independent field. It's a standard thing in Euclidean fermion physics. So I would just call it phi here. And you integrate over, well, you do anyway, even in Lorentzian physics, you integrate over psi and psi bar as independent fields. And then when you get to the complex geometries, they just satisfy this one relation here. Is that they just satisfy this one relation here. You find that on the complex geometry here, where the E0 field is imaginary, then the Dirac is I times the Euclidean Dirac with all the nice Euclidean relations. And the action becomes the Euclidean Dirac action, as you find, for example, in the papers of well, physics papers or the papers of Alan Kahn on the spectral action. Spectral action with an imaginary mass term. And that, of course, comes from the volume form becoming an I times this volume form. And you can rewrite this all in terms of spectral triples. In fact, this is really where I started wondering, could I prove exactly that the Lorentzian spectral triple framework with a Lorentzian Dirac operator exactly rotates in the contour rotation? Exactly rotates in the contour rotation to the con Dirac operator here using exactly the same internal space. So you can write this Dirac fermion thing as a manifold spectral triple tensored with a mass matrix here from the internal space. And use exactly the same internal DF. And by the way, it says KO dimension six, just as we said, and you get the con framework here in spectral triples. So the spectral triple In spectral triples. So the spectrum triple frame rates correspond exactly by Euclideanization. And that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much. Questions from the people in the room? Excuse me? Okay, let's start then with the. Yeah, okay. Let's start then with a question from the people online. If I can see okay, so who has a question from the people in Zoom? Andre, you have a question? No question from me. So sorry, it was a mistake from our side. We thought that you. Was a mistake from our side. We thought that you had a question. I'm sorry. I could ask a question if I'm allowed. Certainly, you're allowed. Okay, so yeah, so when you just mentioned the Euclidean, I mean the Lorentzian special triple, but is it in your mind, is there a very clear set of axioms now for how to treat that? I thought that this wasn't really understood. I mean, in terms of the operator analysis. Yeah, sure. You can present the data in terms of Present the data in terms of say, you know, it's an algebra of smooth functions and a manifold with an indefinite inner product, and has the following algebraic properties. You can't give an axiomatic framework to say these are the axioms that guarantee that's all you have. So an exhaustive set of axioms is missing, but you can certainly say what the data is, and that's the data you put in the quantum field theory. There's no problem with that. Right. And so this data. Right. And so this data, H here is, of course, an indefinite inner product space, turns into this data here in the convo. Can I ask a side during question, but more later to your talk? You know, when you work with, let's say, quantum SU2, as an algebra, a complex algebra, there are different star structures. And so you can have like SU2 or SL2R, and they're different real forms of the algebra. So in optimal geometry, you're going to. Algebra. So, in the geometry, you're going to complexify everything anyway. And really, the Lorentzian version or the Euclidean version could be corresponding different star choices of the star involution rather than, so that would give a kind of, it's not the way you've gone in your talk, but that would be a slightly different approach, right? I don't know if it would, so then, so then you could ask for things. I mean, you're quite obviously this wouldn't really help with the very specific questions you asked about convergence and matching of the contours, but it seems like. Of the contours, but it seems like there's a general framework there, which is not what you're using. If you see what I mean, yeah, uh, right. No, I mean, certainly in this framework here, the algebras are the same. They're the algebra's smooth functions on the manifold. But more generally, yeah, you're right. So, there's an open question of really what is a Lorentzian spectral triple in more general than More general than just giving particular examples. So that, yeah, that's a very good question. And so part of this project here is I would like to now do this contour rotation in reverse and start with what we know is a Euclidean spectral triple and do some sort of plausible analytic continuation of the partition function and say, well, the resulting thing is what I'm going to call a Lorentzian spectral triple. Spectral triple. And then you're right, all sorts of things might turn out to be subtly different. Right. But part of it is just integrating the action. I mean, you could imagine having two different star structures on the algebra. The algebra functions is like the fields for a scalar field. And you could have a weight, a linear, positive linear functional with respect to one star structure and a positive linear functional with respect to a different star structure. And that would be like two different contour integrations. Yeah, well, certainly what's happened is the charge conjugation operator is different in the real and the The in the real and the and the sorry the Euclidean and Lorentzian, they're completely different. That might hint. Yeah, I haven't seen the star structure change. You're right, it's logically possible, and that's something we should be looking out for. Okay, there is another question by Dmitri Vasilevich. Please go ahead. Yes. John, let me ask you about the conformal model problem. And from the model problem. So, to remove this problem, you somehow impose restrictions on the speed of an oscillations. But even then, I would expect that the Euclidean path integral would be dominated by contributions of oscillating geometers. So it looks a little bit unphysical. Could you comment on this? It's possible, yeah. I don't know. Of course, you're saying, could it be dominated by geometries oscillating at the Planck scale? And the problem is that. Yeah, not at the Planck scale, but somewhere near your bound. So your oscillations are bounded, but still the largest contribution to the gradient path integral comes from the oscillations which are near the bound. Yeah. Well, interestingly enough, yeah. Well, if this is relevant, if I Well, if this is relevant, if I divide one by the other, I divide h e by v e to the half, the stationary points of that functional are in fact Einstein metrics. So interestingly enough, the things that saturate that bound look like they ought to be. I haven't quite thought this through properly, but it looks like there. Looks like they're a bit more regular than you think. But certainly, it's possible that there might be some very granular structure going on at Planck scale, which is something like the things that Alan Connor's talked about, where you have lots of little small spheres or something. And I've never really quite understood his picture, but yeah, so but yeah, you're right. I don't claim to understand this fully. I don't claim to understand this fully. Okay, thank you. Let us thank John, and we have 20 minutes of a coffee break. So for people who are in Zoom, we will be back at 11 o'clock our time.
