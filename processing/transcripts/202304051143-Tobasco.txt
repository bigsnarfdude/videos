So what does Gauss's theorem tell you? So Gauss's theorem at Grigien tells you that you can't crush a shell into a plane. You have distorting lengths. But elasticity tells you that if you stretch lengths, you pay energy proportional to the square of the stretch. So what does it do? It finds a way to approximate a planar configuration while remembering through the microstructure of the wrinkling pattern that it is intrinsically spherical. So the question is, if I had just showed you this wrinkling pattern, would you have guessed that it was spherical? That it would be spherical. So, that's the question. And I should say, let me thank my collaborators. So, you can read about more of this. So, this is in two different papers. There's a gamma limit analysis in paper in ARMA. And then all of the experiments and simulations are due to my wonderful physics friends, this recently appeared in Nature Physics. So, let's back up. So, people have been. Let's back up. So, people have been studying elasticity for a while. The problem of pattern formation and elasticity has re-emerged in the last, I don't know, maybe late 90s, but also maybe this is some of the earlier experiments showing pattern formation in confined shells from the 60s. And, you know, it's a classic example of post-buckling, right? So you have buckling patterns which emerge when you just sort of fail to be stable, and then you have maybe some gross. And then you have maybe some gross change in shape. But here you have a post-buckled pattern, meaning that you continue to drive it beyond the initial instability until some fine pattern emerges. And maybe this is an example of buckling and post-buckling here as well. Not everything is a pattern that exhibits oscillations. Something can be a pattern that exhibits oscillations. So I'll finish on that one. So this is a beach ball that you just poke at a point. This is a beach ball that you just poke at a point. It's internally pressurized. So you get a radial pattern of wrinkles. This one is a cone that you press at a point. The initial instability is to radial indentation. It remains a surface of revolution. It's resting on the table. Eventually it loses symmetry, then it loses symmetry again. Or maybe it gains symmetry. Anyways, the symmetry changes. This one is a thin One is a thin spherical shell, which is collapsed onto a hard spherical obstacle. So imagine that you have a thin spherical shell, and on the inside you put a hard spherical obstacle. And then you evacuate the air between the two until it's sucked onto the smaller obstacle. And so evidently you're trying to tile the smaller obstacle in some way, but there's no tiling by hexagons of the sphere, so you have some So you have some pentagonal defects. But wait a second, why would you even expect to see hexagons? It's an elastic object. So there's some beautiful question here about why it is that, I don't know, oregonic folding patterns exist as local minimizers, local minimizers. Why is it that tiling patterns exist as minimizers of elastic sheets? And these are the sorts of questions that I want to talk about. Okay. So the parameter that I want to introduce is called the reference. Parameter that I want to introduce is called the relative thickness. And you just do the following: you take the thickness of the object h dimensionally and you divide by the diameter of the object in its reference configuration. This is your relative thickness. This is approximately 10 to the minus 4 for each of the experiments here. Also, 10 to the minus 4 for a standard sheet of paper. Okay, so if you take your sheet of printer paper and you play around with it, it has relative thickness 10 to the minus 4. Of course, these are all made up of different materials. So that's a nice example in this field that sort of shows how you can get very complicated origami-like patterns to approximate short mappings. That's what Sergio-Conti and Francesco Maggi proved. But the ideas, you know, go back a ways, and it's still a puzzle as to why it is that if you crumple a sheet of paper, it fastens like overgun. So we still have no explanation for this. That's the one I'll talk about. This is an order of magnitude thinner. Just to say that wrinkling, whether or not you'll have a wrinkling pattern is maybe not so sensitive on order of magnitude of thickness. Wrinkling is motif, and the length scales in the pattern may depend on the order of magnitude of the thickness. Okay, so what's this experiment? So it's being, it's a floating sheet. It's been compressed on the left-hand and the right-hand side. The right-hand side, and it has an exposed edge. So it's floating on top of water, and you're looking at it from the top. And so if you know what oiler buckling is, when you take a beam and you load it, it wants to respond with its sort of lowest frequency. You have a large wavelength deflection when it buckles. But this rests on top of water, so because of the interaction of the buoyancy of the water, the gravity energy of displacing the water, it does not select the It does not select the Euler buckling, instead, it selects a higher wavelength, which you can calculate. And notice that the wavelength changes as a function of the position in the sheet. Well, that's because at the edge there's a meniscus energy having to do with capillary forces. That just selects a different wavelength. So now you have to marry the two. And how do you compress something like that? I don't actually know how they do it in the experiment. Oh yeah, so let's take a quiz. So is this a thin elastic shell? Yeah. Everyone says yes. Good. So it's actually like paper. So if you take the thickness of the fuselage and you divide by the circumference of the fuselage, then it's about paper. Elasticity is scalar variant. Of course, the Young modulus is very different. But that's not what's crucial about, that's not what's crucially different about this. What's crucially different about this is that it is substantively designed. It has some internal Designed. It has some internal microstructure which prevents some of the buckling modes that we would see if it was a cardboard tube. So that's the introduction. So this is the kind of energy that I'm talking about. Actually, this is a simplification of the hyperelastic energy function on a thin domain. I could have started for this audience maybe by writing down the integral of w of dy over a thin domain to be the neighborhood of some surface. Some surface, but I didn't want to do that. I wanted to highlight one of the many different kinds of phase field-like models, if you wish. But it's not a phase field. Phi is a map. So phi goes from the reference shell, which could be a sphere, it could be a square, cone, et cetera, into R3. You can think of it as an embedding. And there are two types of energy. There's the stretching energy, which takes the pullback metric induces. The pullback metric induced by the deformation and subtract the rest metric, take the difference. This is like Hooke's law applied to this system. So I simplified thematically to turn it into essentially a geometry problem by neglecting the elastic constants. So if you have an actual material and you imagine that this is called the strain and the strain is not very large, this should really just be a quadratic form whose elastic constants are determined by the hyper-elastic energy function. But I've simplified it. Function. But I've simplified it. So just think of this as a norm. And then there's the thickness squared. And over here is called the banding energy. This is second fundamental form. So that's the embedded normal of the surface. And so if you wish, you can say this is the shape operator. And so there's a competition between these two, but there's a very small parameter. So it falls into this sort of standard class of models with singular perturbation. A non-convex stretch energy in this case. Stretching energy in this case. Principle of virtual work says that you take the internal energy, you subtract the work done by external forces, you optimize. Critical points should be the states. So all of these should be critical points of this kind of function. Good, so two questions to orient the discussion. Question number one. Is it possible to classify elastic patterns by the way that the stored energy scales with the thickness? To this kind of audience, it's a very good thing. To this kind of audience, it's extremely natural to think that if you have a singularity, which in this case singularity is broadly interpreted as pattern, then the rate at which the energy decays as h goes to zero should pick out classes of patterns. So if I wanted to tell you wrinkling, maybe I just need to tell you the magical alpha. And if I wanted to tell you point singularities or fold singularities or line singularities, maybe I'd tell you something. So this could be a call. That's not my idea. Maybe that's Bob Kahn's idea, but I mean, really. PavCon's idea, but I mean, really, it lives in the general way in which one treats singularities in these kinds of geometric relationship problems. Okay, so maybe this is really more like Bob Kahn's idea. So let's try to prove matching upper and lower bounds, where we have to find some constants. The upper bound comes from an onsatz. And so you think you have wrinkling patterns, so you plug in onsats and you optimize the question. You have something forcing it not to be the identity mapping. You have some. Yep, so there's some external forces or constraints. And there's a notion in this field of geometric incompatibility. Usually you force the thing in a way such that there are no smooth isometries. So you don't need this kitchen. So here it's been, it's internally pressurized and then it's poked. So that forbids the existence of smooth isometries since like Hilbert. Smooth isometries, since Hilbert showed that smooth isometries of a round sphere are Euclidean functions. Suppose we look at boundary values, perhaps? Or you could propose boundary values, a fluid and cone problem, where you rest the boundary on the edge of the table and you program the center, so it's not exactly a boundary value problem, but you can see sure. Okay. This one's an obstacle problem. You compress the, you constrain the embeddings to live inside of a sphere. Okay, so. Okay, so upper bounds will come from your guess on what the pattern is. The lower bound will come from some geometric argument or functional inequality. Try to match the two. But actually, the talk that I'm going to tell you about today is more concerned with the next step, which is, okay, so yes, you can study scaling laws and try to tease apart patterns, and there's lots to do still about this. But suppose you know the scaling law, can you predict? Know the scaling law, can you predict the layout of the wrinkles? So the finer details happens. So I just want to give you a broad viewpoint on the literature as it stands. And I've condensed many classical examples in this many examples in this literature onto one axis. So many, actually there are many axis, but I'll be sure. But I've collapsed this onto one axis with the idea of stored energy as being what's With the idea of stored energy as being what separates between the different classes. And so at the very left, oh, this is the energy functionality ones. At the very left, you have Kirchhoff's plate, which should exist as the limit when you have energy, which goes like h squared. Maybe boring, or I don't know. I mean, rigidity theory is fascinating. But in terms of patterns, that's not quite a pattern. And then on the right-hand side, you have pull on in all directions, and so you have energy which is volumetric. And so you have energy which is volumetric. Oh, by the way, this is energy per unit thickness, because, of course, if you stretch an elastic solid, you pay energy proportional to its volume. Volume here is like area times h, and like normalized by h. That's why this is not h1 and h cubed, rather it's 1 and h squared. This one should have order of energy going like 1. Okay, so then everything in between is a fair game to try to understand what is the scaling law of the energy. Can you predict the Law of the energy, can you predict the finer details of the patterns? And this is maybe close to state of the art, although I confess that I've ignored all of Heiner's papers. Sorry. So Heiner has, so let's start there. So again, Frisch, James, Mueller, Kirchhoff, if you wish, it's very well understood how to predict this shape, how to calculate the optimal pre-factor, etc., etc. This one, quasi-convention. This one, quasi-convexification via Pipkin's tension field theory, solves it, but you didn't really even need that if you knew that you were stabilizing all of the all of the directions in the machine, right? Okay, so now the question is, if I have a point singularity, so I, well, I don't know if Connor Moody's in the audience, but he's also worked on this. So if you poke a sheet at a point, and what you're not seeing is that it's resting on top of a glass. Okay, so it's resting on top of a glass, and you poke it as a Top of the glass, and you poke it into the glass. Then it has some contact condition with the glass, which has to be solved for. And you also know that you've depressed a single point into the glass. So, this is an example called the developable cone, or D-cone. It's an example of how a point singularity can exist in this kind of field, and it's conjectured to have energy which goes like h squared times the logarithm of one over h, like gets me a matter of time. And we know very well how to prove an upper bound. Well, we have a proven upper bound. We have essentially no unconditional upper bounds on this problem, except for there's a result by Bob and others where they assume full knowledge of boundary data as well as essentially the exact position of the displaced point in the center. And then they can do it. Separately, Heiner has. Separately, Heiner has a series of works which I highly recommend, which uses degree-theoretic type arguments on the one hand, and then there's been developments since using convex analysis for convex function theory to try to establish a logarithm of scaling in a setting where you, instead of having zero gauss curvature at the tip, you have non-zero gas curvature at the tip. That's a fair summary. Okay, so if you know that your rest metric is conical with zero gas curvature, finer. Zero gas curvature, Heiner tells you how to get lower bounds which match the lower. And now you try to ask what is the energy of a network of line singularities or a random network of line singularities. Okay, so it's supposed to be each to the 5 thirds between our lower bounds. Okay, so then in this direction you can study wrinkles. So wrinkles exist as well as oscillatory type patterns. And for that, the first step in this The first step in this direction was these folks. So, Peter and Bob wrote in 2014 an analysis based on essentially a combination of Pipkin's tension field theory with interpolation arguments from PDEs to show that you could calculate the leading order constant having to do with the amount of work done to stretch the lateral line. So, this is it's not taffy, even though it looks like taffy. Even though it looks like taffy, it's like some kind of polymerics thin sheet, which you've stretched on the left and the right. So you stretch on the left and the right, so you pay to stretch it, and so Pipkin's tension field theory tells you how to calculate the work done to stretch the rubber bands. And then Bob and Peter showed how to prove matching upper and lower bounds to quantify the stored energy of the path. In doing so, they could actually essentially give a rigorous argument for the number of wrinkles, okay, but they don't have an argument for the But they don't have an argument for the sort of orientation of the wrinkles, except for in simple symmetric settings like not this one, in fact, but in a radially symmetric setting. So even in this setting, I would say it's still fair to completely justify that you have the pattern in the middle with those parallel lines. I would say that's still open. So in this case, you would actually have identification of the pattern. Identification of the passage with the energy. Well, but they also prove upper and lower bounds on the next order term. And when you analyze the next order term, you can give a rough estimate of the number of wrinkles, but you cannot say the directionality of their peaks and chunks. Okay, so this is, so this talk is. So, this talk is about this problem. So, this problem has no applied tension. So, nothing pulls on the edge of the shell. It's simply compressed into the plane. That's actually a bit of a lie, which I'll address in the next slide. But the main point about the difference between these problems about crushing into the plane and these problems, which involve pulling in some way on some part of the boundary and then letting it react to the other part, apparently compressing in another direction. Is that whether or not there's tension applied to the boundary, the amount of tension is so weak that tension field theory doesn't really give you a prediction. So this talk is about how you can study stored energy, assume there's no tension applied, to obtain the scaling law and also a formula, variational formula for the optimal rate factor, and solve for the layout of the questions over? Questions so far? Okay, so that's the goal. So let me zoom into the actual model system. And I'm just going to play some videos so that you can get an idea of what the phenomenon is, because the phenomenon is a little complicated and there are many examples. And then I want to give you some general results that explain these examples. So here's the system. So this is this sort of geometrically incompatible confinement. So you take a cutout from a shell and you flip it Cut out from a shell, and you float it onto a water bath, it glues onto the water bath, and then it doesn't like the fact that it's on the water bath, so it wrinkles. Maybe all of this happens at the same time, okay? And eventually you get some wrinkle pattern, and this one has finally settled almost. Now it's in equilibrium, so there's some slow relaxation, it's in equilibrium at the very end. So if you can make it out, this one is like a leaf shape cut out. This one is like a leaf shape cut out of a sphere, which then relaxes into parallel lines. These ones are triangles cut out of the sphere, which relax into some diagram of wrinkles. And then this one is something that, so this was supposed to be about the second half of the abstract. So present work is driving towards trying to understand this, which is sort of a mixture between wrinkle patterns like you see in these ones and something else, which I'll say a little bit about at the end quite a time. The difference between The difference between this experiment and the first one, the only difference is that the width of the cutout region is much larger. So the cutout region here of the leaf is a little small, narrow, and the cutout region of this leaf is much larger. Sorry? What is cutout region then? Yeah, so I'm going to set up the model now, and you'll see exactly what I mean. So, what I mean is: okay, so this will be Okay, so this will be the non-convex energy, the shell-shell model that I will minimize the energy for to try to predict the patterns. I'll walk through that in a bit, but addressing the cutout. So the bit, so omega, so there are two parameters in this model, if you wish. Well, okay, there's four parameters. So let's start with omega. So omega is the reference domain for the calculation. I assume that the shell is approximately planar to begin with. This is called the shell shell theory. So this means I cannot treat a full subject. So, this means I cannot treat a full sphere or even a large portion of the sphere. So, assume that the shell is nearly planar to begin with. And then, if you have the initial shell, which is some graph of a function little p, take it to be a graph over omega. So omega is the choice of cutout. It's the initial planar projection of the shell. So, in the laboratory experiment, they take a knife edge and then they run it along a shape, and that's the boundary of omega. M encodes the initial lengths of the shell. So let's introduce the vector displacement u with components u1 and u2 in the plane, in plane displacement. And let's introduce the out-of-plane. So w is the displacement relative to a perfectly flat configuration, which is not the same as the displacement relative to the initial shape. But w is the final graph. So w minus p is the out of the. W minus P is the out-of-plane displacement. And now if you calculate the change in length that I wrote down in a previous slide and you expand to leading order, you get this expression, where E of U is the symmetric gradient of U, so it's felt linearly in plane, and grad W tensor grad W is the usual outer product, which is felt non-linearly out of plane. And the choice to keep these two terms is what's known as the bucket. Keep these two terms as what's known as the Buck-Covering approximation. It's also known as the shellow-shell approximation. It is justified when the symmetric gradient is on the order of the square of the gradient of W. So it's a little bit of a fun scale. M? M encodes the initial metric. So if you write down the metric of the initial shell, it will be identity plus grad p tensor grad p, and m encodes grad p tensor grad p, which I write here. Which I write here. So m is one-half grab p tensor grab p. And so indeed, if you write the embedded metric minus the original metric, it'll be twice the Karman strain plus higher order terms. I've neglected quadratic terms in U. So this is an approximation. A standard model. This you plug into epsilon. Okay, that was the hardest part of the model. So the rest is more familiar. So that's the non-convexity. So the rest is more familiar. B is like h squared. It's called the bending modulus. B is going to put 0. Bending modulus. B is going to go to zero in the one that I'm studying because it's very thin. K is the stiffness of the water bath relative to the intrinsic stiffness of the shell. So K will go to infinity because the water bath prefers to remain flat as opposed to if it's extremely thin, it can choose to jump over. And so if you raise a column of water, you know, so if you raise a column of water through height W, you pay energy. Water through height w, you pay energy is proportional to w squared. The column is small enough. Of course, there's a more non-linear expression. I don't use it here, I use this. Keeping with the shallow-shell approximation, the outer plane displacements are small enough to use this as an approximation of the gravity energy of the water. And then this is an approximation, again, in the shallow shell model, of the second fundamental form. If you have a shallow shell, so nearly flat, then to leading order, the second fundamental form is just the Hessian matrix of W. Just the Hessian matrix of W. Good. Okay, so that's the model. And now the question is to minimize it. Okay, so I guess a little bit more about the setup. So, I mean, I don't want to just choose a particular P and do the analysis, right? So let me consider a large class of P's. Let me consider a large class of omegas. There'll be restrictions when I say the theorem. How do the minimizers behave as p goes to 0 and k goes to infinity? That's the question. Question. Okay, so think about these two pictures. So I show you these two pictures. One of them is a spherical cap intrinsically flattened into the plane. The other one is a spherical saddle. Sorry, that doesn't make sense. Disc saddle. Yeah. The other one is a saddle disc. Stantons of the plane. Okay, so let me try again. One of them has intrinsic curvature positive, and the other one has intrinsic curvature negative. And they both have omega being a disk. So which one is which? So just imagine in your head. So this one, is it positive or negative in terms of quantity? This one, is it... Meaning, if you release it from the water, does it spring back into a spherical cap? Or not? Oh, people want to go. Okay, so... So how many vote for the left being a sphere? And how many vote for the left being a saddle? You guys are too smart. So if I, it's funny, I ask different audiences and it's like a coin flip. I asked different audiences and it's like a coin flip. People have different intuitions. So the one on the left is indeed a sphere. And interestingly, if you redo the experiment twice, on the one on the left, you get two different mathematical curves. And if you do the experiment correctly on the right, I mean, on the right twice, you get the same pattern, perhaps with the peaks and the draws interchange. But maybe it rotates a little bit. Only on the left. Oh, I mean, my my collaborators have done hundreds of experiments. And what was your question? And what was your question? I I'm just trying to clarify what it is. Do the experiment many times, each time you get a different distribution of wrinkles on the left. Maybe not about minimizer, right? Maybe something related to local minimizer. I mean, the way you produce these wrinkles. Yeah, so it's a okay. So which one of these is a global minimizer, you might ask? The other one. So these are all questions. Okay. So let's catalog the library. So let's catalog a library of experiments. So here's what it looks like when you have cutouts of negatively curved shelves, and here you have cutouts of positively curved shelves. Generically, there's a random interior surrounded, bordered by some determined edge, non-random edge. Sometimes, peculiarly, this is a half-known shape. Sometimes the negative one is completely determinable. There is no randomness, but it's positive. And then the negative one is. Oh, that's positive. And then the negative ones generically are determined. And you can do experiments, you can do simulations. So now is the time to say a little bit of the difference between the experiments and the simulations, because it highlights a crucial ingredient here about the analysis. There's no tension applied at the boundary of the simulations. So you run the simulation code, you apply no tension at the boundary. You can do that in the computer. If you float a shell in a water bath, there will be surface tension pulling on the edge. There will be surface tension pulling on the edge. But the amount of surface tension pulling on the edge of the water bath is very small, and so notice that the patterns are quite similar. So a little bit of terminology. So the thing on the inside we define as what we call a disordered wrinkle domain because we don't really have a good understanding of it. The one on the outside we define as an ordered wrinkle domain because it's nice and ordered. Domain because it's nice and ordered. Okay, so call this a theorem if you wish. There will be a theorem by the end of the talk. This is the main results of the nature physics article, plus all the experiments and simulations, and etc. It says that you can predict all of the patterns using two geometric rules. And here they are. So to predict the patterns for the negatively curved shell, solve the minimum maximum time problem. Solve the minimum exit time problem. The minimum exit time problem by definition is you take a point on the inside of the shell. This is like a problem from optimal control here, right? Take you have domain, you want to take a point on the interior, and then you want to run to the boundary of the domain with a curve that has speed unit one, and you want to minimize the length. So of course the answer is not to wiggle along the path, but rather to take a straight line to the boundary that exits at a right angle. That's the minimum exit time problem for Euclidean metrics. The minimum exit time problem for Euclidean metric. And that's what the peaks and the drops of the negatively curved wrinkles do. Can I get the gradient with the distance from the battery? Okay. Sure. Yep. Okay. So now, on the other hand, for the positively curved shells, at first it seems not so simple, and so it took us a while to realize that there's a duality transformation between the patterns. So in fact, Patterns. So, in fact, if you give me any of the patterns on the bottom, I can perform a duality transformation and calculate the patterns on the top, and vice versa. So, here's the transformation. You take the medial axis, which is the collection of points, which when you come to the boundary by minimum exit, you have two or more points of closest approach. So, you take a point P on the medial axis, you connect it to the boundary by its two legs, you form an isosceles triangle, and the base is the dual wrinkle. Wrinkle. And so imagine you take this triangular shell here, and so you indeed construct the base. And you can see that the orientation of this base will select three different subdomains. And then there's something on the inside where you cannot do the duality. So what happens on the inside? In that case, you have a point in the medial axis that runs to three or more points of closest approach on the boundary. Points of closest approach on the boundaries. You take the convex hull. And the theorem is that any disorder that occurs must occur in the convex hull of points of closest approach. The non-empty convex hull of points of closest approach. Okay, so that's a, so I won't tell you the distribution of the disorder, but I will tell you that it must occur at these convex homes. What's being proved? There exists a unit vector calculated by these rules so that that component Calculated by these rules so that that component of the gradient of the outer plane displacement goes stronger than zero. Strong convergence to zero means no wrinkling. So you can take this to be, if you wish, an asymptotic definition of the direction of wrinkling. A direction field t, such that that directional derivative of the outer plane displacement goes strongly to zero. Okay, so let's get into the analysis. So there are, so I'll say as much as I can and then So, I'll say as much as I can and then I'll quit when I run out of time, I guess. So, there are two main ideas. And so, the first main idea is to extract the limit behavior of this energy as a functional that then you can cleanly analyze. So, this is again a limit problem first. And so, the story is that the energy expands at leading order. Okay, so B and K are the parameters to play with. B goes to zero, K goes to infinity. B goes to 0, k goes to infinity. This is a quadratic functional. Keep track of the length scales involved. It makes sense to take the geometric mean of B and K. Imagine just interpolating between these two. So you end up with the correct energy scaling is the geometric mean of B and K. And then when you calculate the optimal pre-factor, it comes out to be a very nice functional. And what it has to do with is the area of the initial shell. The area of the initial shell minus the area of the stamped shell, where you have homogenized all of the wrinkles. So the wrinkles absorb area. Take the area difference, and at leading order, this gives the optimal pre-factor times two of these terms. If you tried to do this analysis without the metric constraint, you would not get the area function. You would get something else. The metric constraint, well, what else could be in metric geometry? In metric geometry, what else could tell you the measure of the amount of ring point? It's isotropic, right? So, no, note that these are not anisotropic shells. If I had something which is anisotropic or with the heterogeneous elasticity law, not so simple, right? Okay, so therefore, if you believe this, you should solve this sort of following isoparametric type problem, quote unquote, which is find the mapping which goes from the initial shell directly into the plane. This is the homogenized or effective mapping. Plane. This is the homogenized or effective mapping. Assume it is a length-shortening mapping, so tension-free. I write tension-free because I subscribe to against tension field. And then maximize the covered area of the. And so the claim is that this is what comes out, or rather a von Kármán approximation of this is what comes out as the gamma limit. So I'll state this rigorously as the theorem. Let me speed up a little bit. Okay, so here's the theorem. So take a doubly essential. So take a doubly asymptotic limit. B goes to 0, k goes to infinity. Put the following conditions on the sequence of b and k. So b sub n k sub n. On the one hand, b times k must go to 0, because of course we want the energy of the pattern, which is root bk, to be much smaller than the energy of just stretching the shell into the plane. So of course b times patient goes. There's another condition that has to do with the type of recovery sequence I use, which I do not think is optimal. Which I do not think is optimal. So I don't, maybe if you were more clever with the recovery sequence, you could get rid of this other condition. And then, provided the omega is strictly star-shaped, and provided that the misfit M, so this means the initial metric of the shell, is Lipschitz, then you have gamma convergence of the rescaled energies to a change of area. I'll give an exact formula in a couple slides. Oh, maybe I do it now. So, delta A of u effective is defined as, so it is the integral of one half red p squared dx over omega minus the boundary integral of u effective dot one half ds. So, in the shell of shell approximation, this is the change of area. Since the initial area of the shell is the square root of 1 plus grad p squared, which plus grad p squared, which to leading order is one plus one half graduate. And the change of area, it would be the integral of debt identity plus grad U, which to linear order is, of course, the integral of battery integral of the species. Might upward? N, n head. Normal. Atwards pointing normal. Oh, okay. P. Let me study. What is P again? P is the initial height function of the shell. So before you compress it, So before you compress it, the graph of the shell is x3 is equal to p x1 x2. So the initial area of the shell is of course root of 1 plus grada p squared integrated, which would be in order as 1 plus 1 half grada p squared plus hierarchy parents. My shell is compressively flat. This term is missing the initial area of the projected image, which would be the area of omega. Be the area of omega, and that corresponds to this number one, the cancel. Okay, so it's a leading order when you calculate the change in area, it's dysfunctional. So that's what comes out in this camera. And the admissible set are linearly length-shortening maps with respect to the metric M of the misfit M. This has to be understood in the sense of measures. So E of U is a measure because U is in V D. And the topology of convergence is we start V D and plane and we gauge one. Plane would be gauge one. And so actually this is m dx, but I didn't write dx. Okay, and then the outer plane's goes from the terror, of course. Good. So minimizers converge to minimizers, obviously. Okay, so lower bound. So you have your wiggling energy landscapes. You want to put a lower bound on them. So let's look for a lower bound. In some sense, this is the easy part of the argument. I had the full Hessian, but anyways, you find a way to sort of get to the trace. You find a way to sort of get to the trace because that's the crucial quantity here, the Gauss curvature being conserved. And then you interpolate. Okay, so you do some algebraic manipulation. Okay, so the only tricky bit here is that if you chose to interpolate with the full Hessian, you would get the wrong prefactor. So you choose to interpolate using the mean curvature, you get the correct pre-factor. Charging energy tells you that there's a relationship between grad W tensor grad W, and of course, each And of course, each component of this is converging weakly, so you don't want to try to test or limit in this unless you have an identity for it. So this stretching energy goes to zero tells you you can convert this into something linear and you implain this once. So then you integrate that up and you find that the lower bound to leading order is equal to the change in error. That's pretty simple, actually. So the question is: is it sharp? So does there exist a recovery sequence? So suppose you have some way of compressing it to the Suppose you have some way of compressing into the plane, not necessarily optimal. Can you put a wrinkling pattern to recover the changing area? And the answer is yes, if you have side conditions, and I'm low on time, so I'll skip most of the intuition here because I want to get to the second half of what was initially the first half of the talk. And to say that, okay, so this is where this strange side condition comes from, and maybe somebody can tell me how to get rid of it. So here's my recovery sequence. Here's my recovery sequence. So imagine that you've compressed into the plane, so you have a length-shortening map, so now you must produce an isometry which approximates it. Okay, so you tell me to use convex integration, and I tell you, but no wrinkling pattern looks like convex integration. So instead, what you want is a wrinkling pattern which is somehow using only monochromatic wrinkling. So I mean one well-defined direction of wrinkling that maybe you have to mix together through limitation in a few. If you need directions of mismatch. So it stands to reason that your mismatch, I mean, maybe if M is Lipschitz, that was my assumption, that your mismatch from your given U effective in the plane somehow can be approximated by a locally constant misfit, which could be biaxial. And then you just have to cook up the correct twinned type wrinkling pattern, which accumulates two different directions of length, but this is quite standard for the field. Of length, but this is quite standard in the field, known as the Harrington method. So if you do bidirectional wrinkling with an area fraction that you can tune, you can accommodate in-plane biaxial constant compression, and then you just sort of tile with this and choose the in-plane compression to approximate to leading order piece-wise constant infants. You can actually then you have to pay the energy of the approximation and all of the walls, and etc., etc., and you accumulate them and you then make a Accumulate them and you and then make an assumption on your parameters to neglect them, that's where this side condition comes from. Okay, so that's essentially the idea. So we'll see how far I get. I want to tell you now how to solve the gamma limit to predict the shapes. How much time do I have? Eight minutes. Good. Let's try it. Okay. So, for So, there are, as I've been talking about this to many people, there are two different ways, you have to make a choice on how you present it. So, there are two different ways to talk about this. Since this is a compensated compactness workshop, I will bring in the notion of defect measure. I could have talked about stress, but anyways, I bring in the notion of defect measure. And let's define the defect measure, which allows you to keep track of the badly behaved term and this convergence. Behavior term and this convergence. So you have a sequence and E of U is a linear form, symmetric greater than U, no problems, pass the limit, and it's fixed. So you need to keep track of this term. So grad w tensor grad w dx is bounded, so you press to restart with it. This is called the tensorial effect measure for this problem. Obviously, this is the definition. But the point here is you're just, you know, you're averaging over the patterns. It's unlike local ways. Okay, so then in the limit, the statement that you have a sequence of almost, so you have maps whose isometric deficit converges to zero, and limits to this expression. You have a pair of an in-plane displacement and a defect measure that couple through, so you can think of this as isometry expressed in terms of micro-macrovariance, or averaged microvariables. So the pattern couples to the implant. So the pattern couples to the implant strength. Good? Of course, in this problem, the defect measures are constrained by PDE, because the only way that you can solve the previous equation that I had on the board, the only way you can solve this for mu is if the same binot compatibility conditions hold for the rest of the equation, right? M minus e of u. So operate with curl-curl on that equation. With curl-curl on that equation, and you eliminate the u, and you cook up that minus one-half curl-curl mu is kappa. Kappa is the Gauss curvature to leading order. So what exactly is kappa? So kappa is the determinants of the Hessian of the initial p. Okay, so if you wrote down the kappa of the initial shell, the actual kappa, into leading order, it would be the determinants of the Hessian of P plus corrections. And in the shell or shell limit, let's define that to be calculus. So, you know, the very weak Hessian identity by Ivanietz tells you that minus one half curl curl grad p tensor grad p is the dent hessian p, and that's where this calendar comes from. Okay, so what about the target functional, which is the change in area? Again, easy to see through the identity on the previous slide that the change in area is nothing other than the little L1 norm of QU integrated over. So it's the mass. I don't know, what do you want to call it? The mass of the volume. I don't know, what do you want to call it? The mass volume. It's the amount of pattern. Okay? So you have to take the trace. And also, mu is non-negative. Mu is a limit of grad W tensor grad W, hence non-negative. And mu is a matrix. Mu is a matrix measure, non-negative symmetric. And from this identity, you see that if I take the trace, I can express. I can express that one-half trace mu is equal to trace m minus div u. Trace m minus div u is generating this expression. And so therefore it's the same as just the integral of the trace of u. u is not negative, so this is one little one. Okay, so here's an attractive way of expressing the problem. Minimize the amount of pattern compared to the constraint of compatibility. If the pattern should be geometrically compatible. Should be geometrically functional. That's just a translation. So now you write down the Weather-Lagrange equations. So it's a convex variational problem. P, it could be expressed in terms of a linear form involving U effective. So it's a convex variational problem, so it has a dual problem. Of course, there's a duality at one level, there's a duality between measures and functions. Also, there's a duality between Also, there's a duality between area potentials and displacements. So phi is like the area potential for this problem. So you go through, I won't do the proof of this, but anyways you find an integration by parts identity, which allows you to convert, you know, introduce a Lagrange multiplier for the constraint. It allows you to convert this into this. And the critical point conditions take the form of a system. A system. So the coefficients in the PDE system are determined by the optimal dual problem, and then you have to recover from this if you know the optimal phi. So let's chew on what phi. So now I'll prove the simple rules. So let's chew on the optimal phi. So it turns out, and this would be an integration my price calculation, I've been sweeping down in the run, okay? So it turns out that the dual objective functional is the integral of phi against that. To grow phi against that hashtag V. So again, you have an area potential phi, which is assumed to be a convex function, since you want its area stress to be non-negative. And then you have to have boundary conditions, which I don't really have time to motivate. And you maximize the integral of phi against kappa. Now, basically, the story I want to tell, the message I want to tell you is that if you make assumptions on kappa, corresponding to either having a positively curved or a negatively curved shell, Positively curved or a negatively curved shell, you can solve this exactly by hand for any simply connected omega. Now, the gamma convergence theorem was for strictly star-shaped omega, but this problem I've solved explicitly for any simply connected omega. So here's how that works. So in the case where kappa is negative, you want to maximize negative of phi, so you want to raise phi up. So you're computing a convex envelope of a function which is plus. Of a function which is plus infinity inside the shell and a parabola outside of the shell, 1 half x1 squared plus x2 squared. So that's a convex envelope. For the case where kappa, sorry, that's kappa positive. For the case where kappa is negative, of course you want to make phi as low as possible. And you can cook up, I mean, you knew the distance function to the boundary was in. So you can cook that up. So here's the formula for the solution of the problem where the kappa is negative. Solution of the problem where the kappa is negative. And then Irene has stood up, so I'm just going to tell you that a magical miracle happens, which is that the solution for the positively curved problem is the Legendre transform of the solution to the negatively curved problem. And if you project Legendre transform at the level of the second gradients, you get the duality of the SLS's charges. All right, other conclusions, but let me just say one minute or less, which is Or less, which is, yeah, so the principles here were: wrinkle patterns absorb aerial coverage. We can now predict their direction, and they happen in dual pairs between signs of curvature of shell. But there's lots to do, right? I mean, what about patterns that don't just have wrinkles? So if you have a non-shallow shell, some of the material can disappear into the volume of the bath. It can choose to leave the surface of the bath. You can have self-contact, and this is what's known as. Self-contact. This is what's known as a type of elastic fold. So that's what the second half of my abstract is about. And clearly, I ran out of time. I'm presently working on a fully non-linear hyper-elastic analysis of folds. I mean, I still haven't explained the toning problem, and I just put this here for Carolyn, since that's what she and I were talking about this week. So I'll stop there. Okay, so uh yeah it stands between us and lunch, so maybe the data is you want to do is in V D U is in V D. And at the end, what is the structure of the U the affinity this way is affinity or yeah. Yeah, so that's that's let's maybe talk during lunch. That's hard to say when you have one of these open regions in the middle. But in each of the regions where you have an ordered pattern, you can produce a formula for U up to an infinitesimal at infinitesimal rotation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So it's a weighty management point. Yeah, so here's the answer. So if you compute E of due effective minus one half m dx, then in a certain sense, this will turn out to be rank one. It will be rank one in the part of the pattern that is ordered. In the disordered pattern, In the disordered part, I have examples where it can be rank one, rank two. Okay, I guess it's a good place to start, so thank you again.
