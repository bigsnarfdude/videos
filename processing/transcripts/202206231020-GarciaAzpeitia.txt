Thank you to the organizers for the opportunity of speaking here. This is a joint work with Marine Fontaine from University of Warwick. So the title is Breaks in the Enbody Problem. Is breaks in the n-body problem, so I want to explain what is a braid by examples. So this is taken from a paper from Moore called Braids in Classical Dynamics. So you have the movement of bodies in two bodies going around a circle, right? This is a solution of the body problem. Two body problem. Problem, two-body problem. So, what happens if you parametrize time in the C coordinates, right? What you see is what is in the left. You see an elix, where the role of time is being the parameterization of the C component. So, when the two bodies go around the circle, they form an elixir. Now, what happened is that if you have three bodies, like for example, That if you have three bodies, like for example, two going in a circle and one in the center, then you have a string, a line, and then you have two forming an elix. What happens is if you have three bodies going in a circle, well, they form an elix with three strands. Okay, and the last example is the now famous eight choreography. more famous eight choreography for three bodies three bodies going in in figure eight and then the corresponding uh the corresponding braid is what is on the left right actually this famous eight choreography which was proven by chencinger and montgomery was rediscovered in 2000 proved by them it appears first in that paper of more Fields in that paper of more, of course, in that paper, it was found numerically. Okay, so why bread? Why braves? Well, the point is that this was known already by Poincar√©. When you write the action for the L-body problem, right? And then two bodies make a collision, then the action blow ups if the potential is for strong forces. For strong forces, not for gravitational forces, not for weak forces, only for strong forces. So, what does it mean? It means that if you look for minimizers of the action, right, in a subset of periodic paths, which have a topological constraint of a brave, then the action blow ops in the boundary of the Blow up in the boundary of that set, right? And then you can find minimizers by the direct method of minimization. This was already known by Poncaren. There are many papers, many papers on that aspect of finding periodic solutions which are minimizers in the constrainted abrade by the direct method of calculus of variation. For example, Montgomery has a paper. Montgomery has a paper and Montaldi has another paper of the description of the possibilities of these things. So the problem is for gravitational or weak forces, this doesn't happen anymore. So what I want to explain is a concept. The title has the concept of cabling. So what is cabling? This concept appears in the paper of Seymour. Appears in the paper of Seymour. The concept is: imagine that you already have a braid, right, with strands. So you want to replace one strand by another set of strands, just like cabling. So actually, this is the objective of the presentation and of the work, which is starting with the central Starting with the central configuration of m bodies and lossly speaking, replacing each one of the bodies in the central configuration by kj bodies where j represent the cluster. So you are going in this example, you have originally four bodies, and then you are going to replace each one of the bodies by three bodies going in small circles. This is the concept of cabling of CIMOR. How the braid looks? Well, it looks like this. It looks well, it looks like this one for that example. Originally, you have four bodies going in an elixir, the bodies go once, the center of masses goes wind once. And then in this case, the three bodies winds two, right? Two times. So this is a possibility of the kind of solutions we are going to construct. We are going to construct. This problem actually has been studied before in the case of gravitational potential. Of course, because in the concept or in the system of the Sun Earth Mond, this goes back to mathematicians like Hill, Hoff, Siegel, and Moulton and Conley. They had papers about the case of having two bodies in a circle and replacing the circle. Having two bodies in my circle are replacing one by two. This is a particular case, which is in the context of a Sun-Er-Mon system. Which is K1? KJ is going to denote the number of bodies in a cluster. So in this case, only one cluster with two bodies. And actually, this result was generalized also for gravitational potential by Candle. By candle to the case of Lagrange triangle and replacing one by two. And Measure did it for arbitrage general central configuration of n bodies, replacing one body by two, only by two, and in the plane. So I explained what is the idea of what we are going to target. So in order to find those solutions, we are going to introduce To introduce a multi-index notation, so the positions of the bodies are going to be qj. Right, j, I need two indices. J is going to represent the cluster, and k is going to represent the body inside the cluster j. And in each cluster, I have kj bodies. Without loss of generalization, I'm going to assume that after n zero, the closed. N0, the cluster has only one body, which is kj is equal to one after n zero. So the equations with that, the Newton equations for the n-body problem with that multi-index notation is equation one, right? It's just the number of bodies, the number of bodies is capital N, which is the sum of the bodies in each cluster, the sum of the KJs. KJ is how do you maintain the volume velocity for time around the motion? It's going to be a perturbative method and then I will show you after I show the theorem. So first I show the theorem and then I tell you how it's possible to prove it. So QJ is the key body in the JV cluster. It's two indices, JK, right? J is the indices of a cluster and K is the the body in in the in the cluster. The body in the cluster, and each cluster has KJ bodies, right? It's not fixed. So this is the generalized Newton equations, not only for gravitational, but for homogeneous potential. So there is an alpha plus one in the exponent of the denominator of the distance between the bodies. And the case alpha equal to two gives. The case alpha equal to two gives alpha alpha plus one is trigger, which is a gravitational case, and actually, there is a very important case, I would say as important as the gravitational case, which is a case alpha equal to one. This is for logarithmic potentials. This is weak force. That model appears actually in the interaction of steady vortex filaments for fluids. Why is a steady vortex filament? What is a steady vortex filament? It is basically a parametrization, an idealization of a tornado, right? Basically, you have a fluid, right? And then you have a movement around the vortex line. I mean, it's important to remark this is for steady. There is no time in the model of steady vortex filaments. So, what is the role of time in the Newton equations? Time in the Newton equations. The role of time in the Newton equations is precisely the parametrization of the cure by the C component. Actually, if you look at the representation as a braid, what you see is what would be what you will see as the vortex lines. There is no time in the left figure. So that's what I mean, each line. That's what I mean. Each line represents a vortex filament. An important difference is that the role of the masses in the vortex filaments is placed by the circulation of the Euler equation. So in the vortex filament, circulations can be negative. We are going to work only for positive masses. So, but there is a k difference. And actually, I mean, this model of steady vortex filaments appears also in bottoms. Filaments appear also in both Bose Einstein condensates. Both Einstein condensates behave somehow as superfluids. But Bose-Einstein condensates are a quantum state of matter. So because of the quantum property of that matter, in that case, the masses are quantified, right? You cannot have a mass one half. You only have integer masses. Only have integer masses negative as well, which represent the circulations. And these vortex filaments appear also in superconductors. So, superconductors of type 2. Type 2 superconductors are imperfect superconductors. And basically, these vortex lines is where the, if you put a magnetic field in a superconductor, the magnetic field goes around. Around a perfect superconductor. If the superconductor is not perfect, or the magnetic field is very strong, then magnetic lines penetrate the superconductor. And that's what the vortex filament lines represent. That's the reason you can levitate a superconductor. Levitate as superconductor. If it's perfect, it doesn't. Okay. So, having explained what is a cabling, what is the paid and applications of this problem, I want to explain very quickly what is a central configuration. So, starting point, starting point is central configuration of the Duration of the n-body problem for the clusters, right? So capital MJ represents the total mass of a cluster J, right? And A0 is going to be a central configuration for the M-body problem of the clusters. So that's equation two. And then I'm going to replace each one of the bodies in the cluster by KJ bodies. KJ bodies in a central configuration. So I'm going to assume that Aj is a central configuration of the KJ body problem with the corresponding masses. That's equation three. Okay. Now, I cannot replace it like any central configuration. We are going to require some hypotheses. For the central configuration of the clusters, we are going to require that the central configuration for the cluster A0 is Cluster A0 is non-degenerated. So, while it's non-degenerated, basically, the kernel of the Hessian of the amended potential, right, A0 is a critical point of the amended potential. So the Hessian has kernel of dimension one, right? That's a non-degeneracy because amended potential is invariant on the rotation. So the The the tangent the tangent vector to the SO3 orbit of A0 is always on the kernel of the Hessian. So basically, the kernel needs to be of dimension one. You're in the plane. In the plane. So S1. Everything is in the plane. If you are in a space, then you have SL3. Okay. SL3. So kernel is three-dimensional in space. Okay, but in the plane. But here you are in the plane. Yeah. But here you are in the plane. Yeah. So there are many central configurations. It's proven that the central configurations are non-degenerated for generic masses. Basically, if you have a degenerate central configuration and then you vary a little bit the masses, then you end up with the non-degenerate central configuration. Excuse me, this is proven in any case or so for any number of body in any dimension? I think it's proven in any case and in any number of Proving in any case and in any number of bodies, I was expecting a kind of that question. This is related with the smell conjecture about the number of central configurations being finite. And I was reading a long time ago a paper about that configuration and then mentioned that Smail at the beginning started thinking about the possibilities of that configuration of that conjecture. Yeah, it can be. It can be analyzed explicitly in the case of Lagrange triangle for three different masses. Yes. Can you explain, please, in this picture here, where are the clusters and how many clusters do you have? I can explain it in this picture. This picture? Yeah, the other one. This one? No, the one that you had, you just had. The last slide. The last slide. Yeah, what are the clusters? Each point is a cluster. It's going to be actually. Yeah. Okay. This is just illustration. Okay. But you take any central configuration of n bodies, and then you want to replace one by kj bodies, each one of them. Okay? Okay. So what is max? What is Maxwell's configuration? It's a regular polygon of masses equal to one with a massive center. That's a model for Saturn. And then you have a Lagrange triangular configuration and then polygonal Lagrange configurations, regular ones. And then you have these symmetric configurations with different masses. There are a lot of papers about the central configurations being constructed like nested polygons. construct like nested polygons or even what people call spider webs. They look like spider webs when you include a lot of bodies. Okay, so now I finally can explain what is our theorem. This was published this year. For this theorem, I need to assume that alpha is different than two. I'm not going to I'm not going to include the gravitational case. My last slide is about the gravitational case. I need to impose additional conditions and then I'm going to explain why I need to include additional conditions. So alpha can be bigger than two here? What is the question? Alpha can be bigger than two here or? Yeah, it can be bigger than two or less than two. Can be up to one. One is the other. One is the other relevant case. Yeah, one and two. So we fix integers P1 to P and zero. Each integer is for one of the cluster that you are going to divide. And then we are going to assume that A0, the central configuration of the cluster, is non-degenerated. And then we are going to assume that AJ, the central configuration, which is going to replace the cluster J, we need to be We need it to be 2œÄ pj non-degenerated. So I'm going to explain in the idea of the proof what is 2œÄ over pj non-degenerated. Okay. We have an algorithm to verify that when a regular polygon is to pi pj non-degenerated, and we prove that there is an infinite number of polygons which are to pipe pj non-degenerated. Very lostly speaking, A0 is non-degenerated somehow if it's isolated in the space of central configurations. So AJ is going to be, lossly speaking, 2œÄ pj non-degenerated, degenerated if it's isolated in the solutions which are 2œÄ pj periodic of the embodic problem. Okay, but this is loosely speaking. But this is loosely speaking. So if that hypothesis happens, then for each epsilon small enough, so what is epsilon? Epsilon is a measure of the radius of the cluster, right? So for each epsilon small enough, there are at least n0 plus one relative periodic solutions. What's relative periodic solutions of this form? QJK is given in terms of two terms. Given in terms of two terms for the first bodies and then for the clusters with only one body is given by the second expression. So what is the first name? What is the first name term in the qj? The first name is just exponential of tj. So that's a rotation of frequency one. U0j and uj k. j and u j k are 2 pi periodic functions, right? So, and moreover, u 0 j is like a 0 j plus a 2 pi periodic correction, which is order of epsilon. That basically means that the first term is a correction of the center of masses of the clusters going in the central configuration with frequency one. That the second expression is. The second expression is Rj exponential of T omega j omega j. So the exponential omega j j t is a rotation of frequency omega j, right? And rj is the amplitude, a measure of the amplitude of the cluster. So you can see at the last lines, rj is order of epsilon, right? Omega j is order of epsilon to minus. To minus alpha plus one over two. So when epsilon goes to zero, the radius of the cluster goes to zero, but the frequency of rotation of the cluster omega j blow ups to infinite. And ujk is basically exponential of theta j j a j k. What does it mean? It means that once you have the central configuration. Central configuration for the cluster, you have an SO2 orbit of possibilities to starting the process of construction. In other words, the N0 plus one different solutions are determined by phases. Phases, theta j in S1. And what that phases mean is how do you orient the central configurations in the clusters respect with each other, right? They can be oriented in different ways. So that's the role of theta J and that's why you can have N0 plus one predictive solutions. And what is new? And what is new? New is the frequency of the correction. The frequency of corrections needs to blow up as well as the frequencies of rotation, right? Ujk are two pi-periodic solutions, and in the expression qjk of t, you have ujk evaluated at nu multiplying to t. So nu is the frequency of the correction. So we normalize the frequency. So we normalize the frequency to 2œÄ in the functions jujk, and we obtain parameters. Parameters are rj, which is the radius of the cluster, omega j, which is the frequency of rotation of the cluster, nu, which is the frequency of the correction, right? And then theta j's. Theta j's represent how do you orient the central configurations respect with each other. Prospect with each other. Can I ask a question, please? Yes. So I'm trying to understand your theorem here. So what does your theorem say if you have three vortex filaments or three clusters of vortex filaments? If non-degeneracy properties are correct, is that you can divide each one of vortex filaments by another set of KJ vortex. Another set of KJ vortex filaments, which are going to be arbitrarily close. So, what is KJ here? If you take three, three. You can choose it. You can choose it. You can choose K1 equal to one, K1 equal to two, and K3 equal to three, or four, or six, or seven, whatever you like. Okay? Yeah, um, I have a question as well. Yes, so if I'm understanding correctly, you are saying that uh for any decomposition of n into summation kj, we can find uh so basically you can start with any decomposition of n into summation kj. Yes, yes, okay, yes, okay, yes, yes, okay, now. Okay, now I have some minutes to explain the idea of the proof, right? So we really start with the action of the action functional for the capital N-body problem. What is N? N is the sum of the KJs, right? You decided what KJs do you want to put. And then, so the action is just like that. The first term is kinetic energy. The second term is potential energy. The second term is potential energy. What is phi alpha? Phi alpha is a homogeneous potential such that its derivative is minus one to the r to the alpha. When you want to put alpha equal to two, right, then you have phi of two equal to one over r, which is the gravitational forces. And the other important case is for steady vortex filaments, which is alpha equal to one, which is phi of one. To one, which is phi of one of r is equal to minus logarithm of r because of the logarithm, I cannot write simply phi of alpha one of r to be correct exponent. So the idea in the paper, in the paper, we make three changes of variables, right? But they are condensed in this expression. They are condensed in this expression from going coordinates qjk to coordinates qjk, right? It's condensed in that expression. In the paper, we arrived at that expression after three changes of variables, right? But for the purpose of simplifying the exposition, I'm going to say in this action, in this action, which In this section, which is for coordinates qjk, you make the transformations from coordinates qjk to coordinates ujk. And in the coordinates qjk, you are going to have that the action A is equal to an action A0 plus another action H. And I'm going to explain what is A0 and what is H. So U is going to have components U0, U1. have components u zero u one u n right so what is u zero u zero represents somehow the degrees of freedom of the center of masses of the clusters and u1 un represent the positions seen from the point of view of the center of mass of the cluster right because i am already taking a degree of freedom of the center of mass in the coordinate u zero In the coordinate u zero, right, then the component uj has to have zero center of mass. Otherwise, the system is overdetermined. So components uj are in the space Ej, which is the space of zero center of mass. Now, there are three parameters, Rj, omega j, and nu. So we need to put rj equal to omega j to that x. equal to omega j to that exponent because the action because the action because the action has two terms kinetic energy is a homogeneous of degree two and potential energy is a homogeneous of degree depending on alpha right when you put this relation at j equal to omega j you are able to extract the constant such that in equation four you have that the action a zero is nothing else that else Is nothing else that L0, which is the Lagrangian for the problem of the n-body problem of the clusters, and then Lj, which is the Lagrangian for the Kj body problem for each cluster. And then you obtain Rj to the one minus alpha multiplying the Lagrangian Lj. That's the reason we need Rj being equal to omega j, right? So in equation five, Right, so in equation five, you have the Lagrangian. U0 is the potential of the n-body problem for the clusters, and GJ is the potential for the KJ body problem of the cluster. And Lagrangian five and Lagrangian six are nothing else, like the nothing else than the n-body problem, the Lagrangian for the n-body problem and for the kj body problem in rotating frame. The rotating frame is represented by the five that. Is represented by the fact that you have ds plus j. That j appears because you are in the rotating frame with frequency one. Okay. Now, what is the functional H? Well, the functional H, what represents is the coupling or the interaction, the real interaction of the embody problem. When I neglect H, this. H, this doesn't represent the capital embody problem. When I put H, it represents the capital embodied problem. Now, we need the relations omega j being equal to one plus pj of nu, because the explicit expression is in the paper. It's too long to put it in one slide. But h is going to be the integral of a low case h, and that low case case h depends. Case H depends explicitly on time because I am making changes of variables that depend explicitly on time. So I need the relations omega j being equal to one plus pj of nu because I want that age that depends explicitly on time being two pi periodic in t. So if it's two pi periodic in t, then the action which is a0 plus h is well defined in this in the sovereign space. In the sovereign space of two pi-periodic orbits. So finally, I want to say that we choose nu equal to epsilon minus alpha plus one over two minus one, because I want that when I choose the integer number pj equal to one, I want rj being equal exactly to epsilon, right? And when pj is different than one, rj is a order of epsilon. Order of epsilon. If I choose in that way nu, omega j, and rj, everything depends on epsilon. And depends on epsilon such that epsilon controls uniformly the amplitude of all clusters, because rj, the radius of the cluster, is order of epsilon. So what is going to happen is when epsilon goes to zero, h and the gradient of h and all derivatives of h. And all derivatives of H go to zero with epsilon. So it's order of epsilon that. No, but we started later. Yeah, I have five, seven minutes, right? So what is going to happen? The idea is that I want to find. So I'm going to come back. What is A0? A0. zero h0 is the action for the lagrangian of the m-body problem and the lagrangian lagrangian for the kj body problem so when i take the variation of a zero or the gradient respect with u zero i obtain newton's equations in rotating frame for the n-body problem and the same for the kj body problem so because of that it's going to happen that the gradient of a0 respect with u0 Gradient of A0 respect with U0, right? It is going to have a solution, which is the central configuration for the n-body problem A0, but not only A0, any rotation of A0. And the same thing is going to happen when I take the gradient or the variation of A0 respect with uj. That's going to be the KJ body problem in rotating frame. And it turns out that Aj, central configuration, is going to be a critical. interact configuration is going to be a critical point of a zero respect with uj but not only a j any rotation of a j so the the the functional a0 the functional a zero only a zero my functional a is a zero plus h and a is the action functional for the n-body problem but only for a zero i have an explicit manifold of critical Manifold of critical points, which is a torus of dimension n0 plus one. What is that torus? That torus is made of the arbitrary rotations of the central configuration A0 and the central configuration A1 to A and zero. It's a manifold, critical manifold. And the only question is, what happens with that critical manifold when I perturb it with H, when I include H? With H, when I include H, which is order of epsilon, so small perturbation of A0. So that's that's a strategy. I'm not going to have much time to explain. It's a measure of the size of cluster. Uniform. So what happens is that H actually is S1 invariant. Why is S1 invariant? Because H plus A0 is the end body problem and the n-body problem is invariant on the body problem is invariant on the rotations of everything. So I have a n0 plus a torus of dimension n0 plus one, right, of critical manifolds. And I'm going to perturb it with something which is squad invariant. So my time is almost over. The proof is going to be that the category of the torus n0 is equal to n0 plus one. So I don't have Plus one. So I don't have time to explain it, but basically, what you do is a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. If your central configurations are 2œÄ PGA non-degenerated, which is basically the action A0 is going to blow up. It's going to blow up in different terms. So when you regularize and then you take the limit when epsilon goes to zero, that's a well-defined n-body problem. And then what you need to prove is that the generator. is that the generator of the tangent to the rotations of the of the orbit of rotations of Aj, which is J Aj, is the only element in the kernel. If that happens, basically what you are saying is that you have a torus which is made of critical points and all normal directions, right? All the linearization of the action in the normal directions are Are non-zero. So, if they are non-zero, then you can use implicit function theorem to solve all those normal directions in terms of tangent directions. So, you end with finding critical points of phi epsilon, which is defined only on the torus. And then the category is giving you the existence of n0 plus one solutions. What's the category? This is the minimum number of contracts. Of contractible charts that you need to cover a manifold, that's all, right? In the sphere, it's two. In the torus, two torus is three. And so in the N0 torus, it's N0 plus one. So after you reduce the problem to finding critical points in the torus, then by the category, you have at least N0 plus one critical points. So this is my last slide. Gravitational case. What is the Gravitational case, what is the problem with the gravitational case alpha equal to 2? Well, the problem is that normal directions are not invertible, never. Why they are never invertible? Because for a central configuration, in the case alpha equal to 2, you have homographic, a central configuration generate all the homographic elliptic orbits. So, because you have ellipses, not just circles, then because of that, the normal directions or to the toes are not invertible, right? Toles are not invertible, right? So, what do you do? Well, in the published paper, we can deal with the gravitational case under two assumptions. So, what is a first assumption? Assumption is that the central configuration needs to be symmetric by 2 pi over m rotations in the plane, right? Like what? Like these ones. All of these ones are 2 pi first. Octopi first one is three, second four, and so on. So, all of them occupy over M and there are a lot of configurations like the Maxwell configuration or these spider webs or nested polygons with centers. The second assumption is that we need to divide only the central body, right? The central body. The central body requires a condition which is 2œÄ over m non-degenerated, which is weaker. So, how we prove this theorem? We use the Palais criticality principle to reduce in a subspace of symmetric solutions. And in that subspace of symmetric solutions, we don't see elliptic solutions. That's the idea, right? And we verify that condition for the polygon, regular polygon, K1 polygon, for K1. K1 polygon for K1 from 4 to 1000 using interval arithmetics in lab, MATLAB, right? But we have the algorithm to verify all the non-degeneracy properties that I was speaking about. We have in the paper an algorithm to verify them for the regular polygons. Details at the paper. Thank you. For the case at 5.2, the problem is that you can have this on graphic solutions, which are theoretically used stuff, which bodies moving when you are in a keyboard motion. But if you restrict the motion of just a rotating The problem is that you have normal directions which are degenerated. So we are doing some kind of work in progress, but it is going very slow, which is the key part is that you can consider the manifold not only of circular homographic solutions, but you can consider also the elliptic homographic solutions. The elliptic homographic solutions. The problem is elliptic homographic solutions don't form a compact manifold, right? So you cannot use just the argument of the category to find critical points of the reduce. So you have this, yes, you have this well-defined critical manifold, which is not compact, and then you can reduce to that non-compact manifold. So what you need to do is computating explicitly critical points of that reduced action in that not compact manifold. Not compact manifold, that's something that people do, but we are doing it. We are working on that very slowly. It's a topological invariant. It's topological invariant. Is the minimal number is the minimal. If you have a manifold, is the minimal number in which you can cut the manifold in contractible pieces for the torus tree to torus tree? Okay. And in fact, I have some questions. So the first one is that do you find the relative periodic? relative periodic solution or you find posi periodic solution with multiple frequencies they are they are a relative periodic solutions right they are just periodic solutions in rotating frames the point is that relative periodic solutions have two frequencies because in a rotating frame it's periodic so you have two frequencies So, because of those two frequencies, some of them are quasi-periodic. And actually, in that slide, you see that when ŒΩ is rational p over q, the frequencies omega j are also rational. And because they are commensurable after q winding, so what you are really finding is solutions where the center of mass goes around the origin, q times, and each one of the And each one of the cluster goes around the center of mass of the cluster, q plus pj p times. And what pj is an integer, which can be positive or negative. If the integer is positive, then they rotate in the same direction. And if pj is negative, then you rotate in opposite direction. Do you think it may be possible to find quasi-periodic solutions with multiple frequencies with some IDA momentum? Request with some IDA memento or something like that. I was thinking and trying to do that, but yeah, I was thinking into trying to do that. Yeah, yeah, I was thinking trying to do that. Actually, that's the role of PJs. I mean, if you think about it, what PJs determine is omega j's, but they determine in a commensurable way. Commensurable way. So it's like in the set of omega j's, it's like having lines which parameterize commensurable stuff. Now you have the complement of those lines in the set of omega j's. So in others, omega j's are not commensurable. So what you need is a km procedure. Yeah, I have a trivial comment about this procedure of replace one mass by Or replace one mass by other ones, you say this cabling. Cabling. Cabling. If you take two bodies in a circular equilibrium, circular equilibrium of masses two and one, and you replace mass two by two masses of mass one, then you have the Lagrange equivalent. Yeah, I think so. Yes, but they cannot be very close. But actually, what else? Why do you need to be close in this approach? This approach is approached to prove the existence. But I don't give the existence. I don't need to take existence now. Okay. So the question is, how big you can take epsilon? Yeah. Yeah. So there are no more questions. Okay, thank you. We thank you again. It's probably best time, but uh we are quite late. What time is it to shoot the stuff? I think uh Uh forty eleven eleven forty okay so the family of the copper do you guys hear me?
