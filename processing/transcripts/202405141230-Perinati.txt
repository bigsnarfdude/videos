Equation with this wise smooth coefficient. And as Luis Maurice said, this is our joint work with Herr Andrea Moyola and Paul Stoker. Okay, to introduce the quadi-tract methods, we can start by considering a homogeneous PBE, MU equals zero, in a domain omega, with M being a linear partially. In a linear partial differential operator of order lowercase m and the wave coefficients denoted by alpha j. A test method is a high-gorder Galerkin scheme whose discrete functions are exact solutions of the PD in each mesh element. So we have discrete functions VH that satisfies mvh equals zero element-wise. Element-wise. And this works well for many PDEs that are linear, homogeneous, so that the trust space is a linear space, and PDEs that have piecewise constant coefficients. But if the PDE has varying coefficients, like in many physical applications, in general exact solutions are not known. Hence, the construction of the threat space. Construction of the threat space is not possible. Then the idea of quasi-threat methods is to use, instead of exact solutions, which are not available, use approximate solutions of the PD in each mesh element. Approximate solutions in the sense of Taylor polynomials. So more precisely, we We just require that the Taylor polynomial of some order and centered at some point of MVH is zero. So instead of requiring MVH equal zero, we just require MVH equal to a small rate equal. So if we fix a polynomial degree t and a point x e in the element x e in the element e, which is the center of the Taylor polynomial, we can define a positor space of degree P as the space of degree P polynomials such that the derivatives of mvh vanish in the center of the theoretomial. This up to order p minus m, where p is the polynomial degree and m the order of the partial differential operator. So here we are selecting the polynomials. So here we are selecting the polynomials that are approximate solutions of the homogeneous equation mu equals zero. But if we have a homogeneous equation okay, so if we have a homogeneous non-homogeneous equation, so mu equals F also identified, we would like to extend the definition. We would like to extend the definition of the quasiture space to deal also with inhomogeneous PDE. And we can define the quasiture space Qt F now, instead of Qt 0, as the space of degree P polynomials such that the derivatives of M V H are equal to the derivatives of F in the center of the Taylor polynomial F E up to order P minus M. M. So in Qt0, we are requiring that the Taylor polynomial of MVH is zero, while here we are requiring that the Taylor polynomial of MVH is equal to the Taylor polynomial of F. And the first one is a linear space, while the second one is an assigned space. And both of them are well defined if the PD coefficients alpha j and the right-hand side F are sufficiently smooth. Are sufficiently smooth because here we are talking about strong derivatives. The idea of positrest methods originates from this work where instead of using plane waves, they use generalized plane waves, which are approximate solutions in this sense. And a polynomial positor space, like this one, have been used in this work for the wave equation. Our goal is to extend the definition of the quasiter space. The definition of the quadrature space to a general linear PD with sufficiently smooth coefficients and right-hand side to deal also with inhomogeneous equation, and then apply this to second-order elliptic partial differential equations. So, first, we can start by studying the approximation properties of the quadrature space QTF under the assumption that the DPD coefficient and the right-hand side. The P D coefficient and the right-hand side are sufficiently smooth, we can prove that if the exact solution u is sufficiently smooth, then the Taylor polynomial of degree P, of the exact solution, belongs to the quasitre space of degree P. And this is a fundamental fact because it allows us to prove the H convergence under the assumption that the elements are star-shaped with respect to the center of the Taylor polynomial. The center of the Taylor polynomial. We can bound the best approximation error with the error of the Taylor polynomial that now is a particular quasiter function. And this error can be bounded by using properties of the Taylor polynomial. And we obtain the optimal power of HE, which is the diameter of the element. Note that here we have CP norms instead of HP norms because we are required. Norms because we are requiring a higher regularity. Okay, now we want to construct a quasi-traft functions, and here we require a simple assumption of non-degeneracy on the operator m, so that when we say that the operator is of order lowercase m, at least one of the higher-order derivative has its coefficient that is non-zero in x e. For example, we can. XE. For example, we can choose the derivative of order m with respect to the first coordinate. And to compute a quasitcher function vh that belongs to QTF, since this is a polynomial of degree p, we can write it as a linear combination of scaled and centered monomials. So computing bh is equivalent of computing all coefficients AK of its monomial expansion. Of its monomial expansion. And we can derive this simple relation between the coefficients ak and the derivatives of vh in x e. And if we insert this relation in the definition of the quasi-through space, we obtain these formulas dividing by the non-zero coefficients alpha mt1. Apart from the detail of this formula, the important thing is that relates the coefficient AK. The coefficient AK and depends only on the derivatives of S and of alpha J evaluated in XE. So we can evaluate them element-wise. And if we consider the dimension D equals 2, every AK, now K is a multi-index just with two components, K1 and K2. So we can identify this by one of these dots in. Of these dots in the plane. And we can prove that if we know the yellow dot, which we can assign, and they're also called the Cauchy data, then all the others are uniquely determined by those ones. And this is because of this formula, because the red coefficients depends only on the coefficients inside this blue stencil. Inside this blue stencil, and this is the same for all the other coefficients that have their own corresponding stencil, just this one translated. So we can construct an algorithm that proceeds in this order that is shown by the arrow in this figure, that at each step, the coefficient that we have to compute depends only on coefficients already computed in the previous steps or that are known from the Cauchy data. Or that are known from the Cauchy data. So we are actually able to compute them all. And assigning this Cauchy data, so this coefficient AK, it's equivalent to assigning some derivatives of S in the center of the Taylor polynomial. So in general, we can prove that every positive function is uniquely determined by the Cauchy data and hence by this if we assign this. If we assign these values. Now, if M is of order two, for example, like the diffusion adaption reaction operator, we are just assigning the derivatives of order zero, so VH, fixed the first coordinate of the barycenter. So we are assigning a polynomial of degree p that has one variable less. And this corresponds to assigning the first columns of coefficients. First, columns of coefficients, which are p plus one in one variable left, less. And if r is equal to one, then we are assigning a polynomial of degree p minus one in one variable less. And this corresponds to assigning the it's not working. Sorry. The second uh column of the coefficients, which are uh p, so we are assigned a polynomial of uh degree p minus one in one d in this case. Okay, okay, for the Galerkin scheme, we will need to compute a basis for the space qt0, so the linear one. And if m is equal to two, we can choose a two polynomial basis. polynomial basis one for the polynomial of degree p in r d minus one and the other for polynomial of degree p minus one in r d minus one and we can construct a quasi trest basis simply by considering two sets of functions the first one we assign the first column in accordance to the red basis that we can choose and the other zero and the second The other zero, and the second set is the opposite. So these are all zero, and the second column is chosen accordance to this green basis. Then we will also need to compute an approximate particular solution, but this is just a quasi-trace function, so we can choose whatever Cauchy data we want, for example, all zero, and we can compute a particular quasi-track function. And we can also prove. And we can also prove now that we have a basis that the dimension of the quasi-charge space is much smaller than the dimension of the full polynomial space of the same degree equal. So we have the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom. Okay, now yeah, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. So now we can consider the diffusion of vection reaction boundary value problem. So we have the diffusion advection reaction equation in a domain omega. We allow the Uchle and Neumann boundary conditions. K is the diffusion matrix. We assume that is symmetric and satisfy the ellipticity condition. Beta is the advection vector and sigma the reaction scalar and f is the source therapy. And F is the source term. And under some standard hypothesis, we know by Lux Milligram that there exists a unique weak solution U. And now we want to approximate this weak solution. So we can mesh the domain with a polytopic mesh. We assume that the mesh is graded and a uniform star shapeness of the elements. And we can choose any discrete space VH, which is a subset of the broken. Subset of the broken polynomial space of degree P. And the DG variational formulation reads like this. We want to find UH in the discrete space VH such that this variational equation is satisfied for all test functions VH in the discrete space. We use a symmetric interior penalty method for the diffusion part. So we have a penalty. Part. So we have a penalty parameter gamma strictly greater than zero and also KF, which is a diffusion-dependent penalty parameter. And for the advection reaction term, we employ an upwind DG method. So for the analysis, we can define the following mesh-dependent norms, in particular the DAR norm and the DARF star norm, which is a strong. Star normal, which is stronger, and we mainly follow Diploduran and Riviera. The DG method is consistent. We have the discrete percivity with respect to the DAR norm if the penalty parameter is sufficiently large, and the continuity with respect to the DAR star norm and the DAR norm. And hence, we have the well-posedness of the problem and the quasi-optimality inequality. So, the DAR norm of the Inequality. So the dar norm of the error is bounded by the best approximation error in the stronger norm. And of course, this depends on the choice of VH. And now as a discrete space VH, we want to choose the positive space. So locally, we consider QTF on each element, which is defined as before at the beginning. Just now the operator is the second order partial differential operator. They're a partial differential operator. So, and these conditions are imposed up to degree p minus two, because it's of order two. And as a global space, we consider the product. Here, we are requiring a higher regularity for the coefficients, okay, beta and sigma, and for the source term f. And then the quasi-trapped DG method is like this: we want to find the UH in QTF, so the affine. So, the affine space broken, such that the variational equation is satisfied for all test functions in Qt0. We can't directly apply the DG analysis since we have different tests and trial phases, but we can apply a homogenization strategy so we can fix element-wise approximate particular solution. So, just quasi-traps function UHF. function UHF in Qt F. And then this problem is equivalent to find a UH0 now in Qt0 such that and we basically split the UH in UH0 and UHF and then we can apply the digital analysis to this problem. So there exists a unique UH0 and we recovered the existence of UH and the unique since this discrete problem. Since this is a discrete problem, and we can also derive the quasi-optimality in the same manner as before. So, now from the quasi-optimality inequality and the quasi-trust approximation properties, we can deduce the optimal convergence rates in H of the method. And this is the main advantage of this method: that we can have the same convergence rates in H as with a standard DG with a standard. As with standard DG with full polynomials, but much fewer degrees of freedom. Now we can show some numerical experiments. This is a non-homogeneous example. So we have a right-hand side, which is k beta and sigma smooth and rhyme, and the exact solution u, which is smooth in the unit cube. And here are shown the H convergence. The H convergence, the first figure in the DAR norm and here in the L2 norm. And for P equals 2, 3, and 4. And we see that here we have H to the power of P and here H to the power of P plus 1. Okay, now if we fix H, for example, H equal to 0.1, and we let the P vary, we can consider the number of degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom and the error, and compare the quasiter space and the full polynomial space. And, for example, if we want to reach a fixed accuracy, we can see that with the quasiter space, we are using less degrees of freedom. And we also compare the timings, and we can see that we are beating the standard DG with full polynomials. We also treat advection-dominated problems like this one. We have no reaction, the source term F is zero, and beta is the advection that is varying. And the K, the diffusion, is a constant, it's just the identity matrix time constant, which is here: 10 to the minus 1, 10 to the minus 2, 10 to the minus 3, and 10 to the minus 4. So a problem, more and more advection we need. Problem more and more advection. These plots are made using a mesh size h equal to 2 to the minus 4 and the positor space of degree p equal 3. And we can see that we obtain good results similar to standard DG with full polynomials, for example, in the approximation of this internal layer. Here, the choice of the penalty, one needs to be careful because if the penalty is too If the penalty is too big, then it's like imposing the continuity across elements. And hence, it's like using standard Galaxy. So for this kind of problem, it's not working. But if the penalty is too small, then we don't have the discrete perceivity. So it's also a problem. And to conclude, these are some possible future developments. Development, the optimization of the Cauchy data that we can choose, so maybe choose a better basis, a non-polynomial quasi-trap function, maybe to approximate better boundary layers or internal layers, then the p-convergence and the extension to less labor solution, these are more difficult. And we want also to try to approximate the solution of PDEs. Approximate solution of PDs that change nature in the domain, like the Euler Tricomi equation. And the code is implemented both in MATLAB and in NGSolve. And we've prepared for you an NGSolve notebook that you can try this afternoon in the PAL section. Thank you very much for the attention. Thank you. So, do we have any questions in the room or could you go back to the slide where you have this yellow zone where you pick everything and then everything is determined from there? Yes. Is there this one? Yes. Is there a reason why you pick it in that way? Reason why you pick it in that way? Is there some freedom how to pick it? Uh, the the you mean the two first columns, yeah. You could, you could, maybe you could pick the vertical column and the horizontal column. That's exactly the same amount of dots, but that might influence some stability or something. Okay, no, we pick those two because of this non-hypothesis of non-zero. So, if you here consider as non-zero coefficients, the one relates to the derivative of Relates to the derivative of order m with respect to the first coordinate, you have to choose those two. If you pick like the first derivative with respect to the other axis, you have the same, but with those two column of values assigned, so yellow, and then you move in this way. Okay, and the reason is in this formula. So, if you think that this This formula. So, if you think that this holds true for all i, which is a multi-index that starts from zero, you have that you can start computing basically from m e1. So the first index cannot be less than m. Now, this is m equal to. So, you cannot compute this with this formula, so you assign those. Thank you. We have a lot of questions here in the room. Sorry, I got surprised. I thought Bruno, who you would ask about the non-zero right-hand side. I know you're interested in that. You will be up you will have more questions over lunch, I think. Questions over lunch, I think. Okay, then in this case, I guess we can think the speaker again.
