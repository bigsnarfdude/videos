Thank you very much. First of all, I want to say thanks to the organizers. I'm very glad to be here. And this is a very, very, very brief talk without the technicalities. This is aimed to the young people, so it's going to be fast. I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about this type of generators. I'm going to talk about some results that, in some sense, are very related or very similar to those obtained by people as Paññola, Rebolledon, and others. Okay. The simplest model of a logo. The simplest model of low density limit type is a free BOSE gas perturbed by a quadratic interaction. We consider a particle S and a free BOSE with environment E. So we have the system, the particle sector, the gas, and the interaction. Word interaction is this that models. That models this simplest collision between a particle, the particle in the particle, the sample particle and a particle of the gas. When two particles, one particle of the gas and the particle of the system collides, they are uh they give arise a lot of uh transitions. Is a lot of transitions which are modelled by the operator D. Because the operator D is that will give us the transitions. This is the creator and this is the annihilator operators. And the master equation, after to take the limit, is of this form where we Where we can separate into the commutative part and the dissipative one. Here I have a mistake, it must be row, where the effective Hamilton has this form, where the set of P M, as always, is the set of projection into the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian of the system. Of the Hamiltonian of the system. With this symbol, with the denotes the partial trace. N is the multiplication operator in momentum representation by this positive function, which denotes the density of the particles with momentum k. In this operator, the T or scattering operator describes the scatterings between the test particles with the one particle of the gas. The one particle of the gas. One of the biggest differences between the weak coupling limit type and the low density limit type generators is the set of bore frequencies, which in this case is this set. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can go back. I don't know why. I can go back. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I was telling you, in this case, the set of bore frequencies consists in all the difference between the H. Between the agent values in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the system, even the zero-ball frequencies that play a role, very important role in this type of generators in contrapositions to the Wikoplane type generators. With this in mind, we defined, we introduced this kernel for the scattering operation. For the scattering operator, where this symbol means precisely this, where these are of the agent values. This way, we denote the agent values, excuse me, the agent vectors of the agent vectors of HS, this silver space, and this is the agent. And this is the agent value, and k is the momentum of the particle of the gas. So the generator has this form that is very different as we have seen this integral form, but we can recognize here the anti-commutator, and this is a positive part. So I'm going to present some results that certain things are analogous to those obtained for the width coupling limit type generators. Of course, the relations between the generator and its pre-dual is given by this duality relation from which we can obtain the action of the. The action of this type of generators in an element of the V of yeah, it's correct. We can get this. First of all, the first result is the following. Okay. Expanding the book expression, we can get this. This suggests that we can decomposite this generator as assume of generators. We have this proposition. In the generic case, the generic case means that for each more frequency. Board frequency, it can be obtained by taking the difference of only one part of one pair of the agent values of the Hamiltonian system. Of course, we obviously bore frequency zero because in general, this ball frequency has infinite the The generosity. Well, we can prove that each one of these generators can be rewritten in the GKSL form where this cross operator has this form, where this color has is defined by this expression. But in the case, Case where omega is equal to zero, the expression is as follows, it's very different as usual way. But we can see that it's equivalent to this expression. So, as we seen above here, it is the sum of a complete. Completely positive, conditional and completely positive operator plus this that is completely positive. This one, excuse me. This one is completely positive. And so of a condition that completely positive, therefore, this generator by this sub. Generators, but this operator is conditionally completely positive, and also it can be easily checked that the identity belongs to its kernel and enjoys this property. It follows that also the L-dissipative part corresponding to the bore frequency zero is a markup generator. In general, the act of the generator is in this way. And we proceed as follows, as is common, we separate an operator or a state on its diagonal part in the diagonal part. So we define the diagonal part as the function of the Hamiltonian. Part as the function of the Hamiltonian. And through this linear map, we defined the off-diagenogal space. So we have also defined these numbers as they assume of the numbers defining above. Let me recall what is the value of p. What is the value of P is this? So well, uh first, the generator lips invariant in the diagonal algebra. Diagonal algebra, as we can see in this computation, and also Libs invariant in the off-diagonal subspace. And the action of one element on the off-diagonal is of this form, and the action on one element in the diagonal part has this form. Furthermore. So that's all no, no, no. Excuse me. Okay. This speller has real parts negative. As it shows in this inequality, and this is a condition for the Markov generator to be bounded, is that this sum is finite. Also, the generator can be written in this form that is the standard form, thus a completely positive. A completely positive operator where the operator, the generator, well, this operator G, defined as above, generates strongly continuous semi-groups. For studying the invariant states, we center our attention in the visual semi-group that, due to the prospositions above, has this form. About as this form. And also, we know that the prison generator Lips invariant, the diagonal algebra, also the off-diagonal sub-algebra. No, no, no. The off-diagonal, it is not a sub-algebra. It's a linear space. Furthermore, the action of the The action of the generators, the perisal generator is of this form, where we project that the real part of this scalar is negative, so that the evolution of the one element of this form goes to zero when t goes to infinity. So only in the generic case, the states invariance are. The states invariants are diagonal or belongs to the diagonal algebra. The principle acts in a diagonal limit in this way that is very similar to the expression obtained for the generators of weak coupling limit type. We have some results. As the summability of this sum for an element to be in the domain of the generator. Also, this is a necessary condition for the state to be invariant, is that this equality to be satisfied for all E. Well, this is the, of course. Of course, we can see that we can define the table lines when this difference is equal to zero. I'm not going to talk about this because Lupita is going to talk about this. So, for my part, it's solved. That's all. I will stop here. But can you go back a few when there was the sum the integral on dec dk prime here but do you? Do you really need to leave the integral, or since omega k, omega k prime are something in a discrete set, you could write a sum? No, I can because I don't know how to take out this scalar, but if you look in the previous uh expression. Look in the previous expression, we can rewrite it this part in this way where we can see is the zoom in this way. Ah, okay, okay, okay, thanks. I think it is more clear. This is completely possible in that. Let's thanks, speaker again.
