Thank you for organizing this very nice interesting event, especially for gathering people who have different interests. And I think it has been inspiring for me. Usually when I give a talk about this topic, about vegetarian or metroids or logical times, I start by praising the beauty of metroids and the interactions with other fields, especially computer science. But I think here everyone is convinced, so I don't need to. Everyone is complex, so I don't need to spend too much time to maybe I just tell you that my personal interest in the theory is related to asymptotic coach theory, so this is a topic I have been working for some time now. And metro is appear also in that setting from a different perspective in order to give you a description of symptoms of geometric quantities associated to complex manifolds. So it's a misconception. So, it's a mystery for me how this is related. So, this is we are using. So, in this conference, people are interested in using Roger to prove theorems and combinatorics, but it seems that combinatorics we can use it to prove things in complex theorem treatment. So, I'm really enthusiastic about these interactions and so on. So, the topic I'm going to present to you is part of an ongoing research with Matthio Pitores. Maybe he's Peterz, maybe he's he couldn't come here, but he's maybe in the following talk on that. So, this is part of a bigger project where, of course, we were inspired by the work of Karim, June, Eric, and wanted to understand what is this search area, how this is related really to the geometry of some compact things, and is it possible to generalize it, and so on. So, this part of the thing was really. So this part of the thing was really the beginning, so we wanted to understand what is exactly the content of this. And it turns out to be also crucial for everything that we did afterwards. So I would like to put the different citations of Hodge theory for different showings into a little bit bigger picture and give you a presentation a proof of the track header properties for the larger class of fans including Bergman. Larger class of fans, including Bergmutt fans, Ormonted Bergmut fans, I can see, by some recipe that we hope could be used also in other contexts. So I will take the time to present you the things, so please do not hesitate to stop me if there's a question. It should be, my objective is to present you the ideas of the this book. At the end of my talk, I will comment on the connection to this bigger picture of coach theory. Picture of coach theory, larger class of tropical manifolds. So let me start by saying you what is this. So this is the first part of the talk, tropical fans. So we saw, I mean, the name fans was mentioned for most of the talks. So let me just give you the definition of a fan. So a fan. So I'm going to choose to fix vector 3 and vector. To fix real vector space Rn. The lattice is Fn. So Fn is a collection, a finite collection sigma of cones. So these are cones inside Rn, which are rational. It's a finite collection, and this finite collection should have these two properties. First of all, if you take two elements, two cones inside sigma, then the intersection of these two cones. Pones should be a common phase of the two points. And the second property is that if you have a cone sigma inside sigma and you take a face toe of sigma, face, then toe is also inside C. Okay, so maybe I mean since I'm a little bit jet lagged, I started with the second. So this is That I started by the second. So, this is first of all, when you say that if you have a cone, the interfaces of this cone are also in your collection. And if you have two cones, then the intersection should be a common face. So, maybe I give examples. So, the examples, so if you take a polytope, normal fans or polytopes are normal fans, they verify this property. Maybe something which would be one of these normal fans is the normal fan of the interval, which is this, which I Which is this, which is the fan of the projective line. And you can use a lot of fans. So these are fans. So they have connection to, I mean, they provide basic examples of algebraic varieties. I mean, this is probably the first interaction between combinatorics and algebraic geometry, because you can use fans to construct uh algebraic varieties. So if you have questions you want to study, you basically use combinatorics. You basically use combinatorics to construct examples and check on the examples and a lot of things you can run in a combinatorial way. So, but by tropical fans, I would mean a fan which is a little bit more structured. So, let's say sigma is a fan. So, you can associate to this a dimension, which is the maximal dimension of the cone, which is inside sigma. So, let's say d is the dimension of sigma. Okay, so a tropical fan is a fan, it should be a fan, but it has this extra structure. So, this is the weight, which is defined on the space of d-dimensional cones and with values inside z. Okay, so this is the rate function. So, this is the rate function which associates to each top-dimensional cone inside sigma, a rate, and it should verify the balancing condition. Balancing condition. This balancing condition is crucial. So, first of all, I don't, so I mean, so in order to you can suppose that every cone, every cone inside sigma d is takes a takes, the weight associated with this is non-zero, so I remove zero. So, this is the weight, and the balancing condition we already saw it. I just want to draw a picture. So, I like to use colors, so I mean. I like to use colours, so let me just uh so this but the balancing condition tells you that if if you have uh toe, a control, which has dimension d minus one, if you look at all the d-dimensional forms that you see around toe, here for example you have and then what you can do is that you can look at uh so you take a point inside toe and then you look at uh the the vector. Look at the vectors which point inside each of the columns. So this is this code. If you do the sum of omega sigma and sigma 2, so by adding the weight, by taking the rate, So by adding the rate, by taking the weighted sum of these vectors, then you get a sum vector which is parallel to tau. And this n sigma tau is a vector, is a lattice vector, is an element of the d which generates the integer points, the lattice generated by integer points inside sigma, if you know the integer lattice inside this two. So this is the only vector you need to add to the integer vectors in tau to generate everything integer inside C. Okay, so this is the balancing condition. It tells you that here you go. The balancing condition tells you that here you add them up, you get something which is balanced. So, your like green vector is somehow for that face, right? Sorry? This one? Yeah. This one here is red, so you won't see it. It's here, it's coming to me. So you're allowing negative uh I'm allowing negative. The things I'm going to talk to to I tell you work I will tell you w where the uh positivity you have to import it, but some part of the things work for negative. Some parts of the things work for negative objects. Okay, so maybe I'll give you the definition, the formal definition of the local fan. So this is a fan sigma, which is pure dimensional and which comes with a rate. So it's the data of a pair sigma rate omega from sigma b. Of sigma d to z minus zero, which has which verified balance information. Okay, for me, tropical fan is maybe I give you an example of tropical fans. I already gave examples, so normal fans are these examples. You can see these are appropriate fans. I didn't have to specify weights here. The weights here is one. You can put one. Here is one. You can put one, one, one. Here you can put two if you like. Normal fans, you can put the same rate. So it is a constant rate. It can't be negative. But so in the setting we are interested in, so this we have a metric and you can associate with this Pergman fan. The fan which lives inside R over E. So E is the ground set of the metric, but you have to. So, E is the ground set of the metric, but you have to kill the vector 111. You also have the augmented variant fan, which is inside RD. And it turns out that these are tropical fans, and usually you put rate equal to one. So, if you have the possibility to pay rate equal to one, you usually do this. But in the things I'm going to describe, sometimes. But in the things I'm going to describe, sometimes you need uh to I mean if you have you can allow to have rates which are not equal to one. Is there any question about the definition of tropical fans? But uh but of course you can construct, okay, so I so we will see a lot of examples, I mean a way, a recipe to construct tropical fans. Okay, but the basic examples are this one here and normal fans and also this this. Or a regiment on the metroid. So I think, yeah, if you are interested in just the interior of metroids, these are somehow the important propagatives. Okay. So now I would like, so for now you see, I mean, these are the Bergmann fan is a fan, so it's a compactible space. So, I mean, if there was a way to associate a homology, develop a homology theory, it should be, everything should be somehow trivial. But it turns out that there is this nice geometric context. There is this nice geometric object, algebraic object that you can associate to this fan, which is called the Charing. So, this is Chauring of Flands. And I am especially interested in tropical plants. So, this charring is the charring of the, if you have, if the weights are equal to one, in the case you have a tropical fan, this charing is the charring of the corresponding toric fan. Is the charing of the corresponding toric variant. But it turns out that, as Federico mentioned in the talk, so there is a nice way actually to present this charing in terms of generators and relations. And basically, you can completely forget about the existence of some algebraic varieties. So everything you can do, everything I'm going to tell you, you can do it by looking, by working with generators and relations. Everything. Every proof which in this picture, so everything can be done really by just using this this presentation. Using this this presentation of choring in terms of generators and relations. So, if you so sigma here is the fan. So, starting from now, I will assume that my fans are all unimodular. So, unimodularity is essential somehow to get some of the geometric properties. You can relax unimodularity to being simplicial, but if you want to do it for more general funds, it's related to all. Fans, it's related to other aspects that I probably mentioned at the end of the talk. But for now, suppose I simplify, I assume that sigma is a unimodular fan, then you can associate with this sigma, its charge. Maybe I just write the definition of the charing here. So I don't, so this is the charring. So let's say we are working with Q coefficients. So this is, for each ray of the family associated variable, so you take the value of the variable Of the family associated variables. So you take the polynomial algebra generated by these variables and you put two types of relation. Okay, so these are ideals and they have different behavior. So this ideal i is the standard Reisner ring. It's a standard Reisner relation. So if you take the quotient Relation. So if you take the quotient of this by this idea, you get the standardized ring of the fan, and J is the linear relation. So this is really the part which makes the connection to algebraic geometry somehow. I mean, of course, this is also, but this is already known, used by combinatorics, but so this, you add this, somehow you add the theory of theory of, okay, I will talk about Meromorphic functions at some point, so you add the theory of Meromorphic functions. points you add the total homomorphic functions into the relationship so linear relations okay so what is this what are these so this these ones are correspond to taking products of variables associated to rays such that rho one rho k do not form a curve and these linear relations are of the form are of the form and the sum of some linear so if you think the linear function m You fix a linear function m. You can assume that this linear function is integral. And then you just, what you do is that you just take m, you evaluate at the primitive vector of the ray row. So here you have this ray. You take the general... So all the cones are rational. So this ray is rational. It has a smallest integer vector. You evaluate the linear function on that generator, and then you just put this as a coefficient of x. Put this as a coefficient of x rho. And this linear, this j is the ideal generated by all these relations, these polynomials of degree one for m varying among linear functions. Okay, so it turns out that this rig has a lot of nice properties. And as I said, all these properties you can prove it combinatorially. And usually, you, I mean, the proofs, if you want to do everything combinatorily, the proofs are nice, so you need to use all the. So you need to use all the techniques, combined techniques you know to prove these results. So let me just mention three of the basic properties of this ring. First of all, this is a graded ring. It means that you can write it in the form A0 plus A1. So, and this is because all the relations that you see here are homogeneous. So, if you start with some kind of ring, the relations are homogeneous. The relations are homogeneous, so in Cauchy, you get a homogeneous ring. The second property is that, so the ring is as a group generated by square free monomials. So it means that every so basically each element in AK, if you fix the AK, each element If you fix a k, each element, you can write it as a sum, as a linear combination of monomials which do not have a squares. So it's just products of x rows, different distinct k for k rays row. And of course, because of this relation, these rays should form a cone. So basically, the k board is generated by k-dimensional cones inside the path. So this did as a consequence of this, you get that you cannot go uh above dimension D. Above dimension D, because you don't have higher dimensional comps inside your fan. And the last thing is that this omega, which was the weight function associated to this tropical fan, gives you a degree map which goes from AD to Q. Actually, it goes to Q coefficients to simplify. So what is this map? So, what is this map? So, you know that the elements of A D are linear combinations of products of X rows for rows forming a D-dimensional cone. So, if you take a D-dimensional cone inside sigma, then you look at the products of X-row for rho array of sigma. And this degree map sends this monomial to the weight of the Of the conceivable. So it's a very simple map, but of course, the idea here is that you have put a lot of relations. So this, I mean, the content of this is that this is well defined somehow. So you just define it on these ones, and the relations are consistent. So it goes to the quotient. The quotient of the k-th part by relations. Okay, so now I would like to state some of the geometric. To state some of the geometric properties that we would like to have for this charing. So, if this charing was the converging ring of some complex, some smooth projective complex variety, we would expect this to verify these properties. And the rest of my talk will be to give you a recipe, as I said, to construct fans which verify these properties. For geometry, so first of all. So for this is what I made this way. This jarring is graded, you can call it it this way, and it has a degree map which goes from AD to Q. First of all, if you have a homology associated to this is this Is this property that if you take an element, if you take the pairing between the k part of the charring and the v minus k part of the charing with using q and this pairing is defined by taking alpha eta and sending this to the degree of alpha times beta. So you take the product, you end up being inside AB, and then you apply the degree mark. So the point correct the oddity tells you that this is a perfect pairing. It puts That this is a perfect pairing, it puts into duality the k part of the charring and the d-monous k part of the charing. This is perfect. So the other two properties which come from complex geometry, if you had some nice complex varieties, are these two properties, hard left sheds and for Drimon. So I put them together, and so this is this. So, this is the hard defense property tells you that if actually you can construct an isomorphism between these two. So, from this, you get that they have the same rank over q. As vector space over q, they have the same dimension. But actually, you can put an isomorphism between these two by multiplication by some specific elements. So, let me write it this way. For some elements L inside A1, and these are called Lefschetz elements. So you start with an element which has degree K, you take your element which is in A1, you take its power D minus 2K power, you take the product of your element with this element, you end up being inside uh ins inside the d degree d minus k part of the chariot. D minus k part of the jarine. And the hard left shape property tells you that you should get an isomortis anymore. Of course, here you have to say what are the left shape elements. And the whole drimon that I don't specify, it tells you that actually. So if you have this property, then you can, because of the degree map, you can also define a bilinear form on AK times AK to Q. So you can define a symmetric bilinear form on the K ball. A symmetric bilinear form on the k-port of the drawing, and this is defined by sending AB to the degree. So you take the product of A and B, you go to degree 2K, and then you use the Lefschetz element over D minus 2K to end up being inside the DWD part of the jargon. And you calculate its degree, so you get. And you calculate its degree, so you get, yeah, this is the map which sends AB to this number inside Q. And the Hodge-Riemann relations give you the signature of this. So I don't specify it, but so hard-left shapes and Hodge-Riemann are somehow the essence of Hodge theory covering the geometry of complex varieties. And we would like to have these geometric properties, or to have a way to prove these geometric properties for some specific tropical fields. Tropical heat. So you see that the definition of the charge was not used, was not using the weight. The only place where I'm using the weight is these debris maps. So I use the weight to get the debris map and then to be able to state these properties. And I didn't say what are the leftshets elements. So the left sheets elements. Commit. Yes. Can you? Yes. Okay, so the degree map, so okay, so maybe I just rewrite it here. So this is a map which goes from AD to Q. Okay? So by this property, you know that AD is generated by square three monomials. But by the definition of the draw ring, if you have a square free monomial in X row, the corresponding rows should form a D-dimensional group. Rows should form a D-dimensional code. Okay? So it means that this AD is generated by X sigmas, which are defined by taking the product of X rho for rho ray of C. So here sigma is in sigma. By this property, you get that this monomial generate AD. And now the degree map just sends this monomial to the weight of the. monomial to the to the to the weight of the corresponding I'm not putting this I mean of course of course if you have the draw duality you will get the isomorphism but it's not part of the I mean you don't see it yet okay so what I'm saying is that what I'm saying is that we would like I mean I haven't said what is the fan I haven't said what I would what I want to prove I just stated some of the geometric properties you would like to have if there was a garage theory for in the tropical setting for tropical fans that's ideal For two records. That's like the idea. Okay, so but now I would like to tell you: so, for this, for the definition of the Poincaré equality, you don't need to assume that the weights are positive, as it was mentioned. So, if you have a weight function which gives you the balancing function, you can estate. For this one, you need to say what are the hard left shape, what are the left shape elements. And it turns out that the ones which are coming from geometry Which are coming from geometry. Maybe I'll just tell you what is. So L inside A1 of sigma, usually, so usually the left sheds. So these are associated to convex functions. Okay, and convex functions, so strictly convex functions on sigma. On sigma. So these are functions. I mean, what is a strictly convex function on the fan? This is a conewise linear function. So on each cone, you have a linear function. And you should have the convexity, the convexity property, that if you take any cone inside your sigma, you get the, you can. Okay, so basically what we want is that we want to have the property that if you take the graph of your function, then there's a supporting hyperplane which puts the graph. Plane which puts the graph above this support hyper plane. So that's, I mean, you have to make this precise, but this is really the essence of the convexity. But since, so, so, I mean, if omega is positive or omega is negative, this is the right definition of convexity. So this is the one it should. But if omega is mixed, there should be, I mean, I mean, I think there should be some, at least in the setup I'm going to. At least in the setup I'm going to describe, there should be probably the notion of complexity, which allows you to also have the hodge package for the case where the weights can take positive and negative values. This is a question we don't know how to answer. But for now, for the rest of the talk, if I'm talking about hard depths for Dreamer, I assume that the weights which appear in the tropical fan are In the tropical fan, are all positive. So, if you have it for this, you also have it, you have it also for negative. But there should be some setup which allows you to also handle the in this case. And this is somehow realistic from the geometric point of view, where tropical varieties appear as limits of cycles, complex currents. Okay, so is there any question about the geometrics? About the choring. So it was a little bit fast, but I assume that. So since we saw already in many talks the definition of the choring, I mean, I did it fast. So from now, starting from now, I would like to tell you how you can, what are the fans actually. So the question is, what are the tropical fonts which satisfy this geometry? The question. And I'm going to give you a recipe to construct a large class of. A recipe to construct a large class of fans, and a lot of fans that we saw in during the talks fit into this feature. If you have the concurrent duality, you would because the zero is q, okay? This implies then that the weights must be constant, because otherwise it would not be. No, because I mean usually. No, because I mean usually if omega is not constant, the rates are not constant, they can vary. Just means that they're going to be one. X sigma maps to omega x sigma, right? The end of that sentence is messing with x sigma. Ah, yes, this is maps. This maps to omega sigma, which is an integer number. Okay, so colour are multiple. So if the rates are different, then you have to, I mean, if you want. Are different, then you have to. I mean, if you want to have a generator of this, in the case of concurrent probability, you have to take sigma divided by the weight. It gives you the canonical generator. Okay, so I mean, for now, we haven't proved anything. I just stated the terror that we would like to speak to. Okay, so and so this is the third part of the. So, this is the third part of the talk. I'm going to, so this is a recipe. I'm going to give you a set of operations that you can do on tropical fans. And basically, the idea is that every tropical fan, which can be constructed by using only these operations, will verify this job. Operations on tropical fans. So these are three basic operations that you can do on tropical fans. And they have the property that they produce you tropical fans. So you always stay in the category of tropical fans, you don't go out. And it turns out that they are simple operations and they allow you to prove. If you have a tropical fan which is constructed using these operations, they are simple enough to allow you to prove by induction that you have the three properties. Have the three properties that are stated. The first one. What is maybe someone can tell what is the most basic operation that you can imagine on fans? Depending on a higher dimensional ambience mess. So that is a good suggestion. But it turns out that actually the only thing But it turns out that actually the only thing you need in this world, in this parameter, is just to know what are the linear functions. Yes. So it means that if you take another embedding, you get the same linear function, so you don't try and change the refinement. But there is one basic more basic operation, which is for doctors. Yeah, generally. I would like to have, I mean, I think what you are saying is that you take the identity back and then you take the growth. Exactly. And the idea is you are there with the waiting. This is the more crucial for the job to say. But I think there's a more basic situation that you can do on topical files, on any files actually, which allows you to go up in dimension. And this is the product. I think this is the basic, the most. And this is the product. I think this is the basic the most basic operation you can do on geometry corpus. So what is the product? What is the product? You have two fans, sigma one and sigma two. You take the products. And the cones which appear here are obtained by taking the cone here, the cone here, and taking the products. So this will be embedded inside Rn1 times Rn2. If this is embedded in Rn1, this is embedded in Rn2, this will be embedded in R1. One, this is embedded in R2. This will be embedded in the product. It is a fun because you can verify that this cons verify the product is a first. But then the claim is that if you have weight function omega 1, omega 2, you can define weight function on the product. And this, I will denote it this. So this should be defined on sigma 1 times sigma 2, the dimension, the top dimension. So sigma 1 has dimension d1, sigma 2 has dimmed dimension. Sigma 1 has dimension d1, sigma 2 has dimension d2, so d is equal to d1 plus d2. And the claim is that here you get, you can define an actual weight function. What is this rate function? Border. It's a product. And you can check that it's easily checked that it verifies the binary sequence. So this is really the basic operation, the most basic operation you can do on photo fans. The second one is the refinement, as well as suggested by your idea. So, and refinement is these subdivisions and the inverse operation to subdivisions, which is called okay. I was going to say it's how do you call it. It's called the assembly. Star assembly, you know, I mean. Star assembly. I mean, in French, it's called blow-up and blow-down éclatmoire. But I think but I w I mean, blow-up and blow-down are are technologies that are used in uh but sub yeah, in polygraph geometry with subdivisions and the store assembly of course and And the store assembly or code. But since I said that I would like to remain in the category of unimodular fans, but the fans I'm looking at here are all unimodular, yes. Is a star assembly the opposite of a stellar subdivision in particular? Or is it any coarse? No, it's the inverse to exactly. So basically because you want to remain unimodular, the only possibility of subdivision is biocentric subdivision. Okay? And this is the inverse operation. And this is the inverse operation. And the third property, so this is the property which comes from topic cultural methods, and these ones you can do on France. This is called modification. This is the property which allows you to do embeddings, as was displayed, in higher dimension, but changing also the factor. So this is somehow the crucial one. This is quite true because we This is called true because of mutation, eh? And for this I need to do some basic geometry, so I need to do some basic polynomial geometry, but I want also to use some terminology coming from complex geometry because it's really like this. So I'm going to to tell you what is topical modifications. The idea is that you start with the fan sigma, which is embedded inside uh our n. inside our n, and you end up having the fan sigma tilde, which is embedded inside Rn plus 1. So you go up and you have changed the fan. But the crucial property, as I will explain, is that you don't change the charging. So this is somehow the interesting. This is the interesting property of this tropical modification. So let me tell you what is this modification. It's very interesting because it allows you to keep the property of the charins, but changing. Property of the charings, but changing the fan. Okay, and it allows you to somehow construct more interesting fans out of the fans that we had already. So, first of all, I have to do how you do modifications. For this, I should tell you what are the Meromorphic functions. So, they are associated with the tropical modification, the underlying data to the tropical modification is the Meromorphic function on the file. So, the Meromorphic function, the space of Meromorphic function on the fan. The space of air function on the fraction. I think I'm using terminology coming from complex geometry, but you have already seen what this means. It has been used also in other talks. What is this? So this is the space, by definition, this is the space of functions which are defined on the support of the fun with values inside R. So the first property then is that this function should be continuous. Continuous. And the second property is that if you take for any code sigma inside sigma, if you take the restriction of f to sigma, you should get a function f sigma which is z linear. So in other words, uh this is just a space of uh colorwise linear functions which are if which are integral. So if they take integer values and integer points. So I think we already spoken. So, I think we already spoke about this. But I call them memorabic functions because I would like to define, to associate to these nominal functions, zeros and poles. And the modification can be associated to looking at zeros and poles of this function. So, the divisor of homomorphic functions, so this idea is that this one is a tropical fun, which is a tropical fan which captures the zeros and poles. I mean the the denotation is maybe too much but I think the definition is very simple so let me just define you what this means. So we start with the trotting card fan so I'm giving the definition of the device So, I'm giving the definition of the divisor of the motor function. You start with a function which is embedded inside Rn. It is consisting of some cons. So here it's an example of a complete fan, but usually it's not. So now you take a function, a meromorphic function on this file. So I would like to define first an order of vanishing function, which is. Order of vanishing function, which is this order f and this is defined on d minus one dimensional point inside sigma and it takes values inside z. So in other words, the zeros on poles of these meromorphic functions, you will look for them inside the k minus inside the sets of d minus one dimensional cones inside z1. side situation. So in this picture I fix a d minus one dimensional column toe and I would like to say what is the order of vanishing of my function, my monomorphic function, f at tau. And the way I do it is the following. I do exactly the picture that I did to define to tell you what is the balancing condition. I will do the same picture here. I take this The same picture here. I take this toe, I look at all the cones of dimension D which are around toe. So here you will see there is this cone which has dimension D. There is this cone. And maybe I just to make it a bit more interesting, I will also add a you add another color. Maybe I I assume that there is there is a ray which comes to me So now what I do I want to define order of vanishings of my meomorphic function at tau what I do is to I will look at again the the vectors n sigma tau that I see around tau which are pointing inside the d minus. Which are pointing inside the D-dimensional columns which contain toll. So here I will have three of these vectors. That's one. And then I define the order of vanishing of f atau by definition. I define it to be minus the sum of all cones sigma, which are in sigma t and such that sigma containing. And such that sigma contains toe. So toe is here, sigma is here. And now what I do is that I know that my function is conwise linear here. So I have the function f sigma, which is defined here. It takes integer values on integer vectors here. So I evaluate f sigma at n sigma 2. And I have to take into account that there is a weight associated to here, so I just take this time, these times. So I just take this time, this times omega. So basically, this is the definition of the order of vanishing. The only problem is that this is not verified because this vector n sigma tau is not verified. So you have to correct, you have to normalize it to get something correct. And this normalization is just maybe I just do x by adding f tau evaluated at the sum of n sigma tau. Sum of n sigma 2 over the same calls. So the idea is that since by balancing condition this vector is inside here, you get a vector which is parallel to tau, so you can evaluate f tau at this one, and it turns out that this one is very defined, it doesn't depend. Out that this one is very defined, it doesn't depend on the choice of these vectors which are pointing inside C. And this is the order of vanishing. So, what I did is that I started with a Meromorphic function. I explained you how you can associate an order of vanishing function on all d minus one dimensional cones of sigma. And now you define this divisor of f. You want to define divisor of f as a tropical fan. It should be a tropical fan. It should have dimension d minus 1 because it's a divisor of a normal function. Because it's a divisor of a normal function. You define it as delta endowed with the order of anti-function. So basically you want to put sigma d minus 1 here, but the problem is that maybe you have order of vanishing which are 0. So you take delta to be the support of the order of anti-so delta is the support. Okay, so now the definition of the tropical notification of orthogonal modification, what you do is the following. You start with sigma. You have a function f, which is the, which goes to R. You take the graph of this function. You take the graph of this function gamma f, and this is inside Rn times R. This sends every point of, this is the set of all points, X, F, X for X inside C. Definition of the graph. This is the graph of F. Okay, so let me just give you a video and example. People that, for example, if you are looking at this one, your function. You are looking at this one, and your function, so it is a you take a graph, it should be the graph of a linear function on each of the codes. So you might get something like this. So this is like the graph of my function. As you see, it's not balanced, it doesn't verify the balancing condition here. But now the idea is that if I add, so if you take this profile and then you do the modification by adding By adding this ray, I think it verifies the valence conclusion. So, to make it completely formal, so first of all, you take the graph of the graph of f and then you add all the for any delta inside delta. So, delta is the support of the order of vanishing function, is this fan, this sub-fan of sigma, which appears in the definition of the divisor. For each delta in delta, you add delta plus or. delta plus R plus E star and E star is the primitive vector of the last coordinate which goes up. This is E star. So for each column, so here this point is my delta because this is the place where the order of vanishing is non-zero. And what I do is that for any cone inside delta, I just add the inside delta I just add the numeric which which comes from okay so add from any cone delta I add delta plus this ray so I get a cone which has dimension one okay so now the idea is that you take the graph of F you add this cone so the graph of F is naturally a fan by adding these ones I get a fan but now the question is is it possible to put a rate an actual rate and the answer is yes because the cons Because the cones, the red cones that you see, which come from sigma, they have their rates. The top-dimensional ones, they have their rates coming from sigma. So on this one, I put the omega of sigma. For all sigma in sigma d, I see a copy of sigma inside the graph. I put the rate of sigma which is coming from sigma. On this new one, on the top-dimensional cones, which are associated with these modified cones, by hand, we are. By handful of variations. So if delta is inside delta d minus 1, it's a top-dimensional core here. I get this code. Maybe I call it delta star. And this is a d-dimensional core, because I'm adding it anyway. On this one, I define the order, the weight of this one, omega tilde. I define it to be the order of validation of f. So to summarize, what I get is the result of these three. What I get is the result of these three operations, these three steps is a fun sigma tilde, which is embedded inside Rn plus one. And it comes with the natural weight function, omega tilde. And it turns out that it's a total function. Is tau delta here? Sorry? Thank you. Okay. Is it uh is it uh how much time I have uh left? Okay, so is this a topical analog of the cannabis graph function? Exactly. So it's this is exactly the Exactly, the truth. I mean, what you do is that you do take a if you from if you are working with a complex manual, you take a meromortic function on the on this, remember the zeros and poles, and you take a graph of this, and you then you do the tropicalization. It's a little bit more complicated than this, but essentially this is this one. I think this appears already in the book by Mohannes. So, the idea is that this is. So, the idea is that this is a tropical time. Okay, well, okay, so maybe I just wrap this definition. So, the geometric objects that will verify the geometric properties that I studied are the tropical plants. Which are called the cedar if so it is a topical fan sigma bipolar if it can be constructed using Using one products. But of course, if you take a product, you want the sigma 1 and sigma 2, which was appearing in the product, to be shadable, products of shadable parts. So this is something which is defined, which you can make sense inductively if you go, if you do inductive analysis. First of all, you start by defining, okay, constructed using these operations, the products of shallow return. Operations, the products of shared returns, subdivisions, and the inverse operations, the store assembly, and tropical modifications. Okay, in the tropical modification, you have you have to be a little bit careful because you have the fan sigma and you have also the divisor of your function f. Okay? So you have to ask both of them to determine to share. Both of them to the share level. Tropical modification in sigma shareable and delta with this order of vanishing of F also shareable. Okay, so see, because so in this picture when we identify drop calcification, you have the sigma, but you also have the delta. So you ask them both of them shared. Okay, so sorry, Abby, I didn't tell you how very start you. I didn't say you how very little start, you're right. Thank you very much. Starting from the most basic front you can imagine, which is this optical line. But that was the most basic operation. This is the most easy. And actually, if you want to get more weights, you can put weights here. So you're in Germany. So this is the starting from the weighted tropical land. Is there a way in which this is shallow base? Or what's going to be? I mean, the idea is that you basically get some shallowity. I mean, you see that it is constructed from... So if you say shallow defense are shallow defense. I think it should be true. I mean, it's not really fancy. I mean. Yeah, I think. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So now I can I can state, maybe give you some examples. Is there any condition in two? Arbitrary or this is completely arbitrary. But but the the fan if you subdivide should be shaded. Right. You mean that because you have sigma and immediately use you have sigma and then you start you sigma prime is a star sub is a subdivision which is which sigma is the shallow event you get sigma prime which is either star subdivision or storacy but you you really also need the point to start tropical point okay so the examples I think I think the most Okay, so the most interesting examples from the point of view of this workshop are metrics. And it turns out that sigma n is shadable. I think this was proved by Chris and her thesis. So I mean, it's not the state in terms of shallability, but basically that's what she observed. So that so sigma, it's not difficult. I mean, so the idea is that, okay, so what is the shallability? So this is this, this, this is maybe, this is some, I would like to say what is, this is the geometric, so the shallability, this tropical modification is the geometric content of the additional contractions. So sigma m is shallow in the sense that uh it is of 10. So sigma minus, if you take an element i, essentially you take an element i from m, but you can take it out from n. First of all, if m is a uniform metroid, sigma m is complete, so you don't need to prove anything. Otherwise, you have an element i such that if you remove it, you get a metroid which has the same rank as the Metroid which has the same rank as the so now it turns out that sigma m minus i is embedded inside sigma m and sigma m so sigma m contracted i is a divisor here. So sigma m can be obtained by a tropical modification of sigma m minus i along the sigma m quotient plan. Step two can make the alpha code m. Step two can make the ample code empty, right? But step three. Then we can you can make these down your log examples where they're. This one. Yes. So, I mean, I haven't yet stated the theorem on the packet, but I just define what is what you do for each other. But the idea is that the metroid M sigma M is obtained from mitropical modification of M minus I, the Beckman fan of M minus R i, along the Beckman span. Of i along the melvan span of m ocended by i. And the same thing is true for augmented fans. For augmented methods for the same reason. So this fan is obtained by topical modification of phi m minus i along the divisor, phi m divided by i. So, okay, so this means that the the the the fans which appear which have which appeared so far are all uh shadowed and maybe this is the passport. What did you say about the uniform case? Okay, so the uniform case, you're right. I mean so maybe I need the caution because I think the most basic example is the example of coffee plants. Concrete fans are shadowed. And this is because, okay, so why? Because this is because you can take, you take the line, you take the line power n, and then you have to use some important theorem, which is called the weak factorization, which tells you that you can go from this fan with complete support to any other fan by doing subdivisions and assumptions. Assumptions. And you will remain in the category of unit profits. So, yeah, complete fancy. In the case you are uniform, you get a complete translate each year. Okay, so the last part of the talk is theorem. So, the first part of the theorem tells you that any shape. Of the Turing that tells you that any shadow that you find verifies concern. And the second part tells you that, so here we need to have, first of all, if omega positive or omega negative, and the ample core, so if there exists a left shed element, so it means that there exists L Left Schetz. It means that this is an element associated to a strictly convex function on sigma. Then sigma omega verifies hard f sheds and what you okay, so this is the term. So it tells you that every fan you get by this construction, by these basic operations, starting from the line and point, taking for logs, subject. And point, taking for logs, subdivisions, and multiplications, verify the Gender pattern. Again, once you have these points, you can state those properties. Sorry, wasn't that the definition of the options? This is an element which is associated to a convergence linear, convoys strictly convergence function. So it's, I mean, I didn't define it properly, but this is something which comes from toric geometry. What Korean was saying is that you might have. You might have fan having a left shut element, but when you subdivide, it no longer has one. Ah, yeah, when you subdivide, it will have, but when do you do the star assembly? Maybe you use the inverse. Okay, so maybe I just tell you, I mean, so now I mean, the idea of the proof is now somehow simple proof. Just now I think the proof strategy is simple. First of all, For step zero, you verify it for this for the LAN. Okay, yes, you can verify it. It's also the case with the projective line. And the second thing, in the first step, you look at the product. So you know that your fan is obtained, your topical fan is obtained by taking products, subdivisions, assemblies, and tropical modification. So the product, you have the Kunette formula. The Kunet theorem tells you that you can decompose the character as a. Tells you that you can decompose the character as a tensor product. So, if the two components verify the package, you have it. For the second operation, you need to use Key's lemma. So, this is a basic lemma proved by Sean Kila. It tells you the following. It tells you that if you have sigma and you obtain sigma prime by a star subdividing a cone of sigma, then the charge of sigma prime, the k part. Prime, the k part of the charing of sigma prime, decomposed as the k so you get a copy of the charing of sigma, and then you get some other parts. The star function of sigma just I could have just two, three minutes and I could. Okay, so the idea is that if sigma prime is obtained from sigma by subdividing a core, then what you do is that you get this decomposition. You get a copy of the choring of sigma in degree k, and also you get copies of choring of the star fan of this chrome that you have subdivided but put in different. And so once you have this technical. And so once you have this decomposition, if sigma verifies, if sigma is shareable, it verifies the Kerr package. If sigma sigma will be again shared, so this is a property which is correct for shareable fans. The store fans remain shareable. And you have the cader package for this one, so you have to do something, but it's done in the world by Kareem, June, and Reed. It's also something that people were doing when looking at some basic properties, some properties, some geometric properties. properties uh some properties some geometric properties on uh on to on on on complex uh rays so this this is something uh which could be done so it's maybe i mean and the last thing is this tropical modification which allows you somehow to to get more interesting finds out of the and this is somehow surprising this is this is the most uh this is the the the the the easiest of the three properties that we have to check because so for the last the third property that we have to check is But the last, the third property that we have to check is the the behavior of the tropical the charring of the tropical modification and this is this turns out to be the easiest one because the charing of the tropical modification will be the same as the charing this the charing will prove so you don't need to prove anything because the charming doesn't change so so what I'm saying is that somehow you So, what I'm saying is that somehow you get it for free because once you know that the file is shallow, the most interesting operation which allows you to produce a new files gives you the most basic actually in terms of the charing. You have to prove something. This is not uh completely trivial, but it's not difficult. So, you can prove it completely that the choring doesn't change. And the doggy map. The dog remap doesn't change. Everything is really consistent, so Everything is really persistent. So, but the only thing is that, as I said, you want to stay, if you are interested in the Keter properties, you want to stay in the category of entropical functions with positive weights. So, in this case, you have to work with holomorphic functions, the functions, monomorphic functions which do not have any points. Okay, so maybe I just stop here, but I just make a few comments. First of all, I liked very much because this theory, I don't, I mean, Because this theory, it was about tropical fans. As I said, tropical fans are contractive. And I think I would like maybe to make the connection to the first talk because Federico mentions this nice property of the chair rings, which is the fact that you can describe them in three different ways. And I would like to add a fourth one, which is somehow, I think this was the beginning of all the things that we did in this tropical. This is the fourth, because maybe it's coming back to sweat. Fourth, because maybe I'll just write this one and then it's got actually there is a fourth presentation of the drawing. And this is purely trophical. You don't need any complex variety. So what you do is that you want to present this as the cohomology of some compact space. And it turns out that you can do this. This chariot is the cohomology in the it's the cohomology I already displayed. It's the combination I already display of some compactification of the tropical fan sigma. And this compactification is obtained. So sigma is embedded in Rn. You can use the fan to partially compactify Rn. You use the same fan to partially compactify. This is called tropical trollic variety associated with sigma. And then you take the closure of sigma inside. And it turns out that this challenge is also the chromology of this compact. Is also the chromology of this compact. This is a compact space, and this is the chromology of that space. What is this chromology? This is another story, but here is a chromology theory. You can define this. And this is basically the fourth presentation of the jory purely in terms of the chromology of compact manifolds. And of course, this was the beginning of this you can you can use this. So this this is this is the the the most basic uh compact uh ma manif uh topical variety which verify these properties of the sigma shared. Properties of the sigma shelter. And then we'd like to somehow generalize the Hodge theory to more general theoretical variables. In terms of that, there's a nice story also there. But I think I stop here because I can probably be working on time. Questions or questions?
