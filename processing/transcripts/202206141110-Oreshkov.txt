Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Ognien Oreshokov. Yeah, please. Well, thank you. Hello, everyone. Thank you very much to the organizers for the kind invitation. It is really exciting to be here in Oaxaca in person. And today I'll talk about quantum processes on time delocalized systems. So this is a subject that is Is a subject that comes from is motivated by this field of indefinite causal order that I will tell you a little bit about. And I hope that it may inspire some of you with more quantum field theoretic background to think about these questions in the context of field theory. So, this field of indefinite causal order started out of a series of papers. First, there was Lucien Hardy, who was First, there was Lucien Hardy, who was thinking about generalized probabilistic theories in the absence of a causal structure and developed the so-called causaloid framework, where he argued that in quantum gravity, we may expect this fundamental idea about operations having definite causal order to break down. Then there was the work by Julia Kiribella and co-workers, which introduces so-called quantum suit. Which introduces so-called quantum switch. This is in the context of computer science, in the context of quantum computation, a higher-order transformation that is the first concrete example of a quantum transformation that actually features indefinite cause of order, in a precise sense. And then there was our paper with Fabio Costa and Chaslov Bruckner, which introduced the so-called process matrix framework, which was developed specifically to deal with this. Was developed specifically to deal with this idea about indefinite causal order, and in which the concept of indefinite causal order called causal non-separability was first rigorously formulated. And this is the framework that I usually think within. And I would like to introduce it to you and then move on to the question of time-delocalized system in the second part of this talk. So, the process matrix framework is an abstract framework or Is an abstract framework, operational framework, which we imagine these hypothetical experiments, like in this example, associated with two parties, Alice and Bob. And the experiments are imagined in the following way, like Alice is, you can think, resides inside some closed box. She receives an input system, performs a quantum operation on it, and sends an input system out. And each system's input and output are assumed to be quantum, so describe. And output are assumed to be quantum, so described with certain Huber spaces, there are associated Hubert spaces to them, and the operations that Alice can perform are quantum instruments. So each outcome corresponds to so-called completely positive map from the input to the output, and then Bob does the same. But no assumption is made here about specific ordering, whether these operations happen in space-time or anything like that. All we require is consistent assignment of probabilities under some natural assumptions, like the non-contextual. Like the non-contextual dependence of the outcome on the local city map. And this gives rise to the following expression. Basically, if we represent all these transformations in terms of the Choiya-Muelkovsky isomorphism, which means that every completely positive map is expressed as a positive semi-definite operator on the tensor product of the input and output space. Then we get that the joint probabilities should be written in this form, which very much resembles the Bohn rule, except that here instead of a density. Except that here instead of a pro of a density matrix, we have the so-called process matrix, which lives on the tensor product of the input and output Hilbert spaces of each local experiment. And there are some conditions that this thing should satisfy. The assumption that probability should give valid probabilities means that this should be positive semi-definite operator. And then probabilities should sum up to one translates to the constraint that whenever you plug in here a completely positive and trace-preserving map, which is when you sum up all Preserving map, which is when you sum up over the outcomes, you get a quantum channel. Uh, these probabilities should altogether be equal to one. So, this is the normalization of probabilities, and there are certain properties that say when a given choice operator represents a completely positive and trace-preserving map. And one can characterize these objects, and they have been now very well characterized. Another way of thinking about process matrices is in the language of higher-order transformations, which take as input transformations of lower order. Input transformations of lower order and produce new transformations. In particular, you can think of process matrix as this thing in which you can plug in local operations. And here, if you imagine them extended to maybe act on some ancillary systems, you know, what you would like is when you plug them in to get a valid channel on the ancillas. You know, every local measurement operation could, in principle, always be dilated to a unitary transformation on a larger system such that you put the measurements. Larger system such that you put the measurements on some ancillary systems at the end. So, this is another perspective. And here you can think of this like a circuit with a cycle, if you like, where this transformation that is composed with the transformations of Alice and Bob is really composed in a cyclic fashion. If you see, it's a box, it's in fact equal to a channel, a valid channel from these output systems to these input systems. It's a little bit like sending information somehow from the outputs back to the inputs. From the outputs back to the inputs. But does not mean that necessarily this involves any transformation back in time. In fact, here is an example of what this framework is able to do. In particular, it can describe situations in which the operations of Alice and Bob happen in a definite causal order. Like, for instance, one can prove that the most general scenario in which you have no possibility of signaling from the operation of Alice to the operation of Bob has the following type of realization. Has the following type of realization. You can always come up with a circuit in terms of causal standard operations where Bob's operations happen somewhere in the past of the sequence of transformations. And this is one example of a process matrix that is compatible with a definite order between the operations of Bob and Alice. Now, one can, however, conceive more general situations in which such an order may exist, but may be unknown to us. And because this framework permits it, And because this framework permits it is closed under convex combinations, you can form these convex mixtures of situations in which you have a situation in which a process matrix describes no signaling from Alice to Bob and no signaling from Bob to Alice. This could be realized by, let's say, tossing a coin and arranging one or the other. And these are the processes that we say are compatible with an underlying causal order, and we call them causally separable processes. One can extend this notion. One can extend this notion beyond two parties. It's slightly more complicated because once you have more than two parties, there is a possibility that the choice of one operation can affect the order of others that happen in its causal future. But we have defined that and there exists a theory that describes its causal separability in the general case. And the reason why now this is interesting is because this formalism also permits things that cannot be understood in this causal way. So there are processes that are causal. So, there are processes that are causally non-separable. And this was first shown in a precise way in our paper by the following game. So, consider that you have again these parties, Alice and Bob, and now each of them is given by a referee or a random bit. So actually, A is given bit A, Bob is given bit B. In addition, Bob is given one extra bit that we call B prime. And now they will do some operations and produce outcomes, which will be again bits. Outcomes, which will be again bits, depending on what they find out in their laboratories. These bits code X and Y, and there is a goal now. There is a game. The goal is to maximize a certain probability. This probability can be interpreted as following, describing the following thing. Essentially, if I should probably use my hand. Essentially, whenever Bob receives B prime equal to zero, we're looking at We are looking at the probability for x to be equal to b, which means that somehow the task is that the bit that was given to Bob should be communicated to Alice somehow, through the system somehow, such that Alice will correctly guess what was given to Bob. But if B prime happens to be one, then we're looking at the communication in the opposite direction. We want Bob's output to be equal to the A-B that was given to Alice. So somehow in this case, So, somehow in this case, and this is only known to Bob, we want, but it could be made known to Alice. This would not change actually the argument. In this case, we're looking at the possibility to signal in the opposite direction. And one can actually show that there is a bound if there was a definite causal order, even if unknown causal order between these events in this experiment, there is a bound on the success probability. On the success probability, and it is because if such an order exists, it just so happens irrespective of what the primes happen to be. I mean, if Alice is before Bob, and in one of the cases, yes, in principle, it's possible to fully communicate the bit from Alice to Bob. So they will succeed if it so happens that this is the B prime is equal to one. But if it happens that in this case, B prime is equal to zero, this can be at most one half. So one can. So, one can, this is a property that holds irrespectively of assumptions of what kind of theory actually describes these correlations. Only one can formulate it precisely in terms of the variables and the systems that enter these laboratories. I'm going to come back to this later towards the end of my talk in this precise formulation of the assumptions. But this is this constraint, and then we show that within the process framework, this is possible to actually find certain operators. Find certain operators and local strategy of valid causal quantum operations, but only locally, such that you could violate this bound, this causal bound, and you can have something like that. So that is very much like in the CHSH inequality, if you're familiar, a Bell type of inequality. So this is somehow in spirit similar to a Bell inequality. It's like a test, device-independent test for the non-existence of an underlying cause of order. Existence of an underlying cause of order between certain variables. So, but it is still different in spirit. There is some only, I mean, it's similar in spirit, but deep down conceptually, it is not necessarily related to the assumptions in Bell. Now, one thing I want to tell you is that now there was the notion of causal separability expressed in terms of operators, and then there was this violation of causal inequality, which shows that. Of inequality, which shows that a process cannot be causally separable, but actually, it's a more subtle distinction. If you consider the space of valid processes, there is the set of causally separable ones. And then there is another set, and this is a strict inclusion. There is another set of processes that are causally non-separable, but they do not violate causal inequalities. But there are also those that violate, so there are even a stronger manifestation of causal non-separability for those that violate causal inequalities. For those that violate causal inequalities, like the one I showed. Now, the natural question is: okay, you have this abstract mathematical framework. Does this have any physical significance? Could it be relevant, for instance, at the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity? This was one of the motivating considerations for the development of these frameworks. Or could it also maybe exist in some sense even within the standard quantum mechanics? Now, Here, one of the most famous, the most widely studied processes, let's say, in this framework is the so-called quantum switch, which I mentioned at the beginning. And I will use it as a starting point for this discussion. Basically, this quantum switch conceived by Kiribella and co-workers is the following higher order transformation. You think that, like, in a quantum computer, you're given two gates, say, UA and UB, and depending on some control. UB and depending on some control bit, a quantum bit, which could be in superposition in principle, you want to apply these gates in two different possible orders on some target system, some target degrees of freedom. So you wanted to do this. If the control qubit is zero, you want to somehow send your target system first through UB, then to UA, or vice versa, in the opposite order. And you want this to be a linear transformation such that if your control qubit is in a superposition, then you would. Then you would realize the following superposition. Now, I mean, one can formulate it precisely in this language of supermaps, like I mentioned earlier. And essentially, I'm just repeating what I said here. Here is the control qubit. Here is the target system denoted by S at the initial time, at the final time. And somehow has this interpretation. When you set up this to zero, it is as if you realize this kind of transformation or process. Transformation of processing between the operations phallus and Bob. When it is one, you realize the opposite. And in principle, by allowing superpositions, intuitively, you don't have a definite realization of one or the other. You have a superposition. And indeed, I mean, one can formally make the case that this is an instance of causal non-separability. One could interpret this experiment in the language of process matrices by putting four parties. It would be an example of a four-part type process matrix. And one can show that it is causally non-separable. That it is causally non-separable. But one interesting thing is, this is one of the examples of these processes that actually do not violate causal inequalities. One can prove that it does not. And nevertheless, it seems like a very intuitive thing that we can easily understand it from intuition and we can even come up with ideas of how we can be able to realize this in the laboratory. But interestingly, this also has been explored in the context of the intersection of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics. There is a so-called gravitational version of the quantum switch, people conceived, in particular Benna Zieck and co-workers, which is based on this idea that you could maybe by putting a massive object in superposition, you have different locations next to two parties, Alice and Bob, by exploiting the time dilation, gravitational time dilation, you can make two events in their local with respect to their local proper times. Local proper times happen, like let's say the event at which Alice's clock hits 12 o'clock, says now it's 12 o'clock, and the same in Bob's laboratory. Now, if you put the Earth here close to Bob, now this clock is ticking slower, and this event could be made to happen in the causal future of the event of Alice, or vice versa. And so, if you put the Earth in superposition, somehow you could argue that you could create this situation. And what is really amazing, in my view, is that in Really amazing in my view is that there are certain assumptions, of course, underlying this Gedankian experiment. But the most striking feature of this is that here you could imagine these local experimenters, Alice and Bob, who may be starting with synchronized clocks. And inside their local laboratories, according to their proper time, everything is going to run normal. They will not see any. There will be certain events during which they will, let's say, open their lab, do some with the nearby system, some transformations, etc. Some transformations, etc. And then they will record ultimately the types of correlations they obtain. And one can verify that one could effectively obtain the quantum switch, where you cannot say that the event A or B were in a well-defined order. But the thing is that, I mean, that somehow locally, you could not even notice that there is anything unusual going on because you can assume that Alice and Bob are in free fall, so they will not feel the gravitational field, so they will not know that something is going on. So they will not know that something is going on. But the thing is that the exact same idea, not the same, because it is lacking this specific quality of the gravitational switch, but still this same process, the quantum switch, has been proposed. Also, it could be implemented with standard quantum mechanics in the laboratory with optical systems. Now, if we go back here to this picture, you can see that this suggests in some sense. You know, that this suggests in some sense a certain realization of this idea. You can say, Okay, maybe I can just send a particle, maybe I can put these boxes instead of being transformations in the sense of this circuit description of quantum mechanics, I can maybe think these are like boxes in space, like some physical boxes through which a particle can go. And you can make a particle pass through in superposition of different paths. And maybe when it passes through, the internal degrees of freedom can be made to couple with some local apparatuses or systems, and then you could. Or systems, and then you could realize this. And this is exactly, one can easily verify that as far as the total transformation is concerned, you can certainly mimic this at least, mimic, in the way I just described. And this was, in fact, this idea underlies essentially many experimental demonstrations that have been implemented. But one question that naturally arises is whether this Arises: whether this thing that you can actually do it in standard quantum mechanics is really a realization. You can ask, is it a proper implementation of this process matrices without causal order, or is it maybe some sort of simulation of the idea? So to which extent should we regard it as an instance of the theoretical concept? What is the thing that is in indefinite causal order? How to talk and think about this? So, this is the rest of my subject is about that. The rest of my subject is about that, addressing this question, and this is where the notion of timely localized systems will come about, where this will allow us to make precise statements about these types of realizations. So, just as like I want to, of course, when we speak about physical realization, this is a philosophical concept that's one, it's could be controversial. It is, I mean, how we define it precisely can make us have significant. Can make us have significant influence on our conclusions. So I'm taking as well, I think, is sort of minimalist, but this is not really a definition because it's in a way to some extent circular. I just take it the following notion of physical realization. We say that there is a physical realization if there is an experiment in which element, every element of the mathematical description of the process, which includes this Hilbert spaces, the operations between these Hilbert spaces and so forth, has a Hilbert spaces and so forth has a physical counterpart in this experiment, which itself, however, is important to consider this physical counterpart a realization itself, right? Because otherwise I could simulate on a piece of paper this calculation and there is a physical counterpart in my ink, but that is not what we would qualify as a realization. However, I would like to argue that there is a sense in which these types of experiments could be interpreted as realizations because the sense in which we can say, because Say because it really is just a combination of already established notions of what we call realizations of certain channels, completely positive maps, and so forth. So if you describe such an experiment from a temporal perspective, you can always use this language of circuits where certain transformations happen in definite cause of order, obviously because this is within the regimes of standard quantum. Within the regimes of standard quantum mechanics, where everything admits in principle, like a unitary description, if you need, to maybe include the apparatuses, the ancillas in the description. And if you imagine this type of experiment, it's going to look something like this. You could represent it as a sequence of transformations, and it will look something like this. So there is this preparation in the past that maybe we associate with David. And then what you see here, these are controlled operations. Controlled operations. Operations. Control to operation. If you're not familiar with something like this, I mean, one defines it how it acts on the basis states, and then it's defined on the whole Hilbert space by linearity. On the basis states, it acts like this. If this qubit is in the state one, the black dot means that conditionally on this being in the state one, I will apply the operation UA on these systems here. But if it is zero, this is not going to happen here. I'll do nothing. Similarly, the white dot, the white. Similarly, the white dot, the white control, means the opposite. If the qubit is in the state zero, I will do this. If it is one, I will do nothing. So, this is the controlled operations. And this is essentially one can rewrite this type of experiment in the language of circuits. And it looks like this. So, the question is, where are the operations of Alice and Bob? If you have this type of experiment, could you say that they do happen in some sense, that they have indefinite order? What are they? On what Huber spaces do they act? And now, And now I will explain how that works, but I will choose just for simplicity, a simpler kind of model in which Bob's operation will be assumed to happen at a definite time, and we can only put Alice before or after Bob, depending on the control qubit. So this is equivalent. The same can be shown in the other, but this is simpler to explain. So essentially, let's consider this realization. So there is no question here that we're going to say that David is. We're going to say that David is associated with this preparation here, Charlie with this final measurement in the future, and Bob's operation is defined to act on this input system BI and output system BO that are well-defined time-localized systems. Okay, but where is ARIS? And we're going to remove this. And so RIS's operation, if it can be said to happen in some sense, should indeed be searched for inside this circuit fragment. And the main such a fragment, first of all, should be understood that it is an instance. Be understood that it is an instance of a quantum operation because, and this has been already noted, there is the so there is a framework called the quantum comps framework, which deals with describing circuit fragments, essentially, developed again by Kiribel and co-workers. In particular, whenever you have such a circuit fragments, it is some type of quantum operation from the input wires that you see, but here this includes. You see, but here this includes input wires or input systems at this time, as well as this one, which is at a later time, into the output systems, which is the tensor product of BI system, as well as this and this, which are at a later time. But if you consider what are the incoming wires into these boxes and the outgoing ones, there is a transformation from the incoming to the outgoing. And indeed, I mean, one way of seeing it is that you can just pull down mathematics. Just pull down, mathematically speaking, this wire down. And you can see that this is just a swapped unitary transformation. Therefore, you get a valid transformation from these systems to these systems. And the main observation here is this, if you look at this quantum comp or this circuit fragment, what kind of transformation it does from the ingoing wires, remember this was at a later time, but never mind, we can still mathematically treat the problem like that. Treats the problem like that. If you consider what kind of transformation it does, it could be written in a suitable basis as follows. It can be written as a tensor product of one transformation, which is precisely UA, the unitary that we associated with Alice's laboratory, acting on the ancilla of ALICE, and some suitable subsystem of the Huber space QSB0, which we are going to define as the input system of ALICE. To define as the input system of Alice to something analogous in the future, where we're going to define this AO as the output system of Alice, and then there is an identity channel happening on the complementary subsystems. You can choose certain basis and represent it as identity channel here. So, the idea is, in other words, you know, under a different choice of the composition of the silver space, rather than looking at Of this Hilbert space rather than looking at here, we have some natural decomposition QsB0, which was given by this time local systems. I could consider another factorization of this Hilbert space, which is QsB0. And there exists a certain factor, a specific factorization, which I will call AI and the complement AI bar. And similarly for the output spaces, such that I can now say that actually this circuit actually contains Aris's operation happening. Actually, it contains Alice's operation happening on these factors. So, this is what we'll call basically. Here is, let me explain these subsystems and factors more precisely. I mean, how do we define a subsystem? I mean, if you have a every system or subsystem that we deal with, except if it's the full universe, is usually a subsystem of some larger system. So, how do you define or identify subsystems from the perspective of Systems from the perspective of the larger system or the larger Hilbert space. Well, they are defined by sub-algebras. Basically, if you consider the algebras of all operators from the huge Hilbert space, there are certain sub-algebras that you can introduce. And they could, there are, if the algebra has a certain property, it could be defined as a subsystem. It defines, in fact, a certain factor of the global Hilbert space. For this specific For this specific instance that we're discussing, the claim is, like I said, that this global unitary transformation from the input wires to the output wires could be written in this way, where this is Alice's operation happening on certain systems. These systems now are the following. The input system AI is a non-trivial subsystem of this joint Hubert space Q S B zero, which is defined by the following algebra of operators. Algebra of operators. You see, here it is. Essentially, a given operator that we want to call the operator O acting on subsystem AI, from the global perspective, is defined as the following. It is this kind of control thing. If the control qubit is in the state zero, this is kind of intuitive interpretation of this expression. When the control qubit is in the state zero, we associate this operator with the system S. So it's defined to be here. So it's defined to be here, and when it is one, it is defined to be here. This, there is a unitary transformation that takes you from, for instance, from OS, if you localize this operator on this system, onto this. So this is algebra is isomorphic exactly to the algebra that we are interested in. So it is an instance of a subsystem of the respective dimension, and it is the one that we postulate, and we can say this is the input. Postulate, and we can say this is the input system of Alice. And similarly, for the output. So, once you move to this, you know, so just to give a definition, a time delocalized subsystem, we call a subsystem of the joint Hilbert space of systems at different times, like here, which is not, here I have a typo, which is non-localizable, I should say, not non-localizable, but which is not localizable within any of the time local factors. Of the time local factors. In that sense, I say it's a non-trivial subsystem, meaning that it's kind of delocalized with respect to the original tensor factorization in terms of time local systems. What that means, delocalized or not localizable within this, means that it does not commute, the algebra does not commute with any of the original local algebras. Okay, but it's still an instance of that same algebra. It's just another representation which is delocalized with respect to the original ones. And once you go, I mean, the claim is. Once you go, I mean, the claim is that essentially this experiment, when you move to the respective representation that we have identified, could be written, could also be equivalently described in this form. Instead, if you look at the time local systems, which was one choice of decomposition, you get the standard circuits. But if you change this decomposition and you say, okay, I'm interested in describing this experiment with respect to another choice of factorization, then you can see this. Then you can see this experiment as having exactly the form of the process matrix as before with the cyclic circuit. So, this raises the following natural question: Is there a way of transforming circuits, a general principle that allows us to take one circuit and transform it into another? How do you do that? Here we found it for a specific case, but maybe there is a general theory. And the answer is yes, it is possible to introduce such a thing, and it's quite simple. Essentially, just take as an example a given circuit like this, it could be with a cycle. This it could be with a cycle, but here I give an example without cycle. You can rewrite this circuit like you can deform it a little bit in a way that is going to put the wires next to each other. Imagine that I just deform it. This does not change the correlations between the operations that might be here. I just deform it in such a way that I will put it in this form, like the wires A, B, C, D are here. And this big box really contains all the boxes that were connecting the wires hidden. I'm not showing the structure because it's difficult to write curved boxes. Difficult to write curved boxes, but essentially, this is how you should think about it. This is just, I do this, there are other ways of expressing this visually, but I find this kind of intuitive because we're now interested in this. We see the system, the joint Hubert space of all the wires that were in the circuits. I take it as one Hubert space, it's A, B, C, D. And all I want to do is I want to change basis, essentially. I want to do a unitary transformation to move from this factorization to another. And the way you do it is by some isomorphism and the influence. Isomorphism and the inverse essentially. For instance, imagine that I can, I mean, there exists some isomorphism that's gonna take this Hilbert space in a precise way to some other factorization. Okay. I introduce it here. I introduce the inverse over there, such as to preserve everything. I'm not changing what I describe. I'm just moving to an alternative description. And then, of course, now I will compose these transformations with what was given. Formations with what was given to me, the original description of the circuit. So I'm essentially transforming the original description of the circuit into basically with respect to the new systems. So really a circuit is in some sense a transformation from the systems to themselves, a completely positive craze-based standard transformation. And you can just transform that transformation in a different basis, and you can. In a different basis, and you can, and now what you will obtain here could turn out to factorize, and it can get new structure. For instance, so this is the new description of the circuit and the new basis, if you like. So, for instance, what could come out is something like that. You could get some cycle. Depending on how you transform, you can get some new description. What I find intriguing is that if you start to trace preserving operations, you could argue that even if you get a cyclic circuit and it breaks down into tensor product of boxes, this big transformation. Product of boxes, this big transformation. It will also be composed of trace-preserving boxes. Now, which processes can be realized on time-de-localized systems? Now, we saw the quantum switch. What about more general processes? Now, what was first proven is that processes that admit so-called unitary extension can be realized. Unitary extension was introduced in this paper. Essentially, if you have a process matrix, like I told you, it's equivalent to a channel from. Like I told you, it's equivalent to a channel from the outputs to the inputs. It may admit a purification, like every channel admits a dilation to a unit theory with some preparation or some environment, if you like, and tracing out. But this purified thing need not be a valid process matrix itself. It turns out that some process matrices don't admit unitaries that are themselves valid process matrices. But some do. And for those that do, I showed in this paper that actually a realization on time. That actually, a realization on time the localized systems exist because actually, the idea is the following. I mean, if you write it like that, let's say for two parties, I showed it for two parties only. If you write it like this, there is this property that whenever you compose a process matrix with one of these parties, what you will get here is a transformation which is a quantum comp, and therefore it admits a circuit implementation. Therefore, what you could do is you can go in the lab and do the circuit, okay? But now the question is: does this circuit contain Is does this circuit contain Alice's operation on some suitable systems? And these systems should be independent of Alice's operation. And the answer is yes, because you can find such subsystems by the mere fact that this, if you consider the original concept, the process matrix, the unitary itself tells you, kind of, you can think of it as a map that maps this subsystem onto some subsystem of the outgoing wires. And this permits us to essentially find specific subsystems on which you could then see this experience. Then see this experiment as a realization of that. So that was proven the paper. Then I also proved another kind of variation of that for certain isometric processes that are not necessarily unitary, but isometric, but it's not known exactly what's the connection to the others. However, then it was later shown, again, here we have in a paper that we have with John Barrett and Robin Lawrence about cyclic causal models, which develops a language to talk about causal non-separability. Language to talk about causal non-separability in terms of precise notion of causal relations. We showed that all unitary extensions of bipartite processes are actually variations of the quantum switch. And so they cannot violate causal inequalities. This was also independently found by Yukujima et al. from the group of Neo-Morale in Tokyo. So this seems like a bad news because if we want to find realizations of processes that violate causal inequalities, then it seems that at least with these results from the At least with these results from the bipartite case, we have failed. But it turns out this is not at all bad news. In fact, it is precisely this result that allows us now to prove that there exist processes that can violate causal inequalities, but they are tripartite. So there is this recent work with Julian Vex and Syria Branciard, where we show that all tripartite unitarily extendable processes and their unitary extensions actually admit realizations in the sense of time. Realizations in the sense of time delocalized systems. And this includes, in particular, processes violating causal inequalities. The idea of the process, roughly the following, it is known that if you have a unitary process, when you plug a unitary here, and you can always dilate the local operation to a unitary, when you plug a unitary, you effectively obtain a bipartite unitary process. And because all the bipartite processes, unitary processes are variations of the switch, they admit They admit kind of a universal standard implementation with certain time delocalized systems. So, in a sense, you could do this is somehow the switch part for Alice and Bob. So, everything variations of the switch means that you can have around the switch some suitable basically operations. There are some constraints on them, but essentially it's that. So, somehow, for different choices of charges operation, you're going to get a different instance of it. This operation, you're going to get a different instance of the circuit. But then again, just because the process is unitary, it allows us to somehow identify subsystems, certain subsystems of the systems of Alice, BOP, and the time local systems here, on which we can say that Charlie's operation happens. So that's roughly the proof. This is not the proof. I mean, it's quite involved and technical. So I invite you, if you're curious, to look at the paper. But here is an example, which is, in my view, an extremely striking example. This is a process that will. This is a process that was found by understand by Arujo and Figs first and published in the paper by Baumeller and Wolf. But this is a process matrix, a tripartite, which is in some sense classical. The process matrix framework, you can consider the limit in which you restrict everything to be local in some diagonal in some local basis. And you may interpret this as a kind of classical version of the process matrix framework. And this is this example of a classical process. It is deterministic. Classical process, it is deterministic. This is really, it can be expressed. This, what this W does is a channel, but deterministic classical channel, a function from the outgoing systems. Here, they are just classical bits to the incoming systems into the parties. It's a certain function which is given here. Basically, the input of Alice is a certain function Boolean function of the bits BO and CO that Bob and Charlie can send out. Bob and Charlie can send out. It is described here. And it violates causal inequalities. I mean, you can very see that everybody depends from everybody else in a certain way, deterministic. Strikingly, this is a consistent process. It allows Alice and Bob to choose whatever. They have complete freedom of what to do here. You never get a contradiction like a grandfather paradox or anything like that. And it was noted that this can be actually purified, in particular, you can think of it as a. In particular, you can think of it as a quantum process if you like, and see it as a unitary on a larger system, or a reversible classical process, doesn't matter, but it could, in particular, be purified. And so it has a realization in our sense. And this is what the realization looks like. It's a circuit. From a temporal perspective, you have something like that. Okay. And I should say that there exists a way to address these time delocalized systems and variables. You can intervene on them, you can do measurements. On them, you can do measurements and you can verify that there is this process going on in an operational sense. But of course, these interventions are themselves non-local because the variables are non-local. And so if you want to go and set a certain variable to have a certain value, you should intervene in a certain non-local way. But such a way exists and it's described in our paper. But what does the violation of a causal inequality mean now in this setting? Well, the first thing to observe. The first thing to observe, like I said, you can always imagine that we are going to now introduce the ancillas, the local extra systems, and restrict Alice and Bob to do operations from a certain finite set of possibilities. The general causal structure, one can talk about in a precise way, about causal relations between variables. They really mean functional dependence. The local causal structure inside each laboratory is this generally, you can take it to be the full graph. The full graph, the full directed acyclic graph, the fully connected one. And then the causal relations can be verified to be like this. This is also analyzed in our paper on cyclic causal models with John Barrett and Rodin Lawrence, which I mentioned. So this is not so striking as such because even the classical switch, which is a totally causally separable process, where you just toss a coin and put Alice before Alice, this is also a cyclic causal model. So this is not. Also, a cyclic causal model, so this is not the novelty. However, it's important to observe what exactly the causal relations between these different variables are because then comes the novelty. The novelty is about the following argument. A violation of a causal inequality means that the correlations that you observe in such an experiment are incompatible with the existence of potential existence of causal order between these variables, just like you could do in the classical switch. You can say, Oh, this happens before this, or vice versa. I mean, it's a side. Or vice versa. I mean, it's a cyclic causal model because you somehow identified variables at different times, but it's ultimately you can find the causal story. Here, this is impossible. Such causal order between the variables cannot be said to exist, which is such that you respect the following two assumptions. Free choice. Free choice means that this thing, if it can influence anything, that anything must be in the causal future. So these are freely chosen. These are freely chosen. And this is much motivated by the graph. If you look, they have no causal parents. This is a testable fact. You can intervene on these non-local variables and verify that this is the correct causal graph for the relations. So this seems a natural thing to assume that if there was an unraveling, these would still remain free choices. And then there is another thing that we call the closed laboratory assumption, which is essentially this idea that if you see this choice, if you like, This choice, if you like, this choice variable for Alice, it could affect other variables, but only passing through the output variable first. So essentially, this one can one can express it in a precise way. The causal future of IX, for instance, IA or IB or IC, consists of this, this, and anything. And if there is anything else, that anything else is in the causal future of that. So this is motivated by this. Is motivated by this fact that this variable screens off influences from here to others, and vice versa for this one. This one can only be kind of affected by things that are in the past of this one, except if you consider this and this variable, they are, of course, in the past, but in principle, you know, anything else that could potentially influence OA must be in the past of the input system of Alice. And then there is also. system of Alice. And then there is also another condition that for some choice, there exists some choice of this variable for which this will be in the past of this. And you can motivate this by observing that you can set up your experiment in such a way that you can choose to set up this in such a way that you turn on an identity channel here. So it is indeed true, like that for some choice of variable, this can be put in the past of this. So if you believe that these things would hold in any potential causal unraveling, causal inequalities must be Unraveling, causal inequalities must be respected. So the fact that they are not respected means that such an explanation of these non-local variables is impossible. That's the main conclusion. Now you may be tempted to say, oh, but there is this causal explanation. That is true. There is something causal, like an explanation about it. Okay, I will rightly have. If you think that maybe you can say, oh, Charlie happens somehow in the past or in the future of Alice and Bob, depending on what they do. Valise and Bob, depending on what they do, you'll run into a contradiction. You have to conclude that this variable actually can be influenced from the future. So that interpretation is not possible. So as a discussion, I just wanted to say there are very natural questions. Like one is what are, I mean, what other processes can be realized? It's very difficult to actually prove this transformation of circuits seems like a powerful tool, but not clear how to address the general problem. And another natural question is whether such violations of causal inequalities. Violations of causal inequalities, like with the standard non-local variables, could have some practical applications. And another thing I wanted to mention, but I think this is will be suitable potentially for the discussion session, is what seems to be a natural connection to some ideas about reference frames. Like in this gravitational switch, people have proposed temporal reference frames to switch between different perspectives. This very much resembles these transformations, unitary transformations between different time delocalized systems. Uh, time delocalized systems. So, one may ask whether there is any such connection to be developed, and in particular, also, we've developed this recent theory which does not include temporal reference frames. It's just at the fixed time, but still, again, what we see is that reference frame transformations are, in fact such changes of decompositions of Huber spaces. So, it's a natural, it's interesting to ask whether there is this connection and whether physical laws maybe need to be covariant with respect to these types of. Be covariant with respect to these types of transformations I described. So, thank you for your attention. Sorry for running a little over time. Are there any questions or comments for the Of your specific talk, but did you say that it was related to let me let me give the microphone? There you go. So, just not about the details of the talk, but about the motivation and its relation to quantum gravity. I guess you can envision a process that happens in some space-time that does not. Some space-time that does not have a causal structure that is definite or doesn't have any or something. But my question then is: Is there an assumption that when there is a causal structure in the sense of a metric, then causation is related to the causal structure of the metric? Well, that's an assumption, but do we have a reason for that? Like I have general relativity and I see a General relativity, and I see a metric, and then later I show that the perturbations follow the lichens, they are like consistent with that. But I have to show it this doesn't come for free. So, I don't know if people always assume that it's a question for you and for everyone. Maybe I can just comment. Okay, thanks for this question. Yes, so the motivation is not rigorous here. The motivation is based exactly on the intuition that, of course, we know that the Intuition: that of course we know that the metric and the therefore the gravitational field in particular determines what we may call the causal structure of space-time, which is the light cons. So you might think, okay, this is a very heuristic idea, okay, in quantum gravity, somehow we expect this to become dynamical, therefore maybe to exist in some sort of causal super, no causal, but like quantum superpositions, and therefore to be indefinite in a certain sense. Potentially, even like what I was describing with the gravitational switch, all With the gravitational switch, altering kind of putting in superposition the cause of order between two events. This one with the gravity was using just the idea of superposition on the one hand and gravitational time relation on the other, and the assumption that you're in this scenario where you have the semi-classical evolution of the gravitational field. Now, one could debate, for instance, whether this is well motivated from first principles and so forth, but there is this general kind of expectation that That the definite causal structure of space-time that we have in GR would give way to something more general. And in this framework, the assumption was that maybe I still have the notion of a local causal neighborhood in which everything I can make sense of the usual quantum mechanics with input, output, and so forth, but maybe globally somehow I cannot connect them. So, and that kind of led to these questions. Yeah, well, let's. Yeah, well, that's thanks. It may be a question in relation to the issue about quantum gravity, because we have to distinguish between causal order of events and causal order of space-time. These are two different notions. Causal order of space-time is the light construction, and the light construction gives meaning to the causal order of specific events. So it's one level beyond that. One level beyond that. I don't understand the possible connection. For example, let me give you an example. Suppose we have Minkowski spacetime. So the causal structure of space-time is completely fixed. But we have the following two events. Particle one crosses the line and particle two crosses the line, you know, like horse racing, right? Horse A, horse B. But now these horses are quantum. Are quantum and they're in a superposition. So you can construct that. So this is essentially a problem of the time of arrival, and you can have a very indefinite causal order between first horse and second horse. And this is everything that's happening with respect to the Minkowski background space-time. That would be an example of what you're just describing would be an example of this type of differences between time delocalized variables. Right, right. I agree with that. I just think it isn't, I don't think it. I don't think it's very plausible that this is the same with quantum gravity indefiniteness. No, I mean, the framework I believe might turn out to be the same. So yes, I wanted to specifically to distinguish. It could be the same framework, but on one hand, the causal relata that we talk about, they have this indefinite order, or in fact, more precisely, we have developed a theory of quantum causal relations. One can more precisely say it's actually they are cyclic in a particular sense. The causal relata are these. Relata are these subsystems, really, and they are delocalized in one case, and in the other, they are time-local by construction and assumption. They will be really seen local with respect to the clocks of Alice and Bob. So, that is important. And somehow, one suggestion is that potentially even the locality of events in quantum gravitational scenarios might actually be ambiguous with what we discussed yesterday, also in the context of reference frame. Maybe something is local for someone and non-local. Local for someone and non-local for someone else. I believe that this mathematical framework that I outlined with the transformations and could maybe be useful for understanding how to pass between these different descriptions. Okay, thank you very much. I think we should go to the next talk. So let's thank Hognien again. Yeah, so next is Rafael Sorkin. Rafael Sorkin. Whoops. Oh, I see a grid looks perfect. Looks perfect. Oops, got small, a little small.
