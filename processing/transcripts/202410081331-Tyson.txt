So great pleasure to introduce Professor Heissen. She will talk about mutualism as teaching challenge. Thank you. And I'd like to start by thanking the organizers for this terrific workshop and for giving me the opportunity to present my work. This is work done in collaboration with Maria Martiglioni, who was my PhD student. She's now a post- She's now a postdoc at Georgia Tech and will probably be on the market next year. So, if you want someone amazing, you should try and get her. Jimmy Garnier is a professor in France, and we've been working with him on this project. He's the math whiz behind which I'm going to show you. So I'm going to show you the results, and I'm going to refer you to the paper for all the mathological PTS. I want to start by thanking my funders and then acknowledge that I am extremely grateful to live and work. Am extremely grateful to live and work on the unceded traditional territory of the Silk Coconut peoples. All right, so we've been interested in mutualism. Mutualisms are abundant in the natural world. We see them all over the place. However, traditional theory says that competitive exclusion should mean that we don't get multi-party mutualisms. So, researchers have been trying to figure out how you can get these stable mutualisms in spite of comparison. Mutualisms, in spite of competitive exclusion, and there are several known theoretical mechanisms. When niche overlap is low and spatial structure is present, niche differences, colonization, competition, trade-offs, and spatial structure can all give you a stable multi-partner mutualism. If niche overlap is high and there's very little spatial structure, then you can get multi-partner mutualisms with partner selection. We're interested in real-world We're interested in real-world mutualisms, however, where there isn't always an obvious mechanism where partner selection can occur. So partner selection means that if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. So if there's a host that is associated with several mutualists, that host will give to each mutualist in proportion to what it receives from that mutualist. But this is meant to illustrate the mycorrhizal plant mutualism. Everything's all mixed up. Mutualism, everything's all mixed up. This is pollination mutualism, everything's all mixed up. It's not clear in many of these scenarios how partner selection could occur. So we've been interested in trying to understand how you can get stable multi-partner mutualisms without partner selection. So I'm going to focus on our vuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which is a big mouthful, so we'll call them AMF for short. They've been mentioned earlier in this workshop already. Workshop already. So, the way it works is that the plant can photosynthesize, and so it can take carbon dioxide from the air, fix the carbon, and then use that to build plant structures. And then the fungi live in the soil, and they invade the plant roots and build these exchange zones where they take carbon from the plant and in return give some other resource to the plant. And there are many possible resources. We'll just call it phosphorus for today. We'll just call it phosphorus for today. What I've sketched here is: I've sketched a generous fungus by the thick arrows here, and a not-so-generous fungus illustrated by the thin arrows. So this would be a partner selection scenario, where the plant can tell, oh, you're not so nice, I'm not going to give you so much. Oh, you're very nice, I'll give you lots. And you can create this in experiments. So you can grow plants in such a way so that the roots are separated. Away so that the roots are separated, and you've got the fungi separated, and yes, then the plant can tell consumed. But in the real world, these will all be mixed up. So you'll have several fungi invading one root, and as far as we know, there is no known mechanism for partner selection in that scenario. So we have been trying to understand how you can get these multi-partner mutualisms, and we found that we can get them if there is. them if there is an asymmetry in the resource transfer from the plant to the fungus and the fungus to the plant. And we have a series of papers where we looked at this. And in this work that I'm talking about today, we're looking at the evolutionary dynamics where now we allow the mutualistic quality of the symbionts, that's the fungi, to evolve. And the question is, can we still get stable multi-partner mutualisms in that case? And how is the community structure that we obtain The community structure that we obtain here, how is that altered by dispersal? Okay, so we're going to consider the scenario of the host plants are all identical, but the symbionts, the AMF, they can evolve and they're distinguished by their mutualistic quality, nothing else. Everything else is the same. So we're going to use P for the plants, M for the AMF, and the key parameters are beta and alpha. So beta is the carbon supply rate of the plants. The carbon supply rate of the plant to the AMF, and alpha is the phosphorus supply rate from the AMF to the plants. And I'm going to need these other two quantities. I keep forgetting to use this thing. Here we go. So this is the mean mutualistic investment of the AMF community. It's an integral from our alpha min to our alpha max. So we assume there's a minimum level of mutualistic investment, which can be zero, and a maximum. zero and a maximum level of mutualistic investment. So we have an integral over the AMF multiplied by their mutualistic investment divided by this big M here, which is the total AMF biomass. Okay, so with those, now I can show you the model. Oops, is that the right? That's the right thing. Okay, so both diffuse. We've got plant and AMF diffusing. Here's the evolution of The evolution of mutualistic quality. The plant can manage with the fungi. They do better with the fungi, but they can generally manage without. So this is the intrinsic growth. And then these are the exchange terms. So here's the increase in plant growth rate due to resources from the fungi, and then here's the analogous term where you've got decreased fungal growth rate because of what it's given to the plant. To the plant. And then these are the analogous terms. This is decrease in plant growth rate because of what it gives to the AMF. And this is the AMF receiving that resource. And then we have two maintenance terms here. And we have zero flux boundary conditions on mutualistic quality. Okay, and then right away I'm going to simplify things. I'm going to Away, I'm going to simplify things. I'm going to say the host and symbiont are both obligate mutualists, so the plant can't grow without the AMF. We did look at the case where the plant can grow without the AMF, just the results are a little cleaner for the no intrinsic growth rate of the plant case. So from now on, we've got a pair of obligate mutualists, a host, and its community of symbionts. So on this range from alpha min to alpha, From alpha min to alpha max. So these mutualists, these fungi that are giving only alpha min, they're giving less than they take. So they're parasitic. And then at the other end, we've got fungi that are giving more than they take, and those are mutualistic. In between, we have a critical mutualistic investment, which Jimmy's able to calculate. And so if alpha is larger than this critical value, then that holds the Critical value, then that host signal there will survive. Okay, so let's start looking at the case without dispersal. So the host is the same, so we have the same carbon supply rate from the host to all of the symbionts, but we're going to allow this symbiont mutualistic quality to evolve with no diffusion. And this is what we get, and I'm sorry the reds all look rather the same. Sorry, the reds all look rather the same, so let's talk through this. So, if the plant is very mutualistic, so this is a very generous plant that gives lots and lots of carbon to the fungi, then this is the distribution of mutualistic quality in the AMF community. So this is alpha on the horizontal axis, and this is essentially the amount in the community. So we have a fairly flat distribution, and this star here indicates alpha C. star here indicates alpha C. So all of these AMF are mutualistic and all of these AMF are parasitic. Okay, as beta decreases, so the plant's less generous, we end up, here's the beta equals 4 distribution. So now we're seeing more parasitic AMF emerging. But alpha C is lower, right? So the plant's not giving as much, so it doesn't require as much. Sorry, Reggie, what are the cuts showing? Does he steady state then? Is he steady state then? Oh, yeah, this is a steady state then. It's a steady state. My apologies. Yes. Okay. So alpha critical is lower, and we end up, and so now all of these AMF are mutualistic, and these are parasitic. And as beta decreases further, the distribution becomes more and more peaked towards the parasitic end of the axis. So this is the same figure I just showed you. Showed you. Now we can also look at how carbon supply rate affects plant and AMF biomass. So AMF biomass is this blue curve and plant biomass is the black. And there are two, there are dots and a solid curve. So the solid curve is the analytical approximation and there's a dashed curve here that's hard to see. The dots are the simulations and the dashed curve is the analytical approximation. Of the dashed curve is the analytical approximation. So, pretty good. This is, so we look at the right axis, this is the mean mutualistic investment as a function of carbon supply rate. So, and these asterisks correspond to these four values of beta here. So when beta is 12, we have high mean mutualistic investment. And when beta is low, we have low mean mutualistic investment. And it's monotonic with respect to carbon supply rate. Respect to carbon supply rate. The other interesting thing here is that the peak in plant density occurs at a lower beta than the peak in AMF density. So they're not optimized at the same, in the same conditions. Okay, so we can, if we look closer at the equations, we can interpret the results we just saw a little further. So remember, I mentioned this asymmetry in resource transfer. So from the Transferred. So from the plant to the AMF, notice that this benefit term does not depend on mutualistic quality of the AMF. So all of the symbionts, whether they're mutualistic or parasitic, are getting the same benefit. The cost, however, does depend on mutualistic quality. So the cost is lower for the parasitic AMF. However, it's mediated by plant density. It's mediated by plant density. Notice this term is linear. So, as the plant gets bigger, the benefits keep getting better. But as the plant gets bigger, the cost starts saturating. So, now the difference between benefit and cost goes up. Okay, so slowing this down, parasitic symbionts have higher fitness all the time. Yes. But the fitness of parasitic symbionts increases as plant density increases and the mean mutualistic investment decreases. Investment decreases as plant density increases. So, what we have is we have these two forces working against each other. So, if the community is parasitic, suppose we start off, parasitic AMF community, the plant's not going to do very well. So we have low host density, but that means that the mean mutualistic investment is going to increase, which is going to be good for the plant, so the plant will grow. So the plant will grow. So that's pushing things to the right. If we start with a mutualistic community instead, that's really good for the plant, so the plant will be big. But now a big plant means a stronger selection for parasitic symbionts, and that's bad for the plants, so that will make the plant get smaller. So we have these two forces working against each other that give us a host density at equilibrium. At equilibrium. Okay, so now let's look at what happens when we add dispersal. So, same scenario as before, except that now diffusion is non-zero. And we're assuming that the plant and fungus diffuse at the same rate. Okay, these are the results. So again, lots on this figure. Let's start with this curve here. So this is the traveling wave. Here's the traveling wave, this dashed black line. That's the traveling. This dashed black line, that's the traveling wave and plant density. This curve here is the mean mutualistic investment of the community. So it's high at the wave front and low at the wave core. So now instead of having beta, because beta is the same, so the plants are all exactly the same, it's only position on the wavefront that is selecting for these different communities. Different communities. So, this is a highly mutualistic community here, and this is a much less mutualistic community here. These different colors here, green indicates a parasitic AMF and blue indicates a mutualistic AMF. So, this is the traveling wave in the AMF with alpha equals zero. So, this AMF is giving nothing to the plant. The really high one. The plant. The really high one is hard to see. The alpha equals two one is here. So there's the traveling weight in that AMM. So now if we look at the distribution of alpha in the community at each of these positions, so let's start at 30. Here's the x equals 30. And notice that here, this figure looks a lot like the one that I showed you earlier where we had beta, carbon. Earlier, where we had beta, carbon supply rate, varying. Instead, here we just have position. So, towards the front, we have this distribution that has a longer, fidder tail. And then, as we move back towards the core, the distribution becomes more peat, more parasitic AMF. It turns out, though, that Though that the proportion of the entire community that is mutualistic is still larger than the proportion that's parasitic. And here, this curve, if you read on the right, is the percentage of the AMF along the traveling wave that is parasitic. So it maximizes around 40% that's parasitic. If we look at the growth rate of the AMF and Of the AMF and the plant. Here's the traveling wave again. So there's the plant wave, and here's the AMF wave. This dashed curve is the plant growth rate, and the solid curve is the AMF growth rate. So the plant growth rate is maximized a little bit ahead of the AMF growth rate, and both are maximum in the vicinity, sort of towards the. Vicinity, sort of towards the initial part of the traveling body. Okay, so we have eco-evolutionary forces along the wave front. Let's just walk through this again. So at the wave front, plant density is low. And so the parasitic symbionts have a smaller advantage. So therefore, mutualistic investment is high and plant density increases. And now, as we move back towards the way. Now, as we move back towards the wave core, the plant density will increase, but then parasitic symbionts gain an increasing advantage, which means that mutualistic investment decreases and plant density stabilizes equilibrium. And we're able to calculate the mean mutualistic investment and the plant density at equilibrium. We can also look at the most probable ancestors. The most probable ancestors of the AMF community. There's a lot going on in this figure, so I'll take my time here. This is the plant traveling wave here, and this red curve is the plant growth rate. The gray is the analytic approximation. So lots of fun math to look at because he's done an awfully good job. Okay, that's what those two are. Never mind the red curve now. Now I want to focus on this. Now, I want to focus on this curve, which is the AMF traveling wavefront, and the AMF growth curve. Okay, so the colors all mean something. Remember, blue is mutualistic, green is parasitic. And what the color of each dot along this wavefront means is the proportion of the community that is worth essentially the mean mutualistic investment of the community. So it's very highly mutualistic here. We're in this region of the color gray. Of the color grid. And then as we move back, we start moving more into this region of the color grid. Okay, that we already knew. This part along the growth rate curve, each of these diamonds has a color, and each diamond is the most likely ancestor of the AMF at that position on the wavefront. And so the interesting thing here is that the ancestors, for the most part, are Ancestors, for the most part, are green in color. So it's the parasitic AMF at the core that are generating the mutualists at the front. Okay, so in conclusion, we do find that if we allow the symbionts to evolve in their mutualistic quality, that we can have stable multi-partner mutualisms emerge. And the conditions we have. Emerge. And the conditions we had was that the plant mutualistic quality was fixed, and the benefits and costs of mutualism were asymmetric with respect to plant density. And then we have the community responding to new environments. I'm borrowing language from a talk yesterday. We talked about what happens in new environments. So in this invasion scenario, selection becomes a function of space via plant density, and there's higher mutualistic investment at the wave front. Mutualistic investment at the wave front. So, if you sample a community at the wave front, you expect to find more mutualists than you do if you sample at the wave core. And then the invasion wave is pulled by plant density and pushed by symbiont density. Because the next step is to allow beta to evolve also. And that is in progress. Thank you. We have plenty of time for questions. Have you look at the scale of this child and whether it's compared without chisel and with chizer? That's a really good question. We did, what did we, so we did look at here's some spread of speed. So this isn't with and without the mutualism. This is with different dispersal rates. So I don't know, well, okay. So I don't know. Well, okay. So what we've got here is we've got this is a figure showing what happens when the dispersal rate of the plant is not necessarily different from the dispersal rate of the symbiont. So this is equal dispersal rates, and that's our fastest wave. And if they're different, then we get slower waves. Again, the solid curves of the analytic approximation. So my guess is that it's faster with the nutrients, but that's a guess. Okay. Yeah, it's about the interpretation of the common ancestor the store. The who? About the green diamond. Yeah, could you please elaborate on that? You say that so if you look at the age and you background in time, you will find an ancestor who was a paradigm. Is it like individual wise or is it like because uh we know but at the core I echo the window, but at the core, most individuals are priority. Yeah, I'm going to have to refer you to the analysis for that. I don't know how Jimmy did it. Yeah, perfect, perfect. Yeah. But it involves going backward in time somehow. But the magnetic way, okay, very good to track also the trait backward in time, but you go back to a like a Time on you, you go back to like a mean trait and you identify it. Something like that, yes. Yeah, and he's able to analytically calculate it. You showed, were those numerically computed or were they analytic computers? There's both. So the solid is the analytic approximation and the dots are numerical. Is there some like push versus pull change? I don't know if you know this terminology. Terminology. Right, I do. Well, we've got both happening at the same time. Oh, right. So, one might, yeah, does the push-pull reverse or anything when we've got this switch? I guess I don't really remember what a beta factor is, but I'm surprised to see it not monotonic in beta, but it sort of like goes down. Well, though it might come back to that early on, I showed you that biomass saturates at one end or the other. You know, not at one end or the other at the beta scale, but in the middle somewhere. So I'm sure it's connected. I think probably the plant pulling and the symbionts pushing is always going to remain the same because we've got this density mechanism that magnifies the asymmetry in the benefits and costs. So that probably doesn't switch, but clearly not having them move at the same rate slows things down quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah, there is a term of phenomenon that mutualism is more common in stressful environments. Oh, interesting. I wonder if this is millennials. Yeah, that's an interesting observation. Yes. I have a related question. It sounds like it would be like a More mutualistic at the front. So you would see more mutualism, I guess, in places where there was environmental variation. Yeah. So you have regions get wiped out and re-invaded. So if you had a lot of sort of change like that, then I would expect to see and that's another version of Harsher. That's another version of Harsher Environment. Right. I expect you solicit that from Juri, Sean. Yeah. We'd love to find data. So, if anybody has any knowledge of data, that would be absolutely a natural consequence of this. Yeah, that's great. So, I have a question regarding where you say evolution when you have these selections. So, do you So do you observe any kind of the unnovs of this kind of oscillations? Do we observe any oscillations? Right due to the selections. Yeah, no, we haven't. We haven't seen any oscillations in the system at all seems to be monotonic. Yeah. Okay, but any further questions for you, Bethany? Not then, thank you very much. And thank you very much. So, we would like to stick to schedules. We have a seven-minute break and take a washroom break, and then we start. I will do most of the photos, and then I will show some simulation. Maybe I can set up some of the things that I will do.
