The subset of young people, and so I want to speak a little bit for on behalf of all of us. We're particularly grateful for the four organizers for putting this conference together and doing all the work that goes through, especially when we did things like needed to renew our passport or washed it in the washing machine or were a bit slow at sending our abstracts, needed to sort of deal with this not getting the info you wanted when we needed. We're also particularly grateful to the more. Grateful to the more senior people who gave these long lectures talking about introducing ideas from a standpoint of us not knowing sort of the landscape, the mathematical landscape. And we're grateful for the people that are more experienced who didn't necessarily give talks but were available for us to chat with and to sort of have them share their mathematical perspective with us. So we've learned a lot. We've all talked about the sorts of things we've learned. We've all talked about the sorts of things we've learned, and we've all learned quite a lot, and we're very grateful for this. So, I think about three times during this conference, I've been watching a talk and thought to myself, this is exactly how I was going to begin my introduction of the background. So, I'm going to go through some of this that you've seen before in a sort of a bit different way. One of the things that we know about the chow ring is that we can represent it. Chow ring is that we can represent it in these two distinct ways. We can take it as, the way I like to think of it, as take this polynomial ring that's generated by the flats of the matroid and mod out by the ideals, but we can also look at it as the group that we get from the Minkowski weights. I was planning on talking a little bit about what Minkowski rates were. I think I'm still going to do that because I think we have time. If we want to just find Minkowski rates, To define Minkowski rates, we need to start with a nice fan. We're going to start with the Bergman fan, where we write down all of our non-trivial flats, we choose an indicator vector or array for each of our non-flats, and for every chain of flats in the matroid, we take the colon generated by those flats. And then we like working in projective space, so we're plotting out by the all ones vector or the flat containing all of the elements. To get a Minkowski weight, we need to Minkowski weights assign, we have sort of a graded ring where we're going to, for each K, we're going to take the K skeleton and assign a weight to the top-dimensional cones of that K skeleton. For dimension one cone, we're going to make sure that our fan is balanced at by cone. Each of the cones that sort of Each of the cones that's sort of the star of this co-dimension one cone is going to have a bunch of top-dimensional cones that each have sort of one generator that's in the cone. And so we want to make sure we have satisfied we add up the weights times this extra vector and get something in the span of tau. And so our Minkowski weights come from, let's take the group of all the potential weights that we have and take this great group. So this is just sort of an example of how we do the balancing condition. For M1, the only co-rank one dimensional column is the origin. And so we just take all of the vectors and their weights, and we can calculate that it should be isomorphic to Z5. But it should be isomorphic to Z5. For two, we get things sort of of this form, which show us sort of one at a time that two weights have to be the same, which is why we expect putting weights one on everything is going to give us a balanced ban. And then the Twernsworth-McPherson cycles, as has been described a couple of times, is where we take the case skeleton and for every cone we describe, we've assigned the weight function where we take a power of. Take a power of minus one and times it by the product of the beta invariance, where we're looking at the beta invariance of sort of the gaps in our chain of flats. And as a theorem, we get that this is balanced, so this lives in the Minkowski-Weigs group, and we like that. Do you want me to do this computation on my example Matroid? Saw a head nod, but I'm not sure if that was, I understand what's going on, or yes, I want you to do this example. So if we take my favorite matroy, for examples, which is just like, I'm writing this slightly in a weird notation where I'm writing u1s. Weird notation where I'm writing u1, but instead of writing just the number of elements, I'm writing the ground set. We have our non-trivial flats that we can write out, and we should get sort of interesting things when k is 0, 1, or 2. For CSM2, as we expect, we want just the full fan of the Bergman fan and we want to assign weights of 1 to everything. For CSM0, we're going to We're going to assign the weight of just the beta invariant of the entire matroid. An important fact to remember about beta invariants is the beta invariant of a disconnect, the matroid, is always zero. And so in this case, we assign zero to our origin, but in general, that's not going to be true. And then for CSM1, most of the time in this particular case, if I take a flat, either that flat is itself disconnected or the major Or the matroid contracted by that plot is disconnected. So in both of those cases, we're going to get the product of beta invariance being zero. So most of our weights are zero, with sort of two exceptions, which we can work out as going to be minus one. That's what a CSM cycle is. Our goal, I haven't written any new information on this slide, but it encompasses something that I didn't understand for a long time while working on this problem. For a long time, we're working on this problem, so I'm going to spend a tiny bit of time on it. We know that we can write the Chao ring in two different ways, and we know that the CSM cycle is an example of a McKowski rate. Since these two rings are isomorphic, that means we should be able to write the CSM cycles as in the form that we get for the A to the K, or for the Chowering terms of polynomials of flats. And so I'm just going to write. And so I'm just going to write that it should be sort of some coefficient depending on the product of terms times the terms corresponding to those flats. We noted earlier in this week that it's possible to take every element of the chow ring and write it as a square free monomial. Well, every monomial of the chow ring, we can always write it as a square, a sum of square free monomials. But in this case, we're just going to take sort of everything that might Of everything that might show up, and be aware of the fact that our presentation is not necessarily distinct. So say f1 to the p1. Is that just a formal sum? Yeah, that's just a formal sum. So this is just saying I'm going to be taking these, this chain of flats, f1 up through ft, and that might not give me the degree that I want. I want to have something in degree dec to live inside CSMK. And so I'm going to sometimes have something. And so I'm going to sometimes have something where I sort of might square the F1, or I just need the sum of the terms, the sum of the co-powers of each of the terms to add up to k. And so our goal is to find, well, our goal when I started was to find a nice way of writing down these coefficients. So we did a lot of examples, and we did a lot of examples by hand, and sort of a few proofs. Of a few proofs in specific cases and things, and we came up with this conjecture which we wrote in sort of not exactly these terms, where the coefficients depend only on the ranks of the flats and the multiplicity of the flats. So we were working on this, and we had sort of a gross proof that was not quite there, but sort of very close to proving this, but it was a very ugly proof, and we didn't like it. Yes, Alex. Yes, Alex. So I use the abbreviation p tilde to mean the sum of all of the p's up p sub i's up to there. So in this case, p1 tilde and p1 are the same thing, and then p2 tilde should be p1 plus p2. So I didn't describe that notation yet, sorry. Should that be pt tilde? No, no, so the bottoms should always be just the p size. The P sub I's and the top 15. This should definitely be two. This should definitely be two. Sorry, I have dyslexia. I actually took a test and I am in the bottom three percentile in terms of seeing a symbol and recognizing which symbol it is. So when I'm reading math papers, especially that I wrote myself, I read what should be written and not what has actually written. So this one is absolutely a two, and that's going to make And that's going to make this make a little bit more sense. So, our goal was sort of to show that this could be true. We were sort of stuck because we had a gross almost proof and we didn't like it. Federico, ah, Federico, I scroll names, I started with the same letter. Felipe went and visited Chris and chatted a bit about this problem with Chris. And Chris suggested that we might get a theorem or something that would help us in sort of one of two papers. In sort of one of two papers. And it turns out that we did get some stuff that could sort of build off some scaffolding. I'm going to sort of describe the part of this best paper that was helpful to us. So we have these S sub M and Q sub M that are matroid tautological classes. And we have this setup that we care about where I have a list of matroids and I'm forcing that every matroid is a quotient. Is a quotient of the matroid after it. I'm forcing that the rank of each matroid is equal to the number of times like the place where it appears in the sequence. And I'm forcing that the rank R matroid is the matroid that I'm starting with. We can do this. An example is sort of taking the truncation for all of the M sub i smaller than R and doing like this Higgs lift for M sub i bigger than R. live for m sub i bigger than r. And we have this theorem that tells us that the turn roots of these tautological classes can be written in this way. Z sub s. So when I wrote down my chow ring, I wrote things as x sub f because I was looking at flats. These tautological classes are looking at not just flats, but all subsets. So it's basically like So it's basically like x, it's basically my free variable in the chow ring of u n corresponding to s, but I'm just writing it as z so that it's distinct from when I'm looking at things in my matrix. The other thing we get from the Bett's paper is we get this theorem that says that we can write the CSM cycles with Cycles, CSM cycles of M in terms of these tautological classes. Using this series of matroids, we get that and this fact that if I have a subset of t, if the rank goes up when I'm going, so if I have my, if the rank goes down when I take a quotient, the rank of s goes down when I take a quotient, then the rank of t has to also go down when I take a quotient. T has to also go down when I take a quotient. And so using those two facts and a tiny bit of work is enough to prove that our coefficients are what we wanted them to be. But we didn't need all of, so let me jump back one slide. This top theorem we multiplied by delta m, which is essentially saying instead of looking at all of the sets, we actually only care about the ones. Actually, only care about the flats. But nothing that we did to compute these coefficients depended on our sets being flats. We just were sort of multiplying by this delta m, which got rid of everything that wasn't a flat. So we can actually say something a little bit stronger for free. We can say that we can We can write sort of our entire C sub k Turin coefficients in terms of just these sets. I'm going to introduce notation because of the fact that these coefficients don't depend on the S. So when I'm saying L, I'm writing, these are sort of keeping track of the rank and the nullity of the set. And I want to force that my S1 is a subset. force that my s1 is a subset so i want to be thinking of l as sort of describing a type of things like s1 to some power times s2 to some power and i want my restrictions on l to be equivalent to saying that s1 is a subset of s2 is a subset of s3 and so my l is going to be keeping track of the rank and the nullity of my set if i increase the rank i have a chance of increasing the the size of the set and if i increase The set, and if I increase the nullity, I have a chance of increasing the size of the set. And if I take the lexicographical ordering with the rank first and the nullity second, I get that if two things are comparable, then they're going to fit in the right places in my L vector. And then p is just a vector keeping track of the powers of each of my sets. And I can write these churn classes as sums using. Sums using these nice coefficients. The last thing, well, the last sort of interesting thing that we did is we noticed that we could separate parts of these things. Instead of, because my coefficients didn't depend on the exact flats, I can sort of separate them out into bits that are all of the things that are rank one, nobody two. 1, nullity 2 can sort of fit together and have the same coefficients. So I'm going to define y sub i j as just the sum of the variables corresponding to flats where the rank of s is 1 and the nullity of s is j. And if I do that, then I get that this behaves linearly. I'll get that, like, for instance, y squared of ij is going to be just the sum of the x sub s's squared. And this is going to all multiply. And this is going to all multiply out the way that we like, which means that we can write that our turn classes are just sort of, we can factor them out. Sorry, we can write that our turn classes in sort of a more succinct way, which gives us that these turn classes are actually a subset of this smaller ring that's just generated the y sub i's and y sub j's. Sorry, y sub i j's. Sorry, Y sub ijs. I wrote here, I'm just going to nickname this ring generated by the Y sub ijs as R sub M, which should be a graded ring that's a subset of the Chow ring, not of the original matroid, but the Chow ring of UNN. These degrees should be matroid invariants. They seem to be related to other known matrivants, and in particular, the Invariance and in particular the smallest degree essentially counts the number of non-zero coefficients of the type polynomial. The things that we want to do next are sort of to understand the rest of these degrees and to sort of use our descriptions of these trim classes to sort of, I guess, build upon the stuff that's done in the best paper in terms of writing these matrix invariants in these sorts of terms. In these sorts of terms. Thank you. So these are separate. Of the uh and get some kind of entire dimension. Um we know that the dimension is going to be much smaller than the charing in general. Um we have a few bounds on the dimension, in particular. Mention. In particular, the rank, because the rank plus the nullity equals the ground set, or equals the size of the set, and if I take everything, every subset of my matroid should have rank less than or equal to the rank of the whole matroid and nullity less than or equal to the nullity of the matroid. That gives me a bound on the number of y sub ij. In terms of like the smallest rank, there's it's It's reasonable to see that there's exactly going to be one linear relation between them. We haven't played more extensively with the degrees of all of the higher parts of this rate. The dimension, like the Hilbert series of this, or is it palindromic? This is a question that Felipe would like us to answer. Felipe would like us to answer, and that we have not had a chance to just start trying to answer. But other five screws and sea bases do not know what the word five screws or a sea basis means. Auto wheels and what the bowels of the room sorry. Yeah, sure. It seems like we'd be interested to explore this. Oh, so one thing we learned is that CSM is really in the support. So if I were to take like much coarser structure, less variables. For instance, I could have only variables not for all the class, but just for connected class. I don't know how I would change. I don't know how long it's taking. I don't know if you already know the answer to this. Isn't the CSM cluster defined on the minimal buildings? Find it on some larger buildings. Am I misunderstanding? I think you're asking the the coefficients that they should change coefficient. Might yeah, the formula might look very different. So very different. I don't know if I might look just as pretty or do you get the, like, are some of these extreme Ys the alph and the classes that work? Classes that they're essentially exactly like. Okay. Upbraing slightly has like I mean if I had to wager a guess I might guess so but I wouldn't have had much confidence in this guess. The hope is that they're sort of pretty haven't had a chance to play with them too much. Is that less? Thank you again.
