So, I'm going to talk a little bit about this problem. Essentially, we are interested in knowing how water flows in the brain. But the brain is so complicated. And we started with something a bit simpler. It's called optical nerve. I'm sorry, excuse me. And the argument is because they are similar. So, doing a modeling for the optimal will actually help us to understand what's going on in the brain. So, this is a little cartoon and just to show that the latest understanding of how actually water flows in the brain because. Water flows in the brain because the brain is one organ which is different from the rest of the body. There's no lymphatic system. In other words, there's no particular sort of pipelines for water, right? So the question is how water flows because that's very important for many reasons, obviously, to keep the brain healthy. So the understanding now is there is actually a time. There is actually a tiny space just outside the blood vessels and the rest of the brain tissues. It's called a perivascular space. But there are some, I think there are some images. So this is actually become quite interesting and that popular topics now for us spending a lot of We are spending a lot of time. And this paper is very recent. So they did the very detailed images and measuring the signals. And they found out the flow actually reaches its maximum at some frequency when you actually stimulate the brain. The brain using sound or using visual stimulus. And of course, the reason we don't know why. And there is also studies looking at people when they sleep and when they are awake. And they found out actually the flow again reaches a higher rate during sleep. And they then hypothesized. they they then hypothesize that this is the reason that you know um we need sleep because um this is the time when the you know the cleaning lady come out and clean your your brain and uh so this is a little bit more detailed cartoon to talk uh to give you a sense um um this is this is sort of uh let me see whether this thing will Of, uh, let me see whether this thing works. Yes, so this is inside the blood vessel, and then this is the cell which made up made the wall of the vessel. The outside, you have various different types of cells, and the particular important cell is called the astrocyte, and they have those what they call end foot, which wrap around, and then they have other types of glare cells. Type of glare cells. This is a neuron, which also has some kind of a connection with the exercise, and there's a membrane. And in this picture, it's actually not easy to see. There is actually a gap between the endocilia cells and the estrocytes. And if you zoom in, I'm not sure I have a picture like that. Yes, this is again. Yes, this is again, this is not a real image, but this is the carton. So this is the extra size. This is the breast vessel and the endocilia cells, and those are the so-called antfoot. And in between, there is a gap. And this is the paravascular space. And there are also gaps between those anfoot. And this is one sort of recent, more or less recent paper, twenty twenty three. Morris' recent paper 2023, and they set up a model essentially saying that when the blood vessel actually positive because of the pressure goes up and down, it will actually generate flow because then those are treated as elastic. Sort of so, for people who are interested in flu structure interaction, this is a Structure interaction: This is actually maybe a good problem to study, but anyway, so they propose this is actually a mechanism for driving the flow. And we are actually interested in a different problem before we look into the water closely. So it's something called a spreading depolarization. Spreading depolarization. And this was actually discovered a long time ago. This guy was doing some experiment. He was interested in epilepsy, I think. And then he was doing experiment. He accidentally found out, actually, if you do not, from time to time, he's working with those tissues. If you hit, for example, or by accident. For example, or by accident, then the signal generated by those brain cells, action potentials, what we call, will disappear. It actually propagates at different places if you measure those electric signals using electrodes, and then it propagates very slowly. This is very different from the propagation of the electrical pulses, what we call action potential. Action potential because it's that's much much faster. This is very slow, and this is a cartoon to illustrate how the propagation and this is sort of relevant now people believe to in have a relation with other pathologic conditions, for example, migraines and other things. And this is it, this is in birth. This is this is in birth. This is actually not inside the facility. I think one of the advantages of in-burst, you can actually go out to do some hiking during the break. And this is Robert Murray and a few other people at the workshop. Essentially, there is a model proposed by Robert and a postdoc at Postdoc at UBC a long time ago, and how actually those deprivation spread in the brain essentially has something to do with the imbalance of ions, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, that kind of thing. And so we want to come back to see whether the This possibility that water is actually generated not necessarily only, let's just say, by the hydrostatic pressure or those mechanical forces. And whether it's possible because of the movement of ions, which will generate actually an imbalance of osmotic pressure, and which then induce the flow. Okay, that's why we are looking. Okay, that's why we are looking at this problem because during during action potential, there is actually perturbations of those ions. And one of the problems which leads to deprivization is because too much potassium has accumulated outside the brain, outside the sorry, outside the cell. Anyway, so So now the idea is the flow actually, this is what people believe. This is a pathway because you can measure. And so if we pick, let's say, the optical nerve, which is this very thin fiber coming out of the eye, and this is the retina. And if you ever see a retina, Ever seeing a retina image of yourself or some other people, there's a bright spot, and the bright spot is actually the optical nerve head. And we are interested in this question originally, how talcian got cleared. And we choose optical nerve of animal called Of animal called puppy because there was an experiment available done a long time ago. And the other reason we choose this is because for this particular optical nerve, there's no blood vessel. So it's easier to actually to study and build a model. So essentially, also the geometry is relatively simple, so you can actually plasmate with. Plasmate with a cylindrical shape. So, this is a cartoon, one of my PhD students actually who draw this. I think he did a very good job. Essentially, there is so this is a place where the green fruit actually comes in, and then you have this mixture of the astrocytes. Mixture of the astrocytes and the nerve fibers called axon. And there are, of course, spaces in between those cells called extracellular space. And this is a cross-section view of it. And so we want to build a model for this and look at the potassium clearance. At the potassium, first without actually the perivascular space. As I said, perivascular space is believed to be outside vessel. And here we don't have blood vessels, so we did not consider the perivascular space first. So this is essentially the assumption of the model. It's pretty complicated. It's pretty complicated. So we did a lot of simplifications. And at the end, for this talk anyway, I'm only going to concentrate it on the macro scale model. I have some students who start working on more detailed models. But I don't think I have time to talk about that today. Anyway, so this is the type of equation we're going to solve. We are going to treat this as porous median, but what we call active porous median because there are the transportations of various things, including fruits and ions, and they are active because the exchange terms Terms, they are not constant. So, there are two three terms. This is due to the change of the volume because the cell membrane, they can actually move. And this is crossed in that essentially homogenized sense, the flux within that particular. The flux within that particular domain or compartment. And this is the term which has the exchange. If we look at, for example, neuron, then it has exchange with the extra cell space. If you look at extra space, then it has exchange with neuron and the glia cells extra cell. So this is for ions. Uh, for ions, and as well as for fruits, we have something similar. So, let me talk about ions first. So, the complicated part are those exchange through the membrane. And so, this is the simplest, which is called the essentially it's Ohm's law. You have you have something called a conductance, and because it's electric. And because it's electric, it's charged, so you have both. You have the you have the, you have to compare. You know, concentration will introduce a gradient, of course, and that's called diffusion. But also, because you have, it's electric, you also have to consider the electric field. So the combination of this drives the ions through the membrane. Through the membrane, actually, through a specific type of ion channels. And I'm going to, if I have time, I'm going to say a little bit about those ion channels. And then you write down, you know, various of, we have three compartments, we have different type of ions. So you have to work out those fluxes in detail. And this is a simplification. So we assume that. So we assume that everywhere else there is electron neutrality. So all the charges add up to zero. And then there's something else called, so this is outside, sorry, inside, because there are fixed charges, those proteins, then you have to add a little bit of additional charge. And for water, we use Darcy's law mostly. Is law mostly. So, with the exception that we have to consider those cross-membrane flow, and it has two parts. This is hydrostatic pressure, and this is osmotic pressure due to the exchange of ions. And this is for both neuron, exon, and real cells. And then we have mass conservation. So, what is incompressible? Mass conservation. So, water is incompressible in the sense that conservation is in the entire country volume, but not specifically in each compartment. And then we have to actually consider the change of the volumes of each, and then there is a balance. And the volume fraction, of course, adds up to one. So, this is the kind of equations. Equations. So the equation itself is not unusual. It's just that there are a lot of coupling and there are a lot of equations. And I say a little bit about the exchange. So those G, which are called conductance because ions and water actually goes through those membranes via specific. Membranes via specific channels. And those two people actually are responsible for most of the work actually done now in physiology lab. And they propose this actually model called Huxley. This is Hodgkin. This is Huxley. And this essentially tells you. And this essentially tells you actually how the conductance changes. And those parameters n, m, and h actually they change with the so-called membrane potential. Membrane potential is just potential difference between on both sides of the membrane. So I think I need to speed up. So essentially, we have a lot of PDEs and ODEs and coupled together. And coupled together. And one thing I think we want to be very careful is not to have too many three parameters, but try to get those parameters come from the literature, but also make sure that we can actually compare with the experiment. As I said, there were experiments done. So this is the concentration. Experiment done. So, this is the concentration of the potassium after each of those so-called action potential. So, those are electrical pulses. And you can induce electric pulses in various ways. You can inject current or you can have some potassium accumulation. So, this is the usual values for potassium outside the cell. And let me get to the and The and okay, so the other thing is we want to know how much actually ion is exchanged through each one of those electric pulses. It's actually quite small, but it accumulates for each one of those. Actually, a small amount of potassium comes out to the extracellular space. And here's the main point. So the reason. So the reason that the brain actually is structured that way, and now people find out more and more the role of those so-called glia cells. In this particular context, glial cells actually helps to take away those extracellular potassiums. Glial cells also provide the energy sources for the neurons as well. So essentially, So essentially, we did some sort of simulation. And when we simulate, you only stimulate half of the optical nerve. And because the electric signal propagates very fast. So essentially, that the entire sort of lower half of the domain, you have the wave propagates, and then there are two regions. Then there are two regions: up and lower part. And so the lower part of the actual cellular potassium increases. And then the question is, how does it taken away? And the mechanism is actually through the gaze cells. So it actually changes this fluxes because when the actual cell of potassium builds up, it changes this term. Builds up, it changes this term for nurse potential. And then it induces the flow, then it changes this electric potential. And because the electric potential again propagates very fast, and then it in this region, because this change and the potassium actually flow out. That's essentially the story for the potassium. But of course, you can do various You can do various estimates as I did in a couple of slides before. And then you can estimate how much of those total change in the osmotic pressure for each action potentials. Then you can actually estimate how much water is induced. And this is a cartoon image of how actually potassium actually is being taken away. Is being taken away through this glare buffering mechanism. So it comes in here, comes out here. It's much faster than diffusion because diffusion is much slower. And this is a much effective way to clear the potassium. Okay, as I said, we are actually interested in water, right? So what happens is because of this ion. Because of this ion imbalance induced by those action potentials, water actually follows potassium. Essentially, water will get into glia because the osmotic pressure difference is introduced. And then there is actually inside the glia, they are actually connected. And even though the division coefficient is actually very small, because the connection between glial cells like a very, you know, Cells like very small tunnels, and it actually allows this electric signal to be propagated much faster. And therefore, it created osmotic pressure between those two places. Imagine those are the image clear and the extracellular and extracellular. And so you can And so you can compute the fluxes and that kind of thing. So, how much time do I have left? 15 minutes. Okay. So, here now, this is all sort of very high level. I want to actually, because this is mathematical audience, I want to say a little bit about the modeling issues, then I come back to the more recent. The more recent results with Perivascar space. So, for ions, actually, for some of you perhaps already know that it's charged particles, right? So you actually need to write down something called PMP. So it stands for Nurse Flank. So, sorry, Frank, Nurse Boisson. This is the Boisson equation. So for the electric field. Equation so for the electric field, and those are the transport equation called Flank Nerst equation. So, this is also the model people use for semiconductors. Essentially, this is actually exactly almost like a semiconductor, positive and negative charge. For biological tissues, because we have different types of ions, so you actually have to deal with different more than just to. Different more than just two. Anyway, so but doing homogenization with PNP is actually hard because this parameter is actually quite small. So you need to deal with those boundary layers near the cell membranes. It's just not possible. So what we did first is to actually, because no, no, well, we are not the first ones who did this, but we sort of Who did this, but we sort of derive the model when there is actually a fluxes due to Hutchins-Huxfield, this type of more complicated sort of exchange terms. Anyway, the idea is relatively simple. So for people who has done asymptotic analysis, this is sort of a singular perturbation with boundary layer. And you can actually do this for 1D. And this is. 1D, and this is actually a picture of showing you that there is a layer. In other words, this is positive and negative charge, and in the middle, they are more or less the same. So this is what we call electroneutral. Only near the boundary, the charges, they are not cancelling each other. So they can accumulate. And this is called a capacitive effect. And so what do you do? So, what do you do? You do as match asymptotic. And it turns out it depends on different kinds of boundary conditions. For deleted boundary condition, it's actually straightforward. So you derive this kind of relationship. And so I should say C and Phi are in the bulk, so away from the boundary, and P and the Psi, they are within the boundary layer. Within the boundary layer, all the way up to the boundary conditions. So you have this kind of relationship. This relationship actually was derived a long time ago. There's a book by Robin Stan, a cyan book. So it has those kind of relationships already. But with fluxes, actually become a little bit more interesting. But even for that, for multi-ion species, it's actually not as straightforward. And straightforward. So, we actually look at this one way back, 10 years ago. So, with a postdoc. And also, my student, I was told that my student Dondo was here. And this is the problem actually gave it to him. But he's trained as a, you know, a computational sort of numerical. So he actually did not, he did not have a He did not have a course in SM thought analysis. So he actually struggled. And then we happened to have this postdoc who was a student of Rodwick Wong. So very good training. So this is how we did this paper. And anyway, so I don't think I have time to talk about this. Essentially, you make some assumption of the order, and then you do the You do the asthmatic expansion, and what's interesting is that for the bulk, essentially they satisfy diffusion equation. Okay, so if you have positive, negative, they are both C. And then you can solve the Boisson equation for, essentially, the Laplace equation for the electric field. Electric field. And then you match that in the boundary layer. But if you have a flux condition, then things become a little bit more interesting. So essentially, the fluxes, there is a mismatch of the fluxes. And the mismatch is due to the accumulation of the charge in the boundary layer. Boundary layer, and then this is the asymptotics. And turns out this accumulation is actually the order epsilon term. You have to keep the order epsilon term. Otherwise, those two are equal. So there's no accumulation of charge in the boundary layer. So you have to keep it. And after that, you can. And after that, you can work out some simplification of this term. Essentially, if C0 is relatively large, then you can take this C0 out, then this is essentially a capacitor fact. So that's why we can actually use this electron neutral model. And this is the bulky species one, and same thing, it's just more complicated. Same thing, it's just more complicated, okay. And yeah, when diffusion coefficients are constant here, the sum of the ions actually satisfy diffusion equation. Then, for the electric field, you solve this. And then for each individual species, you have to consider both. You have to consider both diffusion and the electric drift, but not for the sun. So, um, so I'm going to skip this because this is the Hodgkin-Huxley, it's just a specific type of flux condition. And then what we can do some comparison of the simplified model with a full model and we show that you can save a lot of time computational. Can save a lot of time computational wise. And then you do homogenization, use that simplified electron neutral model. You can do homogenization. And that's the model we use. So I'm going to skip this. This is just to show that homogenization works. I'm going to skip this. Now, I think I have a little bit of time, so I want to talk a little bit about parallel basic data space. This is just This is just finished. So, Zanzen, you are going to see San Yam. I think Shishen, my former postdoc, he's going to talk about this in more detail. So, what happens is those paravascular space, this is actually from actual image. So, the paravascular space is very irregular. And so, in this particular paper, again, they are focused on hydrostatic. On hydrostatic pressure, and this is more or less a relatively recent paper. And they look at sort of the different shape when you do the cross-section and how they actually affect the flow because they have different resistance. And there is some experiment to show. To show the relationship between this is, I think, the non-dimensionalized version. And the bottom line is if you have different shape, the flow rate is quite different. And we didn't use that in this paper, and we actually were doing something more detailed. Something a more detailed model at the moment. I don't have the time to talk about that, but here is a one, two slides talk about how to incorporate the paravascular spaces into the model. So previously we have neuron, we have extra site, we have extracellular space. Now, if we add the paravascular space, and originally we thought maybe we should also add the We should also add the blood vessels, but it turns out it's way too complicated. So, we are going to leave that out and make some simple assumptions about how the paravax spaces has exchanged with the vessel. Okay, now for each one of those, we have at least five equations. So you can see. So, you can see there are a lot of equations and there are a lot of couplings. And getting this things to work actually takes a lot of time. So, we spend a year essentially on this. And oh, what happened? Ah, sorry. There is actually a movie, but it's not showing here. So it essentially shows that. Shows that the flow, the changes due to action potential, do not affect those perivascular. This is actually the paravascular space outside the arteries, outside the veins, but the paravascular space outside the capillaries actually is affected a lot by those action potential. Those action potential generated osmotics. And if I can say it with words, now I don't have the movie is if you do not consider the parabascular space, essentially you have the actual cellular space, which consists the effect of this. But if you look into this one, then you can actually have more clear. one then you can actually have more clear picture of of high how the ions are transported and then how the other metabolic waste what we call is transported and and this was a question raised again 10 I think 10 years ago we had a workshop at Fields at the time and we have some people coming And we have some people coming from the medical schools. And they actually, at the time, they hypothesized that the plastic actually goes through those glilias, but not only goes to the astrocyte, it actually goes to the paravascular space. And one thing I did not mention. Maybe I. Maybe I go back to that carton picture. Ah, this one. Um This gap is actually quite small. It doesn't show, it's actually on this side. They found there are a lot of water channels. So there are a lot of water channels, but only on this side. And obviously, that has to serve a purpose. That has to serve a purpose, right? So, we have that sort of in the model that there is exchange between the paravascular space and the glia cells. There are some leak into the so-called extracellular space, but this water channel actually plays a very important role for water exchange between the glia and the paravascular space, which carries the potassium with it. So there are a lot of answered questions and which I think we didn't do any of that because just complicated. We only look at this at a very high level. I see John is standing up. So I'm going to stop here. Thank you very much.
