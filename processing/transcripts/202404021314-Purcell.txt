Please introduce our next speaker, Jessica Purcell, all the way from Australia, on excluding cosmetic surgeries on knots in tuna. Right. Well, thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me. As you can see, this is joint work with Dave Buder and Saul Schleimer. Okay, and I'm going to try and use my tablet to write some notes, but the setup is But the setup is a little awkward. So we'll see how that works. Anyway, I wanted to start. This is a conjecture I'm talking about is a conjecture about dane filling. So just to make sure that everyone is on the same page, when we're talking about dane filling, we have N. So N is going to be a compact orientable three-manifold. And it has a torus boundary. Generally, you can have multiple torus boundaries. For this dot, we'll just stick with one. And then S will be a slope on the torus. And what this is, this is an isotopic class of simple closed curves. Okay. So, what we're going to do to obtain a Dane filling of N along the slope S, you attach a solid torus so that your curve S bounds a disk in the solid torus. Okay, so attach, this is a schematic picture, the boundary by a homeomorphism of this. Of this, the boundary. And this homeomorphism takes the boundary of D2 to your slope S. Okay, so throughout, I am going to use the words Dane filling and Dane surgery interchangeably. I think originally, Dane surgery, you had a curve in there that you drilled out and then you filled it in a different. In there that you drilled out and then you filled it in a different way. But I'm always going to start with a manifold with a torus boundary and we're going to fill in a solid torus format. Okay, and then the other thing that I am going to do is I'm going to assume that this boundary, this torus, is incompressible. Okay, so if you have an irreducible manifold, which we will, then this just means you're not looking at the solid torus. You're not looking at the unknot in this sentence. Unknot sentence. Okay, so this is the manifold construction that we are looking at. And then I need to tell you what a cosmetic surgery pair is. So again, we've got the same setup. So n is going to be the compact, orientable, three-manifold. And the boundary of n even is a torus. And I'm going to take And I'm going to take two slopes, so S T are slopes on this torus. And we say that the pair S T is a cosmetic surgery pair there is a homeomorphism. Is a homeomorphism from the Dane-filled manifold using the S slope to the Dane-filled manifold using the T slope. Okay, and this is called chirally cosmetic. If E reverses orientation And it is purely cosmetic if it's orientation-preserving. So, this sort of schematic picture, you'll have these. You'll have these two manifolds, N of S. There's going to be some distinguished core of a Dane-filling solid torus. You'll have a homeomorphism to N of T. There's going to be some distinguished core of the Dane-filling solid torus over here. And Phi is a homeomorphism between those two. So you'll have various images of the other things. Okay, so that is a Okay, so that is a cosmetic surgery pair. And the terminology, I think, came from Cameron Gordon. If you do these two different surgeries, but you get the same thing, it really wasn't, it was just cosmetic. Okay, so Cameron Gordon made this cosmetic surgery conjecture that there are no purely cosmetic pairs of slopes. So, this is purely necessary. There are chirally cosmetic slopes. So, for example, back in 1998, there's a paper of Weilert, Hodgson, Weeks, where they show that if you take your manifold. If you take your manifold to be the census manifold M172, and you take S to be 0 on 1, and T to be the slope 1 on 1, then N of S and N of T are these are oppositely oriented copies of a lens space. Okay, so they're oppositely oriented copies. So this is not a counterexample to Gordon's conjecture, unless it could happen that this lens space L4918 could be homeomorphic to its mirror image, but it's not. Okay, so this is so the 1998, the cosmetic surgery conjecture, live to see another day. All right. Does it mean like blobby? No, it doesn't. It does not. So there are examples both ways, and we'll see some of those. Okay, so evidence. So evidence for the cosmetic surgery conjecture. Cosmetic surgery conjecture is known for many examples, especially when we're talking about knots in the three-sphere. So, if you're looking at the complement of a knot in the three-sphere, then many people over the years have shown partial results. You have a knot of genus one, you have a torus knot, two-bridge knots, pretzel knots, connected sums, non-trivial tables. All of these satisfy the purely cosmetic surgery conjecture. And what I'm going to talk about today Today is more evidence along these lines. So the cosmetic surgery conjecture holds for all non-trivial knots up to 19 crossings. So here's the proof, which you can see in my handwriting, which you can't read, but let me. So by this work of Tau on the previous page, this holds for non-prime mounts. So we've only got to check the prime mounts. So now Ben has. So now Ben has 352,152,252 prime knots of less than or equal to 19 crossings. So we just run through each of those and check that the cosmetic surgery convention holds for them. Okay. And part of the thing that we are excited about, about this project, is that we have our code is available. If you have any Dane surgery questions, you can. Dane surgery questions. You can find it on GitHub. Here it is. You can see that's Saul Schleimer's directory. So you can find the code and you can check various bound holds. Okay, and so this is where I need to put in a little caveat. Back at the very beginning of this conference, somebody said something about how Sage now is really easy to get running on a Mac or a Linux machine, and you can. On a Mac or a Linux machine, and you can use SnapP on top of that, and things work really great. I have a C, so I never bothered to get the program running on my computer. So if you have specific coding questions, I'm going to have to bounce them back to my co-authors. Is Saul here? Saul? Okay, so you're going to have to wait until tomorrow when he shows up again. If you have any questions on specific code, I have a question. I have a question. Is that how you spell my last name? Your H doesn't exist. That's the H. Sorry, that's an H. This is why I like to use a tablet. I'll be my last question. Okay, great. Okay, so Saul is here. So if you have any specific coding questions, I can refer them to you. Okay, great. All right, so how are we going to check this conjecture? Well, we have 352,152,252 knots to check. We pretty much we're going to use other people's tools most of the time. Or I'm giving too much away. We're going to start by using other people's tools. So Counselman has a result from 2023 that shows that if you have a purely cosmetic hair, then one of a couple things happens. Pair, then one of a couple things happens. So either the genus, this is the cipher genus. Cipher genus. So either the genus of your not is 2, and it's a plus or minus 2 slope, or it could be that you have a plus or minus 1 over q slope, but q now is bounded. So you've only got finitely many slopes to check. And what is it bounded by? So it's bounded by this, this is the thickness from Hagar. This is the thickness from Hagar florology. Here's the cipher genus again, and then we have under the dominator we've got cipher genus again. Okay, so this is a big deal. So in addition to only having 352,000,252 knots to check, we also have a bounded number of slopes to check, depending on the genus and the thickness of the knot. Thickness of the knot. Another result that was handy came from Boyer and Lines. So they looked at the Castan invariant, which is half of the derivative of the Alexander polynomial with one plugged in. And so if that happens to be non-zero, then there are no purely cosmetic surgeries. We have a bunch of other tests. I'll show you them in a second. And then we're also using some hyperbolic geometry. Okay, so here are our tests. This is a table from our paper. We've got, so the Casson invariant is the Boyer and lines. There's a quick, there are ways to check. So this thickness comes from Hayard floor homology. It's actually kind of complicated to check, but there are ways to bound it. So, for example, there is work of Of Adam Lawrence, that should be an O, I think. Who, well, you can bound it based on the tariad genus. Adam Lawrence has work on that. And then you can plug in some work of Wang. There's some Jones derivative due to each R and Wu. Dacheri has a TQFT test. There's a Cipher genus test. Ni and Wu have a Tau environment. And then Councilman has this. And the councilman has this Hagar floor homology. And this is, we re-ran them just to see how they did up to 16 crossings. What's pulling the biggest or most of the weight? And this one is pretty good. So the Cherries TQMT test. For this one, I thought I said a little bit more of this. I didn't. Okay, so just let me just say this particular test due to Renaud the cherry, you compute. You compute the Jones polynomial and you plug in e to the 2Ï€i over 5, then you check the Turayev genus of the diagram is less than or equal to 15, and this value is not equal to 1, then there are no And there are no cosmetic surgeries. Okay, so that one ended up being pretty powerful. This is a cherry. Okay, and so that's what we did. So we proved, here's our theorem, the causal. We proved, here's our theorem: the cosmetic surgery conjecture holds for all non-trivial knots up to 19 crossings. And we took 352,152,252 knots and we used the tests above, and we eliminated all but two. So everybody else eliminated all but two. Here are the two that are left at their codes. Codes. Our final tool that we use is hyperbolic geometry. So Henselmann tells us that the only possible slope pairs are plus or minus one, plus or minus two. And then we just, by hand, checked that these have different verified hyperbolic volumes. Okay, so there you go. So there's a by hand? Well, by hand we mean by snappy in Sage. Snappy in Sage using verified hyperbolic tetrahedra. What's special about these? They're pretty. I don't know. I don't know what's special about them. There's a recent paper of Ijihara and someone else, John. Someone else, John, I think, that proved the cosmetic conjecture. They said that if it holds for alternating knots, then it has to have a particular bounded twist number in a particular form. This one is alternating, and it happens to have one of those forms. So that's kind of special. This one's not alternating, though. Okay, we can do more. So, how we really got into this is we were looking at more general three-manifolds and trying to prove the cosmetic surgery condition on more general three-manifolds. So, this is a theorem that kind of started us on this path. And maybe instead of reading that for you, let me just Reading that for you, let me just paraphrase what's going on here. Let's suppose that you have a hyperbolic three-manifold and you have a sufficiently long slope, whatever that means. So this was something I should say was observed in this paper by Weiler, Hodgson, and Weeks. If you have a very, very long slope on your three-manifold, and you do a Dane filling, then Thurston says the geometry is going to be pretty close to that of the unfilled field, which means that your curve, when you do the Dane filling, is going to be. Curve when you do the Dane filling is going to be extremely short. It's going to become the shortest curve in your Dane filling. This is called the system. So let me maybe write some of this down. If N is hyperbolic and S is sufficiently long, then the filling will be hyperbolic. And the core of your Dane-filling solid torus is very short. So in particular, it will become the system. So it will be a unique. So, it will be a unique shortest curve in the field manifold. All right, so now let's suppose you have a homeomorphism from, we're calling these S and S prime. So you have a homeomorphism from the Dane-filled N of S to the Dane-filled N of S prime. Well, it's got to take, this is going to be an isometry. It's got to take the system to the system. And okay, take sister to sisal. This under the hood here is lost out person rigidity. You upgrade that using Debye to be an isotopy. And then this is going to restrict to a homeomorphism. Now, from you take the filled thing and you remove the core, that's your original. The other filled thing removing the other core, that's also your original, and this is taking the slope to this slope. Okay, so what so this was a known basically the known argument, but what we did is we made this. But what we did is we made this effective. So, using some cone deformation theory of Hodgson and Kirchhoff and upgrading this to be calculable, we found out exactly how long do you need to be for this curve to become a system. And the answer is that if your normalized lengths are at least the maximum of 9.97, or this thing involving the system of your manifold, then this is what you get. This is what you get. Okay? So, in particular, if your system is bigger than 0.145, then this will hold. Okay, so now if you give me a manifold, we can use this theorem to check whether it satisfies the cosmetic surgery conjecture. So, our procedure that we coded essentially does the following. So, first of all, we find all the exceptional vein fillings. These are the ones that are not hybrid. Exceptional Dainfillins. These are the ones that are not hyperbolic. We're going to compare the non-hyperbolics to non-hyperbolic ones separately. This uses a lot of, I should credit Nathan Dunfield. He did a lot of work on looking at exceptional census manifolds. So then, step two, we're going to look at all of the, we have this upper bound now, due to this theorem that says we don't need to look at any other slopes beyond these. At any other slopes beyond these. So we have our system short slopes. These are the guys that will not give us a system, guaranteed, at least by our theorem. So we need to check these. So these are the guys that we're going to check. If it happens that we have a homeomorphism of two manifolds, then we're going to have the same volume. Well, and then there are bounds in terms of volumes on slopes as well. So we have finitely many comparison slopes. So we're going to check the guys in two. The guys in two with the guys in three, and we're going to report any failures, basically. So, anything that is, what does a failure mean? It means if we fail to distinguish the two. And how do we distinguish them? We use different tools for the exceptional manifolds. When we have hyperbolic manifolds, then you can use all sorts of hyperbolic invariants. Okay, so let me just So let me just okay so here is another theorem. So if you avoid knots in the three spheres, and I've left the land of the conference, as I'm off looking at general hyperbolic three manifolds, so my apologies to the organizers. So, my apologies to the organizer, but you get what you get. Anyway, if you look at the 59,107 one-cussed manifolds in the SNAPB census, then they all satisfy the cosmetic surgery conjecture, provided SNAPB's systal calculation is correct. So, we have been using verified hyperbolic structures on everything up to this point. There is currently no verified systal copulation. Currently, no verified system calculation in SnapP. This is a point of concern, and Saul can attest that we have been bothering Matthias Gerner about this quite a bit, and he is always, he's working on it, still working on it. Saul, how's he doing now? Going great, really wonderful. It's well in the hand. Excellent, excellent. Yes. So what you mean by verifying here is it's like using interval arithmetic and things like that. Using interval arithmetic and things like that. That's right, yes, using interval arithmetic, yeah. Like the balances of the code. Yeah, that's right. So, okay, so actually I wanted to write this down. So corrected within 1%. So this is, so all our calculations are rigorous. Except, verify, except system. But we have, there are people working on this. So when they are done, then this will be, we can drop that last line from the theorem here. Okay, so let's see. I was going to sketch out a proof. Did I do that? Oh, I did, yeah. Okay, here we go. Did I do that? Oh, I did, yeah. Okay, here we go. Okay, so the proof. The program distinguishes all but five hyperbolic, or non-hyperbolic pairs and two hyperbolic pairs. And so when I say distinguish, so actually I had to write to Dave and Saul this morning because there was another example that I was afraid that we shouldn't have been distinguishing, but we were. But anyway, distinguish, what do we do? In the hyperbolic case, we look at What do we do? In the hyperbolic case, we look at things like volumes, we look at Chern-Simons. We're only looking for orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, which allows you to rule some things out based on plus and minus signs. Anyway, these are the five that we found. Sorry, I guess that's seven. So one of them was this Lyler-Hudson-Meets example. I pointed it at the beginning. These are oppositely oriented copies of this lens space. The other ones had a similar Had a similar pattern, and was an ampichiral manifold. That means it has this reflective symmetry, and the reflection exchanges the two slopes. So, this means that these two Dane fillings are guaranteed to be orientation-reversing, homeomorphic. We're not done because if these manifolds also are homeomorphic to their reflection, then this would be a counterexample to the cosmetic surgery conjecture. Example to the cosmetic surgery conjecture, but in fact, in all of these seven cases, we can prove that it's actually they don't have this symmetry. So these are chiral mallows. Okay. Okay, well that kind of brings us to another open conjecture. So I've been talking about purely cosmetic surgery conjectures. About purely cosmetic surgery conjectures. I've gone through all of the manifolds, all the census manifolds that I can. I don't think we have 20 knots up yet, these two billion, right? There's a problem with hot drunk space. Yeah, okay, good. Okay. We've done everything that we can. So we are interested also in this chirally cosmetic surgery conjecture due to Ichikaira, Ito, and Sevito. So they have been looking at what happens if you have these orientation reversing homeomorphisms. And based on various things that they've proven, various experiments, they are conjecturing that if you have a knot in the three-sphere that isn't the two R torus knots, and you look at its complement, let's suppose that you have a chirally cosmetic pair. So now you have a homeomorphism that reverses. So now you have a homeomorphism that reverses the orientation. Their conjecture is that, in fact, the original knot has an orientation reversing symmetry. It's hypochiral. And that these two slopes are just opposites of each other under the symmetry. I should say here, let me just make a quick note: what their conjecture is actually. Their conjecture is actually stronger. They also have some conditions. So, if it's a 2R torus knot, then there are certain slopes that are always known to give you a chiral cosmetic pair. And they conjecture those are the only ones. But I'm a hyperbolic geometer, and two are torus knots aren't hyperbolic, so we've kind of ignored those. Okay, so, but they do have Let me just write this here particular slopes on these are knots. Okay, so these six manifolds from the previous slides down here, these guys, these all would satisfy that. Would satisfy that. Notice that they are requiring knots in the 3-sphere, though. And these are not necessarily in the 3-sphere. Okay, it turns out that you must have knots in the 3-sphere because otherwise this doesn't hold. So outside the 3-sphere, these six examples are okay, but Ichihara and Zhang have found a hyperbolic manifold with hyperbolic pirally cosmetic surgeries that would not satisfy this. Nathan also. To satisfy this, Nathan also found this manifold 0939009 with a highly cosmetic pair, where the core curves are isotopic to distinct geodesics. So because they are distinct, they can't be preserved by this, or you can't have this behavior of this reflection taking the one slope to the other. Okay. Right. Right. Okay, so then we have more evidence towards the chiral cosmetic surgery conjecture. So if you look at all of the 313,209, sorry, 313,209 hyperbolic knots up to 15 crossings, then again we need this caveat that provided the systal calculation is correct to within one percent, and the pyroly cosmetic surgery contexture will hold. Cosmetic surgery conjecture will be. Okay. So let's prove this. Prove. Okay, so we ran our program on all of these knots and we only had, by our Sistal Short theorem, there were a finite number of slopes to check. Slopes to check. And when we went through these finite number of slopes on these finite number of knots, then the program successfully distinguished all the allowable powers. This is from this system theorem. Okay. That is a quite short proof for what actually took some significant time. There were some particularly difficult knots. This is our list of hard knots. They're the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. I don't know. There's some number of 14. There's some number of 14 crossing knots, and we went looking for these. And it turns out that if you like plug these knots into Google, it brings you up a website of Steumanoff, who has noted that each of these knots is a mutant of its mirror image. So if you have a mutation, it does not distinguish things like hyperbolic volume. So these, they're not ampichiral. Amphichiral, but a mutation of neuroimage made it very, very difficult. So we had to throw out the easy checks. So this is a picture of 14A506. This guy, this one, was particularly difficult. That was the hardest. What we ended up doing is we looked at homologies of covers of these things in order to distinguish the name fillings. Dame fillings. And this guy took six days on eight cores. So, okay, we didn't have Ben's supercomputer, but most of us don't. Anyway, it took a long time, this particular knob. Okay, well, so, alright, so we've done cosmetic surgeries, chirally cosmetic surgeries. You can actually use this to detect common Dane fillings as well. So Effie and Calta Johnny Melvy. Calfa Johnny Melby asked us, Hey, do you know how we could check which manifolds have a common day in surgery with a figure eight knot? And we realized, yeah, well, we could plug this into our program to figure it out. So here you go. So among the knots, you notice that we're kind of dropping down the numbers of crossings as we go along. I guess it gives us something more to do. But of these, these are taking a little. These are taking a little bit longer each step. So, of the 12,955 hyperbolic knots with the most 13 crossings, there are 23 that share a common hyperbolic filling with the figure 8 knot. Here they are. In fact, the 5-2 knot, I believe, has two common Dane fillings with the Figure 8 knot. And provided SNAP P's system calculations are correct to within 1%, then this is a complete list. Okay. So, um yeah, I am I have I still have a lot of time but uh this is what I have prepared, so I'll stop there. So, thank you. I'm still a little confused. How do you how do you what's what's the process of proving this? We discussing things. Trying to compare all the systols of the well, the systoles of the figure eight knot with each of these systems or or each surgery on the figure eight knot? Yeah, so we're looking at the surgeries on the figure eight knot. So if you have a common filling, all right, so now I have to remember how this goes. So if you have a common Dane filling with the figure eight knot, then it's going to have the same volume as the figure eight knot. And so then you know which slopes. You know which slopes might have the same volumes as these fillings. But yeah, yeah, so in order to, I guess that's more of the second step, too. So you're right. So we do have to first, we need to look at possible systals, right? So if you do a high Dane filling on the figure A knot, if it's high enough, then that's going to become your systal. And if you have a common Dane filling, then it needs to take the systal to the systal, and so you'll get this. Take the system to the system, and so you'll get this map taking the complement to the complement. So that's not going to happen. So if the slope is too long, then there's no possible way that it can have the common name filling. So that's where we need it, again, we need the system calculation. Okay, so, all right, so then given that, then we look at possible things that have similar volumes to the Dane fillings. We have a finite number of things to check. We look at all their volumes. We look at which Dane fillings on these other manifolds might give. Stained fillings on these other manifolds might give you knots with correct volumes, basically. And that gives us another finite list. And then we check these two lists together. And sometimes we get, as opposed to proving the cosmetic surgery conjecture where we never get the same thing, sometimes we do get the same thing and then we need to prove that we are actually getting the same thing. Yes. I have a question with the. So there's this caveat that the theorems work if Snappy's sysstole calculations are correct within 1%. So I presume getting the sysdol out of Snappy is fast. Is there, like, do you have, I'm also guessing that if I compute the sysdale, maybe I get a slightly different number from you based on the hardware or the whatever. So is there, like, do you have data so that once you have a number of people? Do you have data so that once Matthias has finished this code, you can just rerun the sysall calculations and know that you're done? Or does it require sort of rerunning the whole machinery again? Does this question make sense? Yeah, yeah, no, no, it makes sense. So this correct to within 1%, basically, we gave ourselves an error bound. So Snappy is going to give us a calculation now, and provided it's within a certain box, then these results. Then these results are provably true. So once we have a verified SISTL, hopefully this will be able to show us that, yeah, the calculation is within this particular box generically. You won't have to rerun the whole thing. But hey, we can. Why not? Your comment about calculating system is relatively fast. That actually turns out to be false. So the hardest manifolds to deal with were the ones with the shortest systems. And I don't know the data on that off my head which ones were the. Data on that off my head, which ones were the worst. But the guys with the really short systems, well, part of the reason, if you go back to our theorem, super short system means you have tons and tons of slopes to calculate. That actually isn't as big of a deal as computing the system when it's very small. Yeah? So I could just make an editorial comment about the system. So the thing is that So the thing is that finding the system is much harder than finding the volume like that, which if you can already do a verified format, is you have to build the Dear Schlade domain. Prove and sort of tile that out and then get for all elements. So you have to sort of be able to build the Dear Schloy domain in a verified manner. Crystal is short. It's actually just generically difficult to fill the Dirichlet domain because of this. That's why I like somehow do all the other steps verify what this is the missing piece of your explanation. I think here's some actual like you have to think about like what's the right approach for this. It's not so I mean the general algorithm like Hodge and the Weeks worked out years ago. It's not just like these other things where you just do something and you just like competing the ball. And you just put in the volume, I mean, literally, just do exactly what you did. For the employee, it's more subtle. That's why it's evaded by people for a long time. Is there a question online? Yeah, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Yeah, I'm trying to compute the um the length spectrum without actually computing material photomates first. Computing material domains first because that one is like a real bottleneck for the short cystal case. And I'm also trying to actually be able to compute the length spectrum for span triangulation by actually deforming the thing and ignoring the locus around the GOD sig. And so that gives me a huge performance case if you actually think of the If you actually think of the manifold as a sprint triangulation or English, what do you think? Nice. Is this Matthias? Yes. Hi, Matthias. That's great. Keep it up. Excellent. Great. Does anybody else want to jump in from the sky and add something? Other questions? Can you go back to the next page? This page? Oh, no. The last page? Yeah, yeah, that's the one. Sorry. No, I can't. Okay. No, let me. That's okay. I was just wondering, this 1%, does it follow particular examples here? Do you know which notes are affected by? Affected by the 1%? I mean, I think all of the populations are affected by that because we do need this system to bound the number of slopes that we are doing. I see. Because David was the man who couldn't decide, but okay. I mean, I'm... I'm pretty confident in Snap P. So I would be shocked if any of those happened. I would be shocked if any of those calculations are off by one part. You could change that one percent to one over a million percent. If we change that to one over a million percent, I think that that might be computationally prohibitive. I don't think we would be able to. Do some of these just come because you allow them to. Oh, no, no, no, no, they don't. No, no. No, they don't. No. No. No, they're all. They're all. Once we find these, so these are all provably. We find these guys, we find the slopes, we prove this is indeed a common daintier. So this can be done. So this can be done very rigorously. The provided means, well, maybe we should have been checking a couple more manifolds, a couple more slopes. But that seems highly unlikely. Highly unlikely. Just to answer, maybe, a question that's kind of floating around: probably the error in the system computations done by Snappy is less than 1 in 10 to the 14. So when we say we only need to be correct to 1%, as Nathan says, that's being extremely conservative. We're almost certainly right. I guess it's no way to say. We're almost certainly right. We're almost certainly right. Questions? So we have a coffee break now.
