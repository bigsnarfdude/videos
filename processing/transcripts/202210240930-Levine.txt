Well, thank you, Liam and Andrew, and Ellie and Absentia for organizing this. This is my first in-person conference since COVID started. And it's just such a joy to see all of these folks who I've known for a long time. And actually, even more exciting, seeing people who I haven't gotten a chance to know yet. And especially, I think, in the past couple of years, watching the Especially, I think, in the past couple of years, watching the current crop of graduate students and postdocs who are just doing out there doing such really great work in this field who I haven't got a chance to meet has been very, very strange. And so it's been, it's a real joy to see a lot of you here. And yeah, I'm and especially in such a beautiful setting. So, all right. So inspired by the title of this of this conference, I just Of this conference, I decided to call the talk using Hagar Floorhomology to construct interesting four-manifolds. And what do I mean by that? Well, Hagar floor homology doesn't construct four manifolds, but what's our goal? Big goal in four-manifold topology is to construct exotic four-manifolds. And by exotic, I mean homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic. But not diffeomorphic to your favorite examples to familiar manifolds. Friedman tells us that for smooth manifolds, smooth, simply connected four manifolds, they are completely classified up to homeomorphism by their algebraic topology, by their intersection forms. Their section forms. And so, you know, so an example, I mean, the holy grail here would be to construct something that's homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic to S4. That would be the smooth four-dimensional Poincar√© conjecture. S1 cross S3, well, that's not simply connected, but its fundamental group is Z, so almost as good. What about S2 cross S2? CP2 connects some CP2 bar. All right, so if we could construct four manifolds that were homeomorphic to these things, but not diffeomorphic, well, that would be a pipe tree. I'm not going to do that today. But what I am going to do is, so there are going to do is uh so there are lots of there certainly exist lots of exotic uh manifolds so when i say um let's say homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to um to for example cp2 connects some k cp2 bars for k Two bars, 4k, you know, basically any number greater than or equal to 2. You can find some known examples. So, and there's a whole lots of names, a whole lot of names associated to these work, Donaldson and Akhbulu and Ahmedov Park and lots of many other names. Okay, now, why, how, what's new here? Hagar Florida. Hagar floor homology, the whole idea of when Andrew Fonzabo introduced Hagard floor homology over 20 years ago now, the hope was that it would somehow be easier to compute than cyber-Witten invariance, but it would be usable for a lot of the same kinds of things that you could ultimately get for you that you would get a closed four-manifold invariant that could be used to actually compute. Compute, um, uh, you know, to detect all these exotic kinds of things, and that it would be you could compute it without doing any kind of annoying gauge theory, um, because gauge theory is hard. Um, that has proven to be difficult. So, Hager flirolology does have a four-manifold invariant, but in some sense, the closed form, all of the results about maybe I won't say all, but most of the known results about the Hagard floor homology closed four-manifold invariant. Floor homology closed four manifold invariant are somehow replicating what could already be done in cyber-Gwitten theory. And so it hasn't really led to a ton of new breakthroughs in terms of closed exotic form manifolds. It's led to a ton of breakthroughs in terms of exotic surfaces and manifolds, especially things with boundary. I can't even begin to list all of the names there. I can't even begin to list all of the names there. But so the question that Ty Lidman and Lisa Piccarello and I have been thinking about a lot is: as we, the community, have gotten really good at computing Hagar floor homology in recent years, and particularly with developments such as the involutive structure of Hagar floor homology and the mapping class group actions on Hagar floor homology. Homology. Can we somehow revisit that? And can we build four manifolds inspired by what we understand about Hagar floor homology and the ways that we can compute Hagar fluorhomology groups of three manifolds and mapping class group actions and action and cobordism things to build up the three the four manifolds bit by bit in such a way that we know that the Hager-Florhamontology will come with the Hager-Florhomontology will come out with that the closed four manifold invariants will come out to be what we want. Okay, so let me just write that down. Um, is inspired by how Hagar phloomology works, and in particular, involutive structure, and the mapping class group actions, which are And the mapping class group actions, which are areas that where we've really seen a lot of improvement in the past couple years. So what I want to talk about is build four manifolds in such a way that we guarantee that we get some kind of non-zero. We get some kind of non-zero closed four-manifold invariant. That the Aujva-Sabo, I'll say, and I'm going to say more about how this works. The Aujva-Sabo four-manifold invariance comes out to be non-zero. And once you know that something is non-zero, then that's typically what you might use to deduce that you have some exotic format of all of my angles. Some exotic format of all binary. Okay. So maybe I'll just state a theorem using this approach. Oh, so I'll say using this approach, what can we do? We can. Using this approach, what can we do? We can construct an exotic CP2 connect some nine CP2 bars. Okay, now that's not the existence of exotic CP2 connects some nine CP2 bars is not really all that new. That goes back all the way to the really the 1980s and the beginnings of the story. And any gauge theory that's worth its thought can. And any gauge theory that's worth its thought can do that. But what I want to argue is that we can build up an example like this in terms of handle calculus and in terms of really understanding bit by bit the Hegel-Flur homology and its sort of proof of concept for an approach to creating maybe better examples. So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about how we do this, but also how one might go about trying to do this. That would be our real pipe dream. Our real pipe dream, and then we'll say, okay, I'll settle for a CP2 bloatu my cats. Okay, now there's something else that's actually a little bit different. We can also construct using the same kinds of computations, we get something that's a little bit more out of left fields. We construct, I'll talk about this at the end, an exotic manifold. It's not simply connected. It's connected homeomorphic. S1 and cross S3 connects some two CP2s, connect some nine CP2 bars. Okay. With, and how exotic is it? Well, it's exotic. Well, it's exotic enough that there's no, it doesn't have this kind of connect sum formula with no S1 cross S3 direct sum and. And this is a little different, and it actually suggests a somewhat different approach. In fact, the closed, the sort of traditional Argent closed four-manifold invariant, I believe, vanishes for this manifold, but we'll see that what. See that what's going to come out of this is sort of a slightly modified approach, an approach to proving something's exotic that makes use of the non-simply connected aspect of this. So I'll come back to that towards the end. But in some sense, this is meant to get the wheels turning and to hope that as people, I think there are a number of people in this room who have a lot of experience. People in this room who have a lot of experience thinking about Hager-Florhomology groups with three manifolds and knots. And hopefully, this will inspire a few problems. Okay, so let me actually tell you. Okay. This is an audience of people who work on these kinds of invariants. So, sorry, can I ask a question? Oh, shoot. Yes. Do you know that your exotic CP2s connected some nine CP2 bars are the same as some that had been previously constructed? Or I don't know that. I'm not sure how. I mean, maybe Ty or Liso could tell you that, but I don't think that we know. That but I don't think that we know um uh there are many many out there. Um, I think this is really meant as a as a sort of proof proof of concept that you could cook gof invariance to be non-zero, um, but not uh I don't know how it compares to all of the many many things that are out there in the literature. Cool. Yeah. Um okay so let me just I want to tell you a little bit about how the how the uh proposed four manifold invariant and Hangard flow homology works, um, and then we'll see how. Works, and then we'll see how this is motivated. Okay, so just the first reminder is that if you have y, this is going to be closed-oriented degree manifolds. Okay, and S is going to be a spin C structure on Y, you get. You get the associated to this are the Hegel flower homology groups. Oh, if you don't like spin C structures, think about them as elements of H upper two. They're basically basically the same thing. We get these Hagar floor homology groups. There's the infinity version. There's the plus version. There's the minus version. There's the minus version, and then there's an exact triangle relating them. I'll call this map delta, I'll call this map pi. Okay, and oh, I'm gonna do everything I'm gonna do here will be with coefficients in the field of two elements. There are a lot of things that could be done over z, although we're gonna be lazy. Okay, and just to establish some. Just to establish some terminology, um, so this group HF infinity is somehow usually the boring one, right? We basically know it, it's it just depends on the algebraic topology of the three manifolds. The interest is in these two, and they're somehow they contain the same information, but I want to just observe that the image of pi in this is what's known as, sorry, the co-kernel of pi. Of pi is what's known as hf red of y. And you could either think about that as being a quotient of, oh, and I should say all of this is within a within a spin c structure. That quotient, which you could think about, it's a quotient of this, but you could also think about it as being a subgroup of this under the inclusion. As a group of this under the inclusion, that's often the most interesting piece, especially as you that's the piece that we're going to really want to understand in a given time. Okay, so what's the version? There are a couple of different versions of this that we'll need. And let me just say that when this fins structure S is non-torsion. Non-torsion. So that is to say, you take it's the C, the first term class of the spin C structure, that's an element of H upper two. If it represents the non-torsion elements of H upper two, which this case will be interested in, this actually ends up splitting. So you HF minus of Y ends up being isomorphic to HF red. HF red of y plus HF infinity of YS okay, in a canonical way. I'm not going to go too far into the details of how that works, but essentially what you end up getting is a reverse map in this exact triangle. In this exact triangle, which I'll call capital pi, right? So that is to say that the reduced part is the, the plus part is equal to the reduced part in that setting. This becomes a split, a short split exact sequence. So to put it another way, I guess this map is zero. Okay. And there's a section to this map. Okay. Now, I'm not going to get into why that works because we're limited on. Into why that works because we're limited on. Yeah. Oh, no, as ampajoin U modules. Okay. Is this just as vector spaces over F? And no, I'm saying this is an actual splitting as F j modules. Okay. So in particular, what we have is there's have is there's there's this section of the map, right? This map pi is a map that takes you from HF minus to HF plus. Okay. And so now let's say I have, so X is going to be a closed four manifold. Okay. And let's suppose, I'm going to assume that B2 plus of X is Of x is positive. Really, the case I'm interested in is when it's equal to one. But I'm also going to have to assume that b2 minus of x is positive, is non-zero as well. Okay, so that is to say, it has indefinite intersection form. And as a result, there are classes in the intersection form with square zero. Okay, let's let alpha in H2 of X be a primitive. Square zero class. Okay, and what I'm going to do is I want to cut, let's let y in x is going to be a separating green manifold such that alpha is in the image of H2 of y. Of H2 of y mapping into H2 of X. Okay, right. So one way you could do this, for instance, is take a surface representing alpha, thicken it up to, you know, that surface across a disk, and then take the boundary of that. That would be one way of doing this. But you can always, but supposing we have this. What I'm going to spell out now is how the Auschwitzabo form manifold invariant works in this setting. And in particular, we'll have to understand why we have both, all of these different versions of Hager pleuromology hanging around. Okay, so here's my picture. Here's X. The whole thing is X. Here it separates along Y. I'm going to call this X1 and this X2. Those are going to be my two pieces. Okay. And then let's. Okay, and then let's drill out a little three ball on either end. Okay, so I can think about this as basically being a big cobordism from S3 to S3. And then I'm going to take, maybe I'll let it like I'll use Wi to mean XI minus this little four ball. Okay, and now I'm going to think about the following diagram. I'm going to take the HF minus of S. Hf minus of S3, that's just F adjoining U. And there's an induced map. Oh, let's say I have a spin C structure on X, and I can, and I'm just by abusive notation, I'm just going to use S to refer to its restriction everywhere else. Okay, so there's a map, there's a Hagar flow homology gives you a cobortism map. flow homology gives you a covortism map to HF minus of Y in that spin C structure. Be careful. Okay, and this is going to be called F minus W1 S. Okay, and now, oh, let's assume that S, I guess the assumption is that the first The assumption is that the first turn class of S evaluated on alpha is non-zero. Okay, so this is Fincy structure that is restricting to Y to be a non-torsion, a non-torsion class in here. Okay, now by what I just told you over here, there's this sort of canonical splitting of that map, which takes me now to into HF plus of. Of y in that stinse structure, right? This is, which is to say, this is, I guess I can call this HF red if you like. And then there's a map induced on HF plus that by the second half of the cobordism. So this is the map on HF plus reduced by, okay, and that's taking me into HF plus. Of S3 on the light ok. Oh, okay. I want to try to maybe the window in the back there is the Window in the back there is the theory. Okay. Ah, very good. Okay, good. So, how does this map work? So, how does the invariant go? The invariant go well, so hf minus of s3 is something that's very standard, so it's just f of join u. You can take the element one, okay, which is like the generator, and then map ask under this commutative diagram, what does it map to? And this group is basically what we call a tower, okay? And so the invariance is essentially this combined map, I'll call it the mixed map. I'll call it the mixed map of one, or at least though, in the most basic form, you choose the sort of the bottom element of this tower, right? The thing that's, I guess it's now like the thing that's in the image of you for all things. And you ask, is this, depending on gradings, what's the coefficient of that number that pops out? Okay, so ultimately, having non-zero, if I wanted to make sure that this map comes out to be non-zero, Comes out to be non-zero. Oh, and if it's non-zero, oh, let's let me let me call this map phi. This outcome is phi x sub s. It's a number, treated as a number in F2. And so the theorem of both of them sappho. The theorem of Oklahoma Sabo is that number one, this doesn't depend on what actual cut I chose, okay? Right, so it only depends on the spin C structure, and I guess the choice of the homology class alpha, but it didn't actually depend on the y, okay? Depend on the why. Okay. And then the second thing is that this gives me some kind of a genus bound. So if is non-zero, then we get an adjunction inequality. We get a, let me actually copy down what I I can't see. Ah, then the evaluation on alpha is less than or equal to two genus of where sigma is a surface embedded in okay, where I have some surface. Okay, the point is that ultimately, if you want, the goal is to. Ultimately, if you want, the goal is to cook up these numbers so that they will come out to be non-zero. And if you can do that, then you will probably get some kind of genus bound that will force some kind of exotic behavior in the manifold. Because in, for instance, SCP2 blown up some number of times, you've got lots of spheres hanging around. If you have a sphere or a torus representing your homology class, then that will force this to be zero. So when you can show that one of these classes is non-zero, that's going to be a way that it will tell you that you don't. Be a way that will tell you that you don't have a sphere or a torus representing the given the given homology class. Okay, and that's sort of good enough to get exact to Z. So the goal is to cook things up. So the goal is to get V of X non-zero. Okay, now there are three pieces to that. What needs to go right in order for you to To get that invariant to come out to be zero? Well, I guess there's two pieces, and they have to fit together. One is that this composition has to be non-zero. And the second bit is that this composition needs to be non-zero. And the third bit is that the composition has to be non-zero, right? I was like teaching linear algebra, like you know, matrix multiplication or something. Or something. But even just those first two pieces are a story that you might want to know. Okay, so need, let's just write this out. One thing I need is the map from HF minus of S3 to the map to HF minus, you know, reduced to HF red of Y S to be non-zero. And I need the map from HF plus. The map from HF plus of, oh, this is FW1. And I need this piece of the math to be non-zero, and I need the composition. Okay, great. Hey, Adam. Yes. In that, in the construction. In the construction of those maps, was the class alpha relevant, or this is for any alpha that satisfies this non-vanishing? Yeah, so the class alpha is relevant, right? So if you are doing this in a manifold with B2 plus bigger than one, then no, but for B2 plus equals one, yes. So you would need sort of a different one. There's a different set of invariants for each alpha. That's a great question. But does that mean alpha is baked into these maps, F sub? These maps f sub w sub comma s or yeah, because it's yes, because it's baked into the place of y. Ah, okay, yeah, right. So, okay, um, thank you. Okay, right. So, so those are the things that you'd want to achieve. So, let's let me try telling you something that doesn't, that you might hope. What would you need in order to get an exotic An exotic S2 cross S2 or maybe okay. How would you maybe try to go about this? And this is going to, I'm going to pose this as a little problem. Okay. Here's one way that you might try to achieve this. Okay. Let's suppose we could find, let's choose two knots, K1 and K2, and let's assume. two and let's assume that zero surgery on k1 is homeomorphic to zero surgery on k2 okay we might even suppose that k1 is equal to k2 that would guarantee that okay and let's suppose really that i choose a diffeomorphism the that uh that realizes that um that equivalence okay and what i can do is i will take the zero trace of Of so this is going to be the zero trace that is say the four wall union a two handle along k uh along k one, and I'm going to glue that to the zero trace of k2 with reversed orientation. And this will be either, depending a little bit on the algebraic topology of b, um, you'll either get an odd or an even intersection form. And it's an if it's an odd intersection form, it'll be homeomorphic. So this is guaranteed to be. So, this is guaranteed to be homeomorphic to either S2 cross S2 or CP2 commits some CP2 bar, depending on some bit of algebraic topology data. Okay, and now you might ask, what would I need if I wanted to get these invariants to be zero, these things to be non-zero? Okay. These things to be non-zero. Okay. Example, by the way, if I just took k1 to be equal to k2, and I just took phi to be the identity, then I'm just constructing the double. Okay, and the double, so if k1 is equal to k2 and phi is equal to the identity, then the thing that I'm getting is actually diffeomorphic to s2 cross s2. This is a nice little exercise that's in Gonfonso. Okay, but the hope is maybe you could get this to work out in a non-trivial way. Okay, now I'm going to point some things out about this. So we want to need, we need, these were the two criteria that we needed to satisfy in order to have some hope of getting a non-trivial four-manifold invariant and thus an exotic manifold. Okay. Now, I can tell you exactly when these two things are true. Okay. Two things are true. Okay, that's a thing that's interesting. So there's these, the VI's are these concordance invariants from Hagar floor homology. So this, let's say, into I and the integers, but I'm going to care about the non-negative integers. This is this family of four manifold invariants. Family of four manifold invariants. And it's a lemma, which I think probably a folk result. I'm sure various people have observed this, which is to say that at least for I greater than or equal to zero, the map from HF minus to S3 to HF minus reduced of the zero surgery on Of the zero surgery on K in the ith spin C structure. So I can index. So spin C structures on the zero surgery are indexed by integers. Okay. This map induced by the zero trace is non-zero if and only if I think it's the i of k is non-zero. Okay. And And so that's my answer to criterion number one. Okay. Criterion number two: the map from HF plus of zero surgery on K to in the I-spin C structure to HF plus of S3 is non-zero. Is non-zero in the right place. I'm just going to say if and only if the i of k bar of the mirror of k is non-zero. Okay? So something I'll point out is that, oh, the new plus, this is the hom woo. Plus, this is the Ham Wu concordance invariance. This is defined to be the minimum i such that vi is zero. Okay, so here's, and there's an inequality, the tau invariant is always less than or equal to nu plus. Okay, I'm throwing a lot at you, but let me point out the following. If you could find a pair of knots with this A pair of knots with this property, okay, if I knew that tal of k1 was a positive number and tal of k2 was a negative number, and the zero surgeries were the same, then I would have satisfied both of these conditions. Satisfies both of these conditions. Okay. And I could then conceivably, this is where I should be looking to try to find an exotic S2 cross S2. Okay. Now, there are plenty of examples known thanks to Yasui. There are examples known of knots who have the same zero surgery, but different taus. But as far as I know, there are no known examples of same zero surgery, but taus of opposite sign. Okay, and so I want to. And so I want to put this out there as a question that is worth thinking about then maybe could construct an exotic S2 cross S2. Okay, now, all right, that's very ambitious. Another way that you might go about this, by the way, is if you could find or a not K. Or a knot K, maybe a single knot K, with V1 of K non-zero and V1 of K bar non-zero. And you would need to know one more thing. You would need to know and map and class group of the zero surgery non-trivial. Okay, so if you're interested in trying to find a non-trivial S2 cross S2, that would be a, those would be a That would be a those would be some places to look. Yeah. But the connexons screw up the zero surgeries. Can you take, could you realize this by taking just a pair of knots that have the same zero surgery and different tau and take connect sums with something something standard? And the problem is that we'll screw up your zero surgeries. So yeah, we spent a bunch of time thinking. We spent a bunch of time thinking about different constructions to get this. All right, well, this is very nice. So now I've spent most of my talk talking about things that don't work. So what about things that do work? Okay. So you could try, one thing that I want to point out is that you could try to relax this a little bit. For instance, you don't have to, you wouldn't have to use the actual zero trace. Okay. Actual zero trace. Okay. Another, instead of the actual zero traces, could use four manifolds that look like the zero traces, but maybe are built in some more complicated way, and maybe have a have something more non-trivial. Now, okay, could use other formats. Other four manifolds, you know, quote-unquote homology traces. If that, if that were your goal, just as two cross-s2s, you could, you know, that look like, you know, with same standard homology as a zero trace. Okay. And maybe you'd have some better hope of getting that. Now, I just erased my list of criteria, but I swept one big thing under the rug here. It's not just enough to have these two maps to come out to be non-zero. To come out to be non-zero, you need their composition to be non-zero, okay? And if we want to make that happen, we should hope we should use some manifold y with hf minus of y in that spin c structure to be nice and small. Okay, right? If those groups were really big, then the composition of two maps, you know, chances are that composition might come out to be zero. But on the other hand, Might come out to be zero. But on the other, you know, if this reduced thing were actually equal to just a one-dimensional vector space, for instance, then you'd be golden. Because if you have a non-zero map in and a non-zero map out, then that would tell you that the composition was non-zero. Okay, so where might we find such a thing? Okay. Oh, and if we don't want to use zero creation, maybe we could use some manifolds that have a bit more homology kicking around. A bit more homology kicking around, okay? But, you know, and so if you're not just interested in exotic S2 cross S2s, but bigger exotic manifolds that have a little bit more homology, then okay, maybe this will increase our chances of actually finding something interesting here. And that's exactly what we ended up doing. Okay, so just to state an example, Let's take K to be a fibered amphichiral genus 2 not. Okay, so for instance, K is going to be the square knot. Okay. So it then turns out that HF red of y in the one spin C structure, in the spin C structures plus or minus one, is just going to be. Okay. So the prop now, and the fact that it's antichiral really just means that we we just need to find some x one. X1, we just need the first half of this story, okay, such that this map on HF minus from in some spin C structure from HF minus of S3 to HF red of y in the S1 of Y is going to be Y is the zero surgery on day. Okay, so I just Okay, so I just need to cook up an example for which this map ends up being non-zero. Okay, because once I have that, then I actually just take x2 to be the, I take x2 to be x1 bar. Oh, no, x2 to be x1, essentially. Use the same three manifold again, just thought about it in the other direction and glue them together. And I'm going to guarantee that this all works out. Okay, assuming, maybe assuming something about the gradings. Maybe assuming something about the gradings. And this is what we managed to do. Okay, I got like form. So let me tell you a little bit about how we did this. We're just trying to cook up, you know, to find the right Bohr manifold here. Okay. And Here's, I'm going to draw. I'm actually going to do something really ambitious here. It actually attempts to draw some pictures of knots on a blackboard. Okay, let's call this not PN. So, this is some number of full twists, and I'm going to draw something very similar. And I'm going to draw something very similar, just without that little twist in the middle. Okay, so this is a family, and I'm going to call these knots Qn, and Q0 is the square knot, and P0 is the Stevedor's knot. Okay, so these are twist knots. These are, sorry, not twist knots, these are ribbon knots. Are sorry, not ribbons. These are ribbon knots. You can see they're fusion number one ribbon knots. Okay. And it turns out that these have some really nice properties. The one surgery on PM is the same as the. Oh, first let's observe that the zero surgery, the plus. That the zero surgery, the plus or minus one surgeries on these all, that these are all bound contractible. Okay. The second property that I want to observe is that the plus one surgery on Pn is the same, is homeomorphic to the minus one surgery on Qn minus. On Qn minus 4. And the one surgery on Qn is homeomorphic to the minus one surgery on P and minus three. This is this dualizable patterns thing. So this is a sort of magical fact that we'll use. Okay. And then the last thing that I want to know is that essentially all of these manifolds have the same pagoda homology. Okay. And that there are cobordisms. So let's observe that if you were to do So let's observe that if you were to do this cobordism, right? So hey, attach a two handle along here, okay? Blow that down, that puts a twist into the band. This is actually sort of similar to an idea that's in Liam and Matt's paper on geography and botany of non-plurhomology, which is to say that those cobordisms induce isomorphisms on Haggard, on the important part of Haggard homology, essentially, on HFRA. Essentially, on HFRA. Okay. And using these guys, you can put together, you can do a whole lot of stacking of stuff. So the way that we set this up, let's see if I can do it really quickly. So there are a bunch of two handles that you can do. Oh, I'm going to go minus four to minus three. Okay, um, then I'm going to go from the minus one surgery to the zero surgery. Okay, I know I'm racing here, okay. And it turns out that these, there's this whole sequence of covortisms that essentially give me an isomorphisms, that give me isomorphisms on H of red. Give me isomorphisms on HFRAD. Okay, these are all two-handle cobordisms. Giving me isomorphisms on HIFRARA. Okay. And now there's one more thing to know, which is that this thing bounds something contractive. Okay, so I want to try to. Contractible. Okay, so I want to try to fill in this manifold. I could try to fill this one in with a formal, with a contractible manifold. Okay, so then I'm going to fill something in. Okay, now what I would love to tell you is that under that I could get this map to this whole composition, that I could get the generator of HF minus here to hit one of the interesting generators of HF minus over here. And I've almost succeeded. minus over here and i've almost succeeded in doing that i just need to know that under this that if i take this bit this contractible thing so this is coming from my contractible okay then i'm hitting the right thing i know that there's an element in hf minus of this that goes to hf minus of what i want there okay and now i have to use my one last bit of magic here okay which is a result of die head and malak Which is to say that there is an interesting there's an involution and Q minus four that acts non-trivially On HF, on HF grade. Okay, and this, and we, and specifically, we know exactly what this involution does. Okay, it's a computable, it's a, this is, we, you know, the in the modern world, we now could compute involutions on Hager fluorhomology. Okay. And by doing that, we were able to cook. So I just need to tell you how to do this gluing here. And if I, if I did it wrong the first time, then I switch it by a gluing. First time, then I switch it by a gluing. And by doing that, I'm able to actually cook up an interesting sequence of maps here that give me, this is going to be the right way. So let me just say it and then I'll stop by gluing in the contractible manifolds in one of two ways, then we can actually guarantee. Guarantee that the f minus of this element one is actually non-zero in the place where I needed where I needed where I needed it to be non-zero. And what I end up is cooking up a non-trivial angle. Okay, so I know I'm over time, but this is my little proof of concept for how really just understanding some cobordism maps, and we don't need any simplex of geometry. We just need to understand how the We just need to understand how the co-portism maps and the involutions could be used to build up something that will ultimately produce an exotic closed format. All right, I'll stop there. So, but I'm wondering if you just want to use it. Okay. Can some people hear me in here? Okay, I think now we have the technology so that questions can be heard by the Zoom audience, assuming their eardrums have not been split open already. Questions from questions from Zoom? Questions? It seems like PN is Qn plus one. Why do you choose to? So, this is the number of full twists, I would say. Oh, okay. Okay. I see now. Maybe can I ask you to take two minutes to put it all together and say how you did complete one concept example? Yeah, sure. Okay, so remember what I, so what I was saying. So remember what I so what I was saying is I needed to construct the whole thing that I needed was to get the map from Hf minus of S3 to HF minus of here to hit a particular element of this L, of this of this group in the non-torsion Smithy structure. Okay. Now, what I know basically is that there's an element because, so under this sequence of maps, essentially each of these by just simple exact triangle. By just simple exact triangle methods, if I had like five minutes, I would show. By just sort of simple exact triangle methods, I know that each of these maps is giving me an isomorphism on HF thread. Okay? So that means that there is some guy here, some element here that is mapping to the that's mapping to the element that I want. Okay, there's some there's some element of There's some element of HF minus of this group that is mapping to the interesting bit of HF minus of this group. Okay? And the thing that I need to know is that when I take this filling, this contractible filling of the four manifolds, that the relative invariant of this manifold hits that element, or has a non-zero component with that particular element. Okay, that's my problem. But there are only, in some sense, some formal considerations. in some sense some formal considerations tell you that there are only two candidates for where the where hf minus of this could take could go okay there are the um it has to be the groups aren't very big and there are two candidates um and conveniently and one of them is a good choice and one of them is a bad choice one of those candidates maps to something that's zero one of them maps to something that's non-zero okay and the key point is that there's this involution this guy that i had malic tell us that Die and Malik tell us that this involution actually creates the good choice and the bad choice. So, with one way of possible choice of gluing it in, I'm guaranteed to produce a non-trivial relative invariant for this whole glued up form manifold. And then when I double it, I just produce an exotic, a closed four-manifold that had a non-trivial module size. And on the geometric side, what do I stick this to? How do I put what do I stick this to in order to do CP2 in the market copy? Oh, itself two copies of itself. And so if you count you count two handles, you've counted the right number. You've got five two handles. Can I ask? I think if that's okay, sorry. Could you? Adam, could you repeat what you said about the construction? I think that was the part that I was also a bit confused about. Maybe I'm sure you said this. So, what am I gluing together? I'm taking the contractible filling to itself into different hands. I'm going to take the contractible filling, contractible filling, then a whole bunch of two, then a whole bunch of two handles. And then that whole thing is half of my four manifold. And then I'm going to glue that to itself. Because this is, so this was the square knot. So this. Is so this was the square knot, so this is actually um uh amphichiral over here. I see, I see. So that's where all this extra homology is going to come in because of all of these extra two handles that you attached. Exactly. And if I didn't have so many extra two handles, then I then I would have maybe hopefully cooked up something that was smaller and exotic. But yeah. Cool. Thank you. But you double it with some mapping class group element or just with the identity? Here I don't need a mapping class group. Here, I don't need a mapping glass group element. I can just use the identity. Here is where I needed the mapping glass group element. And knowing that, and it's knowing that now that we know how to do mapping glass group elements on agropharmology, that was the benefit that we had. So when you dualize these two handles, you will not get zero-frame spheres? You will not get quite enough zero-frame spheres to I mean, one would be the problem. I mean one would be a problem already no one zero frame sphere would be a problem already well but not in the in the not in that particular um um homology class right uh yeah so so what you're showing is that this particular homology class in which you get the the non-zero um uh uh four manifold invariance you get something non-zero and then um you know the rest of the base uh it i don't think that zero frame kills I don't think that zero frame sphere will kill that particular invariant. It'll only kill the ones in sort of other homologous classes. Make sense? Not particular, not completely, but let me think about it. Adam. Adam? Yeah. Where did you use these homeomorphisms between surgeries on the PIs and QAs? That was really ultimately where, so if I had had a little more time, I would have talked about the other thing. Had a little more time, I would have talked about the other thing. Basically, I'm using the fact that this was the same thing as plus one surgery on the sieve it or not. And if you look at plus one surgery on the sieve it or not, you can actually see the involutions like staring you right in the face. And that's where we understand the way that the involutions work. Okay, so these PN, are they the same as the minus three, three, twon petal nodes? Yes, is that I think that's right. Yeah. That I think that's right, yeah. Okay, so then the involution. Okay, got it. Yeah, oh, uh, got it. So, just at an intuitive level, is your sense that the conditions which line up to make something like this work, that it's more that they're delicate to cut through the noise and guarantee that they're true versus them actually sort of being relatively common, just hard to verify. verify right um yeah i think it's hard to get that i mean when when the when the when the floor homology of the three manifolds is small it's kind of hard to get um uh well also getting everything to be simply connected is your last bit that you need um but uh um right so there's an awful lot of there are a lot of places where you could do this kind of thing these kinds whenever you have these kinds of ribbon number one uh fusion These kinds of ribbon number one, fusion number one ribbon knots. You know, you get lots of isomorphisms hanging around on Hager's lurobology. You know, they are with those kinds of twists, but it's somehow a matter of getting yourself to a place where you also know that you have a non-trivial mapping class. That's somehow the trick. No, you know, yes, I said that we know a lot about like finding non-trivial mapping classes, but maybe we don't know that much. So that's, you know, finding those guys is maybe the maybe the hardest piece. Thanks. Sorry, can I get back again? So you are not doubling the manifold, you are taking it, you glue some orientation reversing diffeomorphism, no? Yes, that's right, that's right. So then it's fine. That's fine. That's right. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Otherwise, you will get zero signature or something. Yeah, okay. Where were you using the fact that square nut is? Square naught is MP chiral. I missed that. When I took two pieces of this, when I took this four manifold and then put two copies of it together along an orientation reversing involution right there. Okay. That's what I mean. Yeah. So, does this give you a new involution on CP2 Connexum 9 CP2 bars? Like, do you know if that involution is interesting? Oh, a topological evolution in some sense. Yeah. I don't know if such a thing was known before. You do get some interesting things, by the way. There's some, some, some other stuff that pops out of this. So I don't but there, there are various things that can be sort of rationally blown down in here. And you end up with like an interesting example. Up with, like, an interesting example of an exotically knotted RP2 in CP2 blown up six times. And you get an exotically linked pair of RP2s sitting in CP2 blown up three times. So there are some interesting other exotica that pop out of this. We were thinking that you could sort of rationally blow down this manifold and get something smaller that's exotic, and then we were. Something smaller that's exotic. And then we were, we drove ourselves a little crazy because the manifolds that we were, the resulting manifolds just were turning into ordinary, ordinary, you know, CP2 blown-ups and over times. And so what we ended up deducing is actually it's the issue is that you're just producing sort of exotic surfaces. But I don't know, we thought that was kind of cool also. So, how exotic is the RP2? How not? It's not a standard RP2 together with some. Standard RP tool together with some exotic S2, or how do you see that? I don't know if you can, yeah, I don't know if you could prove that it's not an exotic, that it doesn't, that it doesn't have that property, but it has this, it can be rationally blown up to produce something exotic. That's, I guess, the thing that's interesting about it. So you cannot split off a CP2 from here, right? Split off a CP2 from here, right? No, or at least we couldn't find a way to split off a CP2, right? We couldn't find a way to split off an actual connect some from this thing. So that might be enough to show that it's not double-branched covers, something like that. Oh, I see. Okay. I don't know if you can't, right? I don't know if you can split off a CP2 bar from here. We couldn't find it. I see, I see, I see. Okay, well, maybe we should thank Adam again for an excellent talk. Then we'll resume again in half an hour.
