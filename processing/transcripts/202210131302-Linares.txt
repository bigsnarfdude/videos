Welcome to this update session. It's my pleasure to introduce Philippe Linares from IPA and he'll talk about on local energy decay for solution of the vision in. So Philippe, thank you. Okay, thank you for the presentation, Luis. And thank you for the invitation to participate in this workshop. So I really would like to be there, but well, there are some. But well, there are some previous compromises that I had to be here in Radio. So, today I would like to talk about this local energy decays for solution of the Benjamin equation. And okay, so what we want to do is just to describe the dynamics of the global solution of this initial value problem in some Some regions in the space and time plane, right? So, the problem I have in mind is the following. I gotta give some motivation for this research and some properties that we already know for the Benjamin Beagon equation, solution of the Benjamin-Bigon equation. Equation. Then I'm going to describe the results. I'm going to every result. I'm going to remark some points on the results. And then I'm going to give some ideas of the so this is a joint work with Ricardo Freire from LIMPA, Claudio Muñoz from University of Chile, and Gustavo Ponce from UC Santa Barbara. Okay, so I saw this morning somebody. So, I saw this morning somebody talking about this, this sun, and so I'm going to repeat many things that he already said this morning. So, we have this equation, and this equation is you have this u is a real value function, and h represents the Hilbert transform, right? That is, it's given in this form. So, there are other definitions for the Hilbert transform, and this equation. And this equation was first deduced in the context of long internal gravity wave, right? And later on, this equation was shown to be completely intel, right? So it has infinite many conserved quantities. In particular, we have this tree here that is going to be shared with some other equation that we're gonna see in. In the near future, right? And so, what we have here is the derivative one-half, and in general, we have this fractional derivative that are given using Puri-Janform in this form, right? And the other conserved quantity that we have, right, they have a, they give some a priori estimates, right, for any k greater than or equal to. Okay, so we. equal than two okay so we're gonna have h1 h3 half h2 and so on and so forth right okay so the the most popular uh topic right for this uh initial value problem of course is studying the local and global robustness right in solar spaces In solar spaces of HS, right? And there is a long list of results starting in 1986, 1989, so it's very, very, very close. And the methods are also close. And this is by Yorio and the Luba, Bona, Perlan, and so. And then there is, and what I can say is that at the time they didn't use the structure of the dispersion. The structure of the dispersion of the equation to prove the result. And then in Ponce 1991, he used the smoothing effects and some extra property that solution of the Grange of Ringo equation satisfy in order to get this result. And it's not only local, but global using the conserved quantity, the corresponding conserved quantity. And then there was this result by Koch and Seb Kov, and they have a result. And they have a result, a local result for S greater than 0.4. Then Kay can think. They improve this a little bit, the result of Cochin Stefkoff and the SEF spirit, and they get this result as greater than A. And in 2004, Terry Tau came his gauge transformation, and he got the result in H1, right? And local and global. Local and global, then your completion to one-fourth. And then in L2 units can obtain the per results. Then molinet and below obtained and reproved these results and actually they got a uniqueness to L2, right? Introducing so, proving some bilinear estimates. And recently, there is this result by Perry and Petarlo, obtaining. Obtaining similar results. Okay, so in this long list of results for local well-positant, global well-positing, local well-positors, all of them, the arguments are compactness arguments. And that's because in 2001, only so CFCO discovered that we cannot use any CGF tattoo. Any theta DNHS, there is no way to prove results using the contraction principle argument. So all the efforts has been trying to obtain better compactness in order to get results in low regularity spaces. And then you can also say it's low. Also, say look at the periodic case, right? And so you can see the result of Kapelier and Topolov, Moliday and Libov in this periodic setting. And another property that is nice that the Benjamin equation has is the existence of traveling wave and explicit traveling wave in this form. Traveling way in this form, like this. And we can see this is smooth and it has a smile. Okay. And we also know that they are stable and unique. Okay. And so I had to do an advertisement here for my friends, Jean-Clausot and Christian Klein, that they wrote a book on non-linear dispersive equation, inverse scattering, and PV methods. And you can learn a little bit more about this information. Okay, so let's start with the first result. And so the first result says something like this. So you started with the initial data in L2. Okay, so we can have a solution and we require not only to have the global solution, but a bounded global solution in L2. Then we can show that the limit if when t goes to infinity of the L2 norm, it dissects, right? Right, it's going to zero. This is whatever b is b is between zero and two thirds. Okay, so as always, I close this thing and then you I cannot show that what is going behind, but then you can have a now. So you have actually the sequence can be obtained in this way, right. In this way, right? Then, okay, this is a nice result. So, it's in a big interval, so you have this behavior. But then you can look at something that is more appealing when you look at this ball, right? So, if n would be one that would be telling you something about how. How is the behavior of the solution close to the solidary waste solution, right? But then it's nice, you know, to have an insight of the behavior of the solution, right? Very close to that region. Then we can have some remarks regarding this result. And the first one is that this extent. That this previous result by Claudio Muños, okay, where at the beginning they started with this hypothesis in order to obtain results as the previous one, right? And then this is this method introduced by Method introduced by Claudio and Gustavo was also used previously for KDB and the generalized KDB equation. So you have these three hypotheses. We don't have this extra hypothesis in order to get the local energy result. And then, but this method is still very useful and there are some methods, some results for the intermediate long wave equation. The intermediate long wave equation and for the dispersion generalized Benjamin equation. Okay, so we keep going and then we observe that the new ingredient in the proof for this asymptotic behavior is inspired by this work for the long-time behavioral solution, the etc. Behavioral solutions, the Zahra-funded sub-equation by making these munions public and possible. And then you started with some additional, I mean, well, you will see that in some moments, the estimates are basically energy estimates with some weights. And so you make the appropriate weights so you can get rid of the hypothesis. You can get rid of the hypothesis of intelligibility at the beginning, right? And this method has been proved very effective. And then yesterday was Pelipe Poblette talking about a KP, right? It's a resolved by the same group of people, Mendes, Munios, Poblet, and Pozo, where they obtain this kind of asymptotic behavior. And then we And then we, we, I mean, Mendes and myself, we also look at this system to see what was the method, the power of this method. And we also think some results for this shoring the PDB system. And besides this result, I know this result by Maria Martinez that is there, and Jose Manuel Palacio for the Sahara Rubenchic system in Guandi. System in 1D. All right. Okay, so we can also look at the energy, right? And we also can obtain this asymptotic behavior of the solution. Okay, so you started with easily one half, and you in this space, that's what we're doing bounded, so we cannot. So, we can obtain this asymptotic behavior of the solution. All right, so now we can look at a different region. So, the domain now is moving to integ in the region in the right direction. So, if we have this, we can prove that there exists a constant seeing the zero dependent on, and here is the. Dependent on, and here is on the H1 norm of the RCL data. This global solution should be one and bounded in H1, right? And it satisfies that when T goes to infinity, we obtain the limit and the limit is equal to z. All right, so you can see I am telling you that I have a solution in H1. Solution in H1. Okay, so in looking at L2, and in L2, we realize this. Okay, and the limit, not the limit if, as in the previous case. Then what we can say, this is, well, this result is inspired by some result obtained by Martel and Mer for the generalized KDB equation. And then we use for the Use for the Benjamin Mingon equation, we use some varial identity I'm going to show you, and some computational estimates in order to prove that result. And we can also see that we have the scale for the Benjamin-Mingon equation, we have the scale for the traveling weight, and what we are saying is that the result in the present, right? Right system with this, right? Doing this, we are looking at this region, right? And then it has to be depending on the L infinity norm of the target. So from there, so we remember what we had before. Had before for the constant quantities, so we always have the derivative of in some space, in some space, plus L P of the function in the conserved quantity. So from there, we can obtain this result, right? So we can have Lp is also the limit when T equals to infinity. The norm Lp in this region is equal to zero. And we can use some interpolation. And we can use some interpolation to obtain this also, this next result, with derivative and so localizing things. All right. Now, next, we have that if you look at the next conserved quantity, so it's going to be three half. So no, so if you have a global solution. So, if you have a global solution in this space, then you will have that the derivative of the solution u will be zero for any s between this whole for any s between z and three half. And then you can do this every time you have because we have this approved estimates in H k over 2. In H K over 2, right? So we can have this result with instead to have K over 2 is going to be K over 2 minus 1 half, right here. And then for those solutions, we have this result. Okay, so and the last result, now we are looking at the Now we are looking at the L2 norm, but then in the far left region. Okay, so we are looking at here. Okay, so she says X is less or equal than this number. There, starting with a solution, a global solution in H1, bounded in H1, then in the L2 norm in this region, the solution is equal to zero. And again, this is the And again, this is the limit realized in that case. All right. Okay, so this result, the last one, is no, there is nothing in the literature before. And this is the first one that we know. And actually, we can do Do the same for the generalized KDB, right? Or the generalized Benjamin Mingman equation. And we believe that we can do for other one-dimensional dispersive models. Okay, so the method is applied there. For these, yes, probably we don't need too much structure on that. Okay, and we have this asymptotic behavior for all of this equation, and then we can set the statement 15, 16, 17. I guess we need to go backward. So we have this kind of consideration also in the far left region for the Benjamin unit. The benchmarking unit. All right. Okay, so if we put together the information that we have been describing so far, so we see that the limit of the solution in L2 will be exactly the L2 norm of the DCL data. The DCL data, right? Where the region is just avoiding the previous ones. Okay, so you have zero, we are not taking in consideration out of that. We are going to have the cycling. Okay, this is what expected. Okay, so we can, in this point, we can say, well, we can, so what can we extend? Can we extend something from the generalized Benjamin wono? Okay. Okay, and then okay, so it has nothing to do with to be completely integrable or not. Okay, and the important thing is that we already have this thing here has at least three conserved quantities, one being this one over here, the other is the L1 and the L2, right? And then we already know that we have an That we have an argument, a scale argument. And the scale argument said that you can have s k equals one half minus one over k as a critical space. So in particular, when k is equal to two, that means you can have global solutions for some small data with some size, a precise size. Okay? And so that's important in order to. And so that's important in order to extend this derivative result. So in the case K equal to 2, this is what I was saying. So we have the critical case, and that was proved by Koenig and Takaoka. So you have local poseness there in one half, right? For initial data is more. And this also extends. And this result extends globally, right? But for this kind of initial data, this is small enough. This has to do with the size of the solitary wave. And then there is a result by Ivan Martel and DDFilo and show that this restriction is necessary because there is no if you violate this condition of the current state. State and then, if you look at the global, the local result in the chase, right? Then you see the result by Stefan Brento, and then he proved in the case k equal to 3, regularity is to be s greater than one-third. And then, if for any k greater than equal to 2, the regularity is like this. Okay, so you can have a So, you can have the local result stating globally once the only thing is smallest condition in the H1 node. Okay, so everything here that probably estimates the RNH one half. And then you can see precisely what is the size of the data looking at this work with. Luis Farah and the Milpasblock. Okay, so we have these approval estimates in each one half, and then we have we can extend it if the cell data is satisfies on condition, but this is a small piece. Okay, so then there we went on for extending 2 and 3 depending on the global bound in the infinity, right? And then in this case, we can extend. In this case, we cannot extend the ornament tree for the initial value problem for the generalized Benjamin mean model. But then in the case of the theorem 4, we only require global bounds in L k plus 2. All right. And then we can have the same result of storing four. Australian 4 for any k greater or equal than 2. And then, in the case that k is greater or equal than 1 is odd, the argument to use it in top proof torn one and corollary 1 and totaling 2 applied in this case. Okay? Okay, depending on what happened here, right? So, you substitute this, and then this is going to be even. It's going to be even, and then you're going to have some acetative behavior for solution of this problem, but still, the result that we can obtain via our methods don't beat what Hayashi and Lauki obtain for generalized measuring of an equation using a different approach. All right. All right. Okay, so I'm going to give some elements of the proof, right? So we are going to need some commutative estimates. And the first one is regarding this calderon commutative estimates. And there are some stations given by Koichman and collaborators and Paulson collaborators. And then we have this. And then we have this nice commutator estimate. So we Ponce and collaborators, I don't remember, I remember once, but not the other one. So a student of Gustavo. So they showed this estimate, so you can obtain actually a rough estimate there, but in this case, we need explicitly. Okay, we need explicitly how are things okay. So you can explicitly give in this commutative estimate because we want to realize the limit in the proof. Okay, if we give some just a rough estimate, we don't get the limit at the end. Okay, so we also want to use some cat opens commutators. Computators, some more refined ones, like the one given by Grafacos and O, Brugé, and Linux. All right. So the point, as I said before, so what we are going to do is just use estimate the energy with weight or we will estimate. So we have to construct some weight. Some weights in order to go and work with this energy state. Okay, so we choose in this way. So I'm not going to give you any detail because it's completely technical here. And then you will see that they will appear in the one functional that we are going to define next. So we have a nice property, we have a scale, right? So we are going to give So, we are going to give introduce several parameters to introduce the time, okay, and make the play some role in the estimates. And then there are some bounded for these parameters M and B that are important. Okay, so you will see that this relation here is going to be very important for us. Going to be very important for us, right? And finally, we define this functionality. Okay, so this is the functional that is going to make the work in the proof, right? So, and you see that in I mentioned that in the work of Claudio and Gustavo, they require to have some. were to have some decade of the L2 norm right in terms of time right and so we are introducing instead to introduce one weight we are introducing two weights and one is to avoid this this straight hypothesis all right and so we can see that if we started in L2 this function is well defined and bounded in time and then the important thing is to is to estimate this quantity here, right? And then we can do this using this functional ET, right? Plus something that is integrable in time for time very large. Okay, so I'm not going to do any computation, but this is okay. So as usual, you have your equation and then you try to do energy estimates. Do energy estimates and try to whatever is possible to feel too close the estimates, right? And then after you get this estimate, we can prove the following lemma that is crucial in the argument, right? So we can prove that in fact this quantity here is bad, all right? Is bad. All right. And then you can see what is going to happen next, right? So this is easy once you obtain the previous estimates, this one over here, right? Then you also see that this product is perfect to give us this number here, right? And then we obtain from these estimates, right? Estimates, right? We have the previous lemma, and then we can conclude that, in fact, this is bad. Okay. All right. So if you have that, right? So you are done with the total one because it says something like one. If this guy is not in net one, this guy is not in net one, right? Obviously, it's not net one in this. The only way to get The only way to get that bounded is that this quantity should be zero, right? So you can have a sequence of time, a sequence of time, making this possible, right? And then this gives the, this is very rough, but this is the idea of the result. Okay, so you do the energy estimates in the middle, you get this estimate, and from there you are almost. There's you are almost there. All right, so I also gonna give a little bit a little bit more details for the telling of three, right? Because it appears we have this identity, starting point with this identity here. So we have a weight that is a small A smooth, sufficiently smooth, and then we obtain this identity. Okay, and so this is what I was mentioning before. So you have this in the middle, this commutator, and now we have an identity, and this is going to help to obtain actually the limit instead of have a limit nth. Okay, so again, now once you have this. Once you have this identity, you try to choose your weight with the right information, right? So this is going to be very smooth. It's going to be zero. This is for S less than equal to one, and it's equal to one for S greater or equal than two. This is a nice function bounded. And okay, it's important to have. It's important to have, let me see, it's important to have this nice property here. So in the estimate, we are going to need this. This is a very nice remark doing the computation there. Let's see if we have this. We have these properties. And then, well, as usual, we estimate. As usual, we estimate every term in the identity and we end up with this set of identities. So the guy doesn't produce information. Aphi, you got a nice estimate of this. Okay, very useful. And this is just again, very useful to get the. And then you can put. And then you can put this as usual together with this condition, right? And then if we choose to have this small, then we got what we want, right? This guy decides to disappear, and then we got what we got. Right? So, this is a very nice and understandable proof. And understandable proof. This is doing things very fast, but this is because of the time. Okay, so then we go use integration as always, right? In the L2 norm. And then we all right. So I think this is basically the argument of proof of the. The argument of proof of theorem four follows an argument similar, but then there are some differences. Like, as I said before, this is you can obtain some result from global solution in 24 for the Gen LSP Benjamin owner that you can interpret into useful entities. And so, thank you for the attention. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Felipe, for the talk. Questions or comments? So for your results, in the interior region, you have a demo in, right? Do you expect that you can get to it without a demo in? But I mean, for that. I mean, all that, uh, yeah, but we would like to have it, yeah. But uh, well, we're still thinking of that, yeah. Yeah, we would expect to have something like that, yeah. Any other question? Yeah, I have one, Philippe. So, uh, could you go back to theorem two? I know you don't go to the block for this theorem, but uh, I'm could. But I'm curious why you have the restriction on B in the theorem 2 equation 13. Okay, let me okay, tell me what because the zone is a little bit okay, so go more. So try to find equation 30. So, try to find equation 30. One more period. So, see, you have that restriction on B. No, you explain a little bit why you have this or? That's a good question. Okay, actually, this restriction comes, well, as I mentioned. We, as I mentioned before, we introduced this extra weight, right? If you go to the argument used by Claudio Munoza and Gustavo Polce, right? The arguments only use one weight in the energy estimates, right? And then you introduce one more here, right, to avoid this integrability condition. But then the But then this restriction appears there, right? But this, uh, well, what we expect is to have this much better. It should be like B one half, probably with that DK of the Benjamin model, right? But then, okay, that's confirmed that. Okay, I say, well, if you do KDB using this argument, you're going to get this B, exactly this V. Exactly, this V. Okay, if you go below, you're gonna get this B, at least at least you get very, very low dispersion. So there is no relation between this B and the dispersion somehow, but when the dispersion is very low. All right, so one of the things that we need to understand is that, and then if we understand that, we are going to get probably this a better result. probably this a better result than that. Okay, but this is this comes from this comes from this extra weight that we are using in the argument. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? If not, let's thank Felipe for the comment.
