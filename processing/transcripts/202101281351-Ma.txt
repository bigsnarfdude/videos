Can everyone hear me? Yes. Good. Thanks. Thanks, the organizers, for putting this very exciting workshop together and thanks for inviting me. Really enjoy the talks and discussion. So, today, I'm going to talk about the time of infection for a networks of cities or farms or individuals. This is not about This is not about directly about human-environmental interactions, but rather this is about a mathematical tool that we can use to identify the hot spots or hot paths that disease or population or information or rumors that can pass through a population of individuals or cities. So, I'm going to talk about how the problems arise and how we can model the spread of disease or information or rumors on the network. And we're going to look at a new method that we can use to describe or to calculate the time of infection of a specific node on a network. And we're going to look at a couple examples and we'll talk about what we can. And we'll talk about what we can do next. So, here's an interesting figure about how Zika emerges and spreads around the world from 1947 to about 2016. So I'm not going into details, but you can see that it actually spreads from places to places, starts from West Africa to Southeast Asia, then to Southeast Asia, then to America. Here's another spread of SARS. It actually started from Guangdong province in China, then it went to Hong Kong, which is a very close by city. And then Hong Kong is a major international hub, so the disease goes from Hong Kong to almost everywhere. But there are secondary Are secondary importations, for example, Finland was imported from Canada. So this tells us how the disease spreads from places to places. And how do we mathematically model them? Well, there are two common ways to do that. One is called a multi-group model. We think that each place is a group, and then somehow the And then somehow the individuals from one group can infect the people in another group. It's like if I cough in Victoria, BC in Canada, and someone in Helsinki might be infected by me, which is not realistic. But the good thing is that it ignores all the details about how transmission happens between places. The mathematics becomes simpler. Of course, this is really more useful for population groups like age. For population groups like age groups or social economical groups of a single population rather than multiplaces. So a more appropriate model would be multi-patch model. For example, Nina just presented one in the previous talk where we keep track of the disease dynamics in each patch and then we look at the individuals moving between patches. We can probably model We can probably model that the infectious individuals might move at a reduced rate than susceptible individuals, but these are the details. So this is more realistic just because disease actually pass from one place to another mostly from migration, not from direct mixing between individuals. Now, these models are not only useful for human disease transfer. Useful for human disease transmission. We can also look at, for example, animal diseases. Here's a figure for the salmon farms in west coast of Canada. The red dots are the farms and the yellow dots are the farms and the red dots. Yellow dots are the farms, and the red line are the migration paths. So, here, if you can study, for example, if sea lice is infected and appears in one farm, what's the risk that we're going to observe the sea lice in other farms? So, if we observe sea lice in one farm today, when do we expect it shows up in another farm? So, these are the problems that are really similar to human population, the disease. Population the disease spread in human cities. So if we are interested in the time of infection in a farm or a city, so how can we use these classical models to study them? Now, most of these models are differential equation models, and differential equation models are Models and differential equation models are not really good at studying the time of infection because immediately after time zero, if two cities are connected, then immediately the other city would show a positive I, which means that we're going to have a nano infectious individual in that city. So people deal with this with many different approaches. People may arbitrarily set a threshold saying that if I Set a threshold saying that if I is greater than one, then we treat the situation to be infected. But it's really difficult to estimate the uncertainty, and the one is more of an arbitrary threshold. If we really want to know the time of infections, it's more common to actually use stochastic models. So if we think that for multi-group models, then it's Multi-group models, then it's the mixing rate, the transmission rate from all the other places to a single place, would be the rate of importation or transmission. And then we can think this as an inhomogeneous Poisson process. And then we're going to look at the first event time of this Poisson process for the first importation time. And if it's a patch model, then we can just directly look at how fast the infectious individuals migrate from. Individuals migrate from other places to a single city. And again, this rate is treated as a rate of an inhomogeneous Poisson process. And then we're going to look at the time of first arrival. And that is the time of infection to couple the differential equation models with stochastic models. So it turns out that we not only can study the we can study the easy spreading among cities or farms. We can actually also look at individuals. We look at how disease passes from individual to another. For example, these are typically represented by contact networks. And these are networks that allow us to capture the heterogeneity of contacts among populations within the classical. Among populations, whereas in the classical model, we just assume that these individuals randomly bump each other, bump into each other. So, here's, for example, a model for ICU, where the gray dot is a doctor, and the three white dots are the nurses, and the six black dots are the patients. So, you can see how they specifically mix. So, a nurse. So a nurse does not contact with all the patients, but they typically are assigned to a couple patients. So then the contacts are not random. So we can look at how individuals are infected, how disease pass from individual to individual in this. And it typically has to go through the mixing between nurses or the mixing between the The doctor, so that the disease can pass from one patient to another. We can also look at how rumors spread on a social network, for example. This is a quite famous network called Zachary Karate Club. He studied this karate club using graph theory. Note one is the manager of the club, node 34 is the As the coach of the club, and somehow these two individuals have some conflicts, and it causes the club to split. And Zachary used graph theory to predict who is going to go with who. So it's kind of interesting graph. If we want to know how the rumors pass on this graph, for example, how can we study it? So these are the individual networks. Individual networks. The way that we model individual networks and city and farm networks are typically different. As we said, in city and farm networks, it doesn't matter if we use the multi-group approach or the patch approach. We typically consider the epidemics within a single city or a single farm. Well, if we consider the contact networks, we consider them as individuals. We don't, well, each individual has a within host dynamics. Individual has a within host dynamics, but we typically don't model them if we look at population level dynamics. Rather, we abstract the within host dynamics by the infection states of a patient. It could be susceptible if no pathogen is present in the patient, in the individual, or the individual can be infected but latent. That means the pathogen is in the body, but not shown. The pathogen is in the body but not shedding. It could be infectious, means that the patient is shedding pathogen or the patient could be recovered. If we think about the city and farm networks, we can think about the same thing. If we think the city is an individual, then if there is no patient in the city, we can say the city is susceptible. If a patient is in the city, then the city is infected, but if the patient is infected in the city, But if the patient is not moving around to other cities, then we can say that the city is latent. If somehow the city, the epidemics in the city become severe, and then the patients are moving out of the city, then we can say the city is infectious. And so it's like how we abstract within host dynamics, we can abstract the state of a The state of a city by the infection status. So, in that way, we can actually unify the city networks as contact networks. And then we can look at, if we study the city networks, what mathematics we can use to describe them. So if we have a large contact network, then it's going to be difficult for us to know exactly what network. us to know exactly what network we're dealing with. So you don't have the exact adjacency matrix, for example. You don't exactly know who contacts who for a large population. Now here's a figure that I shamelessly steal from one of Chris Bao's paper. This shows three interesting networks. Two of them are more theoretically interesting. One is Poisson network. Interesting. One is Poisson network, which is the network equivalence of random mixing. One is a power law network, which says there are a lot of hops in the population. There are a few individuals that are highly connected, and a lot of individuals are not highly connected. So it has a very fat tail. Even though it has a high peak here, the tail is actually pretty fat. And the dark one is actually a city network. This is the Actually, a city network. This is the contact network of Vancouver City. You can see that there are a group of individuals who have fewer contacts, or a lot of individuals who have a lot of contacts. And what's more interesting is that it also has a very large and fat tail. So, we don't exactly know the exact network, but we can look at the statistics of the network. We can look at the degree. Of the network, we can look at the degree distribution like this. Is we can look at the correlations between nodes, for example, are there correlations between age groups or correlations between degrees? We can look at clustering, which are triangles that are a group of fully connected individuals, like classrooms or households. We can look at other topology, for example, the cities might have districts and Um, districts and within the districts, or you have a city and satellite villages, for example. These are topologies that are not characterized by degree distribution, but we can look at all these statistics and we can look at a random network that represents or that has the same characteristics as the network we're interested in. The network we're interested in. Then we're going to use the random network as a proxy for the real network and study how the disease spreads on the random network. For large networks, one thing it's interesting is that it has a very nice averaging effect. We don't really, we can't identify hot spots and hot individuals in population, but because the population is large, the run-me. Is large, the random effects average out. So we can just think about the average. The key quantity to characterize the disease on a network, a large network, is called the effective degree. What is that? If we're interested in a central node I here, and say this I is infectious and is passing the disease onto other neighbors. We want to know how many neighbors can he. How many neighbors can he infect? Because it's infected, he's most likely infected by one neighbor. So we have to subtract that neighbor that infected him, and all the other neighbors are infectable. So this is called the effective degree. So the effective degree of a node is found by following a random edge to the node, and we're looking at the number of neighbors minus one. And it turns out. And it turns out the basic reproduction number on a random network is proportional to this excess degree. So it is the average excess degree times the probability of transmission along each head. So to actually model the disease on the network, there are a lot of approaches. There are models that keep track of the states of the node. There are models that States of the node. There are models that keep track of the states of the edges. But it doesn't matter which approach we use. We really have to not only know the states of a node, but we also have to know the states of the neighbors. So in that way, we're actually trying to capture the change of the state of edges. So the simplest, there are a lot of models that do this. The simplest model that's interesting is this. That's interesting is this Miller model that's developed in 2011, which says why is a node susceptible? Well, the node is susceptible because none of its edges has transmitted the disease to the node. So we keep track of that probability that the edge hasn't transmitted. So then the degree k node will be susceptible with probability theta to the power k. And then we just keep track of the dynamics of theta. The theta are the ideas that. So theta, the theta or the edge that hasn't transmitted, but why would it change? Because the edge has transmitted at some point. Why would it transmit? Because the edge is attached to an infectious node. So we then look at the fraction of the edges that is attached to a susceptible infectious node and has not transmitted. Then we look at the dynamics of those phi edges. And why would the phi edge? And why would the phi edge change? Because they transmit, because the infectious neighbor recovers, or because an edge that's not connected to I, but connected to an S, the S neighbor got infected. This is the rate that the S neighbor got infected. It's actually the rate of change that the neighbor is susceptible. So, this is the full model of SIR epidemics on a disease. Dynamics on a disease, on a contact network that's captured by the degree distribution. So the key thing is more about the probability that a neighbor is susceptible. So it's a very simple model. It's very easy to analyze. We can find out the basic reproduction number from this model. We can find out the final state of this model. But another question is: if we have an epidemic. If we have an epidemic on a network, and if we want to know, well, if we want to use a standard SIR model to describe it, what is the correction that we need to make to the standard SIR model? In fact, we just want to rewrite the network model as in the form of standard SIR model, where the transmission rate beta is multiplied by a correction factor, where this G prime of one is actually the. This, G prime of one, is actually the average context of the average degree of the network. C is a factor that changes with time. So we are trying to modify the transmission rate beta so that the standard SIR model and the network model would give us the same epidemic curve. It turns out we can write down an equation for C of T. What's more interesting is that initially the correct Initially, the correcting factor would be one, but for most networks, the C of T would increase. That means if you want to use the standard SIR model to describe a network epidemic, it seems as if your transmission rate increases with time. But after a while, this correcting factor would decrease. And depending on the beta, it could decrease to a positive number or decrease to zero. To zero. So here are some numerics that show this. The red curve are the epidemic curves. We consider two types of networks, whereas a network with Poisson degree distribution and a network with a truncated scale-free degree distribution. Where the blue curve is actually the correction factor. The correction factor. As you can see, they all start from one, then they increase quickly to a maximum. Then, as the disease spreads, this transmission rate starts to decrease again. And as it decreases, it can either decrease to a constant proportion or decrease to zero. So, that basically means if you treat your network epidemic as a standard SIR model, you would find your transmission rate to first. Your transmission rate to first increase, then decrease again. But none of this would work for small networks because on small networks, well, we know exactly what the network is. And typically, the network is given by the adjacency matrix. But the thing is, the whole epidemic becomes a continuum. Well, the results would be a continuous function of each transmission rate rather than there's. Transmission rate rather than there's a threshold. You wouldn't be able to find a threshold on a finite network. Of course, there will be a threshold if the network becomes large and it approaches a large population threshold, where then we can find a threshold. But for most finite networks, you always have a small proportion of the population infected. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if your R0 is greater than one or less than one. So, how can we model such networks? One way we can model it is to set up a Markov chain. So, we characterize the state of a node. For example, if we study a SI dynamics, we characterize the state of a node by S or I. By S or I, but the state of the whole network would be the collection of states for each node. So if you have n nodes, you would have n of these SI pairs, so you would have two to the n possible states. For example, if we have a very simple triangle network, one, two, three, then you can have the state of the network as the first node is infectious I, this two node two and three are S, so you get ISS free. So, you get ISS, for example, and you have all these combinations. Now, if your node one is initially infectious, that cut the number of states by two. So you really just have two, four states. And then you can characterize the rate of transition from one state to another. That gives you a continuous time mark of chen. You can set up the master equations using this mark of chen, which is a huge. Which is a huge linear system. It's difficult to deal with this system. It's possible to solve it, but it's really difficult if you have a reasonable large n. Say if you have 10 nodes, you would have a thousand states, which becomes difficult for you to solve the linear system. So if we are interested in We are interested in the time of infection of a specific node. For example, if node one is initially infectious, when do we expect node three to be infected? So how do we study that with the Markov model? Well, the probability that the node I or node three is infected before time t is the same as the probability that the node three is infectious at time t. So we're really just looking at the probability. So we're really just looking at the probability that node 3 is infectious at time t. So for Markov model, you're just adding up all the probabilities of the states that the node 3, for example, is infectious. Well, because the Markov channel model is really difficult to deal with, so this is possible, but it's actually difficult to calculate. It's also possible to look at something called a minimum passage time. That's if we look at all the pass. That's if we look at all the paths of transmissions from node one, initial infectious node, to the node three, that the target node we're interested in, we look at all the paths of transmissions, we look at the time of transmission that needs along each path, then we look at the minimum time along all these paths. This is possible with a very small network and simple network where we can look at the time of transmission from one to two to three. From one to two to three versus from one directly to three. And you can use this, well, the standard probability theory to figure out this probability. But when the network becomes slightly more complicated, it becomes hard. Well, if you look at this four-node network, where we again, one is infectious and four initially infectious, and we're interested in the state of four. And we're interested in the state of 4. Sorry, this is T4, not T3. And then there are three possible paths: 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1, 2, 4. However, you can't use the standard probability theory to find the minimum of the three paths, the transmission time of three paths. Mostly just because the three paths are not independent anymore. So the paths of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1, 2, 4 would have. And 124 would have this common path of one and two. And one, two, three, four, and one, three, four would have this common node three. So the three paths wouldn't be independent. And it's going to be extremely difficult to deal with this dependence between paths. You might think that we can do a divide and concur. The four will be possibly infected by three or two. So if we know the time of infection of Know the time of infection of three and time of infection of two, we might just add the time of infection along these two edges and compare the minimum. But that's still a problem because the infection time of two and three are not independent. They're dependent to each other because there's a path linking from two to three. So we always have to deal with this path dependency issue. So the minimum passage time in theory is very nice. Time in theory is very nice, but in reality, it's extremely difficult for us to use this method. So, what are we going to do with it? Well, we actually just try to set up a new method to deal with that. So, we are interested in the state whether the node I would be susceptible or the node I would be infectious. And we use the S and I to be. S and i to be to denote these two probabilities. And s i would have a subscript which means the set of nodes we're interested in. Here we're interested in a single node. So why would this node i be susceptible? It's because, as we said, none of its neighbors has infected it. So we can look at the master equation for this specific. For this specific node. So the probability that it's susceptible decreases with the rate that the probability that one of its neighbors, J, is infected, and the transmission happens with this specific rate, beta from I to J. Then we can use this total probability property and rewrite this so that it really just depends on the state of this node itself and the probability. node itself and the probability that the node i and of all of its neighbors are susceptible so if we're just looking at a central node i but if we have a collection of nodes how do we study this as the probability that both i and j are susceptible or arbitrary set of node a is susceptible it's the same thing the probability b The same thing. The probability decreases with the probability that any of its neighbors of the set A is infectious times the probability times the rate of transmission from a J to this set A. Then we can use the total probability to actually convert this probability, including an infectious neighbor, to the probability that all of these nodes are susceptible. All of these nodes are susceptible. So we are setting up a sequence of equations iteratively. One depends on another that describes the probability of states of a set of nodes. And we can actually, for this, we can actually think that if we set a node for the probability of that a set of That a set of nodes is susceptible, then this gives us a graph. So the probability S of A would depend on all S of A and one of its neighbors. So this would give us what we call an S digraph where these nodes would affect the probability of these nodes. So we can actually set up something like that if we're interested in the state. Like that, if we're interested in the state rate of infection, sorry, the state of node three, the three would have two neighbors, one and two. So we put, we're interested in these two sets. And these two sets all have a neighbor one. So eventually we are interested in the probability of this specific state where all three nodes are susceptible. Then we can. Acceptable. Then we can for this self-interaction give us the self-loops and the interactions from this to here or this coefficient tell us the weight from these nodes would affect that. So in other words, we reconstruct a new digraph that describes the state of a set of sequence of nodes. Sequence of notes on the graph. The sequence of notes are susceptible. So, this is what we call digraph or S digraph. With this S digraph, we can then compute the probability of F of 3 using this digraph fairly easily. Some of, well, this means that the digraph might be big, but a lot of the things can be pruned. Of the things can be pruned. For example, S123, if node 1 is initially infectious, then this state of the both all 1, 2, 3 nodes are susceptible would have probability 0. We wouldn't need to consider this node. So we can drop this node. We can also drop this node because node 1 is infectious and it won't be susceptible. So this would prune the tree a lot. There are a lot other ways we can prune. For example, if we're interested in node. If we're interested in node n, then the node k, 2, 3, 4, and 2k to n minus 1, the states of these nodes are independent to the state of this node as long as we know the state of the central node n plus 1. This allows us to prune the tree further. So then we actually go from this sequence of differential equations to S-digraph. So how do we solve this S-digraph? S-digraph is solved. S-digraph. S-digraph is solved by solving this differential equation, which actually just gave us a convolution of e to the negative beta 80 convolved with this, sorry, the input rate. So what does that mean? That means on an S digraph, we can start with the first node. And because it's a, well, there's always, we can trace back. And well, there's always we can trace back along a path, and we can always get back to a single node. We start from this node, then we convolute along each path to the node 4, S4. So when we add up these convolutions along all these paths, then we can get this probability. So it's a straightforward convolution, and it's actually calculable using symbolic calculations. So this actually allows us to compare. So, this actually allows us to compute the analytic formula for the time of infection. That depends on all these transmission rates. So, you can then look at which path would be a hot path, which node would be a hot node, and look at the sensitivity analysis. So, this gave us the mathematical tools that allow us to compute this specific problem. Compute this specific probability. We can, of course, don't have to compute the convolutions along each path. We can just solve these ODEs one by one. We know the state of this, which is one. There is no input, so this is exponentially decaying. And we can use this as a given state to solve the ODE and solve these two states, which are just one differential. Which are just one differential equation to solve, which again is just a convolution. So we can convolve along the path and look at the intermediate nodes, then just use an iterative step to go from the last node along each path to the first node, which is the node that we're interested in. So, this gives us an algorithm that we can easily adapt to compute the time. To compute the time of infection of a specific node. So, this allows us to compute the, for example, the graph, this very simple four-node graph that's extremely difficult for us to study using the minimum path, the minimum passage time method, but it's actually not too difficult to use the S-digraph method to compute it. So, we wonder why this method. So, we wonder why this method works. It turns out that this method works because it's also related to the minimum passage time. If you think about a path on this S digraph, we go from, for example, 234 to 2424. This actually tells us a sequence of infections that could happen. This could be that initially the node one is infectious, but now node three become infected. So, we only have two, four. only have two four then the node two would become infected so we get one two three then four and for here we would get a one and three and four so each path would give us a sequence of infections that would eventually infect four and each self loop if that's the fun the the function that we're convolving along it tells this is actually the Tells this is actually the stage sojourn time in this specific state. So we're the convolution are just adding up this sojourn time. So we're just adding up the time that the system stays in each state. So that is the time of the infection along the specific sequence of infections. So this is close. So, this is close. So, each pass is related to a specific passage time. So, this is why this method works mathematically. Now, we only give a few examples that are straightforward to look at. What if we have a more complicated network like this? Like if we have this Zachary's Prote-Klop network that has 34 nodes, and if we're interested in And if we're interested in the manager node one, send out a rumor and we want to know when, for example, node 34 would hear. And then we can use this network, this method to construct a big, a huge S-digraph. Turns out it's going to contain billions of nodes, but on my laptop, it actually only, well, it takes a long time to compute it, but it takes about eight hours to compute a result that we can actually look at the time. That we can actually look at the time distribution. If node one is initially infected, when would node three be infected? It actually is, we can see that it peaks about 0.2 if the rate of transmission is more. So this method works for a reasonably large network. If we go beyond this 34 nodes, the network is. The network is going to grow exponentially with the number of nodes. But still, if we're interested in a region, for example, in BC, we have a few cities, and we know that Vancouver is the first city that got COVID, and we want to know when the other cities would be infected, and these cities are interconnected, then this would be a reasonable method for us to estimate the time of infection. So this So, this could you summarize your talk in several minutes? Yes, this is the last slide. So then we have a method that can estimate the, for example, the time of infection of a specific node. So we can use this method to identify the hot spots and hot paths of transmission on a network. And we want to On a network, and we want to, what can we do next? Well, we might consider that: well, how do we include a latent stage? How do we include a recovery? And these are possible. We've actually started with SIR. The tree, the graph becomes more complicated, but it's possible to do it. We can possibly consider age of infection because the transmission rate would not. Because the transmission rate would not be a constant. If a city has an epidemic, then during the peak of a neighbor's city, it's more likely that the transmission rate will be higher at the peak than at the initial state of the transmission. So we might want to consider the age of infection. We might want to update the probabilities with more information coming in. For example, if Vancouver has a For example, if Vancouver has a case, Victoria has a case, we want to know what the probability that another city in BC, Canada, is going to have a case. If we observe another case in another place, then we want to know, well, with this information, the probability would change. How do we update this information? And so these are things that we can do with this method. And that's all I want to present today. Thank you. Thank you, Julie. Thank you, Julian. And this beautiful lecture. Everything was explained about Netflix. Now we have a few, several questions in chat. And Fritsov, maybe the first one? Yeah, so that was only on the very first slides. I'm not sure how important this is at this point, but the difference between the two models where the susceptibles are moving around. Where the susceptibles are moving around all the time, or where they're infecting someone somewhere else. It seems to me that's related to what Nina called: you have to return home, or it's a difference between going out for a day trip or actually moving across country or something like that. Yeah, well, I would personally think that these are mathematical convenience rather than reality. The multi-group model is a mathematical simplification that we ignore how. Simplification that we ignore how the dise pass from one city to another. Where the patch model actually considers it and it says that I can't infect anyone in New York unless I visit there. So patch model includes that, but the other model ignores. True, and then it kind of turns into a time scale problem, right? Visiting New York is something that I, if I'm allowed to, I could do for a day or a weekend or so, but that's different. Weekend or so, but that's different from moving to New York for a job or something like that. So there are different time scales again. Exactly. But considering that moving isn't very frequent for each individual, and we have a large population, so these things would average out. So the good thing about using ODE models is that we can just consider the average effect rather than these distributions. But these distributions would be important. We really Would be important. We really need to study. If we really need to study them, we would have to use a stochastic model, for example. Luis? You have a question. Yeah, so this was a similar question to what I asked Nina. Can you use these methods for macroparasites? And presumably, you mentioned distributions, so probability distributions. This would be the same sort of thing, only This would be the same sort of thing, only they'd be distributions of parasite load in different nodes of the network. And so presumably it'd be a system of PDEs. But Mark responded saying he was doing something on this with someone else. But I'll ask Jean-Ling to respond first, maybe. Ah, right. So, yes, we didn't really care what the dynamics is in a specific single node. So it could be a pair. So, it could be a parasite dynamics, it could be an infectious disease, it could be a rumor spreading. So, I don't think why it wouldn't be applied to macroparasites. Well, it'd be the distribution of what matters to macroparasite infection spread is a distribution of loads in individuals. And so, I would think that you would see the same thing for, for example, virus in in a patient. In the patient, right? If someone contacts the virus, they still the virus needs a dynamic to reach a certain level before it can spread. It's the same idea that if we consider rumor, then someone hear the rumor, he or she needs to think about it before he or she passes it on. So there's always this latent stage where it wouldn't be able to transmit. So if the parasital If the parasite depends on the parasite load and the parasite load has a complex dynamics, then you might need a more complex stage of transmissions. You can't just characterize it as susceptible, latent, infectious. You might have multiple infectious stages and the susceptible stages that or recovered stages that intertwin. Mark, you have several. You have several comments. Sure. I was giving a shout out to Peter's work. He's here on the macroparasite infection levels on salmon farms, a network of salmon farms. Anyhow, I can talk to you later about that, Lou, and maybe it's relevant. And maybe I'd love to talk to you. The question I had for Jen Ling was: you showed a picture. You showed a picture of the structure of the doctors, nurses, and patients in the nursing home or in a hospital setting. And of course, one of the big questions that we have now is how long it takes for someone in a nursing home in many places to become infected with COVID. And would the restructuring of the interactions between nurses, doctors, and patients affect that? And so I wondered if you could almost take what you have now and then maybe have two or three different Have now, and then maybe have two or three different rates of interaction. You know, nurse, patient, nurse, doctor, doctor, patient. And then look at different configurations to see which one would be minimal. It would have to be constrained, of course, like the doctors, nurses would have to see the patients. Yes, there are two issues with nursing homes. One is the visitors, the disease pass into this nursing home. One is once it's in the nursing home, how it spreads in the population. In the population, they're two different things to study, but within the nursing home, I think it's a fairly straightforward network. We can study that. The more difficult thing would be collect the data. It would be harder for us to get the actual interaction within nursing homes. We try to do that for contact tracing in Victoria. It's slightly difficult for us to do that. But once we have the data, I don't think it's going to be hard for. I don't think it's going to be hard for us to study that. Thanks. Now we have many comments in the chat, but maybe we should continue these things in the last discussion sessions. So I'd like to have the break now and then come back three or five. We'd like to thank all the two speakers this morning.
