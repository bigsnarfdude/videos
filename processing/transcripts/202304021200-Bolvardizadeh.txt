All right, welcome back, everyone. We are here. We've got our final talk of the conference, and I'm very pleased to announce Seoul as speaking on the quality of ABC solution. So go ahead and take it away. Thank you so much. Well, hi, everyone. I'm Seoul. First, I'm going to thank the organizers for inviting me here, especially Cabra, because she answered all my questions. Yeah. Yeah, okay, so let's start. The title of my talk is on the quality of the abuse solution. This is going to be an outline. So, for the first part of the talk, we're going to go through a brief introduction on the ABC control that you are probably all familiar with. And then I'm going to continue with studying certain families of ABC solutions formed by terms in local sequences and associated local sequences. And then we're going to introduce. And then we're going to introduce a new family of ABC solutions with quality grade of them. For the second part of the talk, we're going to discuss an explicit version of the ABC proposed by David, and then we're going to see an application in broker and automatic problem and the oversh and our display. So a lesson. Okay, so it's like the history goes back to 1985 where when a sort of ambassador actually When Serla Ambassador actually had a discussion about co-practic solutions to A plus B equals to C. So, for the sake of the argument, and from now on, when I say an ABC solutions, I mean a triple ABSC, which you see of ABSC equal to one, satisfying this equation. Okay, so the concept that they were interested in was a concept called quality. Before I define quality, we need something called radical. needs something called radical. So for an integer n, its radical is going to be the product of its distinct prime factors. And we set rad of one equal to one. As an example, rad of 24 is going to be six because two and three are the only one. And then they were interested in a concept called quality. So as you can see, we define the quality of an existing solution as this quotient. And I'm just going to take cause here. And I'm just going to take a pause here and explain what this concept means. So if you have a number p to the power of alpha over prime p, then you can recover this power alpha. It's going to be log of e to the power of alpha over log of p. So this here is your radical and p to the power alpha is your number. The reason is that the reason that they use this The reason that they use this actually concept is that if your power is big, then your quality is going to be big. And if your power is small, then your quality is also going to be small, kind of just relatively speaking. So they were like, what can we say about this concept of database constraints? This is a number. Is it bounded? Is it not? So this is an actual question. Uh, so this is an actual question that actually arrives here. And we have a similar concept in four colonials P1, P2, and P3 in C of X. And we have kind of similar definition of quality here, maximum of degrees over degree of radical of the product of those polynomials. And in 1984, Mason actually showed that if we have three co-prime polynomials, Three co-prime polynomials, and if those polynomials are not constant at the same time, then the quality is going to be bounded by one. And the question that you can ask yourself is that, okay, can you use one as an upper bound for quality integers? So it's a question that you can ask, and the answer is no, absolutely not. As an example, you can look at these family of HC triple, one, bigger power two, two power k and victor power two. 5 to the power of 2 to the power of k minus 1 for any integer k greater than or equal to 1. So we can show that actually this quality for any integer k is going to be greater than 1. So you have infinitely many ABC solutions with quality greater than 1. So you cannot use one as an optimal, obviously. But the conjecture that Master and the Sorna came up with, the ABC conjecture says that, okay, we cannot use one as quality, but assume that you consider a positive. Assume that you consider a positive epsilon, then this conjecture that there exists only finitely many ABC solutions with the quality grouped upon possible. So if this is true, what does it mean? It means that there exists an ABC solutions with the highest quality. So the quality is better. These are the highest, like the first five highest known ADC solutions with the high quality. Maybe the solution with the high quality. So, the highest quality known up to this day is for the first pair of solutions that you can see here. And just a fun fact here that I'm going to call ABC solutions with quality 1.4, ABC solutions with good quality. And up to this day, there are only 241 ABC solutions with quality greater than 1.4 knowns. Yeah. And so this is. So, this is not a very simple, like, simple problem. It's actually hard to find ABC solutions with quality virtual demo. Which brings us to the next part of the talk. So, I was trying to find AC solutions with good quality or like AC solutions with quality greater than one. That's why we studied LUCA sequences and everything. So, let's start with the definition of LUCA. So let's start with the definition of Lucasi close first, which you're probably all familiar with. So I'm going to take two co-prime integers p and q and I'm going to find their roots to the quadratic equation x squared minus px plus q. Then for any integer m greater or equal to zero, I'm going to define, like it's defined um and vm as follow, as you can see. And we have um the Lucas sequence and Vm that associated Lucas sequence. And that's what she had looked at for spawning to the pair pH. So again, I must recall the definition of quality because I need it. So if I want to find something with high quality, quality greater than one, I need my numerator to be greater than my denominator, obviously. Yeah. And if I want it to be high enough, relatively speaking, I need my solutions to be composed of perfect prime power. Uh, of perfect prime powers. This is why I we were interested in this identity between mth term of your LUCA sequence and associated. So for any LUCA sequence and associated LUCA sequence corresponding to the pair P and Q, you do have this identity and D here, we're going to call the D the discriminant of your LUCA sequence. And we were hoping by choosing Q as a high prime power, maybe we can like find existing. Maybe we can find a distortion of good quality or quality data. So, this is, oh, I'm going to skip that. This is the first result that we had. So, this result is under the US under. And it says that if because there are a lupa sequence and associated lupa sequence with positive discriminant, the limits of quality as end-goes link will be one. Okay, you might ask. Okay, you might ask why this circle is an ABC solution. One can show that either this is an ABC solution, all of them are co-prime, or you divide everything by four, and again, they're going to be cool. Okay, so this is our result, assuming this conjecture, and it says that the quality is going to approach one. The question is of like, how is it approaching one? Is it bigger than one, less than one? What can we say? And the next result that And the next result that we have actually says that this is not under the executive, this is unconditional result. Actually says that if we have a LUCA sequence, an associated LUCA sequence with some conditions, then the quality is going to be greater than. So what are my conditions? So I want my discriminant to be odd. I want my Q to be minus 2 to the power of alpha for alpha greater or equal to 0, or Q is a negative square full odd. Negative a squareful odd. And I'm considering n to be an odd multiple of radical of dving that is good. The reason that I'm having like, you might have other triples with quality greater than one, but like if you have these conditions, I guarantee that the quality is going to be greater than one. And I use, like, I'm assuming all these conditions because I need B1 squared to be the maximum in between all those three numbers. All those three numbers. So far, these are the highest qualities that I was able to find for different EQs and like different camps. My search space is not that wide, but like these are the ones that I found so far. And yep. So this is the first part of my talk. Anyone, does anyone have any question? Yes. What do you mean there's some kind of symmetry between the solid ones? So they satisfy the equation, you know, x squared minus px plus q, right? No, they do not satisfy that. We choose a p, we choose a q, and then we like form that quadratic equation, and then we find the roots to that quadratic. Any other question? Yeah. Other question, yeah, the thresholds are good quality. Is that uh a reason? No, uh, actually, the reason that like we did that is because um there is a site that actually gives you uh ABC solutions with like high qualities, and they consider all the qualities greater than 1.4. That's why I'm feeling, yeah, that's it. Okay, great. Okay, so let's move to the next one. Let's move to the next one. Next part of the talk is going to be about an explicit version. We first need a few notations. For any ABC solution, I'm going to set N to be the radical of the product of AB and C. And I'm going to show the number of distinct frag factors of N with omega. So, like if N is 30 to 35, omega is going to be 3. So, in 2004, So in 2004, API came up at a picture that if A, B, and C are positive proprietary integers, satisfying that equation, then C is going to be bounded by 6 over 5 times N times log N to perform the value. So, sorry. Sorry. This is referred to as an exclusive version of the explorer. As an explicit version of the ABC part. And you might ask why. So, this is a partial result that we had that explains why kind of. So, if you consider a positive continuous function epsilon of x, if you fix a c positive, then for fixed omega, if your function satisfies all these three conditions, then you can say that for any integer n, log n to the power of omega over. log n to the power of orbital or orga half real is less than less than uh constant depending on epsilon um times epsilon epsilon n. So in this case, if you put epsilon of x epsilon, like you fix epsilon for epsilon positive, you get the abyss of intensity. If you put epsilon of x, something like one over log log x to the power of alpha, so we check that this function actually satisfies. Check that this function actually satisfies those three conditions and alpha varies between zero and one, but just said that actually this is a refinement of the episode. So in 2012, Leisher and Shore actually showed that if for epsilon equal to 0.75, that quotient is less than n to the power of 0.75. And if we apply that inequality in the conjecture definition, Inequality in the conjecture that we had of the exclusive version, we can actually say that the equality is bounded by one plus 0.75. And in 2015, Silva reduced that to epsilon equal to 0.738, and we were able to reduce that 0.738 to 0.7. So actually, you say that assuming the exclusive version, we can say that C is less than enterprise 1.71. Enter 1.71, and if you take the log of both sides, you can say that the quality is 1.1. Okay, so this is an explicit result. And now what? Maybe I okay. No. So after this, a question that you can ask yourself is that ABC projecture has been used in the field of Diofronton equation. So you grab a Diofanton equation, then we say that if the ABC projector is Then we say that if the ABC conjecture is true, then what can you say about the solutions of that different kind of projection? And usually, those results, if you assume the ABC conjecture, some of the results are implicit because the ABC conjecture is implicit. But this is an explicit version. So we were thinking that maybe we can use this version to get explicit results. One of the things that I were interested in is this equation. So this equation arised separately. arise separately. Roquhard and Robin John asked the ask this question that are there any solutions except these three pairs? And this is still an open question. I will conjecture that these are the only solutions. And a joint work of Brent and Galloway shows that these are the only solutions if N is less than 100 workloads. And in 1993, And in 1993, Oral proved the finiteness of the solutions, assuming the ABC conjecture, but his result did not provide an explicit bound on n or n. But assuming the explicit version, assuming that using our theorem, we could actually show that these three pairs are the only solutions. Do I have time? Okay, good. Okay, so the other thing that I'm So, the other thing that, and I'm just going to finish the talk by a generalization of this problem, actually. So, you can generalize this equation that we have here in different ways. Like instead of one, you could put an integer. But the generalization that I was interested in is actually a work of Pink and Slipside, if I pronounced it correctly, that they considered a LUCA sequence with all the conditions here, and they consider actually this equation. And they considered actually this equation. So Un1 up to Unk and Un are terms in a Luca sequence corresponding to her K and Q. And they said that, okay, these are going to be under some conditions, we are going to have, like, these are going to be the results, the solution that we have. And this is an unconditional result. This is not a simulation. So we generalize their work kinda and use their method, and you can see. Use their method and we consider this equation. So instead of one, I put Q to the power n minus one, where your local sequence is, the local sequence corresponding to her P and Q. And if the discriminant is positive for M greater or equal to seven, I can say that these are the only solutions that I have. And if n is less than seven and is equal to less than or equal to six, this is a tedious computation. You have to write U1, U2, up to U6 using PHQ. U6 using PNQ and then solve all the possibilities that you have, but this is a finite search and you can do it. And for like M0 to 6, these are so thank you for listening.
