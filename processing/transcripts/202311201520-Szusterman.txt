Today we visited inequality related to balance and method into complex bodies. So I need to define a few quantities for you to start with. First, what's uh variance we have? two symmetric comments one V. Well V doesn't really need to be symmetric somehow. So I give you n vectors mu and we're looking for sines plus minus 1 such that the v norm of the sine sum will validate to be small. So we want the smallest copy of the. We want the smallest copy of V, which can sign. So, in other words, that's not symmetric, this is not the norm, but at least this first This first definition still makes sense. Okay, a few examples. So if we take Q equals V, the Euclidean law, this is square root 10, you can see it's a P squared n by taking many whole bases. And why is it less than square root n? Well, if we take the sign at random, The average of a norm squared is less than n, so there exists such that norm square is less than n, meaning such that the L2 norm is less than squared. So another example. So the same probabilistic argument tells you but probabilistic argument tells you that this is the plus n and it's actually of order n c n equals one when there exist Hadamard matrices dimension. Okay, maybe one or two examples more. If we try to find signs for some of the first ball and try to fit them with a C ball, all we can actually always fit them within twice the cube. And this is just hard inequality by putting it on. If you take q equals v q, then this is r square m okay. And there is a unus conjecture around balancing vectors, which is a component conjecture, which states that That type v2 for u and v infinity for v, then this should remain unbliped then. And so it's a conjecture. And the best known upper bomb is due to management. Manage, I don't know. But this is a This is at constant times. Yes. Number of vectors match the dimension, but this is not so relevant. You could define the constant beta prime and you want to allow any length for the vectors. And then this is going to be greater than beta, but it's at most 2 beta. So usually we take n vectors, but it's not so important. He proved this. And this was proven that um Was proving that if V has ocean diagram at least a half, then the balancing will evolve from the factor. And so you apply this with not the cube, which has an exponentially small Gaussian measure, but with a diagnet of Gaussian measure a half. And the dielette you need to take is square root of two of it. And before he got this, a similar inequality was proved for a sister constant, which is not beta, but alpha. So I need to define alpha viewing now. So first, what is the covering address of a lattice with respect to a complex body? Take uh copies of V centered at each point of L, maybe it doesn't cover all of Rn, but maybe dialect of V. If you take copies on ROM with L will cover all of Rn. This is just Next, I need to uh define the successive minima of a lattice with respect to the complex body. Excuse me, L? L, yes, a lattice. Yes. For instance, uh mu of Z n Z N return is our box within So, maybe some of you are familiar with the shortest vector problem. So, the first So the first vector you catch apart from the zero vector, it's a longer one, but more generally if you want to have k dimensions. So you want that convex body T V intersected with Palais. With mileage should span at least KDH. So these are called the successive minimum for any lattice that is you give me For any convex body uv, let's say symmetry. This is bounded by beta of uv times the m successive lina of L with respect to u. Alpha is the supram over all lattices. The supranum over all eddies of this ratio. And both mu and lambda are 1 minus 1 homogeneous, so this is the same taking supremum over lattices such that this is equal to 1 or at most 1, meaning that u should contain, the intersected L will contain the basis of R, and we try to propel. And we try to propound new time. So alpha is always at plus beta, according to the factor of freedom, which gives motivation for finding upper bounds on size. So the inequality I am at mentioning at the title is the following. Yeah, the title is volume. We fix the complex body measure, push a measure at least a half and alpha e to Also constants, and this constant is a short, sharp 10 page. Again, if you take highlight of it, you will get a similar inequality as one which is still in the bottom. Which is still in the book for Law for week. And so, in a newspaper, they make the following conjecture. We should exist a non-decreasing, sorry, non-increasing function f independent of the dimension, such that for any convex part B Get this able to own the balancing vector constant between P and O and P only using the Gaussian legality. Fixed the dimension search function always exists. Supremum over all the speech effects are going to be your exp of ten. But uh conjecture that this should not be another. And so uh if the conjecture holds true, then it will imply the same thing for alpha. So we should explain So we should exist a function f alpha non-increasing, so try current V alpha is less one. So conjecture is open, but we could Is open, but we could prove that the corollary of this conjecture holds true. So for any convex vertex, we trick my left. We have the following quantities which matches this in case an n is equal to 1. But that just tells you that the alpha is smaller than this, but also some steps charger. Although you may argue that since we have homogeneity, why not just use the case people one half and see what we get by it delayed Oh no, just go to this. A is a convex body and if we look at the Gaussian measure of dielectric wave, this is a s On A is a sigma. This is sharp, but not necessarily in higher dimension. So if you use this, you get exactly what's here. But you only get it for a symmetric convex point. Maybe there is a symmetrization argument which should take an arbitrarily into account account for the symmetrization, but we'd allow to use the symmetric case to conclude. To conclude. Like this, we succeed so far. So the other approach is to improve it by induction on the dimension, like they did for the S1. So for n equals 1, that's kind of obvious by the definition of C. That's a good constant. Constant. Why? Because if B has a measure of affected sp, it means that it contains a segment of length at least this. And so for any lattice such that For any levels such that the step is less than this, V has deleted.  So you do, sorry, you do our contraposit. So we want to prove that if the measure is high enough, then V of V is going to be Small enough. Remember, I revolved the supremum by saying that the denominator was equal to one, so we can fix the Fix the lattice so that its intersection with this liquid label contains the basis of Rn, and we want to show that the covering matrix is a possible contraposite some I'll just call this pitch contains users for Portan and And show that here must be small and the discoursion labels real discoursion labels. So I give you a point A, and this is the first time as a dimension. I will guarantee as a prime again. So let me draw the cosets of the atice. And V doesn't meet this cross set, so V doesn't touch any of the points. So in particular, if I take a section at height A n, it's n minus one dimensional convex body, which doesn't meet this lattice. zero dimensional lattice, but we use But we use partition invariants and measures so that after L is given, we fix the basis so that the intersection of L with the first n minus 1 coordinates is n minus 1 minus 1. So by taking the intersection here, intersection, we get that Vm, which is definite this. So Vn, VA sorry, doesn't need this concept, which is a n minus one-dimensional concept. And therefore, we can use induction to go find VAN, the section of height, Scotian meter, lesbian. Now we use the lattice structure because if you don't meet A plus L, you also don't meet B plus L where B is any point in F plus L. Quality we just wrote, we got it for one-dimensional length of time. And then Sherrod's idea here is to construct kind of a hard symmetrization, but which will be two-dimensional. So, congress would be here. And at height C, we got a section whose measure is something, and now we choose a one-dimensional half-line whose measure is the same as this one-dimensional. And if you do that. And if you do that for each height, you get some cross-convex set that we so what we learned here from induction is that A n is here on the possible bn will describe some one-dimensional Lettuce and if I count down the vertical line corresponding to this, we know that the measure of the section is less than p, meaning that this half-line will stop before it will stop on the left. And because W is convex, it means that the intersection of W with the vertical length is contained between two successive points of this one-dimensional x. And by construction, W has the same Gaussian measure as V. The same question measure as V. So showing that W has met P plus P. Purpose, um Mr. Columbus. Columns because W is convex, so you can choose a tangent line here, tangent line here, and W will be contained in a cone. And the cone also, its intersection with this vertical line is exactly the same length as W. So it's enough to show that if I have alpha C, such that the intersection of C this half plane is bounded and if more the length of the intersection was a vertical line is treated as this number So above the symmetric case where we deduce the inequality with alpha directly from people one half case using Petella Palette. I don't know if Know if one can conclude the same thing for alpha, meaning for all convex body B, from a symmetric case. I'm not so sure, like, even if your adversarial lattice is Zn, and like you take a EP double whose Gaussian measure is the same, but the covering radius wouldn't necessarily be increasing by such a symmetrization process. But if it works, that would give notes. If it works, that would give an alternative growth. So the conjuncture is still open. I want to advise this? So you s you said that uh the argument about arbitrary number of texts. Number of vectors in this system, but no, it's older thing, it's deduce. Somehow it can be deduced by some Spencer lemmas. I'm not sure Benashik is the first one who wrote that. Any other questions? So alpha is your lower bound of data. Do you have examples but what it is actually behavioral? So alpha gives a lower bound. So since we have this, for instance, if the conjecture holds true, we have the lower bound theta. So you have examples where alpha is much less. Examples where alpha is much less than beta. But for instance, if I take some ellipsoid, I think this is more or less equal to the corresponding beta. Or if you check you predominantly and then you solve it uh something. Uh something. I don't know for L people's instance. Uh but we don't have we don't have uh an epic one as good. Or here are any other questions, so let's thank Margaret.
