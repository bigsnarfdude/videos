In uh this talk, I mean the g the I'm going to introduce uh some some model which is called the collogram module derivative analysis. That is a uh even in the non-linear dispersive equation it is a pretty new like model. So it is just uh derived uh about ten years ago and then the mathematical regress mathematical analysis just started. Mathematical analysis just started two years ago. So you might not have seen this model before. But and then, but here I want to emphasize that why we are interested in this model and then what is the main benefit to work on here. And then also we'll discuss some some result about this. Okay, because okay, so this work uh is uh the the based on the two joint work Based on the two joint work, uh one is uh the with uh like the Kihan Kim and then Tegyu Kim. Uh and then the other the is uh the the joint work with the Tegyu Kim. Okay, so because uh the that everyone in in the audience are from like learning a dispersible equation field so let me start with some a very uh brief introduction about that. Okay, so the the typical example of The typical example of dispersive equation is nonlinear Schrodinger equation, as you see from here. So, if you ignore such a nonlinear term, like a power type nonlinear term, then such a linear equation, that actually describes some sort of waves, and then because such the linear part of the equation, so one can observe some dispersion effect, which means like actually. which means like uh actually this is uh that describes some some wave phenomenon and then uh when wave waves linear waves are propagate then the speed velocity of the propagation uh that depends on the frequency which means the higher frequency waves they travel faster than the lower frequency so because of that uh the initially uh one can think of like uh the the older frequency waves they are like Frequency waves they are like localized in space, then as time goes, so but by the linear dispersion effect, they have to spread out because higher frequency wave travel away from the and then the low frequency wave will slow. So because of that, the such usually like a linear solution the decay to zero in a certain sense. In a certain sense it means uh for example L infinity norm is going to zero. So that is called dispersive decay. So that is called dispersive decay. Okay? So but such uh the s so i the it is very well known the what is the main behavior about the linear solution. Okay, but in this area, the user, our like main interest is what happened when we have nonlinear terms. Then such a linear effect and then nonlinear effect they may collide and then they create. And then they create some sort of interesting like dynamical behavior. So that is our main topic. So some global dynamics has several scenarios. And then if I simplify things, then we can at least decompose into the three category. So one is like a scattering, and then the scattering is nothing but like. Scattering is nothing but like a dispersion. So, which means even if a solution is a nonlinear solution, then if the linear dispersion effect is stronger, then the nonlinear part do not do an important role. So, solutions just c converge to zero as like a linear solution. Then, if a solution converts to zero, then the linear term vanishing nonlinear term vanishing the relatively faster, so uh we can expect the nonlinear solution is uh is converging to the linear solution. Okay, so that such a behavior is called uh scattering. Okay, so scattering is one of like a typical like uh dynamical behavior of the nonlinear displacement equation. Okay, and then the opposite case is uh is a blow-up, okay? So blow-up and in the occurs in many like uh the nonlinear equations. Many, like the nonlinear equation, for example, from like a fluid dynamics. So, when this solution has a stronger, like a nonlinear attractive effect, the feedback, so because of that, solution contract in a concentrate in a smaller and smaller region. So, it is possible that it blow up in finite time or the infinite time. Okay, so such a blow may. So uh such a block may occur when nonlinear term the actually govern the dynamics. Nonlinear term i is is mm is more important in the dynamics. Okay, so scattering and blow-up, they are actually the opposite behavior of the dynamics. Okay, then so when those two effects dispersion and the linear term, they make some balance. So solutions do not disperse further. Solution do not disperse further but do not concentrate, then so one can expect a sort of non-dispersing solution. Okay, non-dispersing solution, but which do not concentrate in a smaller and smaller region. So such a solution, I mean in the larger sense, it is called the almost periodic solution or the non-scattering solution or non-dispersing solution in some sense. But some typical example of such an almost periodic solution. Of such an almost periodic solution is called soliton. So usually we say like such a solid is such a solution which has a permanent shape, like some usually such a permanent shape and then it travel with constant speed and then sometimes it may take some phase rotation, then such a solution is called the soliton. And then usually such a soliton, when the in Such solitons when the in a domain, there could be many such solitons, right? Then it is called multi-soliton solution. Okay, then what is like what would be the main question about such a global dynamics? Okay, so the previous three category is like all possible like the behavior of the dynamics. Okay, then for given like equation, non-linear equation. like equation, Nerlina equation, we want to investigate, we want to look at all possible global dynamics of the solution. So obviously the first question would be to ask if solution is the global world blow. So I mean if there exists a global blow solution or every solution has to global. Then afterward we Then afterward, we can still ask many other questions to get refined information about each case. So for example, when solution is global, then one may ask what is a typical or symptomative behavior of the solution. So previously I told about the solitone, then usually it is well believed that many such a solitone solution are stable. Soliton solution are stable, and then if the solution is stable, in what sense? Okay, and then or if it is asymptotically stable. And then one can also further ask the more questions about the global solution. And then for the block solution, we still have many refined questions. What could be the block rate? And then if one can constrain such like a single Can constraint such a like a single profile block, or if there are like a several profile block, or like when two profiles block which is colliding, there are many, there could be many scenario. And then we wanna, our eventual goal to study the global dynamics is to basically the classify all the fate of the solution in the in the global dynamics, what what what could be happening. What could be happen? And then if the floor is instable, then what could be the instable mechanism of the floor solution? That is also very interesting, the natural question. And then all those such a question, I think the very first, like the very well formulated conjecture is called the solitone resolution conjecture. So this is somewhat the special tool. So this is somewhat the special tool, like many nonlinear dispersive equation and also the many nonlinear parabolic equation. So the solitones, we believe that solitone plays a pivotal role. So the previously I told that the solitone can occur by the balance of dispersion effect and nulling effect. Okay? But uh in this conjecture we believe that solitone is kinda generic behavior. kind of generic behavior. So when if you even if you start with like any like a solution, then eventually the solution decomposed into some of the solutions and the radiation part. Radiation part is nothing but a scattering part. The scattering part is a linear solution. So this is a very very strong I mean when I saw like such a conjecture I thought it the it this is I thought this is a very strong statement. So we can make a conjecture to both the global solution and the blue solution. If the solution blow up, then if you look at some like sort of like fluid mechanics, then one can expect there are various kinds of scenario of the blow. But in here, in this conjecture, say, blow may. In this conjecture, blow may occur only by solutent profile, which is contracting to zero. Okay? And then, so if solution blows up, then it decomposes some of just the blue profile, which is basically solitons, they're contracting at a different scale, and then with some asymptotic profile. So, this is one of the main conjectures, and then regarding the generic dynamics. And then such a conjecture was inspired from like a completely integrable equation. So since the 1960s, the KDV equation was known to be completely integrable. So by using the scattering and inverse scattering method, the K D V, the has one can solve K K D V equation and then And then, if you look at the initial data of the KDB profile, then by the isospectra property, then one can anticipate what is the fate of the solution. So, which means from the initial data, we can completely determine how many solutions and then what are radiation parts. So, such a conjecture is a solution, is a theorem for many completely integral equations. For many completely integrable equations. So, firstly, it is shown for the Kdv and then 1D cubic NLS and then derivative NLS. They are all known. And then the recently, for some non-integrable equation, when there is no such a completely integrability, then still soliton resolution was proved to for last ten, fifteen years, the there are quite a progress. Quite a progress, mostly due to by like Dewey Kennedy-Mail. They have worked on the radial non-linear wave equation and then wave maps. And then Yandre Lauri gave recently the like a second proof about that. And then also the non-linear heat equation or harmonic heat flow, we have like a theorem. But the most of such a result is about the radial case. Okay, then now let me uh discuss about our model, like a Carlogra model, uh the DNLS. So this is uh a kind of the like a non-linear Schrödinger equation, okay? So the and then defined on 1D. Okay, so this is one D linear Schradinger equation part, and then nonlinear term is a cubic term and which contains one derivative. Okay, so So one can think of this equation is very similar to derivative NLS, like the cubic NLS with one derivative. But here, the derivative is somewhat special. It has a D plus. D plus means the derivative with projection in the frequency space to the positive frequency. Okay? So if you think of like a projection to the positive frequency, it is basically one identity. Basically, one identity plus i times Hilbert transform over two, right? So, which means this nonlinear term has some sort of non-local operator. Okay? So, but at the whatever region, such an equation was like derived from a very natural canonical Hamiltonian system of ODE. So, the original So, the originally Carlogero Mojar Hamiltonian system is written by Hamiltonian system written by such an Hamiltonian. And then the module have shown that this Hamiltonian system is completely integrable in the sense of Hamiltonian system. And then in 2009, so three people have derived the continuum limit of this Hamiltonian system. That is the this Kalog delivery analysis. Delivery by NLS. And then the because of that, and then it is called like a continuum colour module model or just calculated module NLS. So because it is derived in a very like the natural way from an integrable Hamiltonian system, one can expect there could be some very nice structure in this equation. Although Equation, okay, although the equation looks like more quite complicated. And then, so most recently, oh, okay, so before then, so because of such a positive frequency projection, for this equation, like the solution in the hard space, like L2 space with the support in the positive frequency, that is such a problem. Such a property is preserved under the flow. And then we're going to call such a solution chiral solution. So in physics, such a notion of the chirality is used in many places, but in this model, we're going to call if the solution has a frequency support only on the positive frequency, then it is a chiropol solution. Solution and that. Then for the Kairi solution, the Gerard and Lynchman, the two years ago, they have discovered like a Lux pair. So, which means by demonstrating what is a Lux pair, they have shown that this continuum limit is also completely integrable in the sense of the existence of Lux pair. And then, as a consequence of the Lax pair, there are here. There are like a hierarchy, infinite hierarchy of the concept quantity, and then also by some work of the Gerard and then the collaborator, one can obtain an explicit formula of the weak global solution. So this equation is known to be like it is now known to be like a the completely integral equation. It's like a K D V or Benjamin Ono or or one D cubic NLS. or 1D cubic NLS. Okay, and then, but uh, this is uh somewhat different from like uh such an order integrable equation by the following region. First of all, such an equation is L2 critical, the mass critical, and then it enjoys all the like a symmetry uh the shared with like a mass critical analysis. Okay, so it is So it has differently phase rotations at the like a translation and then mass critical act critical scaling and then also it has a Galilean booster. Okay and then once you have such a symmetry then there are associated like conservation laws by the principle. So we have like a force three conserved quantity and then because of like complete integrability there are many more conservatives Integrability, there are many more concepts of quantity in higher order. And then, so in addition, what is more important is a pseudo-conformal symmetry. So, it is well known that the mass critical non-linear Schrodinger equation has a pseudo-conformal symmetry. So, once you t x is a solution, then if you take such a transform, which is similar to like an inverse. The which is similar to like inversion, the transform, the in in in time variable, then this becomes also a solution. Okay? So it has a pseudoconformal symmetry. Okay, so that is the one of the main difference from the other like integrable equations. Okay. And then also, uh this equation is also has some connection It also has some connection with a user delivery panelist, which is another integrable equation. So we have a gauge transform, which is written by this formula. And then this is exactly the gauge transform of daily body by NLS. And then if you take such a gauge transform to this CMD NLS, then uh the equation turn to uh this uh like uh equation. Okay, so this is called gauged This is called gauged the Carlogromojo equation. So with respect to such a gauge transform, such an equation has a very similar structure with a delivery NLS. So one can think of the original CMD NLS or such a gauge equation. They are basically equivalent. But such a gauge equation has many benefits because of the Hamiltonian. Because of the Hamiltonian structure. So in this case, the equation, such an equation is a self-dual, like a Hamiltonian equation with the self-dual energy. And then basically such the Hamiltonian equation with respect to such a usual like the symplectic form. So original like a CMD analysis also Hamiltonian equation, but symplectic form is very form is very complicated, so it's not so easy to exploit such a symplectic structure. But here, the case, the equation is easier to handle. And then, so in here, what I want to really mention is about the form of the energy. Energy is a complete square of something. So which means in particular that shows that the energy is not negative. Is non-negative, okay? But you can recall that the energy functional of non-linear, usual non-linear Schwarzenegger equation is not non-negative, it's sine-definite, okay? So that makes the problem is really harder than this one. So this has a lot of benefit in this equation. So because of such a the nice structure, then we thought that this model is This model is somewhat like an easier candidate to study some serious global dynamics. So previously I told the solitone. And then the solitone is given by such a as a solution of the first order equation, like when the inside of the energy part is. The inside of the energy part is zero, then it it is just a solution. Okay, so which means a zero energy sol solution. Okay, so this is a solution which is independent of the time, so like a stationary solution. So and then this R is a solution to the CMD analysis and then Q is a solution to the gauged equation. Okay, so and then we are thinking of the two equations between in between there are in between. In between, like the gauge transform. Then, if you apply the pseudo-conformal transform to this solution, then one can immediately obtain like a finite block solution. Because R is like just stationary, then such a solution the blows of infinite in at time zero. Okay, so this is a very easy, explicit. A very easy, explicit formula of the fluff solution. Okay, and then this fluff solution blows up with the rate. Lambda T is just T. Okay, so here, throughout this talk, whenever I say lambda, lambda is basically length scale. So block solution means lambda t is going to zero at t going to block time. Okay? So this block rate is like this. This blue rate is like this. But the problem of such the explicit block solution is like a decay of the solution. So it has a pseudo-conformal factor. So unfortunately, such a solution does not belong to like energy space. It has an infinite energy. Because the the decay is just one over x, it is slow, and then it has a like a And then it has a like such a pseudoconform phase, so it does not belong to H1. So if you think of like an energy, like a Hamiltonian system within the energy class, then this is not a good blue of solution. This is not a physical blue solution at all. Okay? Okay, so that is like the some algebraic factor of about like CS. To about the color group module DNLS. And then from Jerry Lentman's work and then the afterworld, there are some known results regarding the global dynamics. But the most are a consequence of the Lax structure that is discovered by Gerald Lensman. So basically they are the Uh the those are all known uh the results so far. So if uh like a mass uh is strictly less than the mass of the soliton, then that means uh we're gonna call this is a soft threshold dynamics. Okay, so when uh in the mass critical equation is uh if mass is not sufficient to form up a non-dispersing first non non-dispersing solution, solitone, then every solution has to scatter. Okay, that is like a Has to scatter. That is like a conjecture, and then it has been known for many the math critical equation for last 15 years. And then actually, Gerald Lynchman, in their own paper, by using the hierarchy of the conservation concept of quantity, they can show that such a concept of quantity is coercive and then can control all ages. And then can control all HK norm under this mass condition. Okay? And then, so, but uh, they didn't show that like a scattering, okay, the below such a mass. Okay, on the threshold of the mass, so there is also a long story about the threshold dynamics for the mass critical linear trading equation, and then what is Equation and then what is known for the NLS is basically the on this threshold, the dynamics are pretty rigid. There could be just a solitone scattering solution or SP or like a pseudo-conform group solution. Only just three possibilities. It is known for the NLS. And then the same thing happened for the NLS as well. But the problem here is such an ST solution, this is not in H1. In H1. Okay? So if you think of like H1 dynamics energy space, then every solution has to be global because S T is ruled out. But the argument is basically followed of the similar to that of the Mayor, the original proof of the about the threshold dynamics of NLS. Yeah, I think the most interesting result is about the threshold. About the above the threshold. So, in the paper of the Gerard Lentman, so I think this is main the result of their paper, they have constructed by using the Lux pair structure, the exact multi-soluton solution. Then, the usual multi-solution solution, such as for the KDV, DNLS, or NLS, they are just a global solution. Global solution which has a like a uniform bound or Like a uniform bound of all HK norms. But here, the multi-soliton solution of CMDNLS, it has like a infinite block solution. So HK norm, the HK norm, it's growing to the infinity. At in so this is one example of infinite time block solution. And then the in their paper they call this is kinda a turbulent solution. Kind of a turbulent solution. Okay? And then such a result is improved by the Hoogan and Cobalt C. So this is what is known so far. So mostly when the mass constraint, when mass is strictly less the mass less than or equal to like a ground state mass, or if mass is greater than like a ground state mass, then they Like a ground state mass, then they presented just one example of infinite time blow solution. Okay? Okay, then the natural question would be one can ask many questions. Without the mass constraint, we can ask what happened in the global dynamics. Okay? So our like the first result I'm going to present, in fact chronologically, so this is In fact, chronologically, so this is our second result, and then uh w we didn't post uh to the archive yet, but the I mean in it to introduce like uh like uh stories, I mean the I think I have to introduce my second result first. So this is actually the solitone resolution. Okay, so the statement is exactly the almost the same as I introduced what is the solitone resolution conjecture. So Conjecture. So we have like the finite time block or the global solution case. If a solution blocks in finite time, then solution has to block with profile, blow profile like a soliton ground state. But there could be several like a blow profile, but here lambda j, this is going to be a lower. Here, lambda j, this is going to zero, and then we have upper bound of the lambda j, length k. Length is the blow of time is a capital T, so little as little t approaching to t, capital T, then lambda j is going to zero, so this is each contracting the profile, and then so I mean, so but but this is uh all the profile i is going to zero. Is going to zero at the same time. And then, so here the parameter xj, that is like a center of the solitone, location of the solitone. And then, so here, so in usual solitone resolution for the finite temple of case, it is possible that there is a blue-off solution and then another like a blue-off solution on the same center, and then on. On the same center, and then another block solution, but they are contracting at all different scales. So, this is this type of block solution is called bubble tower or bubble tree. But in this example, that condition, the center of the two bubble, the distance between the center of the two bubble is greater than each scale. So, which means K. So which means there is no such a such a bubble tree. Even if they are contracting, such a distance is larger than it is K. Okay? So that is also shown at the same time. So this is the statement for the solitary resolution of the finite template case. And then the global case, see, we have to assume that the solution is in the That the solution is in the weighted space, H11 space. I mean, so in fact, all the analysis to show such a solute resolution is for the finite number case. And then I use pseudoconformal transform, aforementioned pseudo-conformal transform, to obtain the result for the global case. So because we want to use the pseudo-conformal transform, pseudo-conformal transform can be just. Schudoconform transform can be justified in the weighted space. Okay? So that's why for the global solution, U is in the weighted space, then the solution can be decomposed, the the is decomposed into like a traveling solitone, so sum of a traveling solitone with the linear scattering part. Okay? And then so here And then, so here, so it the the parameter involved in the the the solutum part is more complicated, but in fact it has a like uh such a it has uh three parameters, lambda, gamma, and C. Here C is basically Kalium boost parameter, like uh which is a velocity, 2Cj is actually velocity of the solitone. Okay, then if two CJ is a velocity, If 2 CJ is the velocity of soliton, then 2 T C J, this is actually the location of the soliton, then we can obtain the same type of the like a novel arbitrary condition in terms of the location and scale. So location of the two soliton has to be the go has to go to the infinity. And then also the velocity has to converge, which means the The converge, which means such a traveling solitone travel at constant speed. So that consistent with the other like a solitone resolution result of like a KDV. Okay, so I think I I almost uh told about like some uh uh the the comment. So so this results say that there is no like a bubble tree. That there is no like a bubble tree. And then, in fact, in the proof, we show we do such an analysis on the gauged side, gauged CMDNLS. And then we first show like a pull-off solution, pull-up case for the gauged CMDNLS, and then use a pseudoconformal transform and to obtain the result for the global case. And then we use like a gauge transform to obtain the same result for the original CMD analysis. So by the basically, there are actually four cases like the global block, global block, and then for both the two equations, but they are all generated from just one case, growth cases. And then there is no And then the no there is no bubble tree. So such a solid resolution is the the proof is relatively the shorter than other like solid resolution result because of those two regions. And then the first one is a variational structure. So as you see, this equation, soliton solution, has a a very nice variation. A very nice variation structure. I told that the energy is non-negative, right? So, and then it is known that if a solution is stationary, then if and only if it is a zero energy solution. And then we can solve general energy solution as well. And then, also, zero energy solution is a first-order equation. So, it is not difficult to see. It is not difficult to see that the uniqueness of the such a general energy solution. Okay? So that was already obtained by the Gerard and Lechman. And then also such a nice variational structure saying that if a solution has a very small energy, which is close to zero, then it has to close to Q, to R. I mean, if energy of I mean, if energy of u is uh like uh smaller, then you has to be you has to close to ground state. So this is a very strong like uh variational structure. Okay, so if you think of usual non-linearity equation, mass create non-interrupting equation, then you you don't have we don't have such a nice variation structure. One has to specify size of the length. By size of the length, size of the mass. The mass is close to mass of ground state, and then if energy is negative, then we can say that the solution is close to the soliton. But here, with the unconditional mass constraint, we can have the variation structure. That is one of the main benefits of this equation. And then the second ingredient to And then the second ingredient, which we call energy bubbling estimate, I think this is the novelty of this work, is this simple equation, inequality. So once we put the solution near the ground state solution, like solution u is like a q plus epsilon, then we have such an inequality. So here, the chi r is a truncation. So here the chi R is a truncation to the to the inner inner region and then this is exterior radiation. So we can control the inner part of the radiation by the energy but for the exterior part of the energy we cannot control but we can still control energy of the exterior part. Okay? So such an energy bubble So such uh such energy bubbling estimate that is uh inspired from like uh the similar estimate of Chun-Simon Schroeding equation that I'm going to mention later. So they have uh in CSS it has a very strong like uh this the inequality. Okay, so this looks like a simple but it contains all those terms in H.1 node. Okay, but uh in this equation uh if Exterior part of the radiation is not controlled. We can only control the energy. So the argument is the following. If energy is small, then we can first extract one soliton. Which means we can write solution U in terms of soliton processing radiation. Okay? And then for the radiation part, we wanna extract the second soliton, then Then we have to expect the radiation part of the energy is still small. But this inequality is saying that the exterior part of the energy is small when this is small. So we can extract the second soliton. So we can iterate such a procedure to obtain the multi-soliton configuration from this. But because for the CSS, we have We have like such a very simple coarse quality estimate. So, because of this, solitone resolution for CSS is very simple, which means there is no multi-solitone, just a single solitone. Okay, so there is the main difference between those two work. Okay, so this is the second work, and then the first work is about like a finite temple of solution. Actually, solid to reduce. Solution. Actually, solid resolution is saying that if a solution blows up, then this has to happen. Okay? But this does not say there exists such a like a finite temple of solutions, right? So although we have solutions resolution, we have to, I mean, we want to show such dynamics are really happen. Okay? There exists really such dynamics. So we So we have constructed a finite temple of solution. So this the so for CMDNLS and then we can construct the that we can find we can show there are like a smooth initial data which is also chiral. I mean the frequency support is on positive and then the mass of U can be up very close to the mass of Can be arbitrarily close to the mass of uh the soliton, then we can we can show that there exists like such a finite temporal solution. Okay, so I think this is the first example which exhibits the finite temporal solution among the all integrable equations. So in order to construct such a finite temporal solution, we also worked on the case side equation. Worked on the case-side equation. And then on the gauged side equation, we can construct like basically co-dimension one set of the initial data which is leaves of wall. So this is a comment about the finite number of solutions. So um so basically uh the we are the The the we work by using like a mo so-called modulation analysis. Okay? So which means for given a solution U, actually we want to construct some sort of the the dynamics which shows like a blob with a profile which is the same as like a soliton profile. The same as like a soliton profile. So, in view of such a symmetry, like a translation and scaling and phase rotation symmetry, so naturally we can introduce like a three symmetry parameter. And then we also have to introduce another like a three parameter which A 3 parameter which governs like a dynamics of three symmetry parameters. Okay, so basically, in total, we introduce six parameters. So basically, we decompose solution u I sorry, this is typo, solution u into like a sixth parameter with some rate, some error part, epsilon. Okay, so Okay, so first of all, for given our initial data set, we can decompose into like a six-dimensional space and then four-dimensional sixth-space. Okay? And then this is actually exposition of such a decomposition. And then writing down solution in this form, and then so here the R d eta nu, this is a basic. This is basically some correction profile depending on the three parameters and then generated from the original solution R. And then by carefully constructing such a profile and then derive some parameters parameter. Of such a parameters. Okay? And then if we are able to construct a dynamics where lambda of t is going to zero in finite time, then we are done. Then we can show like existence of the finite temperature solution. So here, what I mean by a coordination one stability is in that sense. So what we can show is basically, so initial data can be written as six. Initial data can be written as a six parameter with epsilon. Then, for given like a five parameter and epsilon, there exist another par the extra the last parameter, which is leader flow. In that sense, we're gonna call it like a co-dimension one flow. So, from the point of view of the construction, we do not believe such a solo such a blow. Such a fluff solution is stable. It is definitely instable. But if you look at such an initial data set, then there are a co-dimension one hypersurface which is leads of law. Then one may ask like a question, like so this is a the this is a set of the initial data. This is a set of the initial data, and then this is the block manifold. Which means if initial data starts from here, then it has a block, right? Then one may ask what happened the dynamics near the blue manifold. Like if you slightly perturb such initial data, then this solution, solution starts from from here. Start from here to not block, right? Then we can still want to express the dynamics of such a solution which is very to vlog, which is very close to flow but do not vlog. So in the middle of the proof of the modulation analysis, we have a clue that some behavior, the near-development. Behavior, the near-double evolution, which is called like a rotational instability behavior. That is first observed from the work of the trans-dimensional radio equation, which means the if you have a solution at t equals zero, then this is like a block time, then block solution just a block here, like right here. Okay? But uh if you slightly perturb such a such a block solution, then Such a block solution, then such a solution, the contractor of 2 dots k with a small parameter with like a taji l square and then stop contracting further but the spreading out. And then on the way of such so the and then the the the the time taking in in in Taking in the changing such a direction of the scale is the same as a small parameter, the zero. And then on the way of the on this short time, they take a uniform phase rotation by pi, by angle pi. Okay? So this is called like a rotational instability and then Instability and then it also shows some more information about the block, so some neighborhood solution, the nearby the block solution. Okay, so finally, let me make some comparison with the other model, other well-known models. model like uh so uh the our the main the most important the model is uh the definitely the math critical linear shrinking equation okay and then for the math critical linear shrinking equation uh was shown that by the mera fire so log log blow up uh actually more precisely the self-similar with the log log correction block that is a more quite a generic blow up behavior so and then what they have shown is uh And what they have shown is near soliton, near the ground state, if energy is negative, then the block has to occur with this ray. And then there is another known block regime, which is called the pseudoconformal block regime. So that is a different block ray. So T C is also possible, but such a block is non-generic, it is instable. Okay. And then for the delivery analysis, which is another like uh the complete integral equation, but it has been the long standing open problem if all solutions global or not. But the about three years ago, like Bahurian parliament, they have shown good global regularity of the solution. So it the so CMDNLS, which is very close to like a DNLS, has Close to like DNLS has takes quite a different story than the delivery of NLS. And then the last one is the radial translation shrinking equation. So that is actually our old works. So and then the many things, the result work, the method for the CMD analysis inspired from the experience of the Chun Simon Schwartinger works. So they have Demonstrating works. So they have like also non-generic block with this pseudoconformal with the log correction rate. And then for this equation, so solitone resolution is also known, but this solitone resolution is much simpler than CMDNS. It may contain just at most one single one soliton. Okay, so configuration is much simpler than CMDN analysis. Okay, so I mean I just Okay, so I mean I I just uh the want wanted to mention some some ingredients of the proof, but uh this is this time this is not so important. So let me start here.
