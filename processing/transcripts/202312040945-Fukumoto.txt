This is a collaboration with my previous student, Dr. Lonbro. And I'll talk about the formulation of mechanics given by Yoichio Nambri, Nobel Prize winner. And he started from reconciliation of motion of. Of motion of pre-digital body, and as you may know, you define the angular momentum, actually, angular velocity viewed from the body frame. Then, angular momentum is given by multiplying inertial sensors, and the equation motion is derived by Euler. And this is well known as formulated as a leap. As formulated as a lead force from blockage, and the Hamilton equation is given by this. And now I'm going to consider what is there. This is just a structural constant of a standard V personal bracket. And even of the any the smart tool of the and the momentum has And the momentum has cashmere constant. And in particular, if you take a square, then this L is given by the gradient of this square. Then a number formulates this repository equation in this triplet. This is just determined. Then you will derive the motion of the angular velocity. Portion of the angular velocity viewed from the moving attached to the body in this way. What this means? This may be viewed as normal to the constant of cashier. Then this means normal to normal. It means the angle momentum evolves on the constant surface of G, also constant surface H. Constant size H, then the motion occurs along the intersection of this casino and Hamiltonian. And in a similar thing happens to motion in compressed books, and you may know this picture written by Baris and very young, very famous papers. And the motion of order flow occurs, of course, along the constant control of energy in its surface. And at the same time, a local faturation is conserved. This is known as the theorem and this another way. Then are not formulated. So a federal flow is a conditional. Is a conditional extreme function of energy Hamiltonian with respect to isophosphal perturbation. I suppose the perturbation is just the perturbation while keeping the local, every local circulation. In this video, one point is not a special point, just a represent whole flow field. Flow field. Then different points show a different flow field. But Euler flows just evolves along the constant circulation or this is constant archbook the sea and also constant energy contract. Then an intersection is the trajectory of the evolution of the oil flows. The oil flows. Then let's see this from another viewpoint. As you may know, incompressive order flows is given by this Lipoisson equations. And let's see what is this structure constant. And you may well know. You may well know this is the constant Helicity just given by his Mohat 1969. Then using this, you can relate equation of motion in this way. So this is a structure constant, and by just manipulations, you end up with this tweak rate. And actually, And actually, this tau b is the functional derivative of helicity, then you can get this num representation. And the equation motion is just given by this. This means that, like before, for the pre-digit body, evolution of the velocity occurs along the constant energy control and the Energy control and the constant heuristic. If this is just a repeat, then as good as sheets, it's just this normal vector to the helicopter controller. Then a cross product normal to normal means that this is a perturbation around the helicopter. And using this representation of isobotical perturbations, you can You can just take derivative variation of energy and just manipulation. Then you end up with this formulation. And actually, this B is a functional derivative of the energies. Then for steady flow, I mean this is zero. Then for any vector field, see for steady flow energy. For steady flow, energy has just a critical. So this is a very simple proof of the Anon theorem. Then today, just we move on to the magnet hydrodynamics. And this means we extend numb bracket. In earlier papers, numbers imagine several extensions. Table extension. And one way is one way to increase number of independent variables. The other way I should increase a pair of Hamiltonians. First Hamiltonian should be energy. Second Hamiltonian should be casinos. Let's see what's going on for. See what's going on for MATD. And just today, I saw about purposes, number for MATD. Before this, you will see what is the topological invariant for the MATD, including bulk printing effect. So we consider the effect of low-income. Uh, rowing force and bargaining effect, and this is equations. And if this bargaining turn and the rule force, then HT is no longer a proposal invariant. You have to find other invariants. And also, this is well established reporting blockage for the MH. Blacket for the MATD, including bar print PFS, first derived by Peter Morrison and Green. Then, Hameli, just 20 years ago, claimed there are four passengers or four topology invariants. The obvious one is a mass and Is a mass and total entropy, and as you may know, this magnetic helicity. And he claimed close Helicity is just a fourth and last topological invariant. And C is a vector potential of this D. I call a displacement vector. And D is governed by the same equation as magnetic field, but. Magnetic field, but subject to constraints, so anoidal and this entropy condition and just compatibility with magnetic field. But Hame himself cannot show this close heavy. This is D in my notation. Close Helicity is not is casimir. Then he just checked by. Just check by in other ways. Therefore, there's some difficulty. Prostherity is qualified as a casmia invariant. And also, there are several attempts to extend numb bracket to METD, but apparently, only available one is the incompressed case by. By Sarazar and Tubanski. Also, there are compressed case by Nebier Nevar and Tomana, but they use this H. But HC is not Casmia invariant. Then I don't think this is the idealized one. Then let's first see what is. Let's first see what is topological invariant. And as many people say, this topological invariant is by NATO's theorem, this is an integral invariant associated with particle 11 in symmetry. Then let's just formulate NATO theorem. There are many I think more, but many of these proofs of NATO theorem use this so-called forward map, just particle trajectories, and also geometric formulation by form massing latitudes. And our formulation is more direct to prove a natural setting. Just we use inverse map of the Use an inbus map of the part of the trajectory, what we call library function. This is a free map. This is trajectory of starting from capital X and after time T it goes X. And for just using party deriving symmetry, it's much simpler to use in business maps. Inverse map. This is direct. Then inverse map is by definition, if you start from x, it goes to x, then it comes back by the, this is the inverse map, then it comes back to the original place. And taking derivative, you may know the evolution of level map. And this trajectory, time derivative, or trajectory is defined as. Is defined as the fluid velocity. Then, from this relation, you get fluid velocities, and you take variation of the level, then you get variation of the velocity associated with this variation. Also, you assume a conservation mass, then this is determinant of this matrix. Then, from variation of level, you Of a level, you get a variation of density and so on. And so, this is variation of the velocity, variation density, and entropy, and also variation magnet field. Then, variation of the action is given by this. L is the Lagrangian densities. Then, this is the variation of action if you insert this here. Uh, this here, then uh, if you define uh this di like a pressure, temperature, magnitude, but uh at this level you do not uh specify the detailed form of uh Lagrange density, then uh you get this equation and you may call Euda Plancker equation uh generized uh Dari Holmes. Doing diary homes and mass analysis for the incompressed case. And if you insert this prepare, then you find this Vi become Vn Ui equals and the usual Euler equation is recovered. And this is simplified if you return to the Lagrangian. Laborangian functions, just you use these definitions and translate independent variables from the current position to the original positions. You get simpler form, but this is equivalent. And if you keep this substantive by boundary coefficients, you end up with Euler Planetary equations in terms of material coordinates. Terms of material cognates. Then natural seven used for this identities because now participating means this is no change, current density, no change, entropy, current magnitude, no change. Then it's very evident variation of action zero. Zero and then this becomes identity because particle gravity can be taken arbitrarily and so you get these equations. But in our case, you may at the outset specify massive conserved massive conserved and enthalpy is just adiabatic. Just idea what we evolved and also magnetic plastic comes up. Only a level it changed. Then this level change at this constraint. Then with this constraint, this becomes identifies. And if you first assume all the Punker equations, then you are left with this. And this is actually the conservation law. and the time derivative part gives the conservation integral so this is the neutral theorems then you go to the current from the original position to current positions by just using this then this you may define from a original library function to the current library function The candidate function and after this is the same one of the Cauchy solution of the voltage tree. Then this is governed by this equation. And this integral is after rewriting, it becomes this. Then in the current position, you have this conservation of this close heresy and constraint of the momentum and entropy and the magnetic track come in this way. In this way, and this is the close racing and coincides with Hame derived 2004. Then just a comment. Some of you may know other topological invariant. 1981, MOGS just introduced this function tau related to T, then by putting this. Putting this uh barton effect uh can be absorbed into the form of the bar in the same form of barcode effect. Also, Bradnid Mohat, Beckenstein Olong, introduce just this M, vector M, reactive with current. Then by putting this also Lorentz term can be apology just Apparently, just eliminated in the form of the barotropic and non-magnetic neutral fluids. Then a healthy of this is conserved. And in the scheme of the natural theorem, this is this baryon symmetry. Action is obviously unchanged if you use this combination of. Combination of leveling functions, then this becomes identities. And the previous theorem uses only this identity. But you may add this divergence sum because this is integrity to end up with zero. Then by just putting this divergence sum, then you can cook this and you get same form of the helicity, even if about the effect. Even if a balcony effect and magnetic field or rolling force is included. Okay, then let's go to the non-bracket. There are four, but mass is just a linear form. And there are three other is a quadratic. This is just this field and the velocity. And for our convenience. For our convenience, we use this small d by dividing by density. Then, this is close helicity, and this is total entropy manual helicity. And using this, you get this non-bracket form. And I showed there are previous ones, but this is better because all the coefficients is constant, actually, one, and this is. And this doesn't have unused terms. This is a rather complex implementation. And also, you may remember Tamer did not show process, it's not cashmere, but from this, it no problem by By from this way of making numbra target, Casimir is obviously obvious casino is easy to talk that for any function of k Hamiltonians, this is this part of the evidence and second bracket. And second bracket is eliminate zero by the constraint. And third bracket also zero by constraint. Then to C is casino. And what was wrong with original for some drugs? So this part is the equivalent one first design by Moiston Green. But by adding And by adding these stamps, you may rescue the problem of the HC processes non-passing yet. Okay, summary, we showed a hopeless invariant from the natal serums, including bargaining effect and And Lawrence Poss. And there are actually four casino at Hamerica. And this closed HT is governed by the same equation as the magnetic field, but subject to constraint. Yes. And I can show first you can reach the numb bracket using all the Using all the four casimirs. But using this linear form in law does not say much and actually many unused terms. Then by skipping this, you may write, use only three brackets. And this has desired properties and the saves. Just save the problem of the cloth hereicity, and then there are several ways to develop. And this number blockage lockdown is actually related with integral hierarchies, like Lange-Parring derived from the Boltzmann equations. Also, also from the this representation which showed anorem and also this can be extended to the mentv and from this you can go on to the further important quantity in second order in non-linear non-linearity wave energy and wave indigenous flow and this is the topic of the next speaker Next speaker, Dr. Rondo. Also, this will help us to cook a numerical scheme, so-called structure preserving numerical methods. This extension of the like simple integrator or something like that. And we need to just deepen or more just redundancy, just MHD equation. See just MHD equation hub and another direction relativistic extensions. And thank you very much for your extent for your just attention.
