Come from the physics of electrons in the binary system. So, this is uh joint work with uh Tobia Stauber, who uh uh tries to keep me straight about the physics of the problem. And so, the scope, the goal of this talk is to show you some dispersion relations, explicit dispersion relations, but there are also some open questions that I will try to allude to at the end of my talk. Um, so we all know that two-dimensional materials have been. That two-dimensional materials have been a wonderful laboratory for many interesting phenomena ranging from optics, optical phenomena, to elasticity, to electronic and thermal transport. And in this talk, I would like to discuss aspects of 2D plasmonics with these materials and specifically the propagation of electromagnetic edge modes in conducting bilayer systems. To my knowledge, they are not, I haven't seen, at least, I have I haven't seen, at least I have not seen experiments, I have not seen data from experiments about edge modes, electromagnetic edge modes in bilinear systems. So I hope that this topic will perhaps motivate some designs, or at least that's the hope. The main goal of this talk is to show a correspondence through the dispersion relation of bilayer to single-layer system. So allow me to start by. So allow me to start by perhaps, as a means of introduction, saying a few things about edge modes in single-layer system from an experiment. Okay? So the system is graphene nanorebons. They're illuminated by laser fields. This experiment I think was carried out in 2015. And a laser beam comes and is scattered by a tip on top of the nanoribon. And what we see here is the laser. And what we see here is the electric field imaging, so of the scattered field, uh of the field on the on the on the one nanorebone. This is the nanoribbon here. And measurement of the electric field perpendicular to the ribbon is done across along this black line and along this red line. You see the black line will give bulk modes actually, will uh will uh give in evidence of bulk modes. Giving evidence of bulk modes and the red line evidence of modes that propagate along the edge. And here we see from this paper the corresponding clause for the fields. So we see two modes actually. One is in red is the edge mode that corresponds to this edge here. We see them in dark spots as dark spots. And the black here corresponds to the bulk mode. They have different wavelengths. Here we see actually the wavelengths given for different frequencies of Frequencies of the incident beam. And one remarkable aspect of that paper was that the ratio of the edge mode to the back mode wavelengths is about 0.8. This 0.8 has been understood in theory through a sequence of works starting with the work of Fetter in the 80s. Vetter made some oracle approximation, which Volkov and Mikhailov corrected later, a few years later, in a paper, and we addressed this problem a little more. And we addressed this problem a little more generally more recently, and I will try to review that work because it forms the base for the bilayer system. So, this is an outline of my talk. So, first of all, I would like to review aspects of theory of edge, yes. So, just a clarifying question. It's like a rectangle, right? Yes, yes, yes. So, I guess it's, I don't know, I guess I don't understand why one of them. I don't know, I guess I don't understand why one of them was an edge mode and the other one was a ball mode. First of all, they are different modes because they have different wavelengths, different dispersions, even. When you change the frequency, you see a different relation between the frequency, the wavelength, the wavelength, okay? But geometrically, they're also different because one propagates through the nano-ribbon away from the edges, and the other one is viewed only at the edge, and it's localized at the edge. If you just go a little away from the edge, it decays very fast. Edges decays very fast. Oh, I see. So the plasmon modes have like a more powerless tail or something? I cannot answer that question from this point of view paper because of the I don't have all the details of that experiment in mind. It's an experiment, I'm sure. It's not a simulation. Yeah, but both of the modes predominantly lie on the edge. No, one mode is in the bulk, away from the edge. What I call the bulk mode in the. This looks like you had a peek towards the edge. This looks like it had a peak towards the edges. This one here, okay? You see it goes to zero. This bulk mode doesn't have a peak near the edge. This is the bulk mode, okay? It has a peak away from the edge. And the other one, the red, is the edge mode. Okay. Okay? Yeah, it just looks like the peaks are at the same spot in X. Are nearly solid. Yeah. On the right. The red and the black. The red and the black curves are the same peaks. Okay, I think I need to proceed because this is a single layer system and that's not my focus. But so, my answer to you is that actually I'm not aware of all the details of this paper, of the experiment, okay, because you know it's a short, it's a letter actually. But what is remarkable is that they do have different dispersions when you actually try to see how the wavelengths behave individually. How the wavelengths behave individually as a function of frequency, but the ratio is close to 0.8. I mean, the ratio does not deviate much from 0.8. And this has been understood with theory, and I would like to say a few things about that. But then I want to move to the bilayer system. Because to my knowledge, at least, there is no experiment with the bilayer system for electromagnetic edge modes. So, for the bilayer system, what I would like to do is introduce a model for the electron. To do is introduce a model for the electrical conductivity, and this is what I called an effective parameter, right? So, I'm going to use the conductivity, electrical conductivity, as an effective parameter in, let's say, Maxwell theory. So, the conductivity will satisfy set asymmetry considerations, so symmetry conditions, but I'm not going to talk about how these matrix elements of conductivity are derived from, let's say, the quantum dynamics of electrons or other microscopic model. Or other microscopic model at the level of, let's say, Hamiltonian. I'm going to use the conductivity as a parameter under some assumptions which I will try to state later on. So I'm going to formulate the problem for X-plasmons in terms of what physicists call perhaps self-consistent field equation, what mathematicians call boundary integral equations in this context. And then I will try to convince the audience that this leads to. Try to convince the audience that this leads to the canonical Riemann-Hilbert problem for Fourier transforms. And that Riemann-Hilbert problem gives me a self-consistency condition that leads to the dispersion relation. And we'll see that there is a correspondence of this dispersion relation to the single A system, which is an interesting correspondence, meaning in some limit, this dispersion relation will reduce, will be reduced or collapse. I mean, I don't know exactly what word fits here, but will it be reduced to a dispersion relation for a magnetoplasma in a single? Pleasure relation for a magnetoplasm in a simulator. And I will discuss some open questions and some directions that we are currently exploring because this is work in progress with computers in relation to that problem. So I will assume that the time dependency is e to the minus i omega t everywhere, so omega is the frequency. Whenever you see omega, it's the frequency, okay? Time harmonic fields. So the main idea is to treat the problem as a scattering problem, okay? Scattering problem, okay? So, whether you have one layer like here or two layers, the idea is that when you have an incident electromagnetic field, it creates some surface current on the layer, because we're assuming that the layer is conducting. And the surface current by linear response theory is some parameter by the surface conductivity times the tangential component of the tangential electric field. Okay? Here I use a local form of the conductivity, assuming that the sound velocity in the material is actually large compared to the Fermi. Large compared to the Fermi velocity, so the conductivity is local, so it's a function of frequency only. I'm not going to consider non-local conductivity in terms of as a kernel in spec. And that flux creates a scattered field everywhere. And in principle, the scattered field is given as an operator, actually, which has a kernel, acting on the surface flux. This operator, as I said, is a kernel, which means that this As I said, it is a kernel, which means that this reaction of this operator is described by some integral acting on the surface flux. So, I will talk about this later. This problem can actually be simplified, for example, in the so-called non-retarded limit, if you don't use the full maximum, but you use electrostatic potential to describe Maxwell. In terms of the velocity of light, let's say in vacuum goes to infinity. So, the idea here for this canonical problem is to consider this as a half-plane. So, you let the length L tend to infinity. Length L tends to infinity, but you keep the edge. And that leads to the so-called Wiener-Hoff-type integral equation on a half-line. This was studied by M. G. Krine in 62, a version of that, actually, a simplified version. We'll see that this, for the case of the H-plasmon, the problem is quite different. The equation is not of the same form, but there is some basic theory. And actually, the system of Inner-Hoff integral equations that we get in multi-layer systems was started by Bochber. Layer systems were studied by Goffberg and Crime earlier than the previous paper, but they did not provide any formulas. I mean, they just studied existence theory. As I said, the scope, the goal, my goal in this talk is to get formulas, to get explicit dispersion relations that perhaps can be used for predictions. I will also say a few things at the end as an open question about an index that characterizes these solutions. Okay, so first of all, let me say, as I said before, that First of all, let me say, as I said before, that this problem can be simplified without actually sacrificing much of the essential physics by introducing the quasi-electrostatic linear. So basically, the reason for that is that there are two. There's a scale separation in the problem, inherent in the problem. If L0 is the free space wavelength, this L0, K0 is the wave number in vacuum, okay, at some frequency omega, this L0 is much larger than the typical wavelength of a motor. The typical wavelength of a mode, like a bulk mode. And because of this length-scale separation, if we keep the length of the mode, the wavelength of the mode, as fixed, we can think of expanding maximum sequence, their small parameter 1 over c. So c goes to infinity, we expand, and we know that the leading order term is what usually is called in physics quasi-electrostatic limit. Which means that in a quasi-electrostatic limit, after a formal expansion of natural situations, we end up with an electric field who's the gradient of... We end up with an electric field who's the gradient of a scalar potential to leading order in one over C. And this gradient, so I'm assuming that the dependence in the coordinate of the edge is e to the iq x2, so it's a traveling wave, where q is the wave number of the mode. So I'm introducing the wave number that way, right? So I'm assuming that I look at fields that are traveling waves on loose into the IQ X2, like plane waves, like in X2, which is the coordinate of the Which is the coordinate of the edge, and I can do that because there's translational invariance in X2. So X2 is the coordinate of the edge, X1 is the coordinate perpendicular to the edge. So there's translational invariance in X2. So then there is a boundary value problem associated with this scalar potential. Of course, it's a PD problem. If you are outside the seat, everywhere, you satisfy the Laplace equation for phi, for the scalar potential. Actually, it's not exactly. It's not the Laplace equation, it's the Helmuth equation because the x2, the derivative with respect to x2, has been replaced by parameter q. There is no derivative in x2 anymore, right? So it's really Helmutz equation now that we're dealing with, right? If with a Q as a parameter in the Helmutz equation. And there are boundary conditions. The potential, the scalar potential is continuous across the sheet. But because there is a surface charge in principle on the sheet, the normal derivative of the potential has to has to have a jump. Has to have a jump, a discontinuity. And that discontinuity is proportional to the surface charge density. And epsilon here, this epsilon is actually the dielectric permittivity of the abbion space, which is supposed to be a constant. Okay, I'm assuming it's a constant. And this, now, this surface charge, of course, satisfies the continuity or charge conservation at law on the sheet. So it's associated, it's related to a density, J sigma, which in principle is given through the In principle, it is given through the linear response theory through the conductivity methods. Okay, so this is a closed system because this E here, the tangential E, is also a gradient of the potential. So the boundary conditions for the scalar potential involve the scalar potential. So we close the system that way. And this system can be formulated as an integral equation by using the Green's function for the Helmholtz equation. Okay, so, but I didn't say anything about the edge. So, I But I didn't say anything about the edge. So at the edge, we have to impose a condition. The condition that we impose is that the normal component of the flux to the edge is zero. Okay? So the current, the normal current, the normal component of the current becomes zero at the edge from the sheet. Okay? Okay, so this leads to an integral equation for the scalar potential on the sheet. Okay, the scalar potential now, since we removed the x3 because we are at x3 equals 0, right? We are at x3 equals 0, right? This is the sheet, x3 equals 0, right? And x1 positive. And x2 is no longer called, I mean, we have removed x2 because we assume an exponential behavior. We get an integral equation for phi and x1, which is the coordinate perpendicular to the edge. And there is a bar term with a kernel. And there is a boundary term, which involves actually the value of the kernel, the kernel, and the value of the potential at zero at the edge. Okay? Now, this kernel here comes basically from. This kernel here comes basically from the Green's function of the Helmutz equation. Okay, so it's a singular kernel. It has a logarithmic singularity at x equals x prime, right? When the argument becomes zero. So the problem is to find q as a function of omega, or find omega as a function of q, right? So that this integral equation has non-trivial solutions. And I'm looking, because I'm looking at classical solutions, I'm assuming that the potential is continuous, okay? And it has integrable, it is integrable. Integrable and has integrable derivatives. Why integral derivatives? Because the derivative of the potential is the electric field. The electric field is given, is related to the flux, so you want it to be integral because that generates charges. Okay? Now, one can see that this problem from a different way. One can think about this as follows. This term here is singular at x1 equals 0. So this has a singularity if you allow x1 to go to 0. But this guy is not singular. So somehow you want the back term. So somehow you want the back term to conspire together with the boundary term so that for the right q as a function of omega, this singularity disappears. Okay, that's another way to look at the problem, of course, but we won't deal with that way because we are going to take Fourier transforms and then the problem becomes more elegant to deal with. Okay, so the idea here is, and this is now the sort of standard theory of Wiener Hoff integral equation, but of course it's not really Wierhoff in the standard textbook. Been a hoff in the standard textbook case because there is a differential operator in front of this integral. This is the x1 acting, so it's not really standard, but we can deal with the same methodology. The methodology says, okay, take the Fourier transfer of both sides. But, well, if you take the Fourier transfer of both sides, you have to deal with two versions of the potential, like two domains. One domain is x1 positive, which is the physical sheet, and the other one is the domain negative, where the potential is still non-zero. Where the potential is still non-zero, okay? And you have to treat them as separate functions: the potential outside the sheet and the potential on the sheet. And the corresponding Fourier transforms are called here phi hat. Hat means Fourier transform phi. Plus minus, because the corresponding Fourier transform of the theory of integral functions are analytic in the lower or upper half plane. If you define phi of x to be on the sheet and zero outside the seat, this corresponds to the function. The seed. This corresponding Fourier transform is actually analytic in the lower half plane, and so on and so forth. So that means that properties of the potential are reflected into analytic properties of the Fourier transform. Okay? So if you take Fourier transform of this equation, you end up with an equation for the Fourier transform phi hat plus minus. So you get one equation with two unknowns. But because of the analytic properties, you can find both, as we know very well. From the theory of Winner-Hoff integration. Know very well from the theory of Winner-Hoff integral equations or the theory of the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the real line. And at the end of the day, when we have a formula for the Fourier transforms, we can either invert it and then require that the potential is continuous at the edge and get a condition which gives us the dispersion relation or deal with the Fourier transforms directly. But the point is that at the end of the day, when we do this exercise and we end up with closed-form expression of the Fourier transform, we require that they satisfy some. We require that they satisfy something consistent with the spatial solutions. And that gives us the dispersion relation. I will get back to that later on for the bilayer system because at that time, in that context, we'll have to deal with a Wienerhof integral equation system, system of integral equations. But it's the same more or less idea, okay? That you have, you need a consistency position at the edge. Okay, so we get analytical expression. So, we get an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the H-plasmons. In principle, this dispersion relation describes so-called non-reciprocal H-plasmons. If we assume that the conductivity is a reasonably general, reasonably arbitrary matrix, okay? In principle, for general conductivity matrices, these plasmas are non-reciprocal, which means that there are these. Reciprocal, which means that their dispersion in the positive x2 versus negative x2 direction are different. Okay? We expect that. And it's complicated, but basically what I want to say is that we introduce this function q plus, q minus, analytic in the upper logical plane. They depend on the logarithm of this object here, p of z. But this p of z is the Fourier transform of the pseudo-differential operator behind the integral equation, because you can write down the integral equation that I showed you as an operator. Equation that I showed you as an operator acting on phi equal to zero. In principle, this operator is a pseudo-differential operator, okay? And the Fourier transform is given by this. And the information about the conductivity is encoded in that operator. Alright? And yes. Why pseudo? Well, that means that if somehow it looks like a polynomial when you take the Fourier transform and you start expanding in high powers, high, high. Powers, high, high Fourier variables, okay? And you look at it as an expansion in high zeta, let's say xi, xi is the zeta is the Fourier variable, okay? So for example, this P of zeta, you see, if you take the limit of zeta going to infinity, which is the Fourier variable, right, it behaves as a positive power of zeta. It doesn't go to zero. Your k-hat is not a positive. It's one over, huh? It's one over, huh? Your k hat is not a polynomial, right? That's what it is. Yeah, it's one over, actually. It's one over. Yeah. So in principle, we get that for arbitrary conductivity, it's arbitrary 2 by 2, right, for the single layer system. But this approach can be generalized. And the point is that it's not invariant, as I say, when Q goes to minus 2. invariant as I say when q goes to minus q the dispersion relation changes unless sigma 1 2 is equal to sigma 2 1 unless the two of diagonal matrix elements become equal and then the H plasmon dispersions in the positive and negative X directions become the same okay if you have a magnetic field for example and these two of the algorithm elements are opposite each other which is a case of breaking time reverse asymmetry for example right with a static out of plane magnetic field then of course immediately Magnetic field, then of course immediately you see that the Q minus Q have different dispersion. And this is the case that I would like to say something about next, the case where we have the so-called X-magnetoplasma. There is a static magnetic field perpendicular to the layer. And in this case, the conductivity, for example, a typical form of the conductivity is this. We see that the off-diagonal matrix elements are opposite to each other. Then, as we know from the work, for example, of Volkov and Kailoff in the eighties, Of Volkov and Kailoff in the 80s, what we have is different dispersions for, let's say, right from left-edge plasmons. If here I assume, of course, that left and right are defined with respect to the magnetic field. Let's assume that the magnetic field is the X3 direction, okay, positive X3. And then we see that if this is the bulk plasmon dispersion, this dotted, sorry, this dashed curve, the right-edge plasmon does not exhibit, does not exhibit Does not exhibit, does not display any cutoff, okay? Whereas, in contrast, the left H plasma has a cutoff frequency, okay, when the H plasma decays into the back at some frequency omega, which I call omega star here, at the corresponding wave number Q star. Okay? And in fact, if I take this case of this left-edge plasma, as I call it, which can decay into the bulk, I The bulk, I can rewrite somehow this functional relation between omega and q by using some what I call a universal function. But what I actually do is that I rescale, I consolidate omega and q with some parameters of the problem, and I can write this as a function eta universal, as I call it, of s. S basically is this variable here, depends on q and the magnetic field in the horizontal axis. Field in the horizontal axis, and eta, the vertical axis, replaces is one over s where omega s is replaced by omega. Okay? And then you get some nice function. Okay, I like this function because it shows up also in the case of the bilayer system. And my expectation is that the same function shows up also in the multi-layer system under some conditions, okay, under some assumptions, but this is for later. So this universal function actually, you see, has a cutoff in the sense that when you try to solve the dispersal. Sense that when you try to solve the dispersion relation, you see that you can solve it up to some s, from zero to s star. And then it doesn't give you real solutions anymore. In the absence, let's say, of dissipation, when the relaxation time goes to infinity and you expect to have a real solution, like really propagating modes, you don't get any. So that gives you the capital frequency. So mega star here corresponds to the star. Okay? Okay. I just want from all this discussion, what I would like to keep is that for the par Like to keep is that for the particular case of the single air system with a magnetoplasm, static magnetic field, right? One of the modes, let's say, depending on the direction of magnetic field, the one that has a cutoff, satisfies some dispersion relation that somehow is expressed by this, what I call a universal function eta of s. Okay? Okay, so one question that I would like to address in the next about 15 minutes, right? Because we started five minutes later, right? So Because we started five minutes later, I mean, so 15 minutes about, yeah, 15 minutes. Thank you, chair. Okay, is what are the extensions of this theory? Aspects of the extension of this theory to n layers, okay, and specifically n equal 2, yes? Okay, can I just ask a basic question about the previous slide? Yes. So the edge plasmon is a just solutions which decay into the bulk. Is that right? So the edge plasmon is localized at the edge, so some it decays in the sense, yes. So the bulk plasmon. Sense of the Dark Plasmon. This is. Is that dispersion coming from solving the same problem with an infinite plane? Yes, so to see, actually, that's a good question. To see the Bark plasmon is easy because what you do here, you have this integral equation, right? For the Bark plasmon, you can consider translation invariant sheets in all directions. Okay? So that means that this guy, let's say, it goes to minus infinity to infinity. There is no battery turn. And then you consider basically. Consider basically, okay? And then that equivalently, that means, Alex, that what you end up with is you get the bulk moves from zeros of P is P of Z. Because this integral equation becomes in the form P acting on phi equals zero, okay? But then in the Fourier transform domain, of course, you just need the zeros of P. This will give you the bulk modes. And then on the next slide, when you talk about delocalization, it's because the edge mode is at the energy and the bulk mode is the great thing. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. That's right. Okay, so here's the model that I would like to use. So in this case, of course, we have two fluxes, right? In the top and bottom sheet, in principle, there is an edge. I assume that the edges are parallel and they both lie to each other and they both lie in the x2, x3 plane. Okay? So there are two flags, of course. So there are two flags, of course, in layer 1 and layer 2, and the flux as a vector now, four vectors, right, are associated, are related to the corresponding tangential components or tangential electric fields at the two layers through a tensor conductivity, which is a 4x4 matrix, right? And we can be written as in terms of block matrices, 2 by 2, right? As a 2x2 form, where now the block matrices encode symmetries. And here, for example, look, this. And here, for example, look, this uh you see the sigma one one sigma two two block matrix have this uh matrix component matrix element sigma B. This can come from a static magnetic field, the sigma b. It breaks time reversal symmetry. The same for sigma b prime, which enters the off-diagonal matrix block matrix. Okay? But if you forget about sigma b, which might confuse you, what the important element here is, is what I call sigma 2. This sigma 2. This sigma two, if sigma p and sigma p prime are zero, this sigma two does not break the inreners and symmetry. And I call chirality parameter. And this chirality parameter has a very interesting implication, at least from this continuum viewpoint, right, because I'm using already this macroscopic theory, right? I'm looking at the fluxes now after we homogenize somehow the quantum dynamics of the electrons, or I have calculated the conductivity. And one way to see the role of this sigma two is to think about. Of this sigma 2 is to think about that symmetric current modes and that is symmetric current modes really yield electric dipole and magnetic dipole on the sheets. If you think of the fluxes going the same direction, this corresponds to the electric dipole, actually electric dipole distribution. Opposite direction means a magnetic dipole. And if you try to write an effective theory for that, and this electric dipole is proportional to the sum of the two currents in the two layers, but this magnetic dipole is proportional to the difference of the current. Is proportional to the difference of the currents in the two layers. And if you try to write an effective theory in terms of the corresponding electric field and magnetic field parallel to the layers, you end up with these equations. Totally from the point of view of Maxwell theory. And you see here what sigma 2 does is couples the two, right? In the sense that the electric dipole is no longer just proportional to the transition electric field, but there is a term proportional to the magnetic field, and that term, of course, is And that term, of course, is coupled to the electric diode because of the chirality parameter, sigma 2. This, if you see that a little further, this gives rise to the so-called bianisotropy properties of the bilayer system. Which for some people in optics, in photonics, are very important properties because, for example, if you shine light, plane waves, let's say circularly polarized plane waves, right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized waves scatter differently. That's a phenomenological, let's say, discussion on the role of sigma 2 at this point. I'm not going to talk about, let's say, how sigma 2 arises from the actual definition of conductivity as a trace, for example, right? Which I think is also an important aspect of this. Okay, so we are using the quasi-electrostatic approach now in order to find the edge modes. Now, in order to find the H modes, I'm assuming again that because of translation invariance in X2, the dependence in X2 is a traveling wavy to the IQ X2, right? And I introduce that way the Q, the wave number, okay, in the problem. So the derivative in X2 is replaced by a parameter. Any derivatives in X2 are replaced by a parameter. And I have two potentials now, right? Now, I have the potential in each layer, right? Which comes from the global potential, right? It's just the From a global potential, right? It's just there is one scalar potential, but then you restrict it at this layer and you call that potential of layer one or potential of layer two, but each potential now is a function of x1. Okay? And I formulate a set of integral equations for each of these potentials by just playing with the scale with the Green's function of the Helmut's equation, right? Because the same boundary problem that I showed you before for one layer applies, can be extended. Applies, can be extended to two layers, right? Where you write down separately in each layer the boundary conditions involving the surface charges of those layers. Okay? But they're coupled. They're coupled through the conductivity, of course. Okay? Because the conductivity that I showed you, let's say the chirality parameter couples the two layers, okay, the fields of the two layers. Okay, so you see here there are two kernels that show up in this equation. So J, the index J takes two values, one and two. Takes two values one and two for each layer. But you see that there is a coupling of layer one, let's say, with layer two, because you see there is also this j bar here. J bar is the complementary index, which means that if j is one, j bar is two, and vice versa. Okay, so there is coupling. And there are two kernels showing up in this integral equation, and they come from the Green's function of the Helmutz equation, but evaluate a different extreme, right? Because you are top layer or bottom, right? Okay, so by Okay, so, but it's a bit misleading that it's so horrible. It's not so horrible because you can reduce it to a simpler form by considering the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. So you can write linear combinations of the two potentials and end up with simpler equations. Okay? And that's what I'm going to do. But what is interesting is that sigma 2, sigma 2, the chirality parameter sigma 2, participates only at the boundary time. And that's one interesting implication that if you want to get bulk modes out of that, right, and then you replace this integral. Of that, right? And then you replace this integral from negative thing to infinity, which means that you consider perfectly translation invariant sheets and you get rid of the boundary terms. Sigma 2 does not show up in the partnership, in the quasi-linear subtle limit. But it shows up if you don't ignore retardation. If you take into account retardation, if you've solved the full Maxwell system sigma two solar. So it's a relativistic somehow effect if you view it at the bank. If you view it in one conclusion. But it doesn't show up in the question of sensitivity. But it does show up if you put the edge. And that's an important exercise in this, that the chirality shows up at the edge, in these equations. So if we use now the two modes, so what I do is add and subtract the scalar potential at the two layers, okay, and I define a new potential coming out of that. What I call symmetric or anti-symmetric in the sense that the. Symmetric or anti-symmetric in the sense now symmetry and dissymmetry, I'm using, I'm abusing the term because basically symmetry and dissymmetry means switch the two letters. Okay? One and two indices are switched. Okay? In that sense. And then you can get simpler equations with corresponding kernels that involve summation or subtraction of the two previous kernels that I showed. And the equation is simpler in the sense that it involves basically in the back term each potential. Each potential of a layer couples with the same potential with itself. I mean, there's no coupling between the two different potentials through the bulk term, only through the edges. And you see only through sigma 2. So sigma 2 couples a potential of a mode with the other potential, only 0. Okay? Anyway, so this equation, so the problem is to find to to find Q in this system. To find Q in this system so that it has continuous integrable solutions with integral derivatives in a similar space as for the single A. Okay? And this is the chirality coupling. And we can write down one canonical equation out of that, meaning we can ignore the fact that we have plus minus are superscripts, referring to symmetric and isometric, like this plus minus I'll get rid of later because it's confusing when I also use them as subscripts. But really, plus minus here are superscripts. But really, plus minus here, a superscript referred to symmetric or anti-symmetric fields. And I can forget about these superscripts and actually write a canonical field equation for any phi of those. And then the idea is the following. You have this canonical equation where the kernel can be one of these kernels and the C1, C2 are constant that comes from mapping actually what shows up in the boundary constant. Okay? And that will be a mechanical equation. And the DC2 hides, encodes information for the chirality. Formation for the chirality. And the problem is the following. And this sigma here is the sigma 0 plus minus sigma 1 of the two layers. For example, the total truth weight of the two layers shows up in sigma 0 plus sigma 1. The counter flow truth weight shows up in sigma 0 minus sigma 1. So there is connection to the microscopic physics if you think of drude weights, let's say, through the sigma 0 sigma 1 parameters. Okay, so the canonical field equation. Okay, so the canonical field equation can be written, we can take the Fourier transform, and then it can be written in this form. And we want the goal to determine a relation between Q and C1 and C2 and omega, of course, which enter as parameters in this equation, so that this equation has non-trivial admissible solutions, admissible means in the spatial solutions that I have defined. And you see what is interesting about that? You will get one relation between Q, C1, and C2. This relation is linear in C1, C2. And then you have. Linear in C1C2. And then you have to write this relation twice for symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. Then you get a system of two by two, a two by two system of equations for values of the potential at the edge through C1 and C2, and you will require that this system has non-trivial solution, linear algebra, and that will give you the dispersion relation. Okay? And the steps are similar to what I described before. You take Fourier, you find Fourier, you find, first of all, I describe here in more detail the Wiener-Hoff procedure or solving actually this Riemann-Hilbert problem on the real axis in the Fourier domain. And the idea is to take this, the logarithm of this p, and write as a sum of a function that's analytic in the upper half-plane, which I call q plus, and the function analytic in the lower half-plane, which means that if you exponentiate, what you actually do is write p of t here. You do is write p of t here as an exponential of q plus times an exponential of q minus. You factorize. This is so-called factorization in the Wiener-Hoff theory. And this you can do by applying Gaussian theorem, but there is a caveat there. There is a subtlety, which I'm going to refer to at the end of my talk. And then, in what you get, you separate plus for minus functions, analytic in the upper and normal plane, and finally you write down the whole equation in this form. The whole equation in this form, where plus and minus functions are completely separated. And then we realize that, well, since they are separated, analytic above or analytic below, and they're equal on the real axis, they have to come from an entire function. And both from the behavior in the space of solutions of interest, I can, of that entire function, I can figure out that this guy goes to zero, this entire function hasn't go to zero because this guy goes to infinity. So by Juville's theorem, it has to be zero identity. Okay. Okay. And this reveal theorem can be applied now to E plus, E minus, and this will give me the Fourier transform of the potential. And then for self-consistency, I require that this Fourier transform is basically consistent with the space of solutions. For example, the Fourier transform cannot go to zero slower than one over C when C goes to infinity. Okay, it's a nice requirement, and then gives you that gives you a consistency condition between Q and the parameters of the problem. And the parameters of the problem. Okay? And this is the consistency condition. And if I apply this consistency condition twice, one for symmetric and another for anti-symmetric mode, I end up with the dispersion relation. It's complicated, but what is interesting in this dispersion relation is that sigma 2 enters only in a place where you see obviously the coupling between the two modes. Because this QS, QA refer to anti-symmetric or symmetric kernels. Symmetric or symmetric kernels, you see. They come from these kernels. And when sigma 2 is equal to 0, you get an equation for one of the two. They separate, right? So you get pure and asymmetric or purely symmetric modes. Sigma do couples the two. Okay? And here I give you the definitions of all these sigma s and so on. You see, the symmetric s, what I call sigma s here, is dominated by sigma 0 plus sigma 1, which is the inflow, let's say, you can be written in terms. Which is the inflow, let's say, we can write in terms of the inflow root, and sigma anti-symmetric is dominated by sigma zero minus sigma one, which is the counter flow to the grade. Okay, so the question is in the next two minutes, I know I'm a bit, yeah, I'm about to be overcome now, but in the next two minutes I want to just solve this equation or show you some nice analytical solutions of this equation from asymptotics, okay? Which means that I take this equation and Which means that I take this equation and I do asymptotics by assuming something small. What is small? Okay, first of all, let's take the trivial limit, right? Sigma 2 equals 0, no chirality, which is actually not satisfying, but it's a good starting point, right, to see what is going on. And then what you do is you get two modes. What I call the symmetric mode, an optical H-plasmon. It's an optical H-plasm, optical because what you see is that the frequency scales the square root of the wave number. With the correction of the order of Qd. Now, here I assume that Qd, the separation distance between the layers, is small so that it's much smaller actually than the wavelength of the plasma. Which makes sense, because this D is of the order of 3 angstrom, 3.5 angstrom, right? And Q, and one over Q is of the order of nanometers, I mean. It can be 10 nanometers, 20, but it's much larger. Okay? And we see that the other anti-symmetric mode is. But the other anti-symmetric mode is an acoustic mode. Acoustic means that the omega scales linearly with Q, plus corrections of the order of Qd. Okay? So acoustic mode comes out of that in the limit of zero chirality. Omega equals to some velocity times Q. Now, sigma 2, of course, messes up things a bit, but you can still use two main parameters to describe two main dispersions. And I'm going to do that by assuming that. By assuming that, so I want to pay emphasis here to the fact to place emphasis to the fact that I will set the magnetic field equal to zero, so I have time translation, time reverse symmetry. I don't consider the effect of this sigma b, sigma b prime. So if I do that, I expect, actually, I expect that the, anyway, I will just show the results because I'm out of time. So if I look at the optical H-plasmon with Chai. With chirality now, sigma 2 different from zero. I'm not applying perturbation theory in sigma 2. What is nice about what I think in this result is the following. I'm not doing perturbation theory in sigma 2 because if I apply the condition q d small, that suffices for analytical solutions. And this is nice, okay? Which means that somehow I can have non-perturbative results in sigma 2 in what I showed. Okay? And one non-perturbative result will be. And one more particular result will be the appearance of these universal functions, which will show up here. And let's consider the so-called paramagnetic regime in which the counter flow, Drude way, is negative. Okay? Then, in this case, I get a formula like this for the optical LEDs plasmon, where this S of Q depends on the chirality through this parameter zeta and chi. Zeta somehow is a parameter that expresses the coupling between an. The coupling between an isometric and symmetric mode due to chirality, and chi is the relative chirality. You see, it's the ratio of sigma 2 divided by the inflow sigma 0 plus sigma 1. And in fact, this relation can be nicely put in the form of the universal function that I showed you earlier. But S of Q now is the universal function. This comes from the single-layer magnetoplasma. But now, S of Q, which was previously defined in terms of the static magnetic field, is now Magnetic field is now defined through the chirality. So somehow, chirality has replaced the static magnetic field in that dispersion relation. But of course, the other thing that we notice is that in the previous dispersion relation, the Q was appearing in the S in the denominator. Here it appears in the numerator. Which means that the cutoffs are going to appear differently. Okay? So if I plot this, here I remind you the S. Okay, so here I remind you the S for the case of the uh magnetoplasm. Compare the two. Okay? The left-hand side, eta, is the same. Okay? It defines the same way. The right-hand side has a different S, but the same universal function. So if we plot it, we start from the universal function, what we see is the following. For zero chirality, we have this dispersion relation, which is usual. Special relation, which is the usual square root of Q behavior. Okay? And then if you introduce chi-rality in terms of this parameter, what I call chi-bar, which is the product of the zeta times chi-square of the previous slide, and this is proportional to the third power, actually, of sigma 2. Okay? So we see here that if you introduce chirality and you increase the chirality, a cutoff shows up at some wave number, frequency as a function of the wave number. Function of the wave number. And this cutoff becomes smaller in Q as the chirality goes up. Actually, this Q star, the cutoff Q, scales as a negative power of chi bar, actually chi bar to negative one. Okay? It's inverse proportional to the chi bar. Okay, I will stop here. Actually, I will show you quickly the magnetic regime. One can show that the chirality implies a finite damping of the optical edge mode. This is the opposite limit for the counter flow at Rudway. I'm not going to show the results. I'm not going to show the result. Basically, what this means is that omega as a function of q gets an imaginary part and that causes decaying dumping, right? So, this is not good. Okay, it's finite dumping, which comes from the chirality, actually. Not from dissipation, because I have assumed that dissipation, the relaxation time is infinity. All these results are for relaxation dime going to infinity in the conductivity. Okay, and here's the end of my talk with a few open questions. So, as I said, there is a correspondence. As I said, there is a correspondence from the point of view of the dispersion relation of the bilayer H-plasmon, optical plasmon, to the magnetoplasmon in single layer. Thus, the chirality without breaking time-reversal symmetry has an effect similar to the out-of-playing magnetic field, which actually in the case of the single layer breaks time reversal symmetry. But it's interesting to study this correspondence more. For example, what I did not talk about here is that there is a so-called What I did not talk about here is that there is a so-called index, Krine index, that describes whether the integral equation that I showed you has a solution or not. And this index actually becomes zero for the theory that I showed you, for the existence of the plasma. And it's equal, in principle, it can take values plus minus one, plus minus two for the single layer problem. Now, it is interesting that this index is equal to the difference in the number of bulk plasmodes in the upper and as modes, as poles appearing in the upper. As modes, as poles appearing in the upper and lower capital. Okay? So that's well-defined theory for the single layer. We have not really studied the implication of that theory for biology. Let's say crime syntax, which is more generally an index of this operator P that I showed you before, right? Because that's the operator P that's involved in this definition of the inf. Now, I did not talk much about the acoustic plasma, what happens with the effect of chirality. What happens, actually, it's quite interesting, but I What happens, actually, it's quite interesting, but I've not spent time here, is that hydroity in terms of this zeta opens up a possibility for acoustic plasmas in the paramagnetic regime when the counter-flow truth weight is actually negative. Because you see, zeta is on the right-hand side. So, if zeta is greater than one, this becomes negative. Okay? And you see, if d0 minus d1 is also negative, then you can have real solutions. Okay? That's not true for the case of zero chirality. For zero chirality, it's important. For zero chirality, it's impossible to have real solutions for Q in the paramagnetic current. So, chirality opens this window if it's sufficiently strong. Anyway, there are some other questions that come out of that. For example, I did not say anything about the relation of chirality to twist angle. It would be interesting to relate this to specific values of twist angle because what I have seen, for example, in computations is that near the magic angle, the sigma 2 is quite pronounced. It's quite pronounced. Okay? So I would like to, for example, to get more information about how the sigma 2 is related to the magic angle in the case of the twisted bilateral. I will stop here and thank you very much. Given this time and there is a coffee break, maybe we can post a couple of questions in the coffee break. We'll come back and play that. I'd like to make this phrase.
