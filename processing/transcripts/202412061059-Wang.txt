Okay, my great pleasure to introduce the second talk of this program. Last talk of this program. Okay, please. Thanks for the introduction and thanks as an organizer for the invitation, especially Jeffrey Ta and Yi. And also I would like to thank Jeffrey for the one question. So actually I'm not very active at the moment in the At the moment, in the conformal stuff. So, his question should call me to study, or at least to lose, listen about this problem. So, okay, so I also very briefly because definition, but in this conference, there are already many different types very quickly. So, let's define them. We use this as a shorten tensor, and this one defines the sigma k scale coverage by the net symmetric function. And sigma y is just Yamabi. So for the Yamai equations, it's found in the conformal class and the the skeletal object comes. So the sigma k Yamabi so it's already so related to so called the guardian kung. So-called the guardian kung, so defined by the gamma k positive, and also many times appeared in this conference. So I will not give this like, I will not read the definition. So sigma case, so here is the one that two funders in the conformal class saw that the sigma case constant. So the con usually. So the con usually the condition is in the gamma kung, yeah, so positive cone. So as you already see, so this gave you the elliptic as the first talk. Also, the equation then elliptic in this cum, in a positive cum, and also concave. That's operator. So you have the good estimate, especially. So we have the sort of the interior estimate. As an interior estimate, as mentioned in the Monday. And also, so the sigma k Lamabi problem is until now, actually, so this is more than almost 10 or 15 years ago. So the two cases solved, maybe still have some remaining some cases solved, so I I'm not very f familiar later as a developer development special. Developmentally, especially the UK and the NEA has further working on this equation, especially for the green function. For this object, other regards. For the existence, so to me, in principle, it's a two-case. So one is the validation case, actually. So this equation is the validation problem. So Yamadu problem is a validation problem. That's the integral of scalar code. And we are close scale. And Yakrovsky proved that also k equal to 2 is also a validation problem. And the general case, the alternation local component. And there's almost the necessary combination later, the gover and proof. If the violation of the problem is almost, should the wire tensor vanish or the television a wire tensor vanish something close. Something close. The other case is the case that is the so I will focus on the relation case because I'm interested improved the inequality. So this somehow should use the flow method as the first talk. So flow method has an advantage. So if the one is defined flow, one is one total scalar curvature is fixed, another is decrease or increase, and if you And if you approve the convergence to sphere, then give the optima also parametric type of unique qualities. So I will especially actually will focus on the k-equal tool case. As I said, so this is solved by using we proved the k-equal tool case, but ancient. K equal to case, but any shoulder large is at eight, and should one reprove the for general case for k equal to two and also the validation. So okay, so at this time we also consider the causing equation, as I will mention, so this has benefit, advantage to prove the shawmatial inequalities. The quotient problem is that if we have sigma k over sigma k. If we use sigma k over sigma k l, so k is larger than l. So there's causing problems. So we consider the flow of young architecture or maybe use the log as a suitable definition. So especially what, and also we are colour of signal with him, so we consider this. This Sovolov type inequality. There are other types of inequality. So I mentioned the Sovolov, the model shooting and the query mass inequality. This depends on the validation structure of this. If I use if k is equal to k, so this one, and assume this is validation. This means the k equal to all the local conformal flat. Then the validation. Then the evaluation formula is the so this depends on two case of here This is this one or let's still have this validation so that this this constant has a has a whole play in the inequality so if the n large value Large than 2k, then so it has a positive sign, n equal to 2k 0, and n less than 2k is negative. So related to the three type inequality. So I will focus on the sublife type. Inequality just means that I come, you know, it's less than or absolutely that's the case. So if you consider the quotient. So, if you consider quotient like the Yamabi problem, so instead of the volume, so we also divide it by this term. So, this is the same idea. And you can define the flow to preserve this term, total integral of sigma l, then decreasing the sigma term. Then, if you in the case, for example, if the on the sphere or the on the local conform flat, you can prove the convergence to the sphere or to the curvature. Or to the curvature with constant sectional curvature, then you can compute the constant, the basic constant. So that's what our idea. So we get somebody, as I mentioned, also in the provided talk. So in sphere, one can prove that it gets inquiry. So actually, it's generalized. So now how many k because there's no conformable flat k. There's no conformal for that case, so we don't have proof for it. Any case here has an optimal inequality. So if L equal to 2, then the sigma case, the subolif, if k equal to 1, L equal to 0, or if L equal to 0, that's the sigma k. So belief inequality I also will use later. And if L equal to 0, K equal to what is gamma. Equal to zero k equal to what is Yama or just a sublife inequalities ordinary sublife inequality in on the scale. So as I mentioned, so we got local conformal flat, so you have the gradient estimate. So by the method of dimension, also you can get more method you can correct. Naturally, you can prove the Gorenger estimator, then you can prove C2 estimates, so convergence to the limit, then limited the classified in general case by Nan Yan and Dao. So this is only the sphere. So at least on the sphere, one can prove the optimal inequality that this will prove. Okay, so here also we, as I mentioned, say there's a subjective type of inequality in sigma kong. So k is the sigma k comb. So k is the biggest here compared the two total scatter curve. Yeah, so this one. This one. So this because as I mentioned in my discussion, because in sigma k in this cong is elliptical, so as the sigma k equation, the same the quotient equation also the elliptical in sigma k cong. But they are very surprising, so at least at Surprising, so that at least at that time, so the observation by Penvi Guizo. So actually, the Cauchy equation somehow is better than the sigma k. So this is elliptic or the degenerate elliptic in the sigma k minus one country. So that's actually better. So it's somehow it's close to the gamma. So if you see this way, so if the C this way, so if the gamma is sigma 1, so if you divide by C 0, C 0 we usually define just constant 1. So if you see the sequence, if you have Mabis this way, then the Kum is in this cone. Sigma 0 comb. Sigma 0 Kum is trivial, so you have not in the condition. So if you consider sigma k over sigma k minus 1, so your condition is this. So your condition is this in that so in the C, the gamma k minus one, so still a little bit, so it's not really elliptical, but the generating. So it's very easy to particularly, then it's elliptical. And more important also, it's concave, the same. So you have the estimate. Yeah, so the third order derivative you can choose. All the dialogue that you can draw out. That's all the problem. Okay, so that's the observation. So this actually, so he told us actually this as a joint work, but at the end, he's not in this paper here. And he suggests to add it as an author also. So this is unsurring because. This is Tanzurian because he thought us this is the joint observed with the time souling. So this why so we have Yuxinke and the Tang Shu Ling. So we have the we use this observation to at the same time to prove the so-called 3D as a spherical theorem. So if we use scalar curvature postu and the sigma k integral And the sigma k integral is positive. So user this quotient equation and the observation of config one, you can prove that it is a scalar curve, as a metric, this sigma 2 is a point-wise positive. So the condition is on, I forget the condition on the scalar curvature. So the condition on the integral of the proof is positive, then you can prove the Is positive, then you can prove that the sigma 2 is a point-wise positive. Then this implies the niche curvature is positive. That in three dimensions only the diffeomorphism to the sphere in the niche flow. So that's where we use the quotient equation proof. So if I model the technical part, so there are still technical parts. So there are still technical parts, then the idea is very, very easy. So we consider that this approaching equation was the minus lambda, lambda is positive. Then every case, this equation is elliptical. Because the sigma 2 over sigma 1 could be degenerated, but today it was minus E divided by sigma 1. That's equal to any large. So, for any lambda, this is elliptic equation. And if lambda is very large, I have choice lambda large, then somehow you can believe this as C lambda is negative. So, it's a simple C lambda negative in the Mabu equation, that's a very easy case. So, you have and as a maximum principle, you have estimate. So, in here, do you do you not need an exponential in front of the lambda? In front of the lambda. That's a little bit checking, as I said, that we should predict. But if without it perduable, we need not expect potential. Yeah, right. So this is a conformal equation, and the difficulty is still there. If the spectral C lambda is positive, you have a difficulty that's conformable. It's not compact. But it should be particular. But a a modular that's one, so so we we we reconstruct particular equity, right. The actual particular equation, right? But we can modulate this technical equation. So you is elliptical, especially lambda because C, lambda is negative. So you have estimate. So you have estimate. Let lambda increase. So let lambda increase and C lambda is is l upsolved. Lambda is decrease. Lambda derives C lambda is increased. You get that C lambda is increased. So we can see that if the lambda tends to zero, which one is the C lambda is zero or not? So we only have two cases either case. So if the C lambda is reached zero, first there is a lambda reach zero. Then what means of this side is zero, that sigma two is equal to lambda. Lambda is positive. Lambda, lambda is posting, then we found the metric is posting. So if lambda first reach to zero, so here that's still negative, then you integrate this one. So integral condition gives you the lambda should be positive. That's like contradiction. So the conceptual is very easy. Proof. So as I said, the modulus we should. Say the modulator, we should particularly complete this. We only need to consider the sub-colonial equation, not the critical. So, here. So, still one important thing is that we need to use the flow because we need to, the contradiction is to maybe another metric. So, we need to use the flow keeping this condition. So, in three dimensions, So in three dimensions, either the flow is decreasing or increasing the sigma 2. I write here sigma. So the two dimensions, the sign, the extra sigma 2 is a integral of sigma 2 is increased. So always, when started is positive, then it's always positive. So automatically true. Then we get the reproducible existence. A scalar curve. As a scalar curved possibility. For the high dimensions, also high dimensions, the same structure is worked, but this condition is certainly not. So sigma 2 is only one metric positive. That's not enough. We should consider the infimum of sigma 2 is cost. So Yama be constant is cost. Then it's automatically get the controller key to that one. Yeah, so the idea is I say comp. Yeah, so the idea is the same, completely same. Okay, so very close to the idea of the eddy strength with this conformal four-dimensional sphere. Actually, the same idea can be a short okay, so we consider now then for the so here is actually as a So here is actually as an application or at this time the aim as applicant, but the only solid dimension and only consider negative case actually easy case. So then one can also consider the positive case, then ask the coaching equation whether the existence. Okay, so between so as I as I say, so actually we are somehow we have two Somehow, we have two problems. So, the Yamabi problem. One is that, so consider sigma two, and the quotient is the same divided by over sigma one, the suitable power. Then you can consider that, take the infimum in sigma two, so to the two comb for the one comb. Yeah, so so, so, so this is for this one. So, the in the One. So in the previous results, I also was gay and also was gay. So we can prove that actually both comes achieved. Yamabi constant the same. It's actually the same. And also the achieved solution. The first one, for the first one, you achieved the solution by one solution is two kung. Although the first one comes to the infimon. First, one you consider infimum over one cone, but then you can prove the existence solution is a two cone. We have this in the Yamabi constant is the same if you're taking over two kum or the over one kum. So this is this step what Hobed mentioned this. Mention this also. So, with the Penfield, the previous one, we needed to consider the two comb. So, here, with less results, you actually get the same inequality, but in the one comb, because the constant actually is same. So, this joint here is not directly this sobular inequality considered in his talk. But so, this compares sigma 2 with sigma 1. So let's compare sigma 2 or sigma 1, but sigma 1 you can compare to the volume. So he studied sigma 2 compared to the volume. But also as his talk, if consider the stability, then between two intermediate to inequality actually also very inequality also very close. In his first step, certainly. So that's what. Now, Jeffrey asked us whether that's also true if we consider the sigma k Yamabi problem, sigma 2 Yamabi problem, but in one cum. So here is the quotient equation is in one kung. Sigma two over sigma one considered. 1 considered in the one cone. So he asked us whether that's true if you consider sigma 2, but in 0 cone or somehow 0 cone. But still what's one condition that you have the skeletality post. So one can also define the two as a Yama B count. uh the uh a Yamabi constant. So the the for the bias this uh your usual Yamabi constant for the sigma two problem problem. So without the bias so it's not one defined over the C1 con. So the coaching over I write in this way so sigma one is just one right so just volume the then if the so so somehow the the a little bit A little bit different. So, you ask us whether this also achieved. So, we can prove that that's also true. So, certainly the scalar curve in the one cum. So, here, assume that gamma becomes costly. Then, actually, sigma 2 is there exists a metric in the 2 cone. And also, not only that. And also, not only the infinite was achieved by one of the magical was sigma two pulse. Certainly, maybe could have another solution with just the scalar curvature. Is there a restriction to dimension? Oh, yeah. If dimension large is that or equal to five things, yeah, so that another yeah, four four four four four uh four dimensions. For four dimensions should consider should be also true, but you might not be true. And the three dimension I will consider, so I will, this is different, I will at the end talk about it. Three dimensions different. Okay, so actually, one can, so for the standard, I saw here, standard sigma k, sigma two, yamavi, probably you can. A sigma 2 Yamabi problem you can consider in the one con. That's just that. That's why. And this condition is actually necessary if we want to find the solution. So if you have a solution, then it's positive. So somehow. So I just very believe recorded the method and also for the Cauchy equation, very similar without any technical detail. And also, as you still should consider the perturbation equation, not the this critical one. The critical one is difficult. But for our aim perturbation equation is enough. Only the perturbation is a little bit quite complicated because we need to keep any variation structure and the monotonicity. So it's not a little bit complicated. So the idea is just sigma 2 minus a constant, a space constant, divided by sigma 1. As I mentioned, if lambda, L is positive, then it's illuminable. So that's parabolic. So S is just the normalized constant, space constant. So it's important. So here is R is not, is a sigma one module R. Sigma one module divided by volume. So that's all here. For the quotient equation, so we have the actual council by the sigma one. So now we just sigma zero. That means the volume. And S is just keeping the flow such as the flow is preserved the volume. So you define S is just the flow preserves the volume. So then So then if you so if you have a solution, so actually you what you can prove s is always zero. It's very easy to see. So if you have the station the solution and you multiply the sigma one, so take the sigma one, the other side, then you integrate this equation. Then the left-hand side is zero. This means s g must be zero. That actually you get this. Actually, you get this. So you have a L is a positive. So because so L is this point. So and as I said, the positivity, so here is keeping keeping, oh no, sorry. So this condition keeping the sigma 2 integral is positive, always positive. Then we found this solution. So the flow is the preserves of volume and equity. And as I mentioned, it actually should consider the perturbation. So somehow it's very similar to the sigma, the Cauchy equation, the previous results. So which even in some estimates somehow it's simpler. So here, so I just mentioned. So another thing I want, also any further question? Further question, I will change it a little bit. Not really, yeah, so I change it to the cure cover chart, but I actually stay in the city market. Okay, any question? Okay, so we have the because as I mentioned, the C is the superfood in quality in the space is this way. You can also like. Way you can also write down on this as this field. That is just the gamma d on this inequality. So you have the high-order sober inequality. So this is also optimal. So you have the constant, it's the optimal constant. So that is it. So here are the notating just optimal inequality. So if the S is, so S even can be the So, S even can be the flexion gamma or Laplacian. If we k S equal to K is an integer, so you have the high order so that so what my question is want to compute, so as the previous talk, we want to compute this term with another error. So, so this here is a K related another equal. Related to another is, for example, the Laplace minus Laplace L divided by 2. But that's my, in principle, initial position. So this cannot compute directly, so we can see here in this way. So the high order, as I mentioned, so here the sovereign inequality. So you can write down in this sphere. So because the actual conformal invariant. Conformal invariant. So in the sphere, so this is AOK, the operators should be panicking, the simplest one. So you can write in this way. So now the K is a so you can the left hand side you can write as a pure code. So integral of total integral of pure code. Of Q curvature. So this inequality gave you also you can compute the integral of Q curvature to the volume. So somehow the iso parametric inequality. So my question now becomes whether you can consider total K curvature with the L cure curvature. Yeah, that's what my question wanted to come to. So I but I just So I but I just stay as a conveyance. I can I try it, but there are many objects. So if you write down in this way, because now we have the two pure curvature, and usually for the pure curvature, so your hands are if you want to have a good form, so that you have the normalizing or you have the to express the To express that as a curve as a metric in this way or another way. So now we have two components. So it's not so easy to find this one. So if I use for the larger one, use G light written as a U over this power, 4 over N minus 2K. Then the pure curvature, so this is the K curvature, then this is P. Like hair, air current. So it looks like a little bit complicated. You have air, this operator is on the not just on your power of you. So that's one. So you can check this is the solution, yes. That's fair solution. So if you write it in Q curvature, just the Q curvature, it's a I modulo some constant already. So this is the best. This is the best concept. But we can prove the so if the so if the L is zero, just the high order so believe that mention. So if L is zero, the left hand side is the volume. So just the high order. So what I can do is L equal to one, K equal to two. That's true. But still a little bit of confusion, but so if the skeleton will be positive. Positive. So if the scalar curvature positive was a dimension larger than 5, if the scalar curvature positive, this means L2 for this power is positive. And maybe non-negative is enough, but I still have positive. Then you have the inequality. So you can compare the Q2 integral total with the Q1 if I like it. The Q1, if I write it Q1, Yamaba is K1. That's the opinion from the proof actually very easy. So that's why it's easy, but for general case, I don't know. So could be this inequality is implied in the sigma k in the solar inequality. Important. But because the curves are really complicated, one k bigger than the expression. So the proof is just as I mentioned, just the previous results. So because you have the Q curvature is in this way, you already see many times. But if write in sigma 1, sigma 2, then you have this form. So if you integrate, then the Laplace terms certainly certainly not that you have sigma 2 and sigma 1 over 2. The important two constant is positive. So you have the best inequality for this one optimum. You have certainly this not, but you you just use hold, then can reduce to the to the Yamabi as a the the the best for the sublux. Then you give the proof. Then you give the proof. So the proof is implied by our previous one. So it's just an observation somehow. So you can also ask whether this constant is the stability of both. So I really believe that's true because in Frank's talk, everything may be already in this. Okay. Okay, so this certainly we use this to consider the Cauchy equation now, now the sigma, or we peel over scatter coverage. Why call this PL2 over KL1? Whether in a conformable class, you can form everywhere. Scatter coverage, you choose a positive, whether one can consider this example. uh is uh exist uh so so we we can we at least have has just for buttons results so this this this means that if on either manifold or on sphere actually we interest in the sphere then they are only this kind of constant the standard solution yeah so this is the operator type of results so we just link as a valid Just link as a valid new results as a proof, also. So, this Obada's proof for this Yamabi problem and require Quak and Jeffrey and especially the June 10 we do also prove the proof. So, you have alpha one, alpha two, you have a range. So, not for everyone, but we have a rent. At least this includes the two. At least this includes the pure curvature. The pure curvature in the C can be writing in this workground. So you assume that the background metric is Einstein. Yeah, background metric. I understand if you have another metric such that it is scalar code to positive, scalar code constant, then there's also Einstein. Let's talk about that. Then pure curve, which is Einstein metrics, is unique and it can form plus. Okay, just certainly the conformal class here. G is the the comp G zero is the i stand, then g is the is a conformal in the conformal class, same conformal class. I thought I signed matrix meaning with the reason for the further model. Okay, sorry, I got this right. So we use their results, especially the Jensen's proof, a little bit easier to compute to see. Then we use proof accounts that actually support. The same computation, just what is the divergence of the patient of R divided by here, multiplying this one. So in their proof, even this classification, you can also, here alpha is like somehow you can also. You can also approve this only the classification. So, okay, so this is the classification results for the but as I recorded to here. So for this result, we already know extreme. Because so we use two inequality optimal inequality. So every inequality is an equality that already stands up. That already is the standard man. So, this results certainly tell you if on the sphere you have a critical point, then it's only the standard one. So, we use this one wanted to consider as I mentioned. So, we this quotient and kill curve quotient problem. So, we consider kill curve over k2. What is the solution? So, if this So if L equals the same, if L equals 1, just the pure curvature and MARLI problem. So there are many, many results I cannot mention. So I'm not actually expert in the direction. We just learning the method, especially learning the Guski and the cohesion method, the maximum principle, and also normal copy flow. So what do we do? Work of the flow. So, what do we can? So, we that's one so that's still in progress. I hope we can finish not many difficulties. What I claim is the method Busky on the Macaulay's work for this flow. So, I want to claim it this way, but at some point I should still need a detail. So, the equation, so the natural equation is. Equation: So, the natural equation is as I said, so the PL2 over KL1 may be all the KL2 divided by the minus L1. It's different to the sigma 2. So, here it may be better because the TL2 is the fourth order, TL1 is just the second order perturbation. So, ellipticity is automatic. But we think also that if we But we think also that if we consider the Girlski and Markodis type Manglogos, then it's better. So what it means, so actually the left-hand side, you put the inverse panels of that. So we certainly need a condition. So they have the maximum principle if scalar curvature positive and the pure curvature support the semi-positive. Of the semi-positive, which means non-negative and somewhere positive. Then the operator is a positive operator, has an inverse operator, the P. The panel operator has an inverse operator. So they can very close to the induce the similar flow. And this flow is a few KO one, uh KO two in total KO two and then and the increase KO one. So And increase clear one. So it's a very nice flow. So, and needed to prove that certainly. So I will not go into details. So we will try to. So that's almost what I want to talk. Maybe some questions. So certainly in the problem, especially for the Especially for the sober lifestyle, so the scale culture maybe. So, for land protein, this is one last one. So, here, so you want to scale the culture positive. So, it's nature to ask whether this is not the message. Yeah, so in the method, we needed this one. So, for the sigma two, so believe also we need the skeletal to cost. So, method we use the skeletal cost. But for the maybe the For the maybe their analysis. And I actually try also. We try to use the compact as a compact concentration as well. So let's tell me, I'll forget it. Good. So, and the so idea so is you from the the extreme, then you classify the ex extreme. Hopefully the extreme only the s standard solution that you get. Standard solution that you take, especially in on the state. I asked that question already, still, I don't know. But certainly for the this new, I suppose it's true for China, we only really special case, and this proof is very anyone can ask. Anyone can ask also the compa comparements as Jensen's talk. So, what is the solution? I believe also very close. And what I the last one I want to talk about is still, I believe they still open because the Alice asked actually after talk after who bet it for the two solid banking case. So, solid banking case. Banking case. So, 3D banking case, because this effect, so you actually have the sigma 2 is bounded by volume. So, it's negative. So, look like this way. Sigma 2 is integral of, sigma 2 has an optimal constant and the volume is one-third power. Yeah, still, maybe scale curvature should be cost. So, I check the previews, so the previous so that the Pao Yang and the Majin Zhu, they proved the cure curvature. So cure curvature is similar for the cure curvature. They optimize the optimal one. Yeah, I guess the earliest actual mention is this one. I guess because the later the the the from from bow hung and the and for young there are many results. There are many results on this direction, but always stay in the Q culture, not in sigma 2, actually. If you see the sigma 2 in three dimension, or the inner dimension, actually, it actually easy to see that for such the sigma 2 in equality is stronger than q code. As I actually mentioned, our our results sigma for the five dimension or the larger than five dimension in in this way. For solid dimension also, Way for solid dimension also the same way. So now solid dimension that's negative. And we prove in equality also another direction is smaller than this. So if this is smaller, then this negative, this is smaller, then like Q curvature is smaller than some set. Here I make a big mistake. It's smaller than this. Sorry. This is smaller than. This cannot imply this. So another way. Yeah, so another way as a long direction. So what are we feared the inequality is a different direction? No, no, yeah, yeah. Smaller than smaller than sorry. The same direction. Same direction. Okay, okay, got it. What I mean, because this is negative, this incoded implies. That this incode implies this one. Sigma two implies that this one. So this is proof that this is still open, as my opinion, it is still open. For us, our technique is almost there, but the field one way, we did not know the rough. If we can prove that there is a constant that's hold, then we can prove this is the best constant. So we did not rough. We did not rough inequality. This is the difficulty in our proof. If there are the rough bound, then we can prove that optima is unsecured. Yeah. That constant should be n minus 4 over 2 in front of the signal. Oh, sorry. That's 4, yeah. Yeah, right. So since. Yeah, yeah, right. So since n minus four, yeah, yes, so it's negative. This is correct, it's negative. And for n bigger than two is positive, that's why have our inequality. That always means in the dimension that sigma k sigma two inequality is stronger, a little bit stronger than Kirkov. Okay, I stop here. Thank you. Are there any questions? Have you looked at the formula for Q6, the one that maybe like 200? I believe 6 still have hope, but then so you should think any combination you you can such kind cause or sigma 2, sigma 1, such kind. Two, sigma, one such column. The important, if we use this proof, is the important coefficient center is all coefficient positive. I compare a little bit, it's somewhat positive, I'm not really sure because I always made a mistake to computation. Right. I try a little bit. Yeah, right. Could be positive. Even a search kind of combination, so you maybe have, I don't know, maybe having such kind of evidence, if it's a positive. If it's positive, you have the inequality, right? Right. For the solvent, for the next type, to prove the solvent equals inequality in the analysis, you use the symmetrization. Oh, yeah. Right. It's too much. It's too much. Also relative very strand. Even even the correct occasion of that. That very strange. Well it's genuine. So I also try also here. So this equation, if the equation is a tricky, so if I just two. Minus two U is a Yossan power. So here it's minus U n minus four or so two m minus two minus one. Yeah, that's why if you assume this is V so you then Yeah. So you then this changer is so so you have this one. It's very good. So in anything uh a minus four minus two minus one view. Then here is so the half of the system is also the somehow is also positive. Now v is negative. So if you want to check right then v, v is minus minus one equal to v. One equal to three. They are not such kind. So there are many results. Is here positive, here also positive, or here negative, also negative. So then they are maximum principle. But for the for the integral system, yeah? So they are classification, at least one state of the classification. So now this equation is for the activistic in this way that they are updates at one positive, another is the actual. Another thing that I cannot do that I think not very deep on me, but at least for me that's different. Another question different difficult as I mentioned, the infimum, you can use the compact concentration. Then the second term is problem. Is this lemma something like no, I don't know, and it could also have. And it could also happen in your core, you'll note and then analysis could I believe true So a couple slides on you have this analog of the Gersky Del Quiote flow for this ratio of Q to R. Do you get long-time existence of the flow? Yeah, this is what I taught you in the email. So we certainly also can't only take the sequence. Just the existence, yeah. So we didn't know. Very interesting. But at the least, so this flow one can also consider whether this is global convergence. Like this what I mentioned before. Right, that's what I mentioned. Right, so it's still possible that you could have several different sequences that conversions technically take this. Could be, yeah, but I don't know. I believe not. Just a point. So you used the flow method for like Q4 and sigma one. Do you think similar flow method can be generalized to like QK over QL? K over QL assuming right condition. For me, it's important that it's what the maximum principle holds. Yeah, but it uh that's assuming it's the maximum principle to generalize. Right, right, right. The maximum point is very important. Other, for example, also Yamabi constant is less than another Yamabi constant, it should be very similar. And certainly, maximum point then should be there. Certainly the maximum potential should be the also positive mask, or the positive mask. Let's thank the speaker again. There are opportunities thank the organizers. And we had this really very nice, wonderful meeting and we enjoyed it very much. So thank you very much.
