Well, thanks everybody for being here and inviting me to give this talk. I want to talk about a problem I've been working on for the past two or three years and sort of making incremental progress, but finally I have something I think is worth reporting on. And some of this material I've talked about in the past. So the first part of the talk. Uh, so the first part of the talk, if you've seen a talk from me in the past couple of years on this topic, will be review and then we'll go in a different direction in the end. Okay, so the talk is going to be about Hausdorff dimension and its generalization to gauge dimension. So let me put up the definition of Hausdorff dimension. So, Hausdorff dimension is supposed to measure sort of the extent of a set. The extent of a set. And the way that that dimension is being evaluated is sorry. Okay. The way that the way that is somebody trying to ask a question? No? Okay. So the way that dimension is characterized in terms of measure, and one defines the collection. And one defines the collection of outer measures. Here they are. So the S-dimensional outer measure is given as the limit as goes to zero of the in FEMA of the sizes of basic open sets in an open cover of the set A. So there's two aspects of it. First, what's Two aspects of it. First, what's the size of a basic open set? Well, in this context, you look at the diameter of a ball, right? And you take the diameter and raise it to a dollar. So we're measuring the size of a basic open set. Like if it's in the line, the size of an interval is the length of its interval raised to an power. So then you look at these covers where you shrink the scale. You have to take the limit as the The scale. You have to take the limit as the diameters of these balls go to zero. House drop dimension is defined to be sort of the threshold point where the set goes from looking like it's null. So it can be the inf of the s for which the set seems to have no measure. Or, and that's the same. This is a calculation one has to do. It's the same as the supremum of the size. Of the sizes where the set looks like it has infinite size. Of course, you can throw zero in too if it's null everywhere. Okay, so the Hausdorff dimension is measuring the size of the set according to the family of functions that are given by the powers. So the numerical housework dimension of a set is really telling you a cut, a cut in the In the behaviors of how these sums work. Okay, so a couple of examples. The Cantor middle third set has dimension log two over log three. A line segment, even if you're not just viewing it inside the reals, but view it inside any Cartesian product of the reals, a line segment has dimension one. Okay, so it has positive. It has positive measure when you take s equal to one. And the measure of a line segment is just its length. If you have a Brownian motion in three dimensions, then the path has Hausdorff dimension two. And if you, and then more familiar to some of us, the set of reels with effective Hausdorff dimension S has Hausdorff dimension S. Yes. Those are some examples. And you can see sort of natural sets are given some kind of non-integer dimension. It's not critical at any point here that we were confining ourselves to these functions, that the size of the interval is being measured by some power of the length of an interval. You can use any gauge, you can use any function, provided that the function is continuous, it's increasing, smaller, increasing as the argument gets larger. So smaller basic open basic open sets with smaller diameter are given less mass. And the limit as t goes to zero from the positive of f of t is zero. So as you shrink, as you shrink the size of a basic open set down. The size of a basic open set down to zero, the mass that's accorded to it is also shrinking down to zero. So that's a gauge function. Continuous, increasing. The limit as you go to zero from the positive is zero. And the fact that the powers are all gauge functions. Okay, now with a gauge function, just like we did it with the functions t goes to t to the s, we can associate an outer measure. So that measure I'm denoting. Measure. So that measure I'm denoting by HF. So the Hausdorff measure associated with the gauge function f is HF. Now, these measures are sort of a generalization of the Hausdorff measures. So they tell us just like if a set has Positive two-dimensional measure. That means it has area. The way that you tell whether a set has area is you look to see it as a subset, say, consider it as a subset of the plane. What's the integral of the characteristic function? So, what's the measure of membership in the set? If the big measure in the plane gives it a positive measure, then the thing. In the plane gives it positive measure, then the thing has area. If a big measure in the line gives a set positive measure, then it has some kind of in some sense it has length. So it's these different gauge functions are telling you a very finely graded distinction, which is similar to the distinction between area, length, and so forth. Okay, so we write g is greater than h. We'll say g is higher or g. As higher, or oh, this should be an F. So G is greater than F indicates that G indicates a higher dimension. So G is going to zero faster than F is, just like T squared goes to zero faster than T. Okay, so G is higher order than F. Being positive, having positive. Being positive, having positive measure in the sense of G indicates a sort of higher dimension than having positive measure in the sense of F. And if G has higher order than F and F has finite, and A has finite measure in the sense of F, then A is null in the sense of G. Okay, so every set determines a family of gauge functions for which it has positive outer measure. For which it has positive outer measure. So you can sort of think of that if you're restricting yourself as we did with Hausdorff, with the Hausdorff functions, then we're getting a cut inside a linear order. But in general, you just have a family of functions for which the set has a positive measure. Okay, so these gauge functions let you make distinctions that Hausdorff dimension is a little too coarse to make. To make. So, this is a nice example. So, almost surely, the path of a Brownian motion in R3, which has half-store dimension two, right, has finite measure for the gauge function t squared log log one over t. Okay, so its actual dimension, the actual dimension, or you could say the sharp dimension or the strong dimension, some people call it the exact dimension. Exact dimension of this Brownian motion is not, it's, it's not the same as the dimension of the plane. It's a little smaller. All right, so you can make distinctions with this notion that are just not count, the Hausdorff dimension isn't calibrated at final. All right, so now I'm going to have to come back to this capacitability in a few minutes, but you can see that our See that these aspects, the analysis of Hausdorff dimension and the way that these measures work has some non-trivial intersection with what I think of as part of recursion theory, namely effective descriptive set theory. So there are plenty of examples where the descriptive The descriptive complexity of a set is important to analyzing the way that these housework measures and the way that the notion of dimension works. So, here's an example. Okay, so if you restrict yourself to analytic sets, then the measure of a set is supported in some sense by the measure of its closed subsets. Okay, so the first result here is by dates. Result here is by dates. This is all worked out in the 50s and 60s. So, Deb is in 52. If you have an analytic set and it has positive gauge measure, then it has a compact subset, which also has positive gauge measure. So the fact that the set is not null is supported by its compact subsets. And similarly, if A is analytic and not sigma finite, so it's really big, it cannot. Finite, so it's really big. It cannot be written as a countable union of sets, each of which has finite matter. Okay, so if it's analytic and not sigma finite for HF, then it has a compact subset, which is similarly not sigma finite for HF. So the fact that an analytic set cannot be partitioned into convoy many sets of finite measure is also supported by its closed subsets. And so for now, for analytic sets, you can For analytic sets, you get the regularity properties that we associate with Lebesgue measure. If you don't look at analytic sets, then pathologies show up. So if you look at, for example, if you allow yourself the full-blown access to the axiom of choice, then you can build a subset of the reels. It has dimension one and has no perfect subset. Okay, so in general, for general. In general, for general sets, their dimension is not supported by their closed subsets. In fact, you can, if you work inside GÃ¶del's universal constructible set, so B equals L, then in a definable way, you have access to the well-ordering of the reals. So inside L, there's a sigma one, two well-ordering of the reals, and you can get leverage on that to prove that there's a pi one one subset. Pi 11 subset, so sets that are familiar to us, a pi 11 subset of the reals that has dimension one and no perfect subset. So you can, if working in the context where you have nice definable well orderings, you can get definable sets that have irregular, they don't have the regularity properties that the analytic sets have. And if you can recover some of this, and so there's Recover some of this. And so there's there's, I think there's still a fair amount to do with this topic. You can recover some of the nice regularity properties associated with the analytic sets if you move to, if you accept the existence of large cardinals or you move to a context of determinacy. One example is this theorem that I'm citing by Crohn, Fisherman, and Jackson. AD implies that if a set has dimension, if any set has dimension S, As dimension s, then for every d less than s, it has a compact subset of dimension at least d. So some of the pathologies of the axiom of choice get eradicated when you have determinacy and you look at the class of sets for which determinacy applies. Okay, so this is the topic I want to really concentrate on for this talk. So I want to define a set of strong dimension F, if and only F of If and only if, for every H such that F has higher order than H, A has infinite measure. And for every G such that G has higher order than F, A is null. Because a strong dimension means that any smaller, in the sense of gauge, any smaller aspect of dimension, this set looks infinite. In fact, it won't. Infinite. In fact, it won't even look sigma finite. And for any larger, a higher order notion of dimension, the set looks null. So its dimension is, in terms of things that are comparable with F, its dimension is hit by F exactly. And then there's a limiting case, the case where for every G, H G of A is null. So A looks null for every gauge measure. For every gauge measure, we're going to call that strong dimension zero. And the notation here is meant to suggest, if you know it, the notion of strong measure zero. And we're going to get to strong measure zero in a moment. So, okay. Okay, so an example: a line, even viewed inside Rn, a line or a line segment. Are in a line or a line segment, both of those objects have strong dimension linear. So they have strong dimension f, where f is the identity function. F measures a basic ball by its diameter. But these two things, a line segment and a line, they are not distinguished by the notion of dimension. They have exactly the same dimension, exactly the same. Dimension exactly the same in the sense of even this fine calibration by gauge measures, but they aren't exactly the same, right? The line segment has finite length and the line has infinite length. In terms of linear measure, these two objects, the line, the infinite line and the line segment, are given different sizes. They have the same dimension, but different size. But different size. And that's the topic that I want to talk about. Okay, so this is just to remember: this is the definition of strong dimension. You look infinite on anything such that f has higher order, and you look null on anything that has higher order than f. So this question goes back to Vesikovich, and he raised the question, what can the size of A be in terms of the gauge function which characterizes its strong? Which characterizes its strong dimension. So, what about the size of A? What about HF of A when A has strong dimension F? What can we say? What are the possibilities? For Hausdorff dimension, you can have size anywhere from zero to infinity at exactly at your Hausdorff dimension. But that's sort of not the case here when we look at the finer calibration. Finer calibration. So there's three fundamental possibilities. The first one is A could be null at its dimension, or it could be have be not null, but B sigma finite. And sigma finite and finite are sort of lumped together because the analysis is exactly the same. And then the last case is this case, the least tractable case is that A is not. A is not sigma finite. It's very large when viewed in terms of the gauge measure corresponding to its dimension. So there's the possibilities. Those are the possibilities. We'll see which ones are actually realized. It could be null, it could be sigma finite, or it could be not sigma finite. Okay, so the first case, the case where could Could A be null in its strong dimension? That was this case is not so difficult. If you lose interest in what I'm talking about, but you haven't lost interest in the topic, you could try to work this one out. This is the sort of thing that helps one figure out what are the players in this game in trying to understand measure and dimension. So if you have a set that's null for the gauge measure associated with F, then there Associated with f, then there is an h such that f is of higher order than h, such that a is null in the sense of h. Okay, so if it looks null at f, it looks null for something that has lower order than f. So f cannot be its strong dimension. So that's a direct sort of measure theoretic argument. Case two. This is a case two is that A has positive measure and it's an And it can be partitioned into countably many pieces, all of which have finite measure. So, this is the canonical way for a set to have strong dimension. It has positive measure, so everything that is of lower order than f is going to give a measure infinity. And it can be broken up into countably many pieces, each of which has finite measure. But we already noted if A has finite measure in the sense of F and G is. Finite measure in the sense of F and G is higher order than F, then A is null in the sense of G. So if you break A up into countably many pieces, all of which have finite measure, well, Hg is countably additive. So every one of those countable pieces is null in the sense of G. And so A is going to be is going to be null in the sense of Hg. So this is the canonical way to see that a set has That has a strong dimension. And that's what happens with the line. The line has strong dimension linear because you can break it up into kind of many intervals, even unit intervals, each of which has unit length. And so this is the case that we're in. So case three. Case three is A is not sigma finite for the gate. For the gauge measure associated with that. So, this is the most intractable and most interesting case for this situation. So it was first settled for analytic sets. Here's the theorem. So Vesekovich proved, and then he did it for Hausdorff dimension, and Rogers generalized it to gauge measures. This is not Hartley-Rogers, it's a different Rogers. Rogers. If A is compact and not sigma finite for the gauge measure associated with F, then there is a higher order G, such that A is not sigma finite for Hg. Okay, so for really nice sets, for compact sets, they can't be really large in their strong dimension. If they're really large for the gauge measure associated with F, then that spills over. That spills over to a higher order G. So if compact sets are not sigma finite for HF, then F can't be their strong dimension. And by the capacitability theorem that we mentioned earlier, the non-sigma finiteness of an analytic set is supported by its compact subsets. So the same conclusion applies for analytic sets. If you have a set that's not sigma finite for HF, finite for HF and it's analytic, then there's a higher order G such that that set is not sigma finite for Hg. So what about the case where we move away from the sets for which regularity results seems to be the way things roll for the analytic sets. The first result is a consistency theorem. So, Vesekovich proved a few years later that if you assume the continuum hypothesis, then there's a set, a subset of the plane that has strong linear dimension and is not sigma finite for linear measure. So I'll show you a picture in a minute. I got interested in Vesakovich for this talk and I looked him up. There's an interest. Many interesting facts about the man, but the one that caught my attention was that his initial interest was logic, but he couldn't, you know, but he changed his major because the library in St. Petersburg didn't have enough books about logic, and so he couldn't learn the material. Too bad for us. All right, so but but he knew. But but he knew enough about logic to know to be able to do things like this. And if you if you look at Besakovich's proof and you combine it with a little bit further properties of Girdles L. If B equals L, there's a pi 11 set such that a subset of the plane such that it has strong linear dimension and is not sigma finite for linear measure. Sigma finite for a linear measure. Okay, so the again, well, V L satisfies the CH, and here using the CH and the axiom of choice. Well, again, you have a definable while ordering the reals plus the CH. You can get a definable example that plays in the same way that Besakovich's example did. Here's the picture. The way that Bessikovic's example works. Besakoj's example works is you choose a sparse set here, S, and then you just extend the points in S and turn them into line segments. So you take the unit interval across S, and this is the picture. And Besakovich, for Besakovich, his S was something that's called concentrating on the rationals. That's a set. Rationals. That's a set such that every open cover of Q is a cover of S, except for complementary exceptions. So Besakovich, in his proof, took such an S and made this picture, proved that it had strong linear dimension. Okay. Okay, so we're going to have to now discuss the Borel conjecture. So let me remind you what that is. So a set has strong men. So, a set has strong measure zero if and only if, for every sequence of positive real numbers, epsilon sub i, there's a sequence of open intervals, O sub i, such that for each i, O sub i has length epsilon sub i, and S is covered by the union of the O sub i. So, no matter how rapidly you want the diameters of these intervals to shrink and go to zero, there is an open Is zero, there is an open cover of S which consists of basic open sets whose diameters shrink that rapidly. Okay, so the history of this Brell conjecture, Brell conjectured that strong measure zero implied countable, because clearly any countable set has this property. So it's So that was the conjecture. The theorems were that that conjecture is independent of the axioms of set theory. It's independent of ZFC. Sierpinski in 28 proved that if the CH holds, if the consumer hypothesis holds, then the Borel conjecture fails. So CH implies not Borel conjecture. And Labor in the 70s proved that the Borel conjecture was Proved that the Bro conjecture was consistent, consistent with the axioms of set theory. Okay, so now the connection between the Brauck conjecture and this issue about strong dimension. So the first connection is this theorem of Besakovich, which is a set has strong measure zero if and only if it has strong dimension zero. So asymptotically, in the limb, a set has strong dimension zero. The limit has strong dimension zero if it's null for every gauge measure. Okay, Vesekovich proved that that being null for every gauge measure, sort of the limit, the limit of from above of gauge measures making the set null is equivalent to the set having strong measures here. So that's first connection. Second connection is that if you if you If you take a set of strong measure zero, an uncountable set of strong measure zero, right, which you get from the failure of the Braille conjecture, then there's a subset of the reals. And this is just Besikovich's method. There's a subset of the plane that has strong linear dimension and is not sigma finite for linear measure. You go back to this picture here, and you put a set of strong measure zero there. Zero there and extend it by line segments, and you get a set that has strong dimension one. All right. Okay, so when the Brown conjecture fails, there are non-trivial examples of sets that are not sigma finite in their strong dimension. So what about when the strong, when the Borel conjecture holds? And that's the theorem that I've been building up to it. So when the Borel conjecture To it. So when the Braille conjecture holds, well, it's consistent with ZFC that for every n, for every subset of Rn, for every gauge function, if A has strong dimension F, then A is sigma finite for HF. So it's a, it's, you could, you could take, say, the Brown conjecture. The Brown conjecture said if a set If a set looks really small for Lebesgue manager, then it must be countable. So in dimension, it's saying if the set looks really small in the sense of gauge measure, that's all the G's of higher order than F make the set look null. Then the set, we're not going to say that the set is countable, but the set has a countable. But the set has a countable feature. It can be partitioned into countably many pieces, each of which is finite. So it is, after the fact, a generalization of this statement is an extension of Breilla's conjecture into a past strong, past the counting measure to all gauge measures. All right. Okay. All right. Okay, so now there are very few models, there are very few methods to produce a model of set theory in which the Borel conjecture is true. The canonical one is the one that Labor used in his consistency result. And that's the one, that's the place where it plays out this way. So Labor's model for the Braille conjecture is also a model for its extension to dimension. The proof has three parts, which I'm sort of putting under the headings: reflection, fusion, investigation of rank. Okay, so in the last, oh, I actually have quite a lot of time left. Good, okay, I can speak more slowly. Okay, so there's four things to talk about: labor's model. Reflection, fusion, rank. So, Weber's model is obtained by starting with a model of set theory in which the consumer hypothesis holds, and then adding omega too many reals using Labor's method, Labor generic reals, by iteratively forcing with countable support. So, in omega-2 sequence, you add Omega 2 many reals. So the continuum hypothesis: Labor proved that his forcing preserves cardinals and so on. So we're adding omega too many reals. We are going to deny the continuum hypothesis in the resulting model, which is necessary. And the way that a labor real works, it's something that's It's something that is approximated by a condition that looks. I tried to draw a picture here. A condition is telling you something about the ultimate real that you're adding. It's a subtree of omega to the less than omega. It has a finite stem. There's the stem. And for every point that is not contained in this, so every point that So, every point that is either a stem or extends the stem, it has infinitely many immediate extensions. Okay, so if we look at a point here, there are infinitely many i such that if this is sigma, there's infinitely many i such that sigma concatenated with i is inside the tree. So, these are sort of the ultimately bushy subtrees of omega to the less than omega. Okay, so the real adds a function from omega to omega, namely, you know, whoa, I didn't want to do that. So each point here is a finite sequence of natural numbers, and we can shrink these trees down, and we're going to get an infinite sequence of natural numbers, which is essentially the same as a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. Furthermore, on Furthermore, we can assume that G is increasing. I mean, that doesn't show up in Labor's definition of the forcing, but as far as if you just above every point throw away finitely the finitely many things, the finitely many I's such that I is less than or equal to the last element of sigma, we still have a labor condition, and that condition forces G to be increasing. So I'm just going to assume that our G's are increasing. Okay. The other thing I should say about this labor forcing is that if you've worked with things in Ramsey's theorem or working with Matthias Forsen, you can get a lot of power out of taking a tree. Out of taking a tree and not extending its stem, but just thinning out the branches above. So in some sense, the values that the generic function takes don't matter. By thinning the tree, you can make it. So in some sense, the values look like indiscernibles. And one can prove the consistency of the Braille conjecture using Matthias forcing rather than this forcing. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's we're adding a function from omega to the to omega, so I think of that as a real. The other thing is notice, we can make this function that we're adding is going to eventually dominate every function in the ground model. Because if I have a function in the ground model, and here are its values, you can just throw away, throw that away, throw the value goes like this, throw that away. You can look at the tree such that at every line. The tree such that at every level, all the points of the tree have value greater than the ground model function does. And so this G is going to end up being a very fast-growing function vis-a-vis measuring against things that are in the ground model. So that's one step in labor choicing. Okay, now given a gauge measure, or given a gauge function. Or given a gauge function, and g, which I'm thinking of as labor generic, you can define a gauge function, little g, that has higher order than f. And the way you do it is for each positive diameter, essentially you just set g equal to f g at d be f of d divided by k, where k is the least such that d is greater than 1 over g of k. So, if g is a very fast-growing function, this is going to be a function that has higher order, but it very slowly moves away. It very slowly goes to zero faster than f. So, the labor generic gives you what you might think of as a generic gauge function of higher order. So that So that suggests this methodology. Given a gauge function f and a set in the generic extension such that the model thinks that set is not sigma finite for hf. So it's a candidate for having strong dimension f. Look at the generic gauge function associated with f and show that a has Show that A has positive measure. So if you think of the generic object, right, as something that has no, it's generic. It has no features on its own other than genericity. And if the generic, if you're going to look at anything of higher order than F and get that A has positive measure for that thing, the generic object should work. Object should work. And it's the featureless way to get something of higher order. Because that's the heuristic. If you try to look at what I wrote here mathematically and make it precise, it's impossible. The first thing is that A doesn't exist until you get to the end. And G is some forcing that happens along the way. That happens along the way. So A sort of comes into being after G. So it doesn't make sense to talk about G's being generic relative to A, right? And letting G be the test for whether A is of strong dimension F. So the heuristic is right, but you have to do some fooling around. You have to manipulate things to get the heuristic to work. So that's where reflection. Reflection comes in. So we're going to reflect the property that A is not sigma finite. So we've got this F, we've got A, they live in the ultimate model. And A is not sigma finite for HF in the ultimate model. So we're going to reflect that. It means we're going to see something happen at an initial segment of the forcing that mimics the same feature. Okay, so there is an alpha less than omega 2 such that both Such that both the gauge function and A intersect the model up to that point, the set of reals that are in that model that belong to A, right? That set belongs to this intermediate model. So the object, so F and the associated gauge measure and A so far belong to this model. And in this intermediate model, the piece of A that you have obtained at that point is. Obtained at that point is not signifying for the gauge measure HF. So something happens in the limit, it happens at some point along the way. Furthermore, this omega 2 iteration of labor forcing, if I view labor forcing as defined in this model rather than as defined at the place where we started labor forcing, this model sees that the ultimate model is. That the ultimate model is the result of omega 2 iterated labor forcing over itself. So the forcing factors. So you can reflect the property that A is not sigma finite in the limit down to a little piece of A sitting inside a little piece of the iterated force. Okay, so that means we can assume that A and F are in the ground model, and A is not sigma finite for HF. A is not sigma finite for HF. However, we are losing something when we move to this point. We no longer know, when we assume that A and F are in the ground model, because they're in here, when we assume that they're in the ground model, we no longer know that A is not sigma finite in the ultimate model. It's just not sigma finite at the start. So that's step one of our. One of our analysis. Step two, using this kind of fusion arguments, I guess that goes back to Gerald Sachs. Maybe it even goes back to Clifford Spector. But it's a way to produce closed subsets and handle countably many things at a time. At a time. So if you know it from SACS forcing or you know it from the construction of a set of minimal Turing degree. Okay, so assuming that A, this A, so we're going for a contradiction. Assume that in the ultimate model, our set is null with regard to the generic gauge function of higher order than F. Now this makes sense, right? Now, this makes sense. The generic gauge function of higher order than f makes sense because now a and f are in the ground model. And when we add a later real, we actually do have a generic gauge function. Okay, so assume that this generic gauge function makes A look null. Then there's a condition of one of these labor trees and a function C. So C is associating each node in the tree. Node in the tree to a finite collection of basic open sets. And we can even assume that these basic open sets have are nicely, that they're all given by dyadic parameters. So each node in the tree is telling you these basic open sets. Okay, and the following conditions hold. The initial segments of the stem of T and all of all. stem of t and all of all of the immediate extensions of the stem of t are associated with the empty set so nothing happens nothing happens on the stem of t nothing happens on on the first fan out the first branching of t c isn't committing itself to anything secondly the elements of that are associated with c concatenated with i concatenated with j all have diameters All have diameters sitting between 1 over j and 1 over i. Remember, we're assuming that our functions are increasing, so j is bigger than i. So we're breaking up the scale of basic open sets according to the values that the generic function has given us. Thirdly, if you look at anyway, if I look at If I look at c at some particular node in T, C of sigma, then the sum of F of the diameter of U, this is what the gauge measure is assigning. When we do the Hausdorff sums, this is the size that we're giving to a basic open set, F of its diameter. So for every sigma, the sum of the sizes that are associated with basic open sets in that interval is uniform. Basic open sets in that interval is uniformly bounded by a constant, and that constant depends only on the length of sigma. Okay, so we're giving basic open sets. So our tree is going like this somehow. And we are associating with each node here basic open sets. And the diameters are determined by what's the last, what's the What's the last, what's the value here, and what's the value there? That will tell you the sizes of the basic open sets that occur that are associated with the appropriate condition in T. Okay, and lastly, T forces that if I look at the generic path through T, then if you collect all the basic open sets that occur along that path, it covers A. Okay, so you assemble this T and this tree of possible covers of A using a fusion argument in the ground model. So T and C belong to the ground model. Yes, that's pulling the way that we're assuming that this Hg is making A null. To make A look null, To make A look null, it tells you that there have to exist certain kinds of open covers. We're extracting the way that the forcing works to determine the elements of those open covers and getting this tree of possible covers. All right, so now we get to the last step, which is tied to this observation. If you look at the If you look at the set of X, such that T forces X is covered by the generic cover, so X is generically covered, or X is covered by C infinity G, that is a pi 11 set relative to the things that define C and T. Well, it's pi 11 in a kind of obvious way, though it took me two years to realize it. Two years to realize it. It's pi one one because all you have to say is for every thinning of t, there is some sigma. That's a finite thing. So for every real, which is a thinning of t, there is a way to capture x according to some element of the thinning. That's on its face a pi11 property. Pi11 property is pi11 sets. Pomeran sets. Oh, yeah, I should say this if I go like this. So we're no longer talking about the axiom of choice. We're no longer talking about some pathological application of AC, putting together some using a well-ordering of the continuum or something that is irrelevant. We're talking about a pi 1, 1 set. We're talking about effective descriptive set theory. Set theory. So it's pulled this observation pulls the problem away from a set theoretic problem. Now it's a recursion theoretic problem. We have a pi 11 set, and we're trying to figure out how it behaves. Okay, so the pi11, how do you analyze a pi11 set? Well, you analyze it according to rank. Something is, X is in a Pi 11 set. An x is in a pi-1 set if and only if there's some ordinal which is recursive in x, c, and t. And that ordinal is characterizing the reason that x is covered. So the power one set is that x has to be covered. And you look at x and t, and you can, there's a reason why x is covered. The reason isn't instant, unless the rank is very small, but the reason is that there's some ordinal. But the reason is that there's some ordinal analysis which tells you, you know, in terms of this ordinal, x has to be covered. Okay. And this kind of rank function, the way that these things work, if you go from t and you throw away some points, you extend the stem, then the restriction of t to nodes that are compatible with that extension of the stem decreases rank. As you move up in the tree, rank goes down. Okay, so now. Okay, so now we're totally in the realm of recursion theory. So here's what you have to show: you have to show that for every sigma in T, the set of x that have rank 2 in t sigma, right, has finite matter in the sense of our original gauge function. So now, okay. This is kind of odd. Usually, when you do a rank analysis, it's Usually, when you do a rank analysis, it's rank zero that matters. It's rank zero where you say, aha, you know, now I understand what's happening. But here, here it's rank two. That's where the action takes place. Okay, so good. And now notice, right, we have, what do we have? We have countably many sigmas, right? And you can look at the set of things that have rank two at sigma. Of things that have rank two and sigma, right? And now we have a partition of what's being covered into countably many pieces, each of finite measure. Now, A is forced to be covered, so every element in A, there must be a sigma that such that A is ranked 2 in sigma. So this was, I kind of slipped this past you, but I did point it out. When we defined our C, nobody was covered by the stem. Covered by the stem, and nobody was covered by any initial segment of the stem. So, everybody in the tree has rank starting from the stem greater than or equal to two. So before you can get to rank one or zero, you have to go through rank two. And that means that every point that's covered, in particular, every element of A, must have a point at which it has rank two. Has rank two, and that is a set of finite measure. So A is sigma finite, and this is all happening in M because the C and the T were extracted from the forcing relation. So it's sigma finite in M, and that's a contradiction. Okay, so that's the theorem that I wanted to discuss. I have a couple of finite comments if I can run over 30 seconds. If you look at the proof, you can first see: well, we did verify the Braille conjecture, right? Because if the Braille conjecture fails implies that this statement about strong dimension also fails. Okay, so we use Labor's model, but we had sort of 90% into Labor's paper. We took a detour, right? Detour, right? We didn't do Labor's argument to prove the Brau conjecture, but we got it from the analysis of dimension. Secondly, if you have a set that's not sigma finite for some gauge measure in the final model, then it has a size omega one, has a small subset which is not sigma finite for that same gauge measure. So it's kind of odd that being not sigma finite doesn't Sigma finite doesn't require being large. This non-sigma finiteness is supported by sets that are size smaller than the continuum. Okay, so the question that I didn't answer, and I think this is a quite intractable problem, but if somebody could answer it, why would I be interested? We showed that this state, that this state. This state that this statement a is not sigma finite for hf means a does not have strong dimension f. We show that that was consistent with the axioms of set theory, but I don't know whether the Braille conjecture implies it. So if you know that there is no uncountable set of strong dimension zero, can you prove just from that that there is that this that it extends to higher dimension? To a higher dimension. I don't know the answer to that.
