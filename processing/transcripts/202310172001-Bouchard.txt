So we're going to do seven things today in 50 minutes. Isn't that exciting? So it should be pretty easy. So I think actually Marina is the one who said that you're going to tell a story when you started your talk. Didn't you say that? I think he did say that. I loved it because I was going to say the same thing because mathematics is all about telling stories. And that's exactly what I'm going to do today. Did you say that for a second? Did you say that or did I just make it? I think you didn't look at it. So, yeah, I'm going to tell a story about different connections between different areas of mathematics. So, this is really what I'm going to talk about. So, it should be very informal. It's like evening talk. Usually it's a beer talk by this time, but we're not allowed to have beers here. So, let's pretend we do have beers, and it should be pretty informal. All right, so please interrupt me anytime. And I should say, I know nothing about trusted algebra, so that might not be introduced very well. Not be introduced very well. In fact, it might not be introduced at all because there's a lot of people here that know a lot more than I do. So, okay, so what are we going to talk about? So, as I said, we're going to cover seven topics in 15 minutes, so it's going to be awesome. But we're mostly going to talk about the relations between them. So, the first, so I'm going to write it really at the top because I want to keep that for the whole talk. So, the first topic we're going to talk about is inverted geometry. And then we'll see, can you all And then we'll see. Can you all read in the back? It's good. We'll see how this is related to the second topic, which is actually one topic I was supposed to talk about. So tau functions and of course the entry-whole system. So I'll talk a little bit about how this relates to a numerative geometry, and then we'll talk about what I would call differential constraints. So I'll give you, by the way, now I'm just writing the top. Give you, by the way, now I'm just writing the topics, but I'll give you an example right away that should make all of those much clearer. But for now, I'm just writing the big seven topics we'll talk about. So differential constraints. Fourth topic is going to be topological regression. Now let's see if I have enough space in the board. The fifth topic that is related to all of those is going to be what I would call Is going to be what I would call quantum curves or quantum differential equations. So that's similar to what we heard about a little bit today. So, quantum curve and also, I guess, WKD analysis, which is a method for finding asymptotic solutions for these quantum curves. Now, I have two more. Sixth topic is basically related here is what I would call exactWKD following basically reconstructing. Basically, reconstructing, well, I'll explain what these topics, what these words mean as we go along. And then the last one is the one that is perhaps the most important one, but the one I know very little about. So that will be the connection with cluster algebras, which in fact has connections to pretty much probably all of these topics. And somewhere or another, we already heard some of them. Connections with numerative geometry we've heard. We'll hear about connections with tau functions. File connections for tile functions at some point this week, I think. At least it's in the title. And also, other connections. So, this is the kind of big seven topics that I want to talk about today in 15 minutes. Isn't that exciting? Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Okay, so let's start with an example that we all know, because it, I think, highlights or explains very well what the connections are. And this example, of course, is Witten's conjecture or consented theorem. Incentive theorem. So I'm going to go through all of these topics in this case, and then we'll see how we can formulate a very wide generalization of this. And in the generalization, some of these connections are very well understood by now, some are very, very mysterious. So that's kind of what's interesting about this chain of connections. But in the case of Witten's conjecture, all of those, except the last one, as always, except the last one will be something you'll hear about because I. Last one will be something you'll hear about because I don't know. But most of those are well understood. So, what is the inverted geometry in the case of Witten's conjecture? So, we all know what this is about. So, Witten conjecture is about constructing or studying, or at least it's basically what Witten was doing was studying two-dimensional quantum gravity theory. So, one mathematical way of understanding this theory is in terms of intersection numbers and the multiplied space of curves. So, I'm introducing here the notation Fgn. Here the notation Fgn for the standard integrals over Mgn bar of side classes. So we all know very well what these things are, so I'm not going to define those. But this is the enumerative geometry that is interesting in the case of Witten's conjecture. So this is what Witten was studying, and then Witten's conjecture was precisely this connection here, which was the following statement: is that if you, so I'm going to have to. So, I'm going to have to manage the board somehow. So, this will be the first part. Witten's conjecture is the following statement. So, if you construct what I will call a partition function from now on, so this is just the exponential of a generating function for these invariants. So, something like this. You do say parameter h bar. And then you sum over these in lines. Over these n lines with some coordinates xk1, xkn. Usually, t is used in the context of Witten's conjecture, but I'm going to use x later, so let's call these variables x. These are just variables for the generating series for the intersection numbers. So you construct this object Z, this partition function, which is the partition function of the two-dimensional quantum gravity theory. And the statement is that Z is Is that Z is a tau function? In fact, it's not just a tau function, it's a very particular one, but in Z is put in tau function for the KDB integrable hierarchy. So this is a celebrated statement, so I'm sure you're all familiar with this statement here. Now, what does it mean to be a tau function? That's another thing that will not explain in this talk. But roughly speaking, if you take the log of the tau function, Take the log of the tau function, take a bunch of derivatives, and end up with a solution of an integrable system. Very roughly speaking, so in this case, what happens is if you take a function mu, so this is a function of this infinite set of variables, if you define it as being the second derivative with respect to the first variable, let's call it x naught, of the log of z, then this object u here, this function, is a solution of the KDV integrable system. And as I said, it's System and as I said it's not just any solution so it's the one that is fixed by initial condition given by setting all the variables to zero except the first one and then sending that to exit. This is what defines the Kance Witten tau function. And that's the relation between two and one in the context of Witten's conjecture. Okay? Great? Okay, good. So I'm really having trouble managing my board here, but that's okay. Boring here, but that's okay. We'll make some nice stairs. Okay, so this is one, so this was two, and of course, the relation is Witten's conjecture. It was proved by Kinsevich. Now, in this context, what is the differential constraints? So what I mean by differential constraints in this context is what is known as Viazole constraints. So it was proved not long after Putin's conjecture that you can reformulate it in a coordinate way in terms of a differential. In a coordinate way, in terms of a differential, a set of differential constraints for the partition function z. More specifically, what happens is you have an infinite set of differential operators that we call li that kill the partition function. So that's for i greater or equal to minus one. I could write down explicitly what these differential operators are, but I cannot because I don't know them by heart. But the main point is that we form a representation of a sum out. Of the sub-algebra of the Devaso algebra. So, in other words, there is a representation of the Devaso algebra that you can write down explicitly that kills Z, and in fact, it uniquely fixes Z up to normalized scaling of the Poisson function. In other words, if you impose that Z takes this form there is uniquely fixed by these differential constraints. And it turns out that one can show this is equivalent to the K D V of. To the KDV of Z being this solution of the KDV hierarchy with a non-trivial state. So does that make sense? Okay, so these are the things we're going to try to generalize. So now we have to make sure we understand it in this context because it will be harder after. So if you have questions, please ask. Okay, so this would be the differential constraints point of view. Now it's important to know that, I mean, this is also an Now it's important to note that, I mean, this is also an infinite set of partial differential equations for you, but these are very different differential equations, but they're not at all the same. So they do construct the same object, fix uniquely the same object, but they're very different set of differential constraints. Okay, so what is the corresponding statement here for Witten's conjecture or intersection numbers in the context of topological recursion? So I'll have to define what topological recursion is. I'll have to define what the possible recursion is because I assume that many people here do not know what this word actually means here. So, what I mean is one particular topic recursion, which is the in our political recursion. But the statement here, and I'll define what this is later, but the statement is that the in al-Ahante-Eol positral recursion, so this is a machine, as we'll see, that constructs a sequence of differentials on a spectral curve. And if you apply it on And if you apply it on perhaps the simplest spectral curves, I'll define all of that later, but just for the sake of writing the statement here. So if you apply it to the simplest spectral curve, which is called the Airy spectral curve, which is really just this particular equation in C squared. So if you apply topological recursion to this spectral curve, you construct an infinite sequence of symmetric differential forms, and these forms and these turned out to generate intersection numbers as well. So the precise statement here is that these are some, there's some normalization factor here, but the exact same coefficients here, the Fgm, but now it's indexed differently, so now differential form, so you end up with something like this, this tensor product between these. Something like this. Now, if you have, if you don't know about the Polish-Cohere equation, that probably makes no sense right now. So I'll explain what the Paul's curve equation is later. But the key point here is that this is, the Z's here are just local variables on the spectral curve. And this is a symmetric differential on n copies of the spectral curve. But the key point is that it encapsulates, it contains the exact same information as As the partition function, if the outcome is intersection measures. And that's again a very non-trivial statement. But it is true, it is proved. All of these relations are proved for the case of construction. Okay, and I will tell you, basically, most of my talk will be about how we can generalize that. And I'll mostly focus on generalizing this and show how these two things are related in a much more general set. So if by now you don't know what this means, that's okay, because I'll explain what this means. That this means. Okay, but it's just to show you that this big machine we have to polish over recursion: if you apply it to the simplest possible spectral curve, you recover intersection points. Okay, so that's point number four. Now you can go to another statement, which is number five, which is now the construction of quantum. Okay, so what is this? Okay, so what is this? So, this is something that, well, I should have mentioned the definition of topological recursion actually comes from matrix models. This is where they originally came up with the formula that I'll explain later, because it solves matrix models. And in the context of matrix models, there's a relation between expectation value of traces and determinants that gives rise to this connection here, which sometimes is called topological recursion quantum curve correspondence. So, I'll just tell you what this is in this context, and again, we'll talk more about. Context and again, we'll talk more about this correspondence as well later. So, the idea here is that once you have the Polish Crop recursion, which constructs this kind of infinite sequence of objects, these differential spectral curve, then you can construct another object, which is a wave function. So I'm going to write it as psi. And it looks kind of very similar to this. It looks kind of very similar to this, but it is not the same. The summations here are the same. Sorry, no k is here. But then you integrate these differential forms. Okay, there's one extra term here, which is not important. term here which is not important which is for the case where g equal to 0 and n equal to 2. But roughly speaking what you do is you just take these symmetric differential forms, you integrate them, but then you specialize all to the same variable so this becomes a function of a single variable. So you could write that as function of z, which is a single variable on your spectral curve. And that's an object that's called a wave function because the statement is that in this particular case, if you take this If you take this differential upper and you add on psi, you get C. So psi is a solution of this particular differential equation. Okay, so, and this is a quantum curve because it's a quantization of the spectrum. If you take x and send it to x, and take y and send it to the operator h dts. The operator hdx that takes a spectral curve to a quantum curve. And that is kind of a very explicit way of reconstructing solutions of this quantum differential equations from the data of the possible equation of the spectral curve. Okay, so that's the, that can be generalized, and that I'll talk about this, that can be generalized to any spectral curve and so on, and and it's still a conjecture in general. But that's a relation between the quantum differential equations like the one we saw today for Equations like the one we saw today for quantum cohort GFDN and Paul's recursion. Now, what this is doing here is in fact constructing solutions of this quantum differential equations, but very specific solutions, where it's constructing what's called WKB solutions. So these are not, generally speaking, problem-defined solutions. They're asymptotic solutions, where there's a series here in H bar, and these series never converge. And these series never converge. So these are actually asymptotic solutions. That's the method, WK method. And that brings us to point six. So with this machinery, what we do is we construct asymptotic solutions of these differential equations. And then you can ask, well, can you use these asymptotic solutions to recover actual solutions of the differential equation? And there's a whole machinery that exists to do that. That's called exactWKB. Basically, Basically, I will not talk about this much in the talk, but this is a very active research area. And the idea here is that if your asymptotic solution is behaved in a way that's good enough, what's called Borger resummable, then you can basically, there's a whole method of Baudel transform or whatever, which tells you that you can reconstruct the actual solution of the differential equation from the isyantic solutions. And it turns out that in this case, it is Baudel resumable. Borrell resemble, am I correct? Yes, I think it is. But in general, that's probably not wrong. But in this case, you can basically do that, and everything is nice. You recover the Airy functions, which are, I mean, of course, yeah. And you recover the two Airy functions, which are solutions of this differential equation, which is the Airy differential equation. Okay, but then the question is: can this be generalized as well in a much more broader context? And then there's 0.7, which is cluster on. Is 0.7, which is cluster algorithms. And now is something that I so that's 0.7. Great. Okay, so no, I don't know much. So one thing I know is that actually from the exact WQB, you can actually see the structure of cluster algebra. So you have something called robust symbols. I mean, Johe can tell us all about this. But you have robust symbols here. I mean, in this case, it's probably trivial because it's metric here in the GCL, but or mostly trivial. We'll stick to your, but you have a Boba symbol that encodes like monogamy of your solutions. And then these Boba symbols, I think, if you change your Stokes rather than a different Stokes region, if you move around, they transform according to cluster transformations, I think. And that basically you can think of them as variables in cluster algebra, roughly speaking. Is that roughly correct? But that's just one connection with cluster algebra, but there's plenty of others. I'm sure there's connections with convertive geometry with tau functions and so on. Of converted geometry with tau functions and so on. So I will try to avoid saying anything because that would probably be wrong. But that's certainly something I would like to know more and I would like to learn in this workshop. Okay, so this is basically the seven relations in the context of Witten's conjecture. So in this case, they're all well understood. I mean, again, this one I'll keep separate, but everything else is well understood and proven and well. So any questions on that so far? That's so fun. From five to six, you're saying you take this asymptote, and there's a general method that will then produce Airy functions from that? Right, so again, I'm not an expert on that. I think John could say more, but if the coefficients behave like one over natural or one over two g patrol, I think here, or something like that, then you can basically define a Borel transform. And I mean, you should set it. Yeah, Borel transform is a kind of a channel-wise. Plus form is the kind of termwise inverse mappers plus form. So it needs to give some n factorial in each power. So although, even though the original tree is divergent, each term wise inverse Laplace platform can converge. I don't think we can take the Laplace transform. If the germ is analytic continuation on some axis, then the resulting Laplace transform is a solution of the ID equations, and which keeps the ID function. So that was done by Hechan, I think, or Done by Hecar, I think, originally. Yeah, this is the whole idea of resurgence and vulgarity some of the AT. I mean, there's a lot of people working on this, mostly physics. Okay, so great. So, other questions? Okay, so basically, what I want to do now is tell you. So, basically, what I want to do now is tell you that this whole thing, which is well understood in Witten's case, can be very, very widely generalized. And then that's what's interesting. And a lot of these connections are not understood. Actually, most of those are not understood in the general case. And that's really what makes the whole thing fascinating in my mind. So, what I'm going to do is first erase all of that if there's no further questions, and then talk about how to java. So, I'm going to focus. So, my starting point, I mean, we could start in many places, but my starting point would be to generalize these differential constraints, so the realizable constraints. We could start with topological recursion. Of course, historically, topological recursion was what came out first in 2007. What I'll call the generalization of these differential constraints in the form of very structures. Differential constraints in the form of air structure is more recent, 2017, by Konsevich and Suttleman as a way of kind of making sense of this. But I think it's, in my mind, it's cleaner to start here, so I'll start with that. So what I'll do is define now a very large generalization of these universal constraints that is promising so that all of these connections probably make sense in some way for this large class of differential constraints. Constraints. Okay, so let's do that. Okay, so what is, so let me put a line here because I want you to see that the whole talk, because, you know, if you, I think it's again, now you know, so that if you get bored during my talk, you can just look at those and try to think about these connections and, you know, see how exciting it is. Okay, so what is the idea of generalizing three? Generalizing three. So the generalization here is going to be called very structures following the paper of Concede and Solomon. So, the way I'll present them, however, is not the way they introduce them. It's kind of some way that we introduce them in a more recent paper, but it's the same thing. So, the idea here is to generalize the constraints. So, what we want to do, in other words, is find a very large class of constraints. Find a very large class of constraints of the form like this, but for some differential operators. And what we want to keep is the statement that there always exists a unique solution. So what I mean here is a unique solution of the form that I wrote before. So exponential of the sum over h bar with the exact powers, but different coefficients. So we want to keep the statement that there always exists a unique solution of the form that we like, but we want these constraints to be much more general. For example, we don't want them. To be much more general. For example, we don't want them to just be representations of VR so large, but that's way too simple. We want to allow much, much, much larger set of possible constraints. But by keeping Z in the same form, then we can hope that the coefficients will have an interesting emergent interpretation. We can hope that the solution Z will be the tau function, that these also make sense. So that's why we want to keep the solution in that. Okay? Okay, so that's what Okay, so that's what I will do now, and that's what n structures do. So I need to introduce a little bit of notation. So A here is just going to be an index set. Think of it as a finite index set 1 to n, but it could also be countably infinite. In fact, it is contably infinite in all interesting examples, but it doesn't cause any positive problem. And then I'm going to introduce dA, which will be the Val algebra, and coordinates xA. Coordinates xa. So this is the algebra of differential operators with coefficients that are polynomials in your variables. You can think of it as the three associated algebra in X and Val modulo commutation relations. Standard biological algebra of differential operator speed. That's all this is. And so what I'm defining here is just the space or the place where these differential operators will live. So we have to do. Differential operators will live. So we have to be a little careful with that, especially when the index is infinite. So that's why I'm defining things a little bit carefully. So what we do now is introduce a filtration on this algebra. So there's something called Bernstein filtration. It's a well-known filtration on the Vaile algebra. Sending exhaustive filtration. What it is, is that you define subspaces here such. Here, such basically you give card of degree 1 to x and delta. So you subspace i will correspond in sum of things that have a bunch of variables, a bunch of derivatives with k less or equal to r. Right, so you have, so it's a filtration, so you allow things, it's not homogeneous. So you allow things, it's not homogeneous. They don't have exactly degree i if you give degree one to S and L, but they have degree less or equal to i. So that defines a filtration, which is easy to see just by actual differential operators. F i dA, I think an F J D A is an F i position. This is called the Burst time filtration. There's many filtrations you can introduce in the Bar algebra, but that's the one we want to work with. And now, how do you turn a filtered algebra into a graded algebra? Question. Active learning environment. You could use your student response system. So, how do you turn a filter out to? I mean, there's many ways you can do it, but one way is to use what's called a Reese construction. And this is exactly what we need here. And this is exactly what we need here. So, what we do is we introduce a parameter h-bar. So, I'm going to call this new algebra dAH bar. And we introduce it as just being the direct sum. So, we sum over I of H bar I F I K. So, that's not the same algebra, of course, there's a new parameter. That's a much bigger algebra. But if this is a filtered algebra, then this is a grading algebra. That's why we use the case. And the grading here is. So the grading here is just pi degree square degree one, everything else is totally cool. Okay, so this is almost where our differential operators will live. All that we have to do is complete it. So we're going to define its completion here. So all this is here is that we're taking a direct product and taking the direct sum. So in other words, we allow infinite series. We allow infinite series in H bar and have just finite branoms in H bar. And that's absolutely key because we know, for example, Z is going to be an exponential of a series in H bar. So we want to work with series in H bar, just bring on this in H bar. Okay, so this is the space that we want to work in. Now, what we want to define is a condition for any collection of differential operators in that space. Of differential operators in that space such that there exists a mid-execution of these constraints. Okay? So, to make it a little more coordinate-independent, instead of talking about constraints with a bunch of LI, we can talk about the left ideal generated by those within the vial algebra, right? If it's called from if it's if z is killed by all the li, it's also killed by everything that is multiplied on the left by differential operators, so it's killed by the left by the old generator by these L operators. By these L. So, this is what is an error structure. So, it's basically a condition on left ideals in this space such that there is a unique solution. Then we define a error structure. So, a left ideal i in this space is an area structure if it satisfies two conditions. Conditions. To be precise, there's a third condition when the index is infinite, but it's just a technical condition, so I'll avoid writing it down in this talk. So the first condition is actually, let me write it here. So first you have to specify the generating set. So if it is generated by a collection of differential operator, let's call them hi or h A, where A is in my index set, such that. Such that first condition is that each differential operator starts with a derivative, plus i overturns, h bar. And the second condition is a condition on the ideal, which is that if you commute the ideal with itself, you get something which is h bar square part ideal. And that's it. And that's it. That's an error structure. It's a left ideal that satisfies these two conditions. We can find a generating set that takes this form, and the ideal satisfy this particular condition. Okay? Now, just to highlight, I mean, this condition is non-trivial, but of course, if you commute two things in the left ideal, you always get something in the left ideal. And also, by the nature of the value algebra, whenever you commute two things, you decrease at the power of h bar by two. And the power of h bar by 2. And the filtrations, you always get something in h bar squared times the value. But the fact that it lies in h bar squared times the ideal isn't very much a condition. Most ideals are less with one side of this condition. Okay, so this is what the nary structure is. Now, of course, this is not interesting. Now, of course, this is not interesting if it doesn't solve the question I asked in the beginning. So, if that was if you cannot prove that there's always exists a unique solution of the equations i times equals to zero. But the answer is yes. So, let me explain how this goes. I'm not going to write the proof, of course, but I just want to explain how this goes. So, first, let's just look at an example of an error structure, which is the host trivial example. So, I'm going to call it i-genetical. So, this would be the left ideal generated. F-ideal generated by the derivatives themselves of H bar. So suppose that this whole thing here is C. That satisfies this condition, but also satisfies this, which is very easy to see. So this is an example of a variety structure. Okay, so that's a very trivial example, but it turns out to be very important. Very important. Okay, so what do we know about this example? So, what we know is that it does have a unique solution in the form of exponential of a series. In fact, it's exponential of zero because it kills one. So if you react with any differential operator that has a derivative on the right, it kills one. Cool. Magic. Yes. Even my calculus students could probably probably. So that's great. So that's one thing that we know, and it turns out. So that's one thing that we know, and it turns out to be very important. Equivalent statement here would be that if you take the quotient of your algebra by this ideal, you get a cyclic module generated by the thing that is animated by the ideal, so a cyclic module generated by one, which is nothing but, I'll call it m, h bar, completed. That's the polynomial module, so it's just a space the algebra of polynomials, but again, that thing. Okay, so that's just an equivalence thing. Great. So that's a very, very simple case, but it turns out that the reason these are interesting is that they're all related to that simple case by a very special class of tomorrow's. And that's what can be used to prove that there always exists a unique solution. And that's it, theorem. That's the considerable supplement theorem in this context, although they did not. Supplement theorem in this context, although they did not formulate it at all in the way I'm presenting it here, but that's essentially the same. So the theorem here is that if I is an error structure, so it's a left ideal that satisfies these two conditions, then there exists an automorphism of the Vile algebra, of the p is the Vile algebra. Of a very special type. An automorphism, I'll try to put it in brackets. So, this is what we call a transvection in our paper. It's a stable transaction, so I'll tell you what it is in a second. It's a very special automorphism such that this ideal is just an image of this kinetical one by the volts. So, in other words, So, in other words, it's related to this one by this very special automorphism. And then I'll tell you what this automorphism is, and then you'll see right away that it implies that there's a unique solution for Z for any such value. Now, proving this theorem is quite non-true, but it's true. So, it's great. So, what is a transvection? So, a transvection is basically just So, transvection is basically just an enthorism that doesn't change the variable, but changes derivatives by potentially infinite series of terms that are just derivatives of some pre-nominals of a certain degree. Let me check if I have the right degree. The right degree? Yes. So the n plus 1 here just means that this is a polynomial degree of most n plus 1 in. So you can check this is an automorphism of the Val algebra, this is a computation relation. And the Val algebra, and it's very special, it only changes the derivatives. In fact, you can think of it as conjugation by exponential terms. And once you know that derivative and polynomial, it's a product of unique polynomial. Sorry, is that again? It's a product of open routers or not. It's not enough. So once you know that, then it's clear that there is a unique solution of the form that we want. Because if it is the image of this chemical ideal by this type of transaction, then that just means you can. Transaction, then that just means you can, instead of taking this particular HA, define as being something like this, but with an arbitrary thing here that can involve the bructures and all kinds of stuff, instead of taking those as generating set for I, you can just take the image of the calorators here. So that otherwise you can take those as generating set for your ideal. And then create a unique solution to this. And that solution. This, and that solution simply takes a form exponential minus this sum integration. But that's just acting with a derivative on an exponential. And that is exactly the form that we want. So here it's not written in terms of Fgns and so on, but you can just extend the polynomials here and the coefficients would be what I call Fgn correct. Okay, so the key point here is that when you define an error structure, your generating set here can be very complicated. It could have all kinds of stuff. Very complicated. But if it does satisfy condition that the first term is a derivative and that the commutator is an h-bar i, you can always find iterating set, which is very simple, which is derivative plus it happens. And that's very much a rule to prove. What is like q thing? Q are just arbitrary polynomials of degree at most n plus 1 of these values. So they're basically, so you see, what I'm saying here is that given an area ideal, they exist a transaction. So for different area ideals, you get different transactions, different demands. And in fact, this play value is, of course, in terms of the effect. So in terms of all the FGI is all the interesting amount of information? You should ask consideration some of them. I think the reason is because the typical example is of those, as I'm going to say in a second, is Witten's conjecture. And in this case, Z is basically a partition function of the scale of matrix models. Function of the scalar matrix models, and so it's the Arispect curve. I'm not thinking scary mistakes, it's probably called the beta structure for that reason. But I think that you get one dimensional. Yeah, Gita says that it's actual, but that's not at all the motivation. Well, you don't need it, you have to transform it. I mean, it's not even. And the point is, the one-dimensional case is completely useless. No, I think the motivation is the width and the scale. I would think that again, we're talking about, I don't know what consent could be worth thinking, so I don't. But yes, I mean, I could also mention that if, but, let me jump. Good. Thank you. Yes. So, other questions? Okay, so now I'm spending a lot of time. So, let me just give you very quick examples of various structures. Examples of various structures that are interesting. So the first one, of course, is the area, I have an F ideal generated by the Li of consent is written. And in this case, Z, I mean this case you can show that's an ultrasound statement, but if you look at the particular form of these differential operators for the consent width, for the neuralizable constraints of consent witten, you can show that indeed these satisfy the properties of the large structure. And so that's an example. And so that's an example. And as you can see in this case, as we know, Z is a tau function for KDD. The coefficients of the polynomials Q are intersection numbers, so there's a lot of interesting stuff going on. Now, another example would also be Li, but then we call them Li tilde. So now this would be a slightly different case. So again, the representation of the Diazo algebra, but a slightly different sub-algebra. You don't keep the L minus one term. And it's also a different representation. So if I wrote down explicitly, Representations. If I wrote down explicitly the differential operators, it would look slightly different. But there exists such a thing which is an error structure. And in this case, relations one and two are known as well. Z happened to be a tau function, but it's not the same tau function. It's a VGW tile function, for those of you who know what this is. Or you can read it again. This is again known. This is proof. And the FGNs, the coefficients in this case, The FgNs, the coefficients in this case, also have an emeritus interpretation, but that was only found a few years ago. They're again integrals of Mgn bar, but you have to, of psi classes, but you have to pair them with a particular combinology class, which is now known as the Kyodo-Nobbery class. It comes from a special case of a class that was constructed by Kyodo many years ago. But yeah, so in this case it's known. And then there's many, many, many more cases. So there's plenty of examples, and many of these examples come from And many of these examples come from representations of subsymmetry algebra. And many of them come from W algebras. So you have W algebras are extended symmetry algebras for two-dimensional conformal field theories. And then there's many examples you can come up with. And some of them are known. For example, you can get here the tau function for RTDV that corresponds to R-spin intersectional numbers. These would correspond to potential constraints that were approved by Zvunkian and so on. Were proved by Swunkian and so on. That's an example of an error structure. But you can get a lot more. You can get plenty of other things, and most of them are now not known. It's not known what Z is, whether it's a tau function in general, what the enumerated geometric interpretation is in general, it's not known for most cases. But there's a lot of cases that are known. You get all these intersection numbers, you can also get purpose numbers, more term bytes, a lot of stuff here that you can get. You should package them into a set. They should package them into a set, and it turns out to be killed by differential operators that form those functions. So it's a very, very large class of differential constraints. And the hope is that, or at least I don't know if it's a hope, but it would be fantastic if for any such constraints that is a tau function or something, and the coefficients always randomize in relative geometry function. That would be fantastic. But that's as far as I understand just A hole. Okay, so this is the generalization of three that I wanted to talk about. So any question about this before I move on to how this relates to four? So the n is very simple, but it's really just a very simple characterization of left ideals in the bottom output. Well, H bar complete. Okay, so now let me talk a little bit about. So, now let me talk a little bit about the possible recursion in the last 15 minutes and tell you how, in fact, political recursion is a special case of area structures. So, in other words, area structures is more general, but for any structure curve, if you would like to possibly recursion, you can construct the solutions or the differentials from anti-structure. Okay, so what is topological recursion? So, here now we are anti-topological recursion. So, the starting point is the spectral curve, as I said, so we're going to define what I mean by a spectral curve here. So, it's going to be a SP4 object. And all pretty simple. So, sigma here is going to be a compact Riemann surface. Well, actually, it doesn't have to be compact yet, so it's just a Riemann surface. X is going to be a branch cover of the Riemann surface onto P1. Omega01 is going to be a meromorphic one form on your even surface and omega zero two is going to be a symmetric Asymmetric bilinear differential on sigma plus sigma. So in other words, this is kind of a differential in two variables, then one is at two, which give up two copies of your reading sources. And it has to satisfy some properties. It's called Berman-Kerlo in the literature. Doesn't concern us. For today, some are going to define this more carefully. I'm never going to define this more carefully. But that's a spectral curve for me. So it's the key data of a Riemann surface, a branch covering, and two differential forms, one which is a one-form, the other one is a symmetry by the function on the radio surface. Okay, and then tovological recursion is basically machinery that constructs an infinite sequence of objects, omega g n. So this is for g greater or equal to n. So this is for g greater or equal to 0 and n greater than or equal to 1. We can extend to n equals to 0, but I'm not going to do that today. And these are symmetric differentials, miromorphic differentials on n copies of the spectrum. So you can think of them as kind of having n variables z1 to z n, they're like just intensive product of differential forms in each of these variables. Symmetry. Symmetric. So I guess symmetric if you exchange the buttons. Print the buttons. Okay, so that's what TR does. Now I have to tell you how it does that, how it constructs these differentials. So it's basically constructed by a formula, which, as I said, came out of matrix models. And these are constructed by local residue analysis. Analysis at special points on your Riemann surface, which are at the ramification points of your branch cover. So in other words, you have a branch covering width, so you can think of it as something like that, I don't know. And then you have your branch covering here. And then you have your branch covering here. This is your P1, this is your sigma. So there are some points here where you have some sheets. That means these are the ramification points of your branch covering. Locally, you can think of your map. In this case, there's only two sheets, so you can think of it as just a power map. These are local coordinates near these points here. And now, this is a special case where you only have simple ramification points. So, this is going to write the formula only for this case because for the general case, Case because for the general case, it's a lot more complicated, so I wouldn't write it on the board, but there exists a formula for any type of application here. So, what you do is the following. So, to construct the formula, construct these differentials, I use this very specific formula. So, this is an n plus one symmetric differential. I'm going to construct it by taking residue to R here with my set of. So, R here would be my set of ramification points for my bridge covering. So, for any such ramification point, I take a residue. And then here you have some object which is the recursion kernel. And then you have a recursive structure. So maybe write it and then explain what sigma means here. I'm sorry, this is a little bit annoying to write down. Bit annoying to lay down. But I'll explain in a second. Every single time I write this formula, I run out of body space. So let's move here. Okay, so this is multiplying here. Okay, so let me just explain very briefly what this formula is, but you won't understand it if you've never seen it just from listening to me here. But the key formula, the key point here is the following. So there's a sigma here. So sigma is basically a locally defined involution. So if you take a point here near a lamp fusion point, there's a well-defined volution here that exchanges the two sheets locally. It's not defined globally, but it's defined locally. Globally, but it's defined locally, so that's what this sigma is here. But what you can see here, sorry, that should be makeup g minus one, of course. What you can see is that this is recursive over 2g minus 2 plus n. So all the things that appear here have a lower 2g minus 2 plus n and a 1 over 2. So it constructs recursively all of these things from the initial data of omega 0, 1 and omega 02. Omega 01, and omega 02. I could write down the recursion kernel, but again, it doesn't matter. And this, I mean, you can also interpret that in terms of the composition of Riemann surfaces, basically removal of pair plants, and so on. I mean, you've probably seen similar formula in this context. There is an interpretation in this trend as well, but I will not try to talk about this. But this is what the post-code cursion is. So, if you've never seen this and you've heard that word before, that's really what it means. So, this is just a formula. So, what this is, it's just a formula that given any spectral curve produces an accurate C times symmetric factor curves. The sum is over all the validation points of your branch curve. So, these are special points in your spectrum curve on your Riemann surface, and you just do local analysis in your dome. So, it's really a local process in neighborhoods of these points. And why is there a prime in the second sound? Very good. Very good. Yes, I put it there, it didn't mention anything. So, this is because you remove all the instances where omega 01 appears in this formula. So, otherwise it would not be reversed. So, there's no need to put omega 0. That's fine. Okay, so that's the Paul's Color recursion. Now, as I said, if you apply it to the very special spectral curve where sigma is just P1, just genus 0, X is the double curve. 0, x is the double coverage is given by z squared. That's the respective term that I had before, so y squared minus x. You can think of that as just being defined by the double cover, x, which is the double cover, p1 and p1. And then you apply this formula and these omega gm's, if you extend them in powers of z, as I did before, you recover into such multiples, kind of much less basic curves. Same thing that I had before. Okay, and now I have only five more minutes. So, what I will do now is maybe tell you a little bit about how this magic formula is related to three. So, how basically from any of those you can reconstruct differential constraints that are in every structure. Because to me, this is really the meaning of this formula. This is for. meaning of this formula. This has been going for many years and it's always the same thing when you give a talk about that, it just cuts out of no formula that comes out of nowhere and the one you need. Those why this is interesting, but it turns out that this is just a very simple case or very explicit case of differential constraints of a special form. And the idea is the following. So what you can prove, if you take your spectral curve, so let me use dots to denote these spectral curves. To denote these special points, which are the ramification points. These omega GNs, what the polyscope encryption does is just construct them locally by doing analysis and neighborhoods of these parts. What you can do, and that's basically a fairly complicated calculation, but what you can prove is that if you expand these omega g n's and basis of one forms, that so let's just pick one of these points. So I have one point here, I can define a basis of one form. I can define a basis of one form. So, yeah, one thing I didn't mention, these omega g n's only have poles of each variable as the grammar point. That's something that's easy to show from the formula. So, you can expand them locally at the basis of one form with poles at the point. So, for example, if you have one such things, you could expand it in the form like this. You have to do some integers, k, one, k and here, you have some coefficient, then you have a basis of differential forms. Of differential forms of a sign here. So, roughly speaking, these would be one forms that have a pole of order k1 plus 1 or something like that at this particular point here, locally. But that's a well-defined basis that you can construct explicitly, and that defines uniquely these coefficients at each, near each of these. Near each of these ramification points. And what you can show is that these coefficients are precisely coefficients of a partition function z. That is a solution of an error structure in a very special kind. In this particular case, where you have only simple gramification, what you will do is just have a copy of ERIZO constraints for each of those complicated ones. They're all representations of ERISO, but fairly complicated ones. But you can construct all of those explicitly for. But you can construct all of those explicitly from the plane of the spectrum curve. And if you take all of those, you can show these are an area structured. Unique solution z and the coefficient of that solution are precisely the same as the coefficient of the expansion of the defined structures. So in other words, in the context of simple ramification, to Paul's co-equation is just a way of encoding a very complicated set of the Azore constructs. That's what you can put it. But these are complicated. They're all like complicated. They're not like simple like a Like complicated, they're not like simple, like a waiting task. They're much more complicated. And you have a copy of the arizable for each ramification. And if you allow higher ramifications, so more than two sheets that meet, all you do is you replace the arizable by particle type of W algebras, WGR, R for each of those, where R is the ramification of order by each of these points. And again, you can show that these are very structures. So in other words, topological recursion in a general set is. Polychocol recursion in general set is general sense. It's just a way of encapsulating the constraints that take the formula structure. So again, very complicated. Is that cool? I think that's cool. So anyway, so this is fairly recent, but that was the motivation also of Konsevich and Subleman for coming up with very structure, was to make sense of this form. And that's one way of making sense of it as differential constraints. Of course, it's also much more Japanese crowd. There's many, many examples of very structures that do not come along. That do that come. Well, from cursion, in fact, you can construct A structures for all nice W algebras, not just WTLR, WV6, V7, WSL2N, or whatever. So all of those don't have a possible recursion map. But you can construct data structures. Okay, so I was going to say a little bit about this, but I think I don't have time and it's already quite late, so maybe I would not say everything, but let me just say But let me just say that what I wrote earlier on the board. Actually, let me just say one word about this relation here, because it relates to something that we learned yesterday. So this general statement, if you remember in the context of Witten's conjecture, the statement here is that if you construct a wave function psi, which is something constructed from negative n, right, you just basically take exponential of the sum of the n. Take exponential of the sum of the integral of the g n's. Then the statement was that this was killed by every differential equation. The general conjecture here is that there exists okay, so I should say something. So that applies in the case where, I mean, it applies in more cases, but then you just do only this. If your Riemann surface was compact, then you can introduce a function y. You can introduce a function y for your one form. And then you can think of your branch covering as well as a meromorphic function. And then you have two meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface, x and y, so they satisfy a pre-normal equation. So in this context, you can also think of the spectral curve as being a polynomial, like the y square minus x example that I had before. The definition I presented was more general than that, but in the case of Cohen's spectral curve, you have a polynomial equation. Equation. And then the statement here is that there exists a quantization. So that's what we call a quantum curve. We had such that it kills the wave function. So quantization here, I could define more precisely what we mean, but the simplest case would be when we have a force. So you take h, you take y, h dx and x. Can be more general. You can have h plus. Can be more general, you can have H1 corrections and so on. But the statement is that there exists a quantum curve here that kills psi. Of course, this is not uniquely defined as well, you have choices of ordering and so on. But the question is that there exists such a thing that kills this wave function for all spectral curves. Give me any spectral curve. I mean, that wouldn't be a conjecture. Give me any spectral curve, apply it to positive recursion, or find VFTNs using any structure, construct a wave function, and there should exist such a causation. Exhaust such a transaction. Now, I'm achieving a little bit here. So, this is for genus zero spectral curve, for hygiene spectral curve. Statement is the same, but psi has to be modified. You have to use trans series. They can unburned it to them in some fancy way, but it's just pretty much the same statement once we define psi accordingly. Okay, and this is interesting for many reasons. First, because it's a fun statement, but also because it connects to a lot of other conjectures. Because it connects to a lot of other conjectures. For example, I did not mention that at all, but one application of this is to knot theory. So it's conjectured that you can use quantitative recursion to construct the Jones environment of knots, where you take a spectrocurved paper enomule, and in its front-ex, this would be nothing else but the AJ conjecture. So that's just a kind of generalization of the AJ conjecture. It's a much broader set. But that's very conjectural. I mean, it's not proved. It's like this would be the AJ conjecture. So, like, this would be the HG conjecture, and you can generalize it in many other contexts. You can think of it, and depending on the context, it can relate to other types of conjectures. But, yeah, and this has been proved for a large class of genus zero spectral curve, and also for all hydrogen spectral curve with simple ramification, but not yet for all spectral curves. It's still conjectural in general. Okay, and then everything else here is conjectural, so I'm going to stop here. So, for example, are these solutions here? Are these solutions here asymptotic solutions of these quantum curves? Let's assume that this exists. Are these asymptotic in general? So are these or hell resolvable as far as I'm doing? No, this is not known in general. So we don't know. So if we can use these asymptotic solutions to reconstruct exact solutions from these factorial equations, that's not known in general. Relation with cluster algebra, of course, is not known. Whether said is a tau function in general is not known. And what is the inverted geometric interpretation? And what is the inverted geometric interpretation? As I said, there's lots of examples that I know, but it's not all on this beautiful bell. So, thank you very much. You you well, you compress F's in order that you have Q's in. Well that you have cues sorry so what's the relation? Yeah, so it's just a different way of encoding the same thing. So I wrote an exponential of something like this, I think, with Q's and then I also wrote exponential of So all you have to do is just write down these are polynomials, extend them, and then just read the text and write this. Other questions? Yes. What does that mean? What is that? Oh, it's super fun. No, I mean, the idea is that if you, this is just a pertimator solution in H-bar, but when you work with hyogeneous, I don't know how to explain it. Okay, an easy way of explaining it. If you're working with hyogenous, of course, how your spectral curve is hyogeneous, you have modular transformation, you have A and B cycles and so on, and you can have multiple transformations of your spectral curve, and you want this to be modular variant. This would induce a way. Modular environment. This wouldn't be. So, what you have to do is kind of introduce some sort of theta functions or some things that you multiply with that make it modular. And that is basically what your wave function turns out to be a trend series, which is a series that also has not only a series and age model, but also turns out an exponential of one-way age model. Again, maybe someone else will be a little bit concerned. But maybe tomorrow I will talk about heat. About 80 markets. But you will talk about this here, that's right. So we'll hear everything about this tomorrow. And sometimes I don't exactly know in which situations the spectral curve is and some And Stan, I do understand this topological recursion that you're talking about, the generalization of the unusual mirror symmetry, which says genus zero chromogen invariants are computed on the mirror by taking intake for solar periods. Try and calculate genus higher genus chromogen invariants of items by taking intake lower periods, but over these I pop out this current. I popped up about this curve, but sometimes people talk about not the the non-compact curve and this kind of hierogenous. I don't know, in my mind it's like a hierogenous one-person. Yeah, no, it is. So I didn't talk about merisymetry, but the relation between this and this is, you can think of it as merrimentary, that would be the A model, and this would be the B model. And the very case where it's very explicit is if you take. It is if you take your inverted geometry here to be Goverton theory of Caravanyu threefold, so very simple and non-compact toy-keraviel threefold, study Goverton theory here, and it is proved that the B model, you can construct the Cadavio threefold and is mirror, and in fact the geometry reduces to a curve, which is you take a spectral curve, and if you apply topological recursion, you construct a D-model. So that's a very explicit example of mirror symmetry that would be. Were conjectured in 2007, but was proved by Instant Liu and others in 2014. So, yeah, so that's one example of this whole framework is to coordinate with Tori Kaladi 34, but you can also do it for verse numbers and so on. So, you can always think of that as kind of the A model, and this is B model and so on. So, that's you can think of that as Mirror signature as well. But I don't I don't know if that's what you were referring to. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know there's also maybe a lot of maybe millions more than seven directions. Like people talk about these cycles on your spectral curve ending up on agency frames and targets. So having to do with uh physical connections. Physical collisions. Yeah, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah, we can talk more about this if you want. Yeah. I don't know what the connection is with the cluster algebra that you started with. That's something you can explain to me. Yeah, like for some colloidial treefalls, maybe pure colloquial. Sometimes it's related to like the title functions appear. The theta functions appear. I'll be happy to discuss that. I'm definitely not an expert on that. Cool. Thank you. I think you know this one. Nobody's one. Are you excited? Again, some of them coming from the single sample. Yeah, it's like a female computer model. Yeah, exactly. So example. So example. So they have some kind of idea what to do something about and then I mean but very robust very much the same.  If you want to get those several screens with you, let us know. If you're in one of these, I'm excited to make it here. I don't really like it.  It is good weather but not too hot. Not too hot because in July it can challenge.
