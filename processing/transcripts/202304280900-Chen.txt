Okay, maybe we can start. So today our first speaker is Eric Sanford, UC Berkeley. He will talk about the existence of expanding rich solvents as a part two comes of non-natural nature. Thanks very much. Okay, so my title, as Huofeng said, is existence of expanding Richie solitons of a certain kind. So these are non-compact solitons which are asymptotic to cones with non-negative skeleton curvature. So a special case would be, say, to the flat cones. So something asymptotic to the flat, in which case you just have just the Gaussian standard. But I would first like to explain to you why we might be interested in the existence of these. Interested in the existence of these particular kinds of expanders, and then discuss with you some of our results and then some of the ideas behind the results. So maybe let's just start by recalling reaching flow. So the reaching flow of an animal is given by some time index family of smooth metrics, maybe uncompact or not compact, which satisfies the theory that you're probably familiar with. That you're probably familiar with. So the metric falls by minus 2 times reaching curvature. And this exists, say, on some possibly finite maximal time interval. Let's say you're starting from some manifold with nice perfection, unhappy manifold. Okay. And so maybe let's start from dimension two and quote some things that happen in dimension two. Some things that happen in dimension two. So, dimension two, in the compact case, if you run the flow, and you may have to say a sphere which shrinks to the point, but this is basically the only bad behavior that could happen. And so if you suitably re-normalize to fix the volume of your compact metaphor, and you never run into any singularities along the flow of the metric two, and you always have convergence to a metric of constant sectional curvature. So the normalized flow always converges. And in fact, that gives us another proof, I guess, a long time after the original proof of the uniformization theorem. So initially, work of Hamilton and Chow assumed uniformization, but later work of Chengdu and Ken were able to prove this convergence result. And so basically give a preaching for the proof of uniformization without assuming. Uniformization without assuming that result. Okay, so we don't really see any non-trivial singularities like round the flow on a compact two-dimensional, real two-dimensional manifold. So let's now get three dimensions. So in three dimensions, we do start to see non-trivial singularities. And so it's important. And so it's important in order to study the Ricci flow starting in three dimensions entirely to understand what sorts of singularities we see. So let me recall some examples of singularities we might see. So here, going upwards, it's going to be as we move forward in time. So one example, lightning dimension two, we might just have sphere S3, round S3, shrink to a point based on finite time. So this is one kind of singularity. We already encountered this one. You can just rescale. One you can just rescale, you'll just see the sphere all the way. Another one is this sort of object known as a neck pinch. So here on the neck you have a cross-sectional S2. And so if the pinching is severe enough, then you may encounter a neck pinch singularity in some planet time. That's the positive curvature of the neck as two shrinks down to a point. And so this is done rigorously. Point. And so this is done rigorously by I'm going to not self-rotationally symmetric solution that has this behavior. And then there's another degenerate case where maybe one side of your dumbbell is kind of a little bit small. You still have this neck that's shrinking down. So again, you have a cross-sectional S2. This is three manifold. And so as this part of the neck shrinks down, you also have that this smaller side of the dumbbell is also rushing. Side of the dumbbell is also rushing in very quickly at kind of the matched rate that gives you a very special kind of singularity at this point. Okay, and so to study these singularities, what one often does is take a parabolic blow-up. So you sort of zoom in in a way that's compatible with the parabolic nature of the region flow equation. And that allows you to kind of study, well, what does your flow look like? Well, what does your flow look like when you approach these singular times and these points where the curvature tensor is blowing up? So, after parabolically scaling, we obtain some singularity models that describe what's happening near these regions of high curvature, these singular times. And so, for example, in these three pictures that I drew, well, the first singularity model is just a shrinking sphere. Second one is going to be cylinder. So here, this is going to be an S2 cross R. And in the final sort of degenerate case, this is what's known as a Bryant soliton. It's a steady HE soliton. And so this gives a pretty good picture of what happens in 3D. So in fact, in three dimensions, Dimensions. So again, this is in three dimensions. So the singularity models that one encounters when one starts a compact rigsheak flow and runs the flow are going to be either S3 or its quotients, some quotient of S2 cross R, or this soliton here, right soliton. And so from this understanding, that gives us Understanding that gives us quite a nice idea of how contact-reaching photos behave and allows us to deal a bit with their singularity behavior. So, this is, of course, due to Prelimin. And in this last case, where this steady soliton that one sees is identified as a bright soliton, this is due to later work by Brenbaugh. But in any case, understanding the singularities that we see in the three-dimensional case. Dimensional case allows us to then do surgery and then leads to this work on geometry, the proof of geometrization by understanding of singularities. So before I talk about, so this talk is mostly going to be existence in dimension four. So before I start to talk a little more about dimension four, let me just remark that a lot of singularity models, so this here is a studies. This here is a study soliton. But these two are shrinking solitons, and shrinking solitons play an important role in studying in the singularity behavior of retrieval flows. So in the sense that many singularity models are radiant shrinking solitons. Which for now and I'll just denote by GSS. So these are a special case of the quasi-Einstein equation that we've seen before as our expanders. But let me write down what these are. So these are self-similar solutions of the flow. You have a Riemannian metric which satisfies the equation V G plus, let's say, one half of the V derivative of G. g x minus one half g equals zero, right? So special case if x is equal to zero, then you just have a positively curved Einstein manifold for region positive. And in the case gradient, this just means that your vector field is gradient of some potential function. And so this corresponds with the dynamical picture that if you have a manifold Have a manifold satisfying this equation, then you get a corresponding Rigi flow, a soliton, which evolves basically by scaling and 50 more percent pullback. So for T less than zero, ancient flow, you have the corresponding VG flow, GT is equal to some scaling factor times some distorphism pullback of the original G. And this is some flow associated with your vector field. Okay, it's a self-similar solution, and these often model the flow. So, in what sense? I'll say a little bit more, but one result about 10 years ago was out of Endersmueller and Topping, which tells us that if you have a type 1 singularity, So type one means that kind of the curvature doesn't blow up very fast relative to t is sort of like one over t or maybe, yeah, approximately like one over t. In this case, then all such singularities, you take any blow up sequence, you get a gradient-shrinking soliton. So, right, so really gradient-shrinking solitons are a very important class of singularity matters. C's only reaching flow index. C's not the retreat flow in any dimension. Okay, so now let me turn to say a bit more about things we see in the dimension four case that we would have to understand if we would want to deal with any singularities we see along the ball. So, one particular kind of singularity you might see in dimension four is, are these asymptotically conical? I should probably write this out the first time. So, ACs are asymptotically conical. As singularity models. So one early example was that of FIK, FIK shrinker, Feldman, Feldman, and Knot. So this is an asymptotically conical shrinker. It's also Kaler. And Maximo later showed that in fact this is a non-compact shrinker, but you do indeed see this as a singularity model for compact B2 flow. Or compactly to flow. Some other examples. So Appleton constructed some examples about maybe four or five years ago. So this is on a non-compact Vigi flow, but sort of suggests, again, some models you might see. And so you might see, for example, Iguchi-Hansen or say quotient C2, possibly Lacon. There are also some others which I won't mention here, which potentially may show up, although it's not clear. But again, the point is that you may see some, from these examples, you may see some passenger chronicle gradient triggers as models in the flow of dimension four. And this is kind of new and something you wouldn't see in dimension three. And then finally, recent work actually shows you that if you take any asymptotically conical Conical freedom training soliton, so non-compact solvent, it does in fact appear as the singularity model for some compact region flow. So, given such a finger, Stilarsky is able to construct a compact region flow that sees this as a singularity model. So, this is a recent work of it. Alright, and then Iguchi Hansen, is it the shrink? Iguchi Hansen is really flat. Uh Iguchi Hansen is Richie flat, so I think it's a rich but similar to yeah. So it's not a so it's similar. So yeah, these these are type 2 singularity. It's not achieving, so not all singularity. A large group of them, a large class of them are corrected. And also some kind of generalizational provides. Yeah, maybe not necessarily as rich tools. Right, so well. Right, so um well so it's possible that in this particular one work I did as the UI soliton and quotient lines and two, I think there is either data RP3 brush R, you may see those. And so from numerics, I think it seemed like you will, but I think not so clear. It's got a bright up source, it's not just a few it's a treasure case, yeah, not saving on for patients. Right, right, yeah, um, right, so let me. Right, so let me mention maybe one more kind of one more work that suggests that asymptotic conical fingers and dealing with them is something important that we need to consider. So again, as I mentioned before, so Richard has some recent, very nice compactness results where metric flow and results about metric flow and so on. And so one particular consequence of his work is that if you're in a metric, Now if you're in dimension four, growing your compact low until you reach some finite time singularity, then either at your singular time capital T, so either this rescaling converges to some smooth, compact, great and shrinking soliton, or some blow-up, because this is a little different from Anderson topping any plus because some blow-up will converge. Some block will converge to one of the following three things. So either S3, motion of S3 gamma across R, or S2 across R2, or in the last case, a cone, the infinity, so conical metric, VR squared plus R squared H with non-negative scalar curvature. Curvature. And in this last case, this actually tells you a bit about the topology of the link. So H is going to have positive scalar curvature, and so this means that the link is going to be diffeomorphic to some connected sums of quotients of S3 together with some additional connected zones of S2 process. Some S2 process. So we have some idea of sort of what sorts of cones one might see in this case. Yeah, so here the assumption for this theorem is definitely just compact manifolds in four-dimensional derivative flow. Yeah. Yeah. So the bit of a tricky part is that you're taking some blow-up, so in particular, you might take some blow-up that kind of prevents you from seeing, say, the Brian soliton taking it on some. Take it on some sequence that moves away from the tip level, and then you see a slowing group. So, it's sort of a rough description, but gives you some idea of what happens. Okay, so let's take a look at those all of this in the blog as well. So, so this sun blob is doing a lot of work here. So, you're choosing a very special sequence. So, for example, what you're doing is with this tangent flow, you say you take the tangent flow and then you take some tangent flow at infinity of this flow. Some can flow at infinity of this flow. And then you have some special effects. It's a very special curve. So certainly one does see a bright soliton, it's not in this list. So that would come from doing this a lot of the lights. Okay, so right, so from this discussion, I wanted to show that these sort of Show that these sort of asymptotic conical grade shrinkers come up when we want to study singularities of the flow in dimensions four and higher, but let's focus on dimension four in this talk. And so let me now explain how expanders come into the picture. So, well, you may run your flow, you may see something asked in terms of the conical, and the question is: well, Clinical, then the question is: well, if you would like to try to do some kind of retro with surgery, then you would definitely need to understand how to fix these issues with running into a cone. So how you might be able to continue the flow. Okay, so let me draw another picture here. Here is T again, moving forwards in time. Again, moving forwards in time. So, here, let's suppose you have some singularity of your flow, which is sort of modeled on conical shrinker. It's converging to the cone as he moves forwards in time. And so one thing you might do is you might try to do a kind of surgery where you cut off near the region where you're becoming conical and paste in instead. Instead, a expanding soliton asymptotic to the same cone. So this is what you might try to do. Try to cut and glue in an expander asymptotically phonical to the same tone that we started out with. And so, from Richard's work, we have an idea of who kind of And so, for Richard's work, we have an idea of the kind of phones that we should probably target here. So, here, this is maybe some shrinker that's not some type of conical. And so, then you'd hope that you might be able to continue to flow. So, for example, with FIKs, and there are some, right, so FIKs, you actually do have a corresponding family of expanders. So, your shrinker flows into a cone, and then you have an expander that comes out of the cone. And so, you might similarly hope that this. So, you might similarly hope that this sort of picture would allow you to, well, okay. So, why would you want to glue in an expander rather than just something else? Well, if you try to glue in something else, you may not have as good control of the entropy. But if you have an expander coming out of the cone, then you have comparison of the entropy of your expander versus the entropy of your cone. And so, this sort of procedure might allow you to keep some control of the entropy when you do this process, and that might help. And that might help you in preventing these little snakes and lurids accumulating and doing this sort of thing. Right, so in the case that we have positive Riemannian curvature, a number of these things have been carried out. So in the case of positive curvature, so cones of positive curvature, we do indeed have existence of asymptotically conical standards. Conical expanders. Right, okay, so expanders, asymptotically conical, it's very similar to the definition of asymptotically flat, but just cut off some compact region. It should be approximately like GMA. So we'll write down the full definition. So existence of asymptotically conical expanders with positive curvature, so in particular their link is going to be quotient of S3, so this is going to be done. And you also have the uniqueness of these expanders as well. And so this is due to work of Simon Schulze and also later Derruel, who did the uniqueness and gave a better convergence as time goes to zero to the asymptotic cone. So, in order, if you wanted to carry out this sort of idea, you would need to know about the existence of expanders asymptotic to the same cone. And so, this result will tell you at least if you have a positively curved cone, then you can do so. Okay, and so the gluing procedure has also been done in this case. So, essentially, like this picture here, so if you have some comical singularities, you can glue in and expand or continue the flow. And this is done by Genodus Schultz. Do you notice Schultz? And this is where it's isolated from the singularities, which is what we'll see in the dimension 4 case. So let me now state some of our results, the drawing existence of the standards. Okay, and so the result is that if you have a cone With non-negative scalar curvature, again on R4 or quotient of R4, then, so smooth metric away from the point, then there exists an asymptotically, an expander asymptotically productive metric. All right, and so let me now try to And so let me now try to discuss some of the ideas that underlie this and kind of the degree theory part, where this comes from. So the first thing that one might try to do when looking for expanders, it might take a known expander form, some nearby one. So sorry, quickly remind us, I guess, in something really bigger zero, I mean the link must have section coverage of bigger equal than one, I guess, or yes, bigger than zero. Yes, bigger than some positive constant. And TLC will be. It should have positive scalar. There's some figured number, but you don't have to work that way. That's probably right, yeah. I can't try to assign that. Sorry, yes. You say it's R4 by Gamma, but it leads to us via sphere, right? Right, so it's just this is a group action on. Okay, so it's just this is a group action on S3. Sorry, S3 or code S3? Yeah, correcting S3. What is the code topology of the link? The topology of this. Right, so that's a good question. So it will just be the topology of the expander is this. So it's the same as the expansion. Yeah. Yeah, so I'll talk about the set of a little bit. Yeah, so I'll talk about the set of them a little bit later and the setting in which we try to find these things. Other questions? Okay, so kind of maybe one initial idea when trying to find expanders is you take a known expander, which is the Gaussian expander, or maybe some expander like those that we already know about, and you try to deform a known reading expander. So manifold M, metric G. M metric G vector field gradient F to some nearby other expander M G prime gradient F prime. And so how one might do this, one way is the following. So you might consider the following equation based at your known expander with respect to some other retro G tri. So this is just, it looks very similar to the expanding soliton equation. To the expanding soliton equation. So minus 2 Vg of G prime minus G prime minus lead derivative respect to the original reading vector field, G prime. Okay, so maybe this is an initial starting point. You might naively hope, well, maybe you can deform G prime and alpha F will still serve as a vector field. This doesn't quite work, but one can make the modification to make this work, make this a strictly elliptic equation. Make this a strictly elliptic equation, similar to this perfect direction of short existence. And so, a good term to add here is another lead derivative where here your vector field is going to be the Arcke operator applied to G prime. So divergence G prime minus one half trace with respect to G, G prime, and this applied to G. So this will turn out to be spin predictive. And then what you'd be doing is you'd be trying to solve for a metric G prime and a vector field, nabla f minus this quantity here. And hopefully that would give you some expanding solvent. Solvent. G fran. Sorry, I'm not. Didn't pay attention. So the expanders are smooth or they have orbit voltage. They may have orbital tips. They have orbit volts in here. They may have orbit voltagular. Also, in the real biggest zero case? Or are these guys smooth? So I think they talked about the smooth situation in R4, but in the situation we consider where we allow isolated orbital singularities. So this is if you take a quotient. So for example, if you're on R4 quotient something, then the corresponding standard is just a Gaussian expander quotient something. You have an overflow, so you already have a key. Yeah, that's kind of if your matching is kind of variable to sub-discrete or some discrete, then which is all that you get. It's also a variable sub-atjewr, so it's the image. Let's see, so is this it's kind of I mean it's kind of popular. Right, right, right, maybe it's not like yeah. Okay, so you solve for G and this corresponding E prime, so maybe I won't write it again, so that's just going to be, well, the part you need in order to get the expanding soliton equations. So this part right here. And of course then you'd have to answer some questions later about whether your new vector field is a gradient vector field. New vector field is a gradient vector field, and so on. So, I'm not sure how to talk about it, I'll say that at the end. But this is kind of your expander nearby is written in a particular form, V' written in equic form. This involves some kind of gauging which follows the Turk gauge. And so there's another gauge that will come later, so one has to compare the two. Maybe more on that a little later. Maybe more of that a little later. Alright, so maybe I'll write down the linearization of this. Say a bit about that. Oh, quick stop question. So you said that this still has a comp, but I thought you want to get rid of the simulator. Right. So I think you want something that you can flow past. So if you do a, say, Reachiflow and orbital, then I think you can continue the flow. So if it is good in the flow. Right. Well, yeah, or maybe actually. Well, well, yeah, or maybe, I guess, I'm not sure if one can do better, but it's at least a little better than the cone point where you're not sure how you can. So, the linearization of this, so linearize PQG F G. FG applied to H, and what you get is the following elliptic operator. So the Gaussian times this first order term plus two times a contraction of the Riemannian curvature tensor with your two tensor deformation direction h. So this is some kind of a weighted narrow woods operator, which we call LF. So in the case when Niemonian curvature is positive, Monium curvature is positive, then in fact, LF is invertible, and this plays an important role in Darwell's analysis. Invertible on the appropriate weighted spaces, and so it allows you to apply some kind of inverse function theorem to really say that given some particular expander, such as user de Gaussian or something that's constructed by Brian on rotational symmetric cones, you can indeed deform in all cone directions there. Cone directions near R. So in this case, it's positive curvature. Now, when your scalar curvature is non-negative, you may have that a kernel appears. So LF may have a kernel. And so you can't really do the same analysis in this case. Right, and so well, what one might try instead is this approach you took using a degree theory. degree theory. Okay, so let me now kind of describe the setup here. So I'm going to do it maybe first by analogy in some other setting that it was used and then describe our setup. So first setup in a related situation which we used some, right, so which we looked at and kind of helped us in our setup. So this is a study of the plateau problem. Plateau problem. So minimal embeddings of some manifold into Rn. So in this setup you have some manifold, compact manifold with non-empty boundary. And so for example, maybe a disk. And you might ask about, well, what is the space? So you're looking for stationary versions of this into RA. So here's a moduli space, and one asks, Anyone asks for stationary inversions? Not some equivalence relation, which basically says if f and g are doing the same thing on the boundary, then you want to consider them the same. So in the sense that f is equal to if f, so f is equivalent to g if f is equal to g composed of u, where u is map. Where U is a map from M to M that fixes the boundary modulus space, and then you have a projection, natural projection, down to your inversions restricted to the boundaries. So the maps F restricted to boundaries. And then the statement of these kinds of results, I should say, who did these sorts of things. So Tromba and also. And also Brian White and some other works as well. And so the results that one gets in this case is that you have a degree theory. This moduli space script M has a local smooth Banach manifold structure. And you get that. And then this map pi is proper and has a well-defined And has a well-defined integer degree, z2 and integer degrees. Okay, so this is quite similar to the setup that we use. So I'm now going to describe our setup. Again, we're going to have a space in which we're not finding a stationary motion. We're going to try to find an expander on a space. We have a moduli space of the expanders and then a projection down to the cones to which they are asymptotic and try to use a similar idea. The projection is, I guess, sort of, right. You're sort of taking some boundary data. But yeah. Okay, so now back to our setup and the asymptotic space standard space. Okay, so I may need to take maybe I won't be able to fit it on just one half of the board, but so we are going to be looking for expanders on some four manifold or orbifold with isolated singularities. And this is our theta that corresponds with this m partial x. So this is going to be our space, m4, our boundary, m3, and then we Our boundary, N3, and then we have this sort of color neighborhood near N3, just sort of part of the infinity, which we want to sort of fix in a particular way with respect to this iota, which maps from, well, cylinder into setup. So, space, which we're trying to find our expanders, then some boundary data, which in our case. Then some boundary theta, which in our case we use this map iota for. Okay, so we have some assumptions here. So for example, m mod the image of iota should be compact. We're only considering the case when n has a pink one topology, so n admits a positive scalar curvature metric, so it's in that some kind of connection sum like I wrote earlier. So n admits scalar curvature. Scalar curvature. And then we also have some assumption on M. So M again is an orbital with isolated singularities. It has a smooth universal cover. And there are some topological assumptions on the universal cover, which are important for getting some compactness results that we will need. So yeah, two, sorry, this is zero. H2, sorry, this is 0, and this is torsion 3. Okay, so this is our setup, which corresponds to this section right here. Now for the moduli space, so our moduli space, let's call it m grad r greater than 0, is going to be some moduli space of expanding Vici solitons on this particular mandible orbifold. So like triples, G. G and the f gamma. So these are going to be expanders. Asymptotically conical, some cone gamma, which we keep as part of the data. So asymptotically conical to gamma equals dr squared plus r squared h of, so these are all of r and then And then, oh, right, and then we also want some compatibility of our gradient field with this map iota. So, one has some results on how the potential of such a standard would look like. And so it's possible to sort of gauge at affinity in this way that you pull back your gradient vector field onto the cylinder, it actually looks, takes the spawning part. So, this is another gauge that we have to work with in defining. That we have to work with in defining the moduli space, which both data generally. Okay, right, so this is our space. I'm going to do a look at some diffimorphisms. So, diffimorphisms that essentially fix the boundaries. So, these are, so you should pull back your metrics. So, let's say that. Metrics. So let's say that P1 and P2 are in this space. P1 is equivalent to P2. If you pull back your metrics, Heisen diffimorphism. And your two cones are the same, so that's a relation. So that's like this side here, so instead of stationary versions, we're looking for standards. And then we have the natural projection down to the cones. If M4 is smooth, M hat is simply connected. If M4 is smooth, then. Is universal cover and hat or C so M4 is cool. I make my question. I'm a little possible. H1 is... I would absorb H1 would be possible. Zero automatically, but maybe this is orbital power. Yeah, sorry, I'm not sure. So these are. Yeah, I didn't think too much about this special setting, but yeah. I think the one that wanted Z coefficient. Yeah, but I mean what I'm doing for this one. Why is it simply connected? I thought it was a cover. Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, yes. But, oh, so maybe it's smooth. Then yes, yes. Yeah. So, but it's actually, yeah, it's the orbit for it. And then maybe simply connect this property. So, right, and so that one has the natural projection down to the space, let's say of conical metrics, okay, maybe with non-negative scalar curvature on n. And then, so the theorem, the degree theory result that we're having is that, well, let me put some quotations around it. I have to fix some of this setup. So, there's this kind of cartoon setup. This setup. So, this is kind of a cartoon setup here. But the setup is that this projection pie from this modularized basic gradient expanders down to cone is proper and has a well-defined Z degree. And so then, corollary is that if you can, if you somehow know That this expander degree of some given manifold, such as R4, is non-zero, then your map pi is this moment projective. And so in particular, in the case when you're working with m4 is equal to the disk or R4, or some quotient of the disk. So in that case, then actually you do know the expander degree from some uniqueness results for the Gaussian expander and these positively curved expanders in that case. And so that's where this existence result that I stated earlier comes from, is from knowing that this degree in this case is blocked. Okay, so maybe some questions. Maybe some questions. So, some questions one might ask as: well, we have those cones whose links are some connected sums of these quotients of S3 RS in process ones. And so, if you wanted to get existence from this sort of degree theory, then you would want to understand, say, the expander degree of some connected sums of two manifolds, so connected in a way that includes the boundary. Connected in a way that includes the boundary, so that you get the correct connected sum of the cones, sorry, the links. And then also you might also want to know about, so we know about the degree of, say, cones over cos of S3, and then the other case would be cones or S2 process. So something like that. These are questions we don't know. So let me now sort of tell you what needs to be fixed about this and maybe it will be correct. And that's that we actually have to work with a slightly larger space. So we actually need to work with a slightly larger space, which I'll just call script M, not necessarily gradient. So these are going to be. So these are going to be expanders G V gamma asymptotically conical to these degree two homogeneous metrics, and they don't really look exactly like homes. So dr squared is r times some one form in a sense in dr, and here's a symmetric product. Again, wants the Puddletz relation projected down to The space of generalized cones on the map. And so, really, what we should say is that there's kind of an open neighborhood about the space then grab, which lives in here, on which this map is proper, and then you can get a corresponding degree here. So, really, you have to modify a little bit this picture. Right, and so let me maybe finish with drawing of smooth local structure of. Local structure of this moduli space. So, from analyzing that elliptic operator, the linearized elliptic operator, and using as a function theorem, so this is also used in these works by Brian Wyatt and Kamba. So you parameterize your nearby expanders by a space gen cone, so an infinite dimensional space, cross your finite dimensional space k, the kernel of your weight of the operator. Your weight of the operator. So, here you're doing your analysis based at some gradient expander. You have to do it based at a gradient expander. Or, well, we only know how to do it based at a gradient expander. You get a smooth structure. So this is going to be kind of inverse image of zero, right? So this is some equation corresponding to the equation you're trying to solve for the soliton. This is going to be a codimension k. Codimension K, so finite co-dimension on up submanifold, which is going to be tangent to your zero cross kernel direction at the base. And so, for instance, if you think about cone as kind of a small subset of gen cone, and you'll see this here, you may be able to form some nearby cones, but you also, so one thing I'll point out. And you also, so one thing I'll point out is you can also deform to many gen cones. So you get to make many expanders ask about how to do generalized cones, which may not be cones. But this is another kind of consequence of this structure. And these expanders of which encomes are actually cannot be gradients, so they're non-gradient expanders. Okay, right, so I think that's probably all I have time for. So, I think that's probably all I have time for, so I'll stop there. Thanks very much.
