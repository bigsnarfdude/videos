And this work, it is the joint work with my PhD supervisor Neil Bumforth. First, let me briefly introduce what is critical level. So I study waves and instabilities in shear flows. So based on the critical level is an important topic. So basically, if the basic flow has a shear like this, then if Like this, then if we study the waves propagating in such shear flows, then we can encounter singularities. For example, if we consider just a plane wave solution, a normal mode solution, then what we get is a Rayleigh's equation. And we look at this term, we see that one, if at some location where this basic flow velocity is the same as the phase velocity, then there is a similarity of the equation and we can show. Of the equation, and we can show that the velocity has a logarithm divergence. And this is the most Euro critical level. We call it the classical critical level. And there are other kinds of critical levels. It may be related to rotation, the density stratification, or the magnetic field. And today I'm going to talk about this one. And so in our paradigm, we don't want finite. We don't want finite time blow-up. So, our paradigm is that if we have a singularity, then it means the model is too idealized. So, we consider some more realistic effects, including viscosity and steadiness or non-linearity of the waves. And these effects are usually weak, but at a critical layer, it can resolve the singularity. And what happens is that in a strong happens is that in a strong, sorry, in a small region near the critical level, there are locally strong amplitudes. And then this small region is what we call the critical layer. And the important thing about the critical layer is that it is often where the vortices form. For example, this pattern is known as the Kelvin cas I. So Kelvin just overlap the linear disturbance. The linear disturbance to the basic shear flow, and he found that the streamline near the critical layer looks like this. So away from this region, the streamlines open lines, but in the critical layer, the streamlines become closed. So this is basically a vertex. And in experiments, it has also been found that in the critical layer, In the critical layer, vortices can form. For example, this is the experiment of SOP on the internal gravity waves critical layer. So we see gradually the amplitude of the wave will increase here. And here it looks like there's a roll-up. And so mathematically, it has also been theoretically studied about the Rossby wave critical layer. Critical layer. Still one, one, QRS, and Nightingale, they undertake a match asymptotic expansions in the critical layer. And the local equation is this equation. It is an equation for the local morticity. It's a simple equation, although it is not easy to solve analytically, but still you can do a lot of analysis to it. And this is what the streamline looks like. So gradually, So, gradually, again, the flow in the critical layer will roll up. And the vertex I'm going to talk about today is called the zombie vertex. So, in the title, I call it self-replicating vortices, but this is the name these people give. So, why it is called zombie vertex? Because they can replicate. So, what they did is that instructed by shear flow, they put some Instructed by shear flow, they put some vortices here, and these vortices will excite the critical layers. And the critical layers will roll up into vortices, and these new vortices will excite new critical layers. And this process will repeat until the entire domain is filled with these critical layers and vortices. And these critical layers are what we call the barcode critical layers. They happen when the horizontal. One, the horizontal, sorry, the basic flow has a horizontal shear. And also, there's a vertical density stratification. And it happens when this condition is satisfied. So it is the location where the difference between the basic flow and the wave space velocity matches this quantity. So this peak n is the buoyancy frequency, and this k is the horizontal v. This k is the horizontal wave number. So, this is a characteristic phase velocity of the internal gravity waves. And they call it zombie vortex because they can replicate by infecting others. So, I don't like this name, but anyway, this is what they call it. And this thing, as long as at least what they propose, it has an important potential application that is it. That is, they propose it can be the instability that drives the creation of the protoplanetary disk. So basically, this disk needs to become turbulent so that it can form the young star at the center. And so actually yesterday, Professor Zhou said MRI, the magneto-rotational instability is the instability. But some people say the gas is not sufficient. The gas is not sufficiently ionized. So, people also consider other instabilities. And this last one, some vertex instability, is what those people propose. But our work is theoretical study of the barretto critical layers and the zombie vertex. And we will undertake a match asymptotic expansions to study these critical layers and vortices. And so we will try. And so, we will try to obtain asymptotic solutions for the critical layer. And when it is not possible, we will try to build a reduced model. So, the benefit of this analysis that we can obtain the mechanism of the flow and it is also much easier to solve. We can obtain much higher resolutions. And this is our model. So we consider the basic flow has a horizontal shear. So the velocity is in X direction and it has a shear in Y direction in horizontal plane. And in the vertical direction, we have the density stratification and this peak N is voicing frequency. And we also add the effect of rotation. And we also add wave maker at y equals zero to excite the waves. Waves. And these are our Gauman equations. So we use the Businick approximation for the disturbances. So basically, Bousinik's approximation means that the basic density has a buoyancy frequency represented by this curly n. And the disturbance of density only affects the buoyancy, that is this term. And other terms are the same as the S equation. And initially, there's And initially, there's no flow, so everything is zero. And then from t equals zero, we turn on a forcing. It remains steady once it is turned on. And what it does is that it induces a jump of the horizontal velocity across y equals zero. And so the first thing we consider is weak. So initially, we have linear. So, initially, we have linear waves. And also, the false in steady. So, after a transient period, it will follow steady waves through the bulk of the domain. So, you see, it is time independent and it is periodic in X and Z. But in Y, because of the shear, we have to study its distribution. And then, if you substitute this expression into the Gamma equation and neglect all the nonlinear and the viscous terms, what we get is this second-order ODE. This second-order ODE in terms of pressure, and it is not difficult to solve. But the important thing is this term at y equals plus or minus this curly n, which is the scaled buoyancy frequency, the equation has a singularity. And we can show that the pressure itself remains finite at its critical level. So, sorry, these are the barrel critical levels. And we can show that. Levels. And we can show that the pressure itself remains finite, but other components, including the velocity and density, they all diverge here. And then what we do is we consider time dependence near the critical level or inside the critical layer. So we don't consider viscosity or nonlinearity at the beginning because at the beginning, the landscape of the critical layer is relatively large. So viscous effects is weak. Viscous effects is weak, and also the disturbances are small initially. So, we don't consider non-linearity, but finally, we will consider them. So, anyway, so here we consider time dependence. So, every term except the pressure now depends on the time. And then in the but the pressure is a constant in the critical layer. So, using this approximation near the critical layer, we write down the equation of the vertical momentum and density, and we get this solution. And we get this solution, this analytical solution in the critical layer. And what it tells us is that as time goes on, the amplitude of the wave become larger. That is, the amplitude increase linearly with time. And at the same time, because of this combination, the thickness of the critical layer will become smaller and smaller. So this means the waves will become more focused in the critical layer. Critical layer. And we can explain the mechanism of the growth. So, this part has the character phase velocity, that is the phase velocity of the internal gravity wave, that is basic flow plus or minus points of frequency. On the right-hand side, this phase velocity is just zero, it's time independent, and this is imposed by the external forcing. So, we see that when these two become the same, we can have. Two become the same, we can have some sort of resonance that makes this kind of growth. And that is the solution for density. And in this problem, we can use the conservation of the linearized potential vorticity. So basically, we can show that this quantity is just zero. And so this vorticity just grows similar to the density. So the vorticity has similar solution. And this is the plot of the vorticity. And this is the plot of the vautistic in the earlier stage. So you see that the amplitude grows stronger, but the critical layer will become thinner. And this is the linear critical layer. And what happens next is that the growing waves will false the growth of the mean flow. So now we consider these components. They have subsequent zero and actually they have no wave number in x direction. The wave number is zero, so it is mean flow. Zero, so it is mean flow, and we can write down its equation. So, basically, the mean flow is driven by the Reynolds stress, and we can substitute in the solution of the waves and find that the mean flow has this solution. And what it tells us is that it has smaller initial amplitude, but it grows faster. So, as time goes further on, what we see is that the pattern will become more and more homogeneous in the streamwise direction. Homogeneous in the streamwise direction. And another comment is that the harmonics remain weak in the critical layer. This is because the nature of the critical layer, it depends on the wave number. So other harmonics, they have different wave numbers. So they are not actually amplified here. Yeah. So at this stage, we compare our analytical solution to the full simulation. This is the full simulation of the student of Marcus. And we find Markers and we found that in the for the first picture, it is similar to what we found. But what happens next is that this pattern, this critical layer will roll up into a vertex, and then the vertex will become larger. So we need to consider what is going to happen next. And we have considered two possibilities. One is that this mean flow will become stronger and feedback, feedback to the Become stronger and feedback to the waves. So the wave becomes nonlinear. And we have actually wrote a paper for this problem. But it turns out that another effect is more important. That is this strong mean flow defect will become unstable. And we call it a secondary instability. So we wrote another paper on this topic. And this secondary instability is what is responsible for this. Is more responsible for this rollup. So we'll consider this. And so, as we said, the mean flow will change the basic flow profile. And the basic flow is a linear shear. So this thing is what the mean flow modification does. It will cause a defect of the mean flow in the critical layer. And this defect, you see, it is hardly visible. It is not strong. But what is important. What is important for the secondary instability is the mortistic gradient in the critical layer, that is the second-order derivative of this basic velocity with respect to y. And because this defect has very small length scale, and this thing can become much larger. And there are studies showing that when this quantity becomes at the other one, there is a local instability. Local instability. And we just use the solution of this mean flow growth to deduce that the voltistic gradient grows even faster. And we found at this time, that is order of amplitude to power minus one half, then the instability will happen. And then what we want to do is to build a reduced model taking advantage of this small length scale. So according to Scale. So according to the time scale we found, we can find the local length scale and then the amplitude of the mean flow modification and also for the density. And then at this stage, we study the effect of the dissipation, that is the viscosity and thermal dissipation. So basically, we consider these effects have the same order of magnitude as other terms. This gives their scale. And then, so, first, we consider So, first, we consider when the dissipation is present, how does the mean flow evolve? And we found an integral solution. So, basically, as we show that if there is no dissipation, then the mean flow will grow in the order of time square. And from this solution, we can show that when the thermal dissipation is present, the mean flow becomes grow slower. And when the viscosity is present, The discard state is present, the mean flow will become even grow even slower and it will spread out. But in this problem, the mean flow always grows. The dissipation at this order doesn't stop the growth of the mean flow. And then what we do is we study the secondary instability itself. So, first, we consider the solution outside this defect. We call it the outer solution. So, the outer solution. Solution. So the outer solution are what we call the quasi-steady waves. So this is the main part. It is waves. But now the phase velocity is this curly because this is the basic flow velocity at the defect. And so this big phi here, it evolves with a critical layer, with a slow time scale of the critical layer. And this is because it is driven the outer flow. The outer flow is driven by the critical layer, basically like this, and we can find a steady wave solution similar to the original waves. Yeah, and then in the critical layer, we do a local analysis. So it is a horizontal shear instability. So we can use a stream function to represent the major, the leading order dynamics. The stream function is a function of theta, which is the phase, and the rescaled y. And the rescued y and the slow time. And the leading order is independent of the local coordinate. This is because if you look at the outer solution, for example, like P, the P itself doesn't have a jump, but its gradient has. And this is the main equation. It is the equation of the motivity. So basically, it tells that the motivity. So basically, it tells that the morticity is affected by the linear shear by the non-linear convection, and this term, this basic flow, mortisity gradient, it is what causes the mean the instability and it is also affected by the viscosity. This is the main equation, mortisity equation. And the next equation is the matching condition that is basically tells you that the integral of the vorticity across the through the critical layer. Through the critical layer, it's responsible for the jump of the velocity. So, as we say, the jump, the gradient of pressure has a jump, and this is caused by the integral of the vorticity. And this is the reduced model we built. And then, so it is simple, so we can do more analysis to it. So, first, we can see the linear instability. We can neglect this nano term and obtain an analytical solution. And we can show that one. And we can show that one, we don't have this patient, that is basically this term is also zero. We can do a normal mode solution. We can find the growth rate. But the thing is, because the basic flow evolves, it is actually not a normal mode problem. So actually, this C is not constant. It depends on this time. So this is not a strictly valid solution. So and when there is no dissipation, we can actually find. Is no dissipation, we can actually find the actual time-dependent solution. So, the solution looks like this: because the mean flow keeps growing, the disturbance upon this basic state grows exponentially, but it grows to at the order of exponential of t to four-thirds. So it grows faster than a normal mode solution, and this is the actual. And this is the actual behavior of the secondary instability when there's no dissipation. And if we add a dissipation, what we obtain is an integral solution. It's our integral equation. And we can do some analysis to it, but now I only show the main results. What we found is that if we only have thermal dissipation, sorry, thermal diffusion, that is this lamp, sorry, this lamp. This lambda, then it only delays the instability. After some time, instability will always start to, the waves will always start to grow, similar to the non-decipitative case. But if we include viscosity, what happens is that this viscosity can really reduce the growth rate. And if it is strong enough, it can surprise the instability. Okay, yeah, and this is the linear instability. And this is the linear instability. And the next part, as we all know, when this linear instability becomes strong enough, we have to consider non-linear evolution. So we solve this reduced model to study the later, solve this model, solve this reduced model numerically to study the later nano evolution. So we use a numerical method of Chung and Nor. It is specially built for. It is specially built for, it is a semi-Lagrangian method, especially built for this kind of convection problem. And then, so first we consider initial condition just has one mode in the state direction, and this is the evolution of the voltage state. So, for the first three panels, we have already shown the result. And from the fourth panel, it is what happens. It is what happens when you have instability. So basically, you see there are waves growing. And then the wave becomes stronger. And so you see now at this point, there is a strong nonlinearity. And what happens next is that the waves will become even stronger and roll up into a vertex. And then because of viscosity, mainly viscosity, these pillows will gradually. Uh, these belows will gradually fade, and what is left is a final vertex accommodated by a shear layer. Yeah, and so actually, in today, a lot of people talk about blow-up. So, actually, we also found when this discovery is small, this thing can become very sharp. I'm not sure if that is blow-up. And because we are dealing with a very simple reduced model, we can approach. Simple reduced model, we can approach much lower viscosity and we can obtain much finer structure of the critical layer. So, in this case, when the viscosity becomes very small, we found that when the roll-up happens, we obtain this structure. The vertex roll-up into a very, very long below. There can be many loops in the middle. There is a vertex. And what happens next is that because when these long belows, That when these long billows become very thin, these billows can again become unstable. So they will roll up into even smaller vortices. And what we call it a tertiary instability. And these vortices will understrong some very turbulent behavior and finally they will be dissipated away. So the final structure is again this vertex accompanied by this shear layer. Yeah. And so, and for the last case, we consider what we call multiple mode excitation. So, we consider the distribution in theta is in the phase is the Gaussian distribution. So, it has many modes then initially. And what happens is that there are many vortices, different vortices forming on the critical layer. And then this critical layer, sorry, these vortices will revolve or rotate around each other. Revolve or rotate around each other. And then first, two vortices will merge into one vertex, and then the other will also merge into a vertex. And again, we have the same final structure. I talk to people intervalists, they call it an inverse cascade, but I'm not an expert in this. And finally, let's give a review and then explain the replication. So we have shown that this. Have shown that this standard wheel maker will cause a linear critical layers, and the critical layer will force the mean flow, and mean flow will roll up because of the secondary instability. And the important thing is when it rolls up and causes secondary instability, it has a new phase velocity, that is the basic velocity here, that is this curly, and it is different from the phase velocity of the faucine. And the consequence is that these. These secondary instability mortices will false new critical layers, like, for example, here. And this new critical layer will undergo the same process, that is, force the mean flow and then roll up because of secondary instability. And this explains the replication. So we just have explained this in a theoretical point of view. And then, yeah, that is the end of my research. That is the end of my research. And thank you. This is my supervisor.
