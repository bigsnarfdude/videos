Thank you very much to the organizers for allowing me to come and also thanks for allowing me to give a talk. I'm going to talk about perturbation, certain type of perturbation of later expansions and at the end also of linear relations. This is a joint work with Itinia Baraguarda from the University of the Basque Country in Spain. Country in Spain. Let's look at this problem. Well, this is just a finite dimensional work, a word for finite dimensional faces. If we have two matrices, when does there exist another matrix of boundary tramp such that A plus B is equivalent to B? Observe that different types of matrices, different allode perturbations, different equivalent relations. Include many different problems. So, a lot has been said about that problem. I've got here some references. Sometimes the perturbation is generic in the sense that it belongs to a dense subset of the good set of possible perturbations. Another time it's very possible. But another time it's very possible very great. So from the generic point of view, I brought here some references and Fredando Pippen put the borrower here and Christian Merl is attending the conference, the workshop from the distance. From arbitrary perturbations, God has been said also, the problem has been solved for polynomial matrices and unimodular equivalents, loopholes, for constant matrices and bounded and fixed. Matrices and bounded and fixed rank for patch of similarity, for pairs of matrices and figure equivalence relation, and for pencils, where in the last years we have been working on pencils. We have obtained several results. So we have solved the problem for regular penicillins, a bounded RAM and fixed RAM, and for a bit. Fixed rank and for arbitrary pensions when the perturbation has just ranked one. And I want to show you what is the solution for this case. And also I will talk about perturbation of linear relations, because this has allowed us to solve that problem. So the outline of my talk is let's talk about the rank one particular. Let's talk about the rank-built perturbation frequency, and then we introduce another bio characteristic, and then it allows us to obtain certain bounds, and finally we will talk about the inability. So, the problem is, when does there exist a random matrix such that A plus B is strictly equivalent to B? Observe that if we change A by any other strictly equivalent function, and also B. Messi and also B, then the problem remains. So there is a solution for this problem if I'm only there is a solution for the next problem. We could have stated it in this way. Find a main pencil strictly equivalent to this one, and another one strictly equivalent to this one, which I read is times one. So the round of the difference is one. And it allows us to pose the problem for linear relations. So given two linear relations, True linear relations, does they exist? Strictly equivalent linear relations says that, well, they are a distance one. This value is the maximum of the dimensions of those two sheets. Well, just to fix some notation, as we are working with the string equivalence relation, we need the fluored invariance, the changes in variant factors, so for example, collection. Factors of existence, collection of homogenous polynomials, and then two collections of integers, which are the column and minimal indices. But I have brought here a smaller sample. This pencil has a finite invariant factor, which appears here. Then it has two infinite elementary divisions of degrees two and one, and it appears here. And then three polymal indices, of success two, two, one, and zero, which are those ones. Zero, chart those ones, and finally one, the minimum index. These will represent the credit bargains in the future. Concerning tram-bum pencils, they can only be like that. Either they have one finite minimum factor, one infinite elementary diversion, or one quantum minimal index of minus one, or one row minimal index. Then around compensating. Then round one pensi obviously can be written as a product of two vectors and in this case one of the two has is a constant. Just this remark allowed us to turn the problem into the following one. Given our pensions, yeah, fine. But our pensions say that this one can be completed. This one can be completed up to the pencil A, well up to a pencil, which is strictly equivalent to A. And also, the same is subpensive, has to be completed up to B. And when we realized that, we were lucky because the pensive completion problem is already solved. Well, there are two possibilities: either which are completed by rows or which are completed by columns. In what follows, I will say that A21 can be completed at 2A. In fact, it can be completed at 2 Wednesday, strictly equivalent to A. From now on, the results are highly combinatorial. The slides are full of information. I think we'll try to convey some something. And first of all, I'm going to show you the solution to the fancy complexion problems. To the pencil completion problems. These solutions were obtained by Daniel Dodic and Markost years ago. They have been working a lot on the pencil completion problems. This is an easy case. And given two pencils, we are assuming that they have the same round, the artillery, the productivity variance, while the other one, the smaller, can be completed in the larger if and only if these conditions are satisfied. Conditional has that each value. This is related to the number of branch zero raw minimal indices. Here we have an interruptment between the materials invariant factors. The column minimal indices remain the same. And here we have a majorization. I'm not precise in it now. It is in the slides. If I have time I will show you it. But it says these values, the EUs, the device, have to have cert to satisfy certain. To satisfy certain requirements, certain inequalities. But in our problem, this condition is always satisfied, so it will want to be regular. If the two rounds have two punches have different rounds, then the conditions are similar, but we have the interplacement. These are the raw minimal indices which remain constant, and here is a measurization, but Measurization, but the role of the impacts of one pencil and the other one is not their changes. Right. If you go back to the completion, observe that we have to complete one pencil up to another one and this one, well, A to 1 up to A and A to 1 up to B. We have to join the two completions. And these pencils may have the same round or one. May have the same round or one less. So the result was highly combinatorial, but we managed to obtain the solution, and I'm going to show you the solution. Our problem has solution if and only we have to split it into several phases. If the minimal indices is not the same, that is reduced just to the interplacement, which means that only the regular part of the benchmark. Only the regular part of the pencil is put out. If these are different, so the colour of minimal indices are different, but these are equal, then we have interlacement and an inequality. It's very technical. It depends on all of the projections of the next case is summer, the last one is as worse. There is the interplacement, and then two measurizations and one inequality, but maybe they kind of. But maybe they can appear reversed in the reverse position in another inequality, and this can also cross-vote. And then when we obtained this result, we were really happy with it because it solves a problem and it solves a problem in a complete form. But then if someone says, Okay, what does it mean? If I give you a pencil, can you tell me how much can you move around the pencil per round one? Run the pencil paper RAM one and I said, okay, give me the variance where you want to arrive, and I'm going to check if they satisfy the conditions. And it seems reasonable to try to understand what those conditions mean. Then we learn about a paper by Levin, the two and collaborators. Just using group and shortline chains, they define certain options. Defined certain portions of spaces. First they introduced some portions on Wednesday. These are different. They were working with different questions in the paper quote. And then we define those questions, our situation. And then we call these dimensions W and call them generalized while characteristic of a penislip because we realized that there was one. Because we realize that those values have a the wide partition of the regular part, but we can see that the quantity partition of the column of minimalities is increased anymore. Thanks to the W, the W values characteristic, we managed to obtain bounce. We thought if we have a good solution, when we have a close solution, we should be able to obtain good bounce. And then in this line, we can see the frequencies. We can see the frequencies from the biocharistic of a popul and original pension. This result was already known, but I'm distinguishing different cases here regular, original pension regular, the singular, the opposite situation, the general situation, and the powers are all of them time. So I find in the in this in the sense that we can build a penis here where compensate where whatever I characteristic, one of the whatever characteristic can achieve it. Or if you cannot decide satisfying all of the bounds. Well the general case is split into many different cases, but all of these bounds can be achieved. So we were happy again. But it happens that let me show you an easy That let me show you an easier case. A depends on the first column minimal index of the perturbed pencil. So that's something within me. It seems that it's resolvable to try given a pencil, try to find a pound around it, such that after around one perturbation, you know where to go, depending on you, the properties of the pencil. Now we are studying that, we have made some progress with the Have made some progress with the gap idea yet. Well, this is solved. And now, concerning linear relations. Remember, a linear relation is a vector subspace with the partial product. And it happens the following. We have a pan C. You can find a linear relation associated to the pen C. But we can find the range representation, which is nothing but the colour space. Which is nothing but the colour space of this matrix, and the grammar representation, which is nothing but the grammar of this matrix. And also, given a linear relation, Kernand, Trunk, and Abrasors observed that we can find a pension such that the race representation is the relation or the current representation is the relation. We can move from pensions to linear relations. To linear relations. And this is satisfied. Even to pensions, if you find the representations, the pensions are strictly equivalent if and only if the linear relations are strictly equivalent and extend to the current representation. Remember the problem? Given two linear relations, find some others, strictly equivalent, at same. Strictly equivalent at say distance one. And if this is one, this was the maximum of these two portions. So it may happen that both dimensions are one. And these are equivalent. If both dimensions are one, we can find a pensin whose range representation is S, a pensin whose range representation is T, and another one whose range representation is the intersection. The range representation is the intersection in such a way that there exist vectors, but these densities can be completed. So the smaller one can be completed up to B and it can be also completed up to several decimal. And then we were happy again because we know that it's a publishing problem. And then, well, it can be also stated in terms of the parallel representation and And sorry, um Constantine introduced the vile characteristic of a linear relation. Here we have the vile characteristics of pencil and then the relations between the white characteristic of a pencil and that of the associated French representation is this one. So the white characteristic of the eigenvalues within the point of infinity are the same. Are the same. The one characteristic of the parallel minimal indices here the first one is lost, is lost with respect to the pencil, and here also the first one is lost. And if we work with the current representation, the first two coincide, and here two of them are not lost. Well, taking that into account, we managed to obtain the solution. In this case, well, I haven't measured. In this case, the dimensions are different. This is the easy case. The problem has solution if and only if you can follow track here of the solution. This reminds us the international that there are two measurizations. This is a different measurization because we have to turn all of the conditions into the conjugate conditions. Well, I have an example. Well, I have an example and I have the definitions of the measurizations. I don't know if I'm running out of time. They are below. If I have time, I can show you an example of a completion of a pension. Just in case. Here's one example. So we have a pension of rank nine. His chronicle invariants are a finite invariant factor of degree 1, 3 column minimal indices, 1.1, and 1 row minimal index, as 5. And we shall find the conjugate partitions of this column minimal indices increased in 1. So we have to find the conjugate partition of 2, 2, and 2, which is number of values greater than 1 is 3, number of greater than or equal to 1 is 3. greater than equal to 1 is 3, number 1 is greater than equal to 2 is 3. And the conjugate partition of 5 plus 1 is 6, so we get 6 marks. And then we want to achieve this invariance. We want to obtain a pencil strictly equivalent to this one. Here we have two finite invariant factors of degrees 1 and 5, this column minimal indices and no raw minimal indices. Observed then it's quite Observe there is quite a huge variation of the indices. I want to obtain it by a rank one. So, first of all, we should check that it is possible. Well, I have not defined the measurization, so we cannot check it yet. But, okay, this polynomial is interlaced. The only restriction is that this has to be a divisor of this one. All of the other ones are satisfied. Everything is satisfied. And then it means that It means that, well, this is the justification. We found the viral characteristic of the pencil. Remember, the viral characteristic of the regular part plus that one. So the cis plus one, the conjugate partition of cis plus one, then the characteristic of the particular pension, everything is at this one. So here is our pension, then by a factor, Then value factor, three column minimal indices of size one, and one raw minimal index of size five. Then we perturb it by a round one plus it which turns into zero and we can perform elementary operations. If we add to this row this one, we subtract to this row. This one, we subtract to this row this one, it starts with zero, here appears to one, and here nothing else. This is zero. So when we have this, I'm finally by M factor S, another one of size five here, and then we have a column minimal index of size two, and another column minimal index of size two. So just with round one, uh the difference of the structure of the two penses is really huge. Of the two penses is really huge. The next thing I have is the visualizations, if you are interested in it, I don't know. Shall I? Maybe you know about the measuration in the sense of hardly little button polio. I don't know. This is the generalization of it. If we have two partitions, let me show you just the example. If we have two partitions, If we have two partitions, in our situation, one of them has one more term, the other one. This is C and this is D. So we call it one-step measurization. C is one-step measurized by D if the following is satisfied. You compare the components and when you find the first one smaller than the component of C, then you stop there, and the tail has to be the same. Has to be the same. Here there is a shift of one as the measure is shifted. Then it tights the attach the tail of those two partitions, but we have lot of possibilities for the figure. Then we have to turn it into the conjugate partition. So the conjugate partitions, the conjugate of, well, let's check this two. Well, let's check these two partitions, and then these terms have to be out. I will tell you why. And then you compare both again. Then, whilst the R here, S is measurized by R. Then whilst the R are greater than or equal to the S are greater, then this should be this one's plus 4. This 4 plus 1. This is 4 plus 1, 3 plus 1, and so on. And when it happens, when this partition is not strictly smaller, this element is not strictly smaller than that, that is freedom. Then that's the conjugate partition of that one. So this partition is C is measurized by D if and only if the S is measurized by R. And the relation Between the C and D and the R and the S is this one. So take the D, increase it in 1, you get 7, 4, 3, and 2. Find the conjugate partition, and then you get number of elements greater than 1 is 4, of 2 is 4, of 3 is 3, of 4 is 2, and then of 5 and 6 and 7, and the same for the other. And it allows us to turn our measurization into the measurization of the conjugate partition. Thank you very much for your attention.
