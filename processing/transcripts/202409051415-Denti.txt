                                                   Thank you, Francisco. Very interesting. Are there any questions? Thank you. Very nice, Tol. Just a quick question about the first project where you use a variation inference. Do you know what is the complexity in terms of sample size? In terms of sample size, or in terms of both sample size and sample, Thank you for the very nice talk. Uh I'm going to report our first project. Uh you're going from uh a literature process to like lectures. So is it So, is it actually using a number of clusters H for something being fixed, or are we putting a prior fixed number or like putting a prior on it? And also as a follow-up, also this project, I'm wondering: are there people looking at? I know you're using the mean field variational inference, and this model could definitely be done by Gibbs and Polar, although very By Gibson Polar, although very slow, I guess. So it's like doing fairly well as skips. Just curious. Yes. Yes. Sorry. Sorry, thank you. Any other question? Okay, I have a quick one. They share that atom model mentioned that after you make minute mixtures, you forget about this problem of, let's say, over sharing information. Over sharing information. One thing I noticed is, well, the atoms are dense, right? Because they are from a base measure. So my question is, would you know what would happen if the atoms take the finish model, like the one you take, but you don't take the II that they lay that they can't do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you. That's that's time for Tesco again.
