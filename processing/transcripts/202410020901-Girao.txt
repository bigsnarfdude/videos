Right, so what we want to talk about, maybe let me start from the beginning, so you all know the conjecture of Ernest Heinel 77, and it states that for every graph G, for every graph H, every epsilon, so for every G. G is H3. There is either an independent set or a clique of size, the order of G to the power. Okay, so there has been lots of work on this conjecture. It's still very much open. It's still very much open. So, one question we could ask, which is very natural, is: instead of finding an independent set or a clique, how about a sparse set or a dense set? Okay. So, let me give a recognition. So, instead of epsilon is a half, just we say some set S, it is epsilon subset of edges. These are called epsilon. They squared and these epsilon dense Okay, maybe I'll just say if the complement Good, okay Okay, right, so we could ask: so fix an epsilon, how large, so if you have a graph G which doesn't contain an induced copy of some fixed graph, we could ask how large we have a sparse or a dense set. Okay, and this was answered by Robo ATC, so for every epsilon and for every H so there. So there it is, sub delta. So for every graph G, which is that G is H3, so H3, no copy, no index copy of H, then there exists a sine of sparse or one like sine of dense some set. Some set where the size of s is at least some delta proportion of the entire size. But and the proof of this is now is sort of standard. You can use a little art dilemma. If you can't embed, then you must find between regular pairs, and regular classes, you must find a very dense set or a very sparse set. Right. Okay. Right. Okay, so obvious question is how does this delta depend on the dependence on H, we don't really care. How does this depend on H? Oh, sorry, I should have said and I completely forgot that this is joint work with Toby Unisli, which is an undergraduate. Right. Okay, so question. Equation how delta dependent. Okay, and so this bound that Rodol gives is horrible because it's regularity lemma. So Fox theorem, Fox Sulakov, 2007. So they actually show that delta can be like epsilon to some constant depending on age, log with one over epsilon. So essentially, so it's not really polynomial in epsilon, but close. But yeah, right, so and they conjecture Delta NB polynomial in MC. Right, so this conjecture is stronger than Edward's head, and this is easy to see. Because if we take epsilon to be a small power of one over n, then you can find a large set that you want to say. And the last set, maybe that's just okay. So if I plug in this epsilon, then I have a set. If you have a graph G on n vertices, which doesn't If you have a graph G on n vertices which doesn't contain any discopy of h, then I can find a set of signs at least n to the well it's this times that, so this is like at least square root n and this is very dense or very sparse that you can use to announce. Good. Okay, so this is stronger than Erguschei. And then there's another version And then there's another version of this where you can allow not only you say that you don't have a copy of H, but you don't have some number of copies of H. Okay, and recently that we actually know, so Fox, the Buccic, Fox, and Tham proved that this is equal. All these conjectures are equivalent. Okay, so we know that let me rewrite this objection one, so we know trivially that this final and then a theorem. And the proof is very nice. I mean, very short and very nice. Um right, okay. And I mean, at least theoretically, it seems easier to find sparse Seems easier to find sparse rather than finding complete or independent. Okay, so let me give another sort of, so we know that, okay, we have Edge Heinel, then we have this sparse or dense type of problem, and then you can say, how about I partition my vertex set, and each part is dense or sparse. Okay, so this control. Okay, so not only we find, so we know by rhodal that we can find one part, but how about partitioning everything? And now this is, but this follows easily because you can just keep moving out by rhodal, and then until you have some leftover which is very small, and then you just add it to the biggest part. add it to the biggest part. Okay, but how about so this is what Paul, Alex, Tung have thought about, which is instead okay, and now I'm going to change the definition. Instead of saying that the part is epsilon then or one minus epsilon sparse, I'm going to say, I mean, I'm going to use the same thing because I don't want to introduce too many. Same thing because I don't want to introduce too many things. So from now on, S is epsilon sparse if the maximum degree induced from S is at most epsilon size at S, and 1 minus epsilon depends if the maximum degree of the complement is the first epsilon X. Right? So it's just saying that it's power. So it's just saying that it's parse if every degree has if every vertex has degree minus epsilon proportion, or dense if every degree has one minus epsilon proportion. Okay, so now the question is not so clear. So if I ask this with this new definition, so we want, so is it true that the graph which doesn't contain an induced copy of H can be partitioned into some fixed number of parts, just depending on H and epsilon, such that each part. Epsilon, such that each part is epsilon sparse or one minus epsilon plus. Because now, what do I do with the leftover? Because the leftover could be huge to one of the parts which is very sparse, and then I can't add it. Okay. Right, so lovely result of so this is true, so zero. Norvsky. So there's a follow-up paper that Tom did. This is with Sophie and okay, sorry. Yeah, it's too many subsets, so it's crazy. Substance, so it's got C. Ah, Scott C was correct. But not totally. Okay, so it's SS. This is maybe last year. Okay, and then they show that for every h for every epsilon, so there exists some f h epsilon, such that. Such that every H graph can be partitioned for toss F of H epsilon say V one. Yeah, it's on such type. Vi, G Vi is epsilon sparse or whatever is epsilon bits. Right. Okay. Okay. Now of course if we knew that this f of h epsilon is polynomial, then particular proof heine. So we could ask, okay, so an interesting observation is that, so we know that this conjecture, so conjecture one of Fox, so this delta being polynomial in epsilon, is equivalent to Edwards Hayen. But as far as I know, But as far as I know, I don't think we know that Erdogan implies this. Right, okay, but we could ask: what graphs do we know that this f of h epsilon is polynomial one over epsilon? Okay, so result okay, so Korean. Gooien Pauls Gooen Scott Singer. So they show that every E4 free graph has FOR E4. If our file going to so this is at most okay, I'm going to put here some constant, maybe they track down exactly what is the constant. Okay, so we know for P43 graphs that we can partition into polynomial in many parts. Each part is maximum degree small or minimum degree large. Right? Right. Okay, so they ask what about for triangles or cliques. Okay, so this is the result. I'm going to prove to pay. So we prove that for every K. For every k there exists some constant such that every k3 graph G can be partitioned for every epsilon g can be partitioned. Parts where each part is the epsilon sparse. So, in the case of cliques, we not only have, we don't need to have these tense things. I mean, obviously, if I put epsilon what Obviously, if I put epsilon 1 over k, then I will have a click. Right, okay, so the idea is to give the proof. It's not card, so let me now to do that, I will need two lemons, some steps, and a picture. So I'll try to divide the board. To divide the ball, maybe I'll stay first over. Okay, so the first thing is just that, okay, if you don't have a Kr, then you have a large, for every epsilon, you have a polynomial size set, which is sparse for every k there is a constant. There is a constant, epsilon. Every G K K three has a subset such that And okay, okay, and the idea it's just this is C, but it's simple. Okay, so you start with your graph, it doesn't have a k. Okay, if every vertex has degree at most epsilon or proportion, then if not p-clad vertex, look inside, this doesn't contain a k minus one duct.  Okay, so this gives even this constant here. Right. Okay, so now we found a polynomial size subset which is Rs. So the definition of squares is now with maximum degree? I sorry. Oh okay, so if you have no yeah, but uh your statement you put uh such as So I think we're completely thank you. Right. Okay, so the second lemma. Okay, so we need some definition for the object. The definition is I mean this is the usual definition but for the This is the usual definition in any case. So we say that pair AB is delta epsilon lower regular for every subset of A, subset of B, where the size of A is at least some delta proportion, size of B is a delta proportion. Delta proportion, then density, let's just say the number of edges between A and B, sorry, A prime and B prime, Z epsilon. With any small subset of this, I don't really care that it deviates more upward, but at least have a look. Upward, but at least have a lower bound. So, this is the definition, and now we want to find large, lower regular pairs. Okay, so this is the 11. And we say that, okay, so let epsilon be fixed, let A and B Let A and B bipartite graph substrant all vertices of A send epsilon send at least epsilon made proportion of edges to B. Okay, so we have So we have some density. I mean, we could use a density, but write as well just as CDs. And now for every delta, we can find A prime, B prime that so we have that. So we found that A prime B prime is delta epoxylum over to lower radio and the size of A is at least some exponential in delta and size of B prime is at least epsilon size of B. I mean, the the constants I mean of course the constants are important because I need to iterate this lemma to eat that. Iterate this lemma to eat up my graph, but okay, but let me just give a sketch of this because it's also maybe just a picture. So here we have our A, here we have our B, maybe this every vertex here sets epsilon the edges at least. Least at least yes, we have some posits, so let's just lower that. Okay, and now what we say? Okay, suppose not. So we find here some B prime and A prime of size delta. I find some size proportion delta in each size except the density is very small. It's smaller than x angle root. Small. It's smaller than epsilon over 2. Okay, then just delete these. Okay, there must be many verses which send small there, inside here. Just delete P. So all these verses and XYZ portion there and send at most XR over to in D prime, which means they must send the density sort of increases there. So then inside A prime, these, I can find a large set, say by half. By half, where all of these and proportion increases there. So I keep, so now I use this part with this thing, and then again, if I can find a delta proportion there, and a delta proportion there, which is not epsilon over 2, lower regular, the density is not epsilon over 2, then again I eat epsilon proportion. I find another subset, but okay, at some point this must stop because Some point this must stop because in every stage I'm taking that all these words have epsilon over epsilon over 2 there, epsilon over 2 there. So once I have a leftover which is less than epsilon over 2b, we have a contradiction. Okay, so how many steps do we do? Well, this is delta proportion. Each time it's delta proportion, so we have something like yeah, the the constant is not even going to be one over x, it's going to be like all index all one over x. Log X or next whatever. So after that many steps, this is much, much smaller. Which means, and how many times did we go inside A? That many steps. So we have that the last set A prime. This is just a sketch. The last, the final is at least one over delta to the power, the number of steps. And B, okay, we know that the leftover has to be at least epsilon over 2. Okay, so we find these lower regular pairs. No, no, no, they could be. Epsilon here really is a constant, it's not the epsilon for the main theorem. Uh it will be. Yeah, it's going to be fine. Yeah, that might be smaller than one. It should be delta to the issue here. It doesn't agree with what we approved. It's delta the minus one, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. That's correct. That's correct. No, that that is correct. Every time I go delta salt. I didn't crack this fine. Yeah, but it's fine. Exactly. Yeah. Okay, so now let's see. Okay, so now we have lemma one, so recall, and we have, let's call this lemma two. So I just want to keep maybe I should write here the statement now. I'm going to do the statements. We need to prove our result. Okay, so here will be a picture. Here will be a picture, here will be the status. Okay, so what do we start? We are given a graph G, which doesn't have a KK. So first thing we do, so step one, so find, okay, let me just, we are going to prove the first week. So first we find by lemma one subset A, which is epsilon, some constant depending on the k I don't have. So let's say kk3 and we are given some del some epsilon. I find some a which is epsilon to some constant sparse and a we know And A, we know that lemma 1 gives polynomials. So A is a polynomial species. Okay, so here we have our A. Now let's look at leftover. Now the leftover can have two properties. Either a vertex sends many edges to A or field. So we split the leftover into B and C. So B is going to be the set of x's V of G except A, such that the degree into A is at least epsilon A. In some sense, these will be the bad guys. That's why I call P. These all of these Okay. Man, I might need the three box four more meetings. Four more minutes. Okay, and these will be the guys that send very few. Now, I claim that these guys I can easily deal with because, okay, this has polynomial size. So I can just apply lemma one here, eat, eat, eat, until I have very small. So if I do polynomial many times, this will be much smaller than that. And now these guys, I can just, okay, I can, if you want, I randomly split these. Want I randomly split these randomly split so that the property that these guys said epsilon proportion still is satisfied. Three, apply lambda one to eat all but few and let the left over L L is much much smaller than. L is much, much smaller than A. Now randomly split into parts. And now I just, so our set will be okay. This, this, this, this, this. And now the leftover will be data. This is pass. Good. Okay, so we eat the whole C with polynomial in many parts so far. Now let's look what would we be. Okay, here we have our A1. A1 is very sparse. I just have split in half. B, all obese and large. Okay, so now I apply my. This and large. Okay, so now I apply my lemma 2. My lemma 2, I find here a large set, A star, let's call it, which has size at least epsilon proportion of A. And because A is epsilon to the million sparse, this will be sparse. And the subset here, which is order roughly, will be one over some poly epsilon. Such that this is so I apply lemma 2, maybe I'll apply lemma 2 with delta some epsilon to some very large constant depending on k. The epsilon is the same epsilon, and the epsilon will be. Okay, so we find here a large set, a large set such that each pair is Is delta epsilon lower. Good. And this is sparse. Because this is epsilon proportion and A was sparse. Good. Okay, so now what we do? Okay, the leftover, so the things outside this part, I eat it with my lemma one, until it's much smaller than this. But recall, this is epsilon to the one over poly epsilon. One over poly epsilon. But in each time, I eat a polynomial proportion. So then, if I do a larger polynomial, this is going to be smaller than this. So then I eat, eat, eat, and then I have my left over. And these are the bad guys for the next iteration. Okay, so we found our pair. Okay, there's a technicality that here inside I need to find again a sparse thing. Find again a sparse thing. Okay, now I find a pair. Now, what why do I do exactly the same that I did, but with these two guys? So here I split those that send few here or few here, I'm done. Those that send the last two here and here, I apply again my dense regular pair. Okay, keep going. I cannot go for more than. Okay, so the only thing we need to show is that I cannot go for more than k states. Because if I have Because if I have k parts where every pair is epsilon regular, then I know that there are many verses here which send epsilon to portion all and then because of epsilon and then I can find my k. Okay, I think that'll stop. Any uh any rap very rapid questions? Very rap very rapid question. Yeah, it's a good question. I haven't thought. What I think would be interesting, I mean, essentially, we know P4 and clicks, and I cannot even do cographs. So I thought that this should work for okay, so two remarks. So thank you. Okay, the first is that this proof gives the number of parties exponentially. The number of parts is exponential inverse. So I don't need more than exponential for any graph H. Second remark is that I don't think I can even do when H is a co-graph. I mean, okay, P4 you know how to do, but any other co-graph. What did you say about exponential co-graph? So the number for any graph H, this proof with some tweaks will give the number of parts I need exponentially in empty. Exponentially maps. But I wanted to at least give, so okay, what we really tried was to at least give the same bound as the fox or the new bound you have on the Erdős Hegel, at least that many parts, like you know, like epsilon minus one log one over epsilon. You should stop. Thank you.
