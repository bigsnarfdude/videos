I'm happy to introduce Laius Heiduk, talking about powers in arithmetic progressions. Go ahead. Thank you very much, Nias. It is a great pleasure for me to give a talk on this online meeting. It would be much better to be together, but it's still a very nice opportunity to meet in the virtual space. So, thank you. The title of my talk is Powers and The title of my talk is Powers in Arismatic Progressions. First, I would like to tell you about the plan of my talk, so what I'm going to talk about. First, I will set the problem. Well, the problem is that how many squares or higher powers can you find among n consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression? But I will be more precise. Then I will talk about the square case, then I can tell you some. You some history, some related results. Then the general case comes, then I can tell you some new results. First, I will present the best arithmetic progressions which contain the most S powers asymptotically. Then I will present some, so to say, numerical results in the small cases concerning Q's and force powers. I would like to say that all the new results. Say that all the new results I'm going to present are joint with subordinate. So, then first about the problem for squares. Well, the question is very simple. At most, how many squares one can find among n consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, shortly AP? An old conjecture of Erd≈ës from 1963 says that, well, if you write p and 2 for this maximum, P and 2 for this maximum, then Edis conjectured that this should be bounded by small O of n. This conjecture was proved by Samaridi. In fact, this nice result of Sameridi follows from his celebrated theorem concerning the existence of arbitrarily long progressions in dense sets. And he also needed a classical result of Euler about non-existence. About non-existence of four squares in arithmetic progressions. Well, much later, Bombieri-Grandville and pins could prove much more precise bound for this P and 2 for the number of squares among n-concentrative terms and arithmetic progression. They used, they combined deep methods about curves, elliptic curves, hyogeneous curves, fair tension. Curves, Fatting CRM, prime number theory. So they really combined several ingredients to come up with this nice bound. You see in the exponent you have n power 2 over 3. Later, Bombian and Zanier could refine the approach of Bombier and Granville and pins, and they could get a better exponent n power 3 over 5. Okay. Okay, there are still sharper conjectures. So, well, the best you can expect, of course, is that P and 2, so the number of squares in an alipatic progression among n consecutive terms, is big O of square root n. This is the conjecture of Rudin. You can make it even sharper, even more refined. A stronger form of this conjecture predicts that this number P and 2, well, number p and 2 well this is achieved by the same the very same repetitive progression all the time at least for n is at least six so the this this magic progression is 24x plus one and this should contain the the most squares among n consecutive terms ever and if you go for the number of uh of squares among this uh among n consecutive terms of this this terms of this progression 24x plus 1, then you will see that this is square root of 8 over 3 times square root n plus some small error. Well, these conjectures, of course, are completely open. Here I just would like to mention that, so why n is at least six? Well, up to four, the situation is very easy. You can recall a classical result of Ferma Euler. Eiler that there are no four constitutive squares in arithmetic progression. So, in view of this 12549 in this progression 24x plus 1, we are done. So it's easy. But n equals 5 is exceptional. So it's a special case. Okay, but it's not that important. I would like to mention that this sharp conjecture of sharp form of the ruding conjecture was recently checked by Gonzalez, Himenes, and By Gonzalez, Himenes, and SARLES up to n at most 52. Okay, so now to the, I turn to the case of arbitrary powers. Well, here again, the problem is, I would say it's now self-evident. So, what the question should be. So, let L be at least two. And the question is that at most, how many S powers can one find among n consecutive terms? Find among n consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Well, if you would like to state here something which is similar to the short form of Rudin's conjecture, so really not only to say the magnitude, but really to say something about what the best progression should be or could be. Well, then you have to do some work, and then you really have to go for the best progression. So, can you say which is the best progression, which is the progression which contains the most S powers asymptotically? So, now the progressions compete each other. Well, then, of course, the quantity you should define, you should look at is this P A B N of L. So, you just simply count the number of S powers among the first n terms of your arithmetic progression Ax plus B. Progression Ax plus B. Well, it's very easy to check, and it's obvious that this PABN of L is big O of square S root of N. Yeah. Okay. Some more observations and notation comes, but I believe that it's not that technical. Okay, so it's good to make some simple observations because Simple observations because they are just needed. The first thing is that if you multiply your progression, then S power, so L is fixed, fix your exponent L. And if you multiply your progression with an S power, then you do nothing. S powers remain S powers, non-S powers remain non-S powers, so you didn't do anything. So this means that this is a transformation which doesn't change things. Another simple thing is that if you shift your progression with a multiple of the With a multiple of the difference of the progression, then you again do nothing because you think asymptotically. So any shift with multiples of the difference doesn't make any change. So this means that your progression Ax plus B, if you start from Ax plus B, then this other more complicated looking progression, they are just equivalent because they are just shifts and multiples with S powers. L is fixed, L is fixed all the time here. All the time here. So it's an important notion that we have equivalent arithmetic progressions. Okay, and then we should introduce an appropriate measure for the density of S powers for an arithmetic progression. And as I mentioned, and this is really easy, the magnitude is S root of n. So it's a good idea, seems to be a good idea to divide out with S root of n. With S root of n. So this PABN is just the number of S powers among the first n terms of your progression. You divide out by square S root of n, and then you just take the limit. And then this quantity which says something about your progression, about the S powers in the progression. So this, okay. Yeah? And then if you fix A, yeah, so. If you fix A, so you fix the difference, then of course you can just take the maximum over B, where what is B? B is just, well, this residue class of your progression, so to say. Here you see that B is an integer, but of course, this is just a finite maximum. So if this limit exists, and this is very easy to see that this limit exists here, then this maximum also exists. It's really very, very simple. simple okay and then the the most important quantity comes you take maximum over a so you you take maximum over the the differences for s a l and then you get s of l which is now a quantity which which belongs to l only and you would like to maximize this this s l you would like to sorry so you would like to find the a which maximizes find the a which maximizes sal and then you get sl so this this sl will be something like the square root eight over three if you remember for the square so this is something like the the constant in front of of square root n or s root of n well and you will see this is not really about the the constant what is the constant now this is the important point the important point is that can you find the best progression so is it true that you can find the best progression is it You can find the best progression, is it exist at all? Yeah, and the first theorem we obtained with Saboch Tenge is just about this SL. This looks complicated, but I will show you what is the important point here. So the important point here is that this SL exists and it can be explicitly given for any L. So for any L, you can really say this constant in front of this. This constant in front of this magnitude, the s root of n. You see here square root 8 over 3. This is just, of course, the same what we see before, what we saw before for squares. And then something complicated, it's not that important. Otherwise, the point is that you can say it precisely. And then the second part of this statement says that further, if you have an arithmetic progression, SABL, which E L, which is the best, for which you really have this best constant, that this contains the most S powers asymptotically. Then this progression AB, say this is Ax plus B, then this is equivalent to A star x plus one. And A star x is uniform. This is unique. For any L, this is unique, well, almost. On the one hand, of course, you cannot make distinction between equivalent progressions. Between equivalent progressions. So, yeah, this is clear. And well, for L equals 4, in fact, you have two options. So you have two competing aliquatic progressions. None of them is better than the other. But all the other time, you have one best progression, which contains the most S powers asymptotically. Okay, I would like to briefly talk about the, oh no, not yet. First, I would like to make some remarks. Remarks. The first remark is that, well, if L is odd, if you look at those product, this complicated product in the CRM, then you will see that SL is just one and A star is just one for L odd. It means that asymptotically, you cannot do better than the trivial progression x. So you just say the consecutive integers, and this is the elementary progression which contains the most S powers asymptotically for L. Powers asymptotically for L odd. On the other hand, for L even, you can really find non-trivial arithmetic progressions. At least for infinitely many L, you will get something which is non-trivial. For example, if L is P minus 1, P is being a prime, then it's very easy to see that S L will be greater than 1. And this P will appear in A star. So you really get something which is better, say, than the Is better, say, than the trivial progression, you get a non-trivial progression for the best asymptotically for this L. Well, and the bottom part of this slide is just something about that. In fact, if you want something more complicated, A star, not only say one prime to put in A star, you want to put many primes in A star, you can also do that. So you really can get, well, composite moduli or composite difference. Moduli or composite differences, if you want, highly composite, even if you want. Okay, and then some remarks or some things about the proof. I don't go into details. In fact, this is elementary. So we want to determine SAL. So L is fixed. And we want to determine SAL. If you know what SAL is, so this is the say the coin. The say the coefficient belonging to A, the difference A. Then we should find the best B for this A. So we fix A, we fix the difference, and then we want to find the best residue class for this A. Yeah, then what is here is completely trivial, of course. So if u to the L belongs to our progression Ax plus B, you can rewrite it as U to the L is congruent to B modulo A. Yes, of course. But this means that But this means that it's good to introduce this number, MABL. What you do is just you just count. You just count how many S powers are there such that U to the L is congruent to B, modulo A, and U is restricted into a full residue class. So this ranges from zero to A. Of course, this is an important. Of course, this is an important quantity. And then you write MAL for the maximum of this MABL, so B can vary. And then, so we are after this SAL. A very simple calculation gives that SAL and MAL are very strongly related. So we have such a simple connection among them. So this means that MAL is really an important thing. If we understand MAL, then we are just winning. We are just winning, okay. And because then we can just take the maximum in A, and then we are done. So that is the strategy, or that is the idea. Okay, and then by the Chinese Remainder theorem, so you don't need deeper sync than that, you can show that MAL is multiplicative. This is very helpful because then SAL is also multiplicative. And this means that you can restrict your attention to arithmetic progressions Ax plus B with difference being a prime power. Being a prime power. And of course, it is much, much easier than. And then it is just a technical thing. You distinguish details, you go for B. P divides B, B is zero. Sorry, P doesn't divide B, B is zero. P divides B, but B is not zero. And then in the first case, this is the most interesting. Then you can just use classical results for the number of roots of unity modulo prime powers. This is very rare. Prime powers. This is very well known. You use the result, and then you can describe the quantities you are after. The second and third cases are just easy. They can just be reduced to the first case. And then you are just done. You get explicit formulas. You take the maximum and the theorem is proved. Okay, so this is what is behind. And so after having this theorem one, now we are in a position that we can formulate, say, We can formulate, say, conjectures or with subwatch, we call them problems. It's good to distinguish two things. You will see why. So the first problem is really just for arbitrary L. And then, so what we do, I just recall this PABN. This is just the number of S powers among the first n terms in your progression. And then the question. Progression and then the question is: so it's similar to Rudin's conjecture: that is it true that the asymptotically best progression is always the best, not only up to infinity, but ever? And well, at least after some n is greater than n zero. So, can you find an n zero? So, after that, every repetitive progression is superseded by this best, asymptotically best progression. So, this means that asymptotically best progression should. means that asymptotically best progression should contain the most S powers for any n among n consecutive terms, for any n compared with any other arithmetic progressions, at least for n greater than n zero. Yeah, just a very small remark that here l equals four is special. You may remember that there are two competing arithmetic progressions. Well, of course, here you should take the maximum. So they are really just overtaking each other. So, they are really just overtaking each other all the time. It's very easy to check it out. Okay, for odd values of L, the situation is a bit more, so it's slightly different or a bit more interesting or a bit more technical. So, here you need some quantity B cross, but the question is the same. So, maybe I just come here. So, maybe I'll just come here. So, the question is: Is it true that P A B N L, the maximum for any A and any B? So, this maximum is always given by one particular progression. So, here there is a little trick. So, this one you see here, this is just because consecutive integer. So, A is one, that is known from the theorem. And what is this B cross? Well, this is trivial that if you look at the things locally or Things locally, or some fixed interval, and of course, because L is odd, it's good to make a shift to the negative direction. I will show an example in the next slide, so it's really a very simple thing, but the principle is the same. So that the best progression shifted a little bit because we are counting locally should give the best result. Okay, yeah, this I already told you that all this. Toward you that all these things are about that the best progression asymptotically should be the best progression ever. So the problems are related to this question. And of course, we get back Rudin's conjecture for squares. So this is really more general. This is arbitrary for any L. I would like to mention that for squares, I told you the results which are known. For L greater than two, I'm not aware of any result. Not aware of any result. I only know about a remark without a proof in the paper of Bombieri, Granville, and Pinz. They just remark, so they didn't prove it, that by their method, it should be, one should be able to prove that P and 3, so for cubes, we should have this upper bound, and for arbitrary L, L is at least four, we should have this upper bound. These would be very nice to prove these things, but they are. Proofs, these things, but they don't give back the problems or the conjectures. And here is a very simple example I mentioned. So a shift to the negative direction may help. So if you count how many cubes L is three, you have among these 70 numbers where you have five, because minus eight is there and minus one is there, and so on. And if you would run from zero up to 16, then you would have only three. You would have only three, so it's the distributor shift helps locally. So that's why this shift is always there. Okay. Finally, I would like to mention our numerical results, so to say. So with some watch, we obtained some results about cubes and about force powers for some small, relatively small or small values of n. We could prove that the problem has positive. That the problem has a positive answer. So we could prove that this PABN is really always below this best progression, this shifted best progression, up to n smaller than 20. Well, practically, this means that an arithmetic progression among n consecutive terms can contain at most three or four or five cubes for these values of n. So, this is the claim here. And the very And very quickly about the background of the proof. So if you have, so if you, among the end terms, you have four cubes, then you have such equations, then you can combine these, you get a genus one curve of this shape. It's very easy. Then, by some classical results, say due to Danash, you can get rid of. To Danish, you can get rid of several of them immediately or very quickly. But in some cases, you are in trouble. And then we used results or ideas and approach with Mike and Nias and Carma and Yuri. And then we could construct Genus2 curves. And then we could apply nice deep results of Stoll and methods of Stoll to find generators on these curves. And then we use magma. And then we could verify or claim in this. Verify or claim in this way. What about the case of force powers? Well, a similar statement as for q's, but here much smaller interval. We could go up only up to five. Well, here, among the two progressions, this is the better in this range. Yeah, this is remarked here. In fact, we or claim says that among four consecutive terms in a repetitive progression, you cannot find more than two force powers, at least if. Force powers, at least the n is between three and five. So, this is the plane here. What to do now? What to do here? Now, assume that we have three force powers, then we have similar equations as for q's, but only now three. But we can just use now standard parameterization techniques. We obtain genus two curves also in this case, and then we just follow as I explained for in the previous case, and then our statement follows. All statement follows. Well, that's it. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. Are there any questions? I have a question. Yeah, go ahead. Has anything like this been studied in the general number field case? General number field case? No, no, no. I think at least I cannot recall any related result. What I think of is that about squares. But this is more related to the result of Ferma Eiler about that there are no four squares or four north. No for consecutive squares and arithmetic progression over integers. So this has been extended over number fields. And of course, then it is possible to find four consecutive squares. But well, I'm not completely sure if it depends on the degree of the field. Maybe it was only about quadratic fields, the result I have in mind. This is due to. This is due to, I believe, XARLES and some of his co-authors. But I cannot recall anything related to squares and how many squares, nevertic progressions in number fields. I cannot recall any such design. I see. Thanks. You're very welcome. Any further questions? No, hearing none, in that case, let us thank the speaker again. Thank you very much. And then we now have a small break and And we'll reap in the
