Thank you, and thanks for the invitation both to speak and to be here. The first in-person meeting for a long time. It's great to spend some time with colleagues. So everything I'll talk about today is joint work with David Plaskier-Sense, Guy Gasall and James Freitag. And James Freitag. And somehow, this is around a project we have trying to use differential algebra and some related topics to tackle some of those functional transcendence that we've seen play an important role in Dynam geometry problem. And today I'll talk about the actional theorem. The actional theorem. So a starting point for this talk is the theorem of Pila and Timmerman, so-called Axe Shaniel theorem with derivative for the J function, maybe in motion. I forgot the focus. Yeah, the camera for the camera. Okay, I think it's all right. So let me quickly go through the statement. So let me start with the V complex analytics variety of some open subset of a conjugate power, the half plane. And let T1 through T10 be coordinate functions. functions and I choose them so that the functions the j the classical j function applied to them are meromorphic on v notice that the derivation induced by differentiating with respect to ti are such that the rank Jacobian is the dimension of v and so what's well known is well what has been known classically is that if g is in g L to G is in GL2Q plus, so positive determinant, and you have a relation between some of the i and j's, then what you have is you have a modular polynomial that provides algebraic relation between the ti and the tj. And so if you're And so, if you're trying to find transcendence results, so algebraic independence result, this is a clear obstruction. And so the theorem of Pillan Simon is that if the Ti's are geodesically independent, so none of these modular relations, so the GLTQ plus relations between the TIs and the TIs are also, none of them are constant. Them on constant, so this is what geodesic independent means, then you get the expected transcendence degree, okay, of the ti j's and all the derivative. Okay, and so since we add that derivative, that's why it's called the actional wave derivative. So if you don't include the derivative of functions, this is known as the action. This is known as the action. Wasn't there a plus one also? You're doing it over C, right? Isn't the 3n plus dimension of V plus 1? Plus 1. Well, because the 3N of B. And the 3n includes it. Yeah, yes. Yeah, the dimension of B from the dimension of B. The T's are in V, right? No, the T's are in the T's sort of are the coordinate functions on V, okay. All right, and so somehow just so this is a generalization, if you want, of the Axin-Duban via trust, and we know that these plays play a role, for example, the Axynder and Vietnam. Role, for example, the axiom and Weiestrust plays a role, as James mentioned yesterday, in the proof of the Andre Oort conjecture by Pila. And using the actionable theorem, in that paper, they prove a weak form of the Zilber Ping conjecture, but a weak, very weak form. And so these are relevant to DiFein's problem, but I won't sort of really talk about those. And let me just say that this is being Say that this has been generalized in many arithmetic or Shimura settings by a lot of work. So here, a subset of authors and too many to list. And the dot does not mean infinite, but rather that there are newer results still out and haven't had the time to look at. And so needs to be included there. Somehow, for Somehow, for my motivations, unlike Acts proof of that theorem for the exponential function, the work here does not make use of differential algebra, at least not central. And indeed, there are various tools employed from group theory, complex variable, and number theory, but somehow all in common generally is that ominality as explained slightly. As explained slightly by James yesterday. And so, but one can think of these functional transcendent statements as belonging to differential algebra in some shape or form. And so, as I mentioned, over the past few years, we've been working with my co-authors in trying to sort of find proof of this theorem that avoids along the middle. And so use tools from the franchise, Robin. Use tools from differential algebra, maybe differential geometry and the multi or differentially closed fields. And somehow a year ago, I talked about how we were successful doing so in joint work with James and Guy around Axlindermann Weierstrass theorem. And so today I'll talk a little bit about the case of the action. So what can we prove? So the first example is So, the first example is sort of the straightforward generalization that's a statement of the case of a J function. So let me start with gamma, a Fuchsian group of first kind and any genus. So somehow a discrete subgroup of PSL2R. And if you don't know what first kind and any genus mean, so basically, if you look at the quotient of the upper half plane by the action. Half plane by the action of gamma, you can compactify this quotient and get projective curve, which will be of, so the genus of that group is precisely the genus of that curve. Okay. And so in the case before, gamma was PSL to z, and the quotient was the projective line, and j gamma. And J gamma was the j function. Sorry, Ronnie, you probably just said it in a mess. First kind means what again? So I'm not giving the definition, but. Does that mean limits? That's the whole sort. Right. Okay. All right. And so let us take P1Pn points in H, and let's take formal power series in the neighborhood of these points. So I'm thinking of those PIs as. I'm thinking of those PIs as a power series in these L variables. And so what replaces GL to Q is the following. So we say that the PIs are geodesically dependent if either one of them, at least one of them is a constant, or we have relations PI gamma PJ where gamma PJ where gamma here comes from the commensurator of gamma, so GL to R such that gamma and sorry, what is N L is the variable and the number of variables. H is losing context, very much. Yes, so I'm not sure. Yes, so I'm not sure understand your question. Why h is the upper half? Right. So is it h or h to be n no? So I take uh p1 to pn points in h. So that's how I'm going to look at the product. And so I'm going to apply j. And so I'm going to apply J's to each of these PIs. So it's slightly more general than. It's this formal power series around the neighborhood of why is it in L variables? Oh yeah, so it's pointing HL. Thank you. Thank you. Are commensurable. So somehow So, somehow the intersection of gamma with the conjugate by little gamma has a finite index in both gamma and conjugate. And so, again, it's known, and that's from the theory of Fouxian function, that if you have a little gamma in the commensurator and you have those relations between the Pi and PJs, then when you look at the Then, when you look at the J, you will have the analog of modular polynomials, so-called gamma or commensurator polynomials. So J P I, J P J vanishing. Okay, so somehow, in a way, the case of modular polynomials is a special case of those more general commensurate polynomials. General commensurator polynomials. And so what we prove, we prove, we prove the axanial with derivatives for those. Okay, so if they are, the Pi's are geodesically independent, then when we look at the transcendence degree of all the P i's, the J's, and the derivative, we have that since they are geodesically independent, they'd be greater than, so it's a transcendence degree. So, it's a transcendence degree you expect. Okay. So, let me just point out that the statement we prove is slightly more in the spirit of Acts and is somehow slightly more general than the statement given by the Pillat-Simmelman theorem, where somehow the PI were assumed to simply be called. were assumed to simply be coordinate functions on complex the complex analytics right okay and somehow in our setting we don't impose that gamma is arithmetic okay and indeed if gamma is arithmetic as i mentioned before uh this was already known um due to mock pillars okay so where they prove uh the as shiny The channel with derivative for all Shimura varieties, pure Shimura variety. So now, so what's the value of somehow doing work in the differential setting? So, not only can we prove those kinds of generalizations where we do still have a Fouxian group, let me give an example of a theorem we can prove where. Of a theorem we can prove where somehow there are no groups involved. So let's take an open circular triangle in the upper half plane. And so using the Riemann mapping theorem, we know that this triangle is conformally equivalent to the unit disk. And so there is a biholomorphic map from the triangle to the upper half plane. The triangle to the upper half plane, and we get a unique map once we fix where we send the vertices. And so, if you pick the vertices to be sent to the point infinity 0 or 1, that particular choice is special. And the biholomorphic map you get is the so-called Swartz triangle function. And so, somehow, if you think of the J function is a special case of the The j function is a special case of that as well. The Hecke groups provide more examples of those, but it's much more much more general. And so what we prove with my collaborators is that if you assume that you have a generic triangle, so if you assume that the alpha, beta, gamma are P1 or is it called a? To H. So somehow So, somehow, since we don't have a group, you can't extend. It's not the same as the J function where you can extend the map. So, this is like the fundamental domain, but you can extend, but in the case where you don't have a group, you can't extend it. So, it remains a local map. But you said that the J function can be thought of as a special case of this. Yes, it's a special case. So, when for specific alpha, beta, gamma, so when the So when the yes, so somehow when you have when you have the group, the group can act on the triangle and cover the entire power of plane. Then you can apply it. And yeah, and then by that, you get, if you have a quotient by a group, you can somehow recover the j function. Yeah, so that's a very special case. Yeah, so that's a very special case. And so, and so precisely what I'm saying is we don't have to necessarily just restrict to the case where we can extend the fundamental domain to the just a late basically. Yeah, so if we assume that the alpha, beta, gamma are algebraically independent of a q, so a generic triangle, if you want, then all we have to assume to make the theorem work is that we take distinct. That we take distinct parameterization. So, if we take distinct parametrization, then we get that the statement of the action of theorem holds. And that's somehow to be expected. There's no group around that can provide modular relations. And I guess I should say, yeah, I did say non-constant. Yes. Yeah. Question? If the points are the same. Well, if the points are distinct, the parametrizations are automatic. So again, if the points themselves of p1 through pn are distinct, then that's already distinct parametrizations. Yes, I think so. That's yeah, I mean, take the thing else, yes, but they could all be the same. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. You mean that the functions p1 hat through p n hat, these formal power systems. These formal power sees, we mean that those are distinct. Yeah, but you're saying is that if the points are distinct, oh, oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. That's right. Okay. Again, it has to be delta to the L everywhere. I apologize. Yeah. Yeah. All right. And so somehow, good. So So it turns out that what I'm hiding right now under the carpet is that there's an even more general setting that we are able to sort of try and prove an actional theorem. And that's the context of so-called geometric structures. So let me say a few words about it. So I'll take a definition from differential geometry first. And I won't give the technical definition. The technical definition, but I'll give an example and try to explain how it works. So, if I'm given a analytic manifold X with a Lie group acting transitively on it, by a GX geometric structure, I just mean a choice of a coordinate chart of an atlas so that the transition functions are given. Are given by the action of the element of G. Okay, so here, as shown in the picture, so you have on chart when the charts agree, the transistor function is given by a metropolitan. So this is a differential geometry definition. But let me sort of, instead of giving the technical definition, let me sort of explain in an example specific. In an example, specific example, how it works, and then slowly show how one can think about the generalization of this work. So, for our context, remember we want to work with Y, which is a complex algebraic variety. So, that's what we are interested in. So, X will also be complex algebraic. And we will choose X to be given as a quotient of the group G. Of the group G by an algebraic subgroup itself. Okay, and so the charts, the diffeomorphisms, and the ATLAS will be given by solving differential, algebraic differential equation, so local solution, analytic continuation, and so somehow, as we will see in the transition. As we will see, the transition will be given that by the action of G. So, to keep things, as I said, to keep things concrete, let me take the case where Y is the projective line, G is PSL to C. I take B to be the group of lower triangular matrices, so that when I look at the quotient, basically I get that X is also the projective line. Projective line. And so what I want is a G a G X structure on Y. And so this is also known as a projective structure. Notice that this is for simplicity, instead of Y being the projective line here, I could have chosen X to be. I could have chosen X to be any complex algebraic curve. Okay. And so let's go a little into differential equations. So consider this Feynman second order linear homogeneous differential equation. So here Fouxian is, if you don't know what it is, so just it's about the singularities of the equation being regular singular. But if you don't know what Being regular singular, but if you don't know what that means, it's not important. That's not going to play a role, obviously. So we want to start with a point in P1 less s. So S here is the set of singularities of the equation. So where the rational function is not defined. Oh, I forgot to say that R is a rational function. Okay. And so I can take the basis of analytic solution. Analytic solution in a neighborhood of Z. And as we know, in this case, if I take B in G L to C, okay, and I look at G1, G2, the functions given as B F1, F2. Okay, I get another solution of my differential equation. And indeed, every solution comes this way. So if you're thinking of Come this way. So, if you're thinking of starting with a local solution and analytically continuing the solution, the new solution you'll get will be given up to an action by matrix multiplication of B. Okay. And so somehow this is the first sort of indication that there's a group that acts. However, this is not an action on, this is not a geometric structure on P1 yet. Okay, so this is not the one we are looking for. The one we are looking for, but let me just remind some qualitative information. We have the monodromic group, just in passing. So if we start with a path in the fundamental group, we can analytically continue the solution. We get a new solution. And as I said, these new solutions F1 tilde and F2 tilde will. To tilt will differ by because F1 and F2 is the basis of solution, so we have a matrix M gamma, and this mapping taking a path to M gamma, the group, is so-called monodromy representation. And if we look at the image of rho, we get the so-called monodromy group of the equation. Okay, I'm only mentioning that because this is what Mentioning that because this is what's going to differentiate between the Swartz triangle function and the Fuchsian group case. But what we are interested in is how do we get a chart on P1? Well, it's known that if you start with the basis of analytic solution, then if you take the quotient of F1 and F2, the function you can One and f2, the function you get t will be a local solution of the Swartzian equation. Okay, so here let me not assume that everyone knows what the Swartzian is. So T prime prime over T prime prime minus half T square, where prime here is divided y and so again we are now And so again, we are now in a situation where for any, so ABCD in PSL to C, we have that the function T1 given by linear fraction neural transformation of T is again a solution to this. Again, a solution to the Swartzian equation. And so, again, if you're trying to do local analytic continuation, the new solutions you'll get will be related by an element of PSL to C. And so if you think about the transition function, then the transition function will be given by elements of PSL to C. Okay? And so finally, the And so finally, let me mention that you can specifically apply M gamma for a path like before, and in this case, you will get a new solution. And so the projection of M gamma in PSL to C is so-called the projective monodromic. Progenitive monodromic group. Okay. And so somehow and they matter when you want to differentiate between the case where you have a Fourier group or not. In any case, the summary, if you want, is that the data, given the Swartzian equation here, and local solutions t, which is the quotients of these that linear independent solution of the Of the linear equation is what define PSL2CP1 structure, so projective structure on P1. So the use, the local solutions provide the open sets that cover P1C once you do analytic continuation. Let me mention for us that matters, one could have equivalently give the Uh, give the data of the inverse differential equation. So, if you look at t as a solution and you look at the inverse, it might be multi-valued, but locally well-defined, then the inverse will also satisfy a Schwarzenegger equation, but this time more complicated. And this is the famous Schwarzenegger equation satisfied, for example, by the J function, which you might have seen in Jim. Which you might have seen in Jim's talk yesterday. And so the inverse function is called a uniformizer of this geometric structure. And so as an example, so that's where the Schwartz triangle function comes into the picture. So the Schwartz triangle function only locally defined, but they give example But they give example of the inverse of those charts or keep the function that keeps us charts. Okay, so let me just say that in the special case where the projective monogrammy group is a discrete subgroup of PSN2R, then the inverse function is one of the j gammas. Is one of the J gammas. This time it's globally defined. And you can see that we have a quotient and the branches of the inverse are related by elements of PSL to C. And this is the idea of the charts. Okay, and so this leads us to more general example of geometric structure. Okay, so if we take omega bounded symmetry. Omega bounded symmetric domain. So given as a quotient of the real points of a connected simple League group, algebraic Q group by K maximal compact subgroup. Well, there's the idea of the compact dual X, and that will be the X we're interested in. So it's simply the quotient of the complex point of G by quotient by some power. Quotient by some parable, etc. And so this leads us to the example of how one can interpret shimura varieties, pure shimmura varieties, as geometric structure. So we looked at omega quotient with an arithmetical lattice. That's a Shimuro variety. And the geometry. And the geometric structure, so where the G here is the one we start with, and the G mod B is the one from the compact dual, gives us a geometric structure on the Shimura varieties, which is the system of partial differential equation satisfied by the uniformization function. So let's not stop here. Let me give a Let's not stop here. Let me give somehow the most general example to which our results apply. And that's the setting of covering map as introduced by Tom Skam. Okay, now in this setting, so let me put all of it so that everyone can read. So again, so I start with an algebraic group over C. I have a regular action on a complex of variety X. On the context of variety x. Now we assume that x is given as a quotient of g by b. So Tom does not have this assumption necessary in his setting. I take a complex open complex submanifold of the complex of X, complex rule of X, and I have a Zarsky dense subgroup that's preserved under preserve under that preserves the action induced action on X preserves U okay and I assume that I have an a complex analytic map which is a covering so it expresses y as the quotient of u by gamma okay and so if you want to notice where do we get the charts and things well The charts and things, well, the inverse of that covering map is a multi-valued function.
