We really need all the lights off. Some yeah, right? Maybe a little bit darker. I know there's some that at least line up the different. Let's try side lights. Doesn't really do much. Oh, we definitely don't want the front lights on. That's gonna try. Yeah. We try, yeah, right. Okay, let's let's play around here. Oh, so now that's a few black, right? I think the second one before this. Okay. But do we believe this one is? But do we believe this one is too much? That's what we have. Virtual recording or coming up. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I do like it. Well, you're already at that, so yeah.  All right. Welcome back, everybody. I'm very happy to introduce the couple of it from the Introduce Natasha Havlovich from University of Texas, Austin. And she will tell us about a binary ternary Boltzmann equation, origins of the equation, and moments of solutions. Go ahead, Natasha. Thank you. I'd like to start by thanking the four organizers, Maya, Maria, Nestor, and Russell, for the invitation and for patience in allowing me to give a talk on Zoom. I would love to be there. Zoom. I would love to be there. It's just crazy busy, and I could not travel at this point. But I see that you're having a lovely discussion. The talks that I attended, they were great questions. Enjoy for me, please. So I will talk about derivation of the binary tab equation from particle systems, which is joint work with Joachim and Patsoglu. It's my understanding that Joachim is at the conference. It's just the figures are very small, so I do not see who is there. Also, I do not see who is there. And then I will. I'm very excited to tell you about our recent result with Javakima Patsagu, Edene Gamba, and Maya Taskovic. Maya being in the audience too, on the moments of solutions of this equation, homogeneous version of this equation. So let's first revisit just why would one want to go beyond the Boltzmann equation itself. So as we know, and in this crowd, I will not put many technical details for the Boltzmann itself because I see that we have experts, we have many experts. That we have experts, we have many experts in the audience. So, the Boltzmann equation was introduced by Maxwell and Boltzmann in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Here is the equation 1.1 for the position x, the time t, and velocity v in R D. And F, it describes evolution. Natasha, sorry, I think Moritz is asking for the screen to be bigger. And I think I have a response. We cannot make the screen bigger. We cannot make the screen bigger. Thank you, Nathil. What do you want? Can you put your slides in full screen? So we have went through this before everyone returned from the coffee break. And I'm very happy to report that this is the optimal, this is the optimal setting for this talk. And Mortis is very happy to accept that. Thank you. I would love to say there's a huge I would like to say there's a beautiful chair in the front, which is much closer. I have a question for people sitting in the back. Do you see what's on the slides? Very well. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So that's all. I will continue then. So here we have Boltzmann equation. And as we know, we have a transporter on the left and the Q2 operator, collisional operator on the right. And collisional operator for the Boltzmann equation itself. For the Boltzmann equation itself is a quadratic integral operator that expresses change of the density of the gas particle due to instantaneous binary collisions of particles. Okay. And of course, the form of Q2 depends on the type of, if we are talking about hard spheres or if we are talking about Maxwell molecules and so on. I will not go into detail because I want to go to the question: why would one want to go beyond Q2? Okay, and that next. Okay, and that next slide. So, the Boltzmann equation, as you know, takes into account only binary collisions of particles. And one derives this derives the equation from the particle system. Actually, ternary and higher-order collisions have to be considered, but they are neglected due to lower probability of occurring compared to binary. To me, this is really like a lens that we use on a microscope when we look at the binary collision. It's not suited to the Is not suited to detect other types of collisions. And of course, related to scaling from the particle systems to the non-linear PD. However, when the gas is dense enough, higher order collisions actually matter. One example, which is not our motivating example, but we use it to illustrate this concept, is colloid, which is a homogeneous non-crystalline substance when you have ultra-microscopic particles of one substance dispersed through a sector. One substance dispersed through a second substance. Think milk, or for example, foam. Okay. So there are a lot of physics papers on colloids, chemistry papers too. And in one of them, this is physics paper by Rus and von Gunberg from 2002. They say that multi-interactions among particles actually significantly contribute to this situation when they describe colloid and they contribute to the grand potential of a colloidal gas, and they are more. And they are modeled by some of higher-order interaction terms. So, in that context, this is what Joachim started, Joachim Ampatzol, who started in his PhD thesis, and there are still quite a few questions open there. So, what Joachim and I started doing at that time was we wanted to introduce equation that motivated by this, we wanted to introduce equation and rigorously derive it from particle systems that include. Systems that include interactions beyond binary. So we wanted to incorporate some of higher-order interactions. So here is a possibility for that equation. So that's 2.1. On the left-hand side, we still have transports delta TF plus V dot gradient F. On the right-hand side is a sum of the QK operators, sum where K stands for having K copies of F. So that's K to order collisional operator. And the sum, one can take it. And the sum, one can take it to be finite, let's say m. So then, m is the order of highest collision that's allowed. Okay, after we have played, after you can play with this equation and we introduced it actually in the binary-tenary case, we learned from Irene that Irene, Gamba, and collaborators, Bobilav, Gamba, and Ceciliani, actually considered this equation some time ago for the Maxwell molecules, and they used Fourier transfer methods to establish well-poseness, but that's for the Maxwell molecules. But that's for the maximum molecules. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit. I will first talk about the derivation of this equation. And let's stop just and let's go to the case m is equal to 2 when we have really the binary Boltzmann. So I just want to remind us all the derivation of the Boltzmann equation itself from particle systems is a challenging problem, has been and still is. So Hilbert described this problem as in his famous sixth problem as one of the challenges. Sixth problem as one of the challenges of the 20th century. It's still challenging in the 21st. So, for the hard-sphere interactions, this was this work of going from particle systems to the Boltzmann equation was pioneered by Lamford in 1975 using the approach of hierarchies, finite hierarchy, infinite hierarchy, the equation, non-linear equation. And that was recently revisited and completed relatively recently, 10 years ago, by Gallagher, Sandramon, and Texier. There are some other works. And Texier. There are some other works, and I will not mention all of them here. I want to point out that for short-range potentials, there are also works by King, Gallagher, Sandram, Texier, Pulvirenti, Safirio Simonella, and many other people. But still, there are tricky questions, even for the derivation of the binary Boltzmann equation. So, I want to tell you now what we did with Joachim in terms of derivation of the binary ternary. So, if I go back to the slide, we are talking about M is equal to 10. Slide, we are talking about m is equal to 3 video slide video equation, which would mean having q2 and q3. So, since q3 was new at the time when we started talking about it, we first did derivation of the ternary in order to understand what kind of obstacles we have in front of us. And then once we did that, then we were able to talk about into having binary and ternary at the same time. So, I will tell you a little bit about the ternary only, so just that you see how it arises, and then I will. How it arises, and then I will talk about binary ternary. Okay, so the first question that with Joachim we faced in order to derive ternary Boltzmann equation is how to make sense of ternary interactions so that we can actually detect their contributions. So, this is related to the question from the beginning. If you look at the lens or scale that sees only binary, you will not be able to ternary interactions will not survive. So, what should we do to detect ternary interactions? To detect ternary interactions. And actually, what should ternary interaction be? Okay, so then we went back to this physics paper that I mentioned earlier, Roos and Van Gunberg, and there they are saying that what they are considering is that interactions among three particles are determined by the sum of the distances of interacting particles, rather by different geometric configurations. This is to say, this is different than looking at the three-body problem in physics, where various computations. Problem in physics, where various combinatorial and geometric situations are super complicated. We are not trying to do that. Motivated by the sum of the interacting particles, we are modeling ternary interactions like that. So we introduced concept of a ternary interaction of a certain zone, epsilon zone. So this is in the next definition. So consider epsilon positive and consider three particles, i, j, k, and let us denote their positions as with xi and velocities with Xi and velocities with Vi. So we have Xi Vi for the first, Xj, Vj for the second, and the third. And we say that the particles ijk i in ijk term are the epsilon interaction if 2.2 happens. Notice that there is a semicolon after I. So I has a special point, special position in this equation. So here it's the sum of the square of the distance. Of the square of the distances between i and j and xi and xj and xi and xk, and we are saying that some function of epsilon squared. So, this is so-called what we consider to be asymmetric version, which has a central particle, i is here central particle. Later, we can actually get rid of this assumption by symmetrizing a corresponding kernel. Okay, epsilon is called interaction zone. So, let me pause immediately before I tell you how this distance then Distance then guides what's happening next. Let's just do some counting and try to figure out how this distance influences scaling. Okay? So ternary scaling. So the point of the story is that this equation that distance squared is equal to epsilon squared can be interpreted in a very simple way if you lift the dimensions. Instead of being in Rd, you lift yourself to live in R. You lift yourself to live in R2D. So, in other words, one can interpret the interaction zone epsilon as a special hard sphere interaction of a certain radius, which is a function of epsilon in R2D. So, that's very simple to see. So, here we have a distance. I just copied it. So, now I want to rewrite this distance in higher dimension. So, we are going to form the vector xi, which has coordinate xi and xi, and the vector xjk, which is this. JK, which is this vector. So then this relationship is nothing but the distance between these two vectors in R2D. So we are talking about R2D distance being equal square root of 12 of epsilon. Okay, so then we need to count how many the 2D particle with position xi would span a volume of order. We are now in R2D. So we are talking about epsilon to the 2D minus one. And on the other hand, now you have to count how many choices do you have for the many choices do you have for the vector xjk? So for the xj, you have n, for the xk, you have n minus 1, but roughly it's like n. n times n is n squared. So what you get is n squared times the volume epsilon to the 2d minus 1 in order to observe order of one interaction that's like constant over order of 1. So you end up with new scaling and the scaling here is n epsilon to the d minus one half, which is equation 2.2. One half, which is equation 2.3, is order of one. Okay, so this is new scaling, and this is scaling that will allow us to detect ternary interruptions. Okay. Now, having that distance, I will not go through the entire derivation. It would take me a lot of time. And I'm sure that you have seen examples of these problems. Rather, I will just tell you: first question that we should face is: having that distance, what can That distance, how can I determine after that collision now is really interaction of three particles? So, what happens with velocities of the three particles after the interaction? So, that's like, I want us to consider transformation of velocities at the ternary interaction. And here is our distance, ternary distance is equal to epsilon squared. So, we are going to denote by the stars vi star, vj star, vk star, the velocities of interacting particles after the interaction. Particles after the interaction, and we will assume that there is conservation of momentum and conservation of energy before and after interaction. So that's 2.5, 2.6. So then by simply introducing these impact directions, which we called omega 1, omega 2, in the following way. So the first one is distance between, sorry, the difference between positions rescaled, and the other one is difference between positions of xk and xi rescaled. The point introducing these is we can revisit two. This is we can revisit 2.4 and notice that this is nothing but the absolute value of omega 1 squared plus absolute value of omega 2 squared is equal to 1. In other words, instead of having just one impact direction of omega, now we have two impact directions, omega 1, omega 2. Or if you want, you can put them in a vector in a higher dimension. Okay, so still I need to solve, we need to solve these equations 2.5 and 2.6 for the stars. Okay, so first there is Okay, so first, there is there the question is: do we know that there is a unique solution? So then we impose an extra condition, which is a generalization of the condition that was imposed in the binary case. So we impose that the vectors vj star and vk star are obtained by vj and vk by doing this shift with respect to impact directions. So when you add this condition, and by the way, to binary cases, you just forget about the second line of this vector. About the second line of this vector. This is really a generalization of what happened in Gallagher-Saint-Ramon and Texier. So then you can actually find a unique solution to this system 2.5, 2.6. I'm not writing it here. There is a unique solution. Joachim found it. It's in his thesis. And here is the, we will just denote that whenever interaction happens, then the velocities are changed according to 2.9. Okay, so having that, then you want to come back to the Liovilla. Then you want to come up to the Liouville equation. So, first, we talk about phase space. So, phase space will be a set of all configurations here, Zn, which is denoting the vector of the positions Xn. Xn here stands for the vector and the vector of velocities in R there are n particles in each in this is in R2 dn, okay, such that this inter new terdinary interaction distance is greater than or equal to epsilon squared. So, on the boundary. Epsilon squared. So on the boundary of this phase space, you have interactions. And for the note keeping, we order these guys i, j, k. Otherwise, you can you do not have to do that, but this makes things easier in terms of keeping track of the combinatorics. Okay, so having that phase space, we want to get a system for the n particles. So we have to describe behavior of n particles. So it's described by the equations one and two. So basically, you look at the So basically, you look at the initial configuration in the phase space, and then you assume that particles perform rectilinear motion as long as there is no interaction. So, xi dot is vi, vi dot is zero, linear motion. Okay. And then assume that at time, at some time t, you have reached the configuration z n of t, which is xn of t and vn of t, and assume that there is interaction. Then you prescribe that at that time, velocity will have to change according to. Will have to change according to law 2.11. So, in other words, linear motion, and then when interaction happens, you exchange velocities, three velocities, according to 2.11. So, then you have many questions in order to derive the equation. So, this is n-particle system. So, you want to make sure that that system is well posed and the dynamics make sense. And this is not obvious that that system is well-defined. By the way, since system can run into various Since the system can run into various pathological situations. So, this was done in the binary case by Alexander in his PhD thesis. And we could not use Alexander itself because everything was cooked up for the binary. But Alexandria was inspiration for us to prove that there is a global in-time measure-preserving flow that can be defined almost for all initial configurations, and that leads to Liouville equation. And in order for us to establish And in order for us to establish this first point, what I put in the bold phase here was crucial. So, first you do it locally in time, then you go from local to global. And to go from local to global, it was crucial that when you have a triplet of particles interacting, then a system evolves, the subsequent interaction cannot involve the same tripletoparticles. So, once we proved this, we were able to implement the program of showing that there is a well-defined dynamics for the end. A well-defined dynamics for the n-particle system, okay. And that gives us Liouville equation. I'm not writing this, I want to get to the Boltzmann. Okay, so then integrating by part Liouville, one can derive, because the problem is when n is very large, Liouville is not useful. So one can obtain finite hierarchy of equations that are typical called BBGKY for the marginals. Okay, then you look at the limit as that finite hierarchy converges to infinite, and we do it in this new scale. And we do it in this new scaling, in the ternary scaling. And by the way, doing that convergence is actually where most technical work happens. That's challenge number three, required a lot of new geometric estimates. Joachim is there. I'm sure he would be happy to tell you during the conference about all that hard work. At the end, what one gets is this infinite hierarchy, which you can prove propagation of chaos, and you can show that it meets special nice family of solutions which are factorized. Of solutions which are factorized and the factor solves Ternary-Boltzmann equation. This is 2.13. So the equation is delta Tf plus 3 dot gradient F is Q3. Now let me write what Q3 is because I'm sure you are curious. So here is Q3. So it's integration. So you integrate over both impact directions, omega 1, omega 2, which live on the sphere. And then you're integrating V1 and V2. So here there are products of three factors of post-collisional velocities. factors of post-collisional velocities and pre-collisional sorry post-collisional F's and pre-collisional Fs, and there is B kernel and kernel is the generalization of the hard sphere kernel because if you have just if you were just in 1D sorry not in 1D in R D instead of R2D it's be considered binary there would be no second term here there would be just hard sphere interaction now we have two terms here again really like lifting the dimension okay Lifting the dimension. Okay. So that's all I was planning to say about ternary because I won't talk about binary ternary. Okay. So that was our next quest. We wanted to derive, and I need to speed up. I see that it's 11.50. So we wanted to derive binary ternary Boltzmann equation. And I want to make sure that at the end I tell you why we think that the equation is actually really cool. So, but for now, first, how did we derive it? Let me just talk about some obstacles that we faced. And first obstacle is And first obstacle is, as I told, as we heard a few minutes ago, am I right? When you derive binary Boltzmann equation, you use the regular distance 2 between particles xi and xj, and it's equal to epsilon. To derive ternary, you use a different notion of a distance, and here is our ternary distance. The issue is that the bind derivation of the binary, you put a lens so that you see those interactions, and that means the bolts. Those interactions, and that means the Boltzmann-Grad scaling, that's 2.15. On the other hand, in order to derive ternary equations, scaling is different, and they are not, they are apparently incompatible. Okay? Sorry. Is it square root of two times epsilon or square root of two epsilon? I think it's supposed to be a square root of the whole thing because it was epsilon squared over there. Yeah. But sorry. Uh, sorry, sorry, if I'm writing both, sorry, if I'm writing this distance in terms of epsilon, then I'm writing that distance in terms of epsilon. But you are hinting upon the solution to this problem. The solution to the problem is that one should not consider same epsilon for both of them, of course. So the solution to this problem is that we will work with hard spheres of the diameter epsilon 2, okay? And we will allow that these spheres can collide. That these spheres can collide as hard spheres in the binary sense, but that's with respect to the scaling that involves the same number of particles which the system has, that's n, and epsilon 2. But we will allow the same balls of diameter epsilon 2 to interact as binary as well as at ternary interactions. In other words, they can interact as triplets via interaction zone epsilon 3. In other words, we are not bound to have the same, we actually cannot have the same epsilon. Actually, we cannot have the same epsilon. So, we put epsilon 2 for the radius of the hard sphere, and that takes care of the binary interactions, and then epsilon 3 for the larger internary interaction zone. And this 2.17 implies that epsilon 2 is much smaller than epsilon 2 is much smaller than epsilon 3, which makes sense with this picture. So that was challenge number one. Challenge number two, and I think I will then stop talking about challenging and switch talking about moments because I want to make sure that I tell you about that. But let me just tell you. Make sure that I tell you about that. But let me just tell you a little bit about challenge number two. Challenge number two is: okay, you know how to detect binary, you know how to detect ternary, but how do you decouple them? Okay, so our framework a priori allows picture like this, that you have particle, that you have hard spheres of diameter epsilon two centered at i and j interacting as binary interactions, meaning touching each other, binary collision. And a priori, you could have. And a priori, you could have a k1 here which interacts with these three in a terdinary sense, meaning distance between i and j and i and k corresponds to the ternary interaction. Why is this bad? Let's first talk about intuition. Because you want to derive binary ternary equation. So if you have an enemy like this, you do not know if this is going to contribute to the binary collisional operator or to the ternary collisional operator. So the good, there are So, the good there are a bunch of pathological configurations of this type, including the one above. And in the proof, you actually show that they are negligible and in the limit, they disappear. Okay, so there is actually decoupling of interactions, and Joachim worked hard to prove that. So, what happens, you don't see that immediately, you see that inside the pearls, that what survives are pure binary or pure ternary interactions, meaning I and J, if they interact in terms of the binary, If they interact in terms of the binary, then all other particles, none of them is involved in any binary or ternary interaction at the same time. Or you can have a situation where you only have ternary interaction. This is like pure ternary, but then none of the subsets or any other particles are interacted binary at the same time. Okay? So this happens in the proof. And there is challenge number three, which is convergence. And this brings new sets of challenges. New sets of challenges compared to the derivation of the binary or derivation of the ternary because you have to consider various mixed configurations. I will not talk about this because I have just six minutes. Okay. Instead, I want to tell you this can be done. And we have a paper on derivation of the biomet with Joachim on the derivation of the binary, ternary Boltzmann equation. What we are doing now with Joachim and my current student, Billy Warner, we are generalizing really to what we want. Are generalizing really to what we wanted to do from the beginning. We would like to derive the equation that has up to m collisional operators. Okay, and the good news that there is a lot of work because many things have to be checked, but the good news are that we suspect that some of the tools that we developed for the binary-binary interaction will be helpful in this context. On the other hand, I want to mention that if you consider a homogeneous situation and maximum molecules, it's actually easier to derive. It's very difficult. Easier to derive. It's very different derivation. It's done from generalizing Katz model. So, this is something that we just completed. I think it's an archive as a couple of days ago. So, this is with Esteban Cardena, student of Thomas Chen here at UT, and Billy Wardner, my student here. So, where we derived Boltzmann equation with higher order collisions all the way up to M from a generalized Katz model. So, we generalized Katz model, Katz model was for binary. Binary interactions in a stochastic model, we generalize that to have a k and then we sum of them. So we have a different stochastic model. And then consequently, we derive space homogeneous Boltzmann equation. That's actually the equation that was studied by Irene and collaborators some time ago. Okay, so let me use the last four or five minutes to tell you about the results with Irene, with Maya, and Joachim that we have, I think, all four of. That we have, I think, all four of us are quite excited about, which shows that binary ternary, why are we excited about the result? It shows that this equation can behave better than either binary or ternary. So we consider homogeneous binary, ternary, Boltzmann equation, where Q2 and Q3 are generalized versions of what Joachim and I used in the derivation. In the sense, derivation corresponds to hard spheres, but we allow hard variable hard potential. Allow hard variable hard potential case, and we so it's more general than just hard spheres. Okay, so what do we prove? We prove global halposeness for this equation, and also we prove it's homogeneous, and we prove generation and propagation of polynomial and exponential moments. And what's that twist that I was hinted upon? So we show that this binary ternary equation is better behaved compared to binary or compared to ternary in terms of behavior of moment. Ternary in terms of behavior of moments. So, in order to tell you what I mean by better behaved, let's just quickly recall. I don't know if there were talks on the propagation and generation of moments in the conference. So, let me just quickly recall just where we stand, where people stand with binary interactions, or in general, just definitions. So, by polynomial moment of order k of a function f for measurable non-negative function, one considers that to be given by formula 3.4. So, one is integrated. So one is integrating in velocity f, which is integrated against the bracket of v to the power k. On the other hand, if you were to sum those moments and then you put relative weight, so you can actually get exponential by summing polynomial using Taylor formula. You can introduce the concept of exponential moment. So exponential moment, you're integrating f against exponential, which has e to the z is the rate and order is f. Is the rate and order is s. You have again bracket of A to the S. And what I didn't put on the slide, three-point exponential moments are related to the polynomial moments because they're actually talking about summability of polynomial moments thanks to Taylor expansion. Okay, for each of those two concepts, one can talk about propagating in time those properties or actually generating them in time. Okay, so what does one mean by that? So I want to give a definition that covers both cases. Covers both cases. So you can have a weight, which is either polynomial in case of polynomial moments or exponential in case of exponential moments. By generation in time, one means you start with some initial data that have finite energy, okay, second moment, and then you prove that for any function phi of that time, you prove that for phi, which is v to the bracket v to the k, you have finiteness for all times. So this is generated in time. Is generated in time. You did not have to assume that initially, rather, you had a very weak assumption initially, and then you get all of them. So, it's a generation, or if some people call it creation of moments in time. On the other hand, propagation of moments here is you start with a moment of certain order initially, and you show that that's propagated in time. So, for binary, there are many works. I'm not going to recall all of them. I just want to point out some that are relevant to us. Point out some that are relevant to us. For homogeneous Boltzmann equation binary, generation as well propagation of polynomial moments is known for any k bigger than two. Many references here, I'm putting just Micheler Vanberg and Alonso, Canizo, Gamba, Muho, because those are relevant to our works. On the other hand, exponential moments of order, I'm recalling generation of order gamma 2 is generated instantaneously, but of order gamma 2, not beyond gamma 2, okay. Beyond gamma 2, okay, and that brings us to why, to how we see that this equation is better behaved. So, what do we mean? How do we see that? So, I will first describe it in words, then I will describe, then I will state the theorem. Okay, so first way to see it is that the binary ternary Boltzmann equation generates higher order exponential moments than only binary or only ternary. Because if you remember, we just recalled for the binary Boltzmann equation, Binary Boltzmann equation, exponential moments are generated instantaneously up to order gamma 2. They will actually show that if one kernel has a gamma i denotes potential of the gamma 2 is the denotes potential for the potential rate of the angular kernel gamma 2 Q2, while gamma 3 represents potential rate for Q3. So then one can actually pick the maximum of these two. These two. The other really interesting thing is that generation of exponential moments happens even if one of the gammas is zero. So gamma being one of the gamma being zero means corresponding scenario is Maxwell molecule. And this is in contrast with the binary Boltzmann equation for the Maxwell molecules, in which case generation of exponential moments is not known to happen. Okay, so people didn't know before whether it happens or not. Know before whether it happens or not. So now it's simply not known to happen, but now when you have this equation, you can play, you can take one of them to be positive, and then you can get generation of moments, even when you have maximum molecules. So there are various types of theorems that we prove in that paper. I will not put all of them since I'm in minus one minute time. So here is the statement of the theorem, just the one that I illustrated in words. So generation of exponential moments is if you have t positive. Moments is if you have t positive and f solution of the binary ternary Boltzmann equation corresponding to initial data in L1 weighted, L12, and F0 greater than or equal to zero, then there exist these two constants A1 and C, here they are, depending on all the relevant parameters, on the kernels, basically, and the rates, such that when you integrate F against exponential, but you integrate it with the order, which is bracket of V to the gamma. Bracket of V to the gamma where gamma is maximum of gamma 2, gamma 3, and you require this maximum to be positive, then you have boundness of that. So you have instantaneous generation of more exponential moments of the order which is bigger of the two gammas. Okay. Then again, this is in words, really. You can pick the bigger one, or you can actually pick one of them to be zero, as long as the other one is positive. So you can talk about maximum molecules. Positive, so you can talk about maximum molecules. You might wonder why is that? Why do we have this better behavior? And there are crucial estimates for this to happen is this estimate that there are better collision operator estimates thanks to having binary and ternary operator. So we prove that when you integrate collisional operator against bracket of V to the Q for any Q positive, what you get is the negative. There are these terms here. Is the negative? There are these terms here that I'm that depend on the moments of order two and moments of order q, but then usually this will, and then what you get on the right-hand side is also minus. I try to put green color here. I don't know if it's visible. Minus, you have the shifted moments of Q with respect to gamma two and shifted moment of Q with respect to gamma three. So you have you are subtracting more on the right-hand side. Consequently, your moment when you write. Um, moment when you write moment inequality, you have better behavior because of this, but of course, that doesn't mean that the job is done immediately. You still one has to work for the exponential moments to show generation. And we use the method of Alonso and collaborators, where we use this partial summability method, and we still have to show that they behave nicely and so on. So, if you on the other hand wonder why we can get this, this is related to the new angular estimate for the ternary kernel. Angular estimate for the ternary kernel, Povser type estimate, and then putting it together with the non-Povsner, one can get this. But I am beyond time for minutes, so I think I'll stop. Thank you. So I'm curious about the physics of the system. Because I mean, when we have the binary. When we have the binary collision term, we can understand that the characteristic length scale over which the particles interact is like the physical diameter of the molecules. But now you say that for the ternary collision, there's like a longer scale over which the three particle interaction happens. And if you have more high-order collision operators, I guess you have even higher length scales that somehow appear from the system. Could you comment on how they sort of emerge or how they're related to the physics? What are those length scales? How are those three parts? Scales, what are how are those three particle four particle forces created? This is a good question for now. We looked at it, we are mathematicians, PD people, or precisely. So, we look at it really from a mathematical point of view, so where we have this range of scales, am I right? And you are going into higher order approximation in some sense. Our explanation for that is this, sorry, let me go to one of the pictures that I have that are relevant. So, for example, here that you can have exactly as you can see. Here, that you can have exactly as you said: that you have hard spheres, they're interacting binary, but you allow that another particle approaches. And if it approaches enough, that's going to be considered ternary, and it will produce the ternary collisional operator. And again, as you hinted upon, one can and what we are trying to do, imagine one more particle here. So then, if the four, if the collective of the four is closed in whatever that distance is, we would have q4 and so on. Have Q4 and so on. So it's some sort of looking at the system that's in front of us, but with a different lens, so that you could consider not only how they interact binary, but how they interact if you go into finer and finer scales. So, but again, I don't know. Our understanding is that we interpreted that these papers that talk about colloids want to do something like that. Want to do something like that. Of course, they're doing the physics paper, they're doing something different. So, there is still a question of how this exactly interacts with physics or with chemistry. That's something to be explored. What we did not know immediately, once we derived it, of course, we talked with Irena and Irena told us, like, guys, you have to analyze it.
