Thank you so much, Martin. Thanks to the organizers for bringing up such an amazing event. So today I'm going to talk to you about the classification for the motifs of projective homogeneous motives or the motives projective homogeneous varieties Of course, we have to fix the motifs we are working with, so it will be this category of motives with coefficients. So, those will be show motifs. F will be orbased. For the coefficients, we will be working with coefficients in a finite logarrane. So this is the main category of interest and the one for the application which is the most important. And so I'm going to make some assumptions in this talk. So the following. So first I mean I will just take annotation for varieties and it will always be projective homogeneous. So by this I mean that there is an action of a semi-simple group on this and the viet T becomes isomorphic to a quotient by a parabolic support after some extension. And the second one is that I bring some restriction on the group acting where growth will be supposed to be of inner type. So it means that there is an action of the ab circular book on the Dickin diagram of the books, and we assume it's trigger. It's the star action. With next, the segment must Which makes the statements much easier this way. Like screwing on the link in the room. So, all the results I'm going to mention are true if the group is more generally P inner, so it means it becomes of inner text of a P power field extension, if P is the residue characteristic of this ring of coefficients. Outside of this context, all the results are wrong, they don't work. That's why it's the good framework. So, testing this one works for Isma T, it's a long story. It started like more than 30 years ago. In the case of SEPA data strip, in this case, those multi-s are similar. And so, then actually, the multi in this situation is determined by the toncalibrinion of the. Determined by the total equilibrium of the right. Because in this situation, those varieties are similar. And so the main starting point is to try to define some like more generalized concrete polynomials which are useful for any field. And this is the notion of temperatures I'm going to. And this is the notion of tail trace I'm going to define right now. So definition. So the data is of object homogeneous IT of X. So it's a direct summary of So it's a direct semantic module, which is pure tech, and it's the biggest one. So with coefficient under. So I will draw this kind of with coefficient under after because it will be always clear from the context. So this pure type directs among the material x and x. We've questions in lambda of maximum ranks, or the biggest one. Okay, so let's give some examples. So can you put what lambda is? It's a ring of coefficients. So it's a finite local ring. Finite local ring. Which one do you have in mind? Okay. Actually you can show that if you in the end, I mean if you if you go from lambda to the third field, it doesn't change the modility composition, it's relevant composition in negative, and then you can just reduce to Fp for example. I wanted to make sure that every relevant but lambda was yeah, so you can take lambda equal to F P into this equal continuous. I mean actually this generally shows that I mean F P is the most important one. F p is the most important one. So, the first example is that, well, validity which are varsional points. So, if x has a variational point, then it gives the recycle, of course. So, you can open it equally. So, the details of fixes is integral. The converse is not true, but actually, so this condition. True, but actually, so this condition about getting the temperature is non-zero is equivalent to the fact that there is a zero-cyclonics of the Greek operating to the characteristic or of P. So, this is a little exercise. The second example is the case of C-bar sp in this case, X is signal, so it has a signal structure. So, So each motif is just a sum of tape motifs and one so the tatrace is everything. And as you probably know, I mean this area decomposition is completely determined by the structure of the group. So for instance, if you're looking at glass finance, you have U, Tableau, etc. So we won't need this in the second. Okay, so sometimes the tail trust can be zero. Sometimes the tail trust can be zero, sometimes it is automatic. And of course, there are intermediate situations. The famous one is the one of quadratics, it was determined by host. Following, which is a Q projective quadratic dimension D here I'm toler I'm taking longer to be F two, we take two. To be F2, we take two, which is the most interesting case. Here is the V decomposition of the quality form associated to this. And so there is a waste decomposition. It shows that the motifs the demotives of Q. So it's the motif of the anisotropic The anisotropic quadric, so shit to this. So here I write it this way, but those are direct sounds. It's just formal, because it makes the notation lighter or later. So a certain scheme of tablets. So by spring earth, So, by spring alpha, M there is no technology inside this. So, let me trace it with the only remaining part, the purest part, which is this quadratic. So, the only thing I wanted to express here is that for projective codecs, the data of the tetrace is exactly the same as the data of the dimension B and the beat index M. So, if you know Trace, you know M and the R. So, the main method. So, the main method we were looking at at the beginning is whether we could classify the motives of objective origins of this data. That is, we wanted the following. We take two projective regional variables. We want to show that vermotive We want to show that biomorphisms are isomorphic if and only if the tetrace are not only equal over the basic but over any fit extension. So, first, so we are going to show this. Actually, we are going to show much more, but I wanted to point out two things. So, the first is Point out two things. So, the first is that here, this result doesn't use the classification of submissible groups. So, here, X and Graph could be for projective, homogeneous, or any submissible group. They have to be the same group. No. No. That's another point here. So, amazing results already in the literature, such as we know when the motifs are positive products or isomorphic, this is such as Criteria. We know when the motifs are severely probable or isomorphic, this is Nikita's. But here, I mean. Here, I mean, it happens sometimes that the motive of saving a variety could be as motivated to do one of a codec. So, yeah, we disclose. And the other thing I wanted to point out is that here for simplicity, I just took all the extensions, but it's not your question to say, do we really need all these extensions? And I don't know if you all have the time to talk about it, but I mean, in the end, we only need a finite number of search, and we have a process control on which extensions are needed. So, the main tool to all this is first to forget about the problem and to use the theory of automatic, which is due to Captain Car. So, the first thing I'm going to say to state is to put some pre-order relation on the class of. Order operation on the class of smooth projective yet. It's kind of semi-classical stuff. So we say that x longer than x. Y if the temperature of y over the functions is x, so the idea of y t is not terrible. So this connection, I mean, it's I mean, it's a little exercise to show that it corresponds to a classical relation, which I don't know, I saw this correlation in the works of Sussein, Rorotsky, Vischy, Garbico, Marco, but I don't know where it comes from, but it's very useful for our purpose. And so if we take a projective modulus variety, hex, also. I will denote it like this, notation this. And I will say that the varieties are longer equivalent. The varieties are lambda equivalent if a dominant each. Why has zero cycle dv to q over the function? Yeah, but the thing is that here, I mean, it could be a lambda shifted by non-zero. And shifted by null zero. Yeah, which should. So you just have to show here that if a variety has non-trivial trace, then it contains a lambda zero in Venice system. I mean, at first glance, you can rethink of this just like the local version in P of having a rational map from X to Y. You will based the notion of having a rational point based on a local point to P. Okay, so now I've done very fast digestive alternatives. So if you start off with a variety, x project is mogeneous, you can associate with this alternative. And the way to define it is to say that it's an integral it's a summand of uh of x which satisfies two properties. Satisfies two properties. Definitely an indicoposar direct amount of the multi-covex such that its state trace is non-zero of L, well, contains non-zero of L single vertical. So it's a tech multi shifted by zero. So I mean it's well defined because of I mean it's well defined only up to isomorphism and of course if you change the ring of coefficients you get another automatic choice. So you have another automatic for each choice of ring of coefficients. And then these motifs, they encourage a lot of geometry of the variety, not only its canonical dimension. But the good thing with them is that they are much more easy to classify by the motives of varieties. So there is this proposition. So two of the motives are isomorphic if and only if div x and y are equivalent. And it's the same thing for change CPS team developer phishing. But now what I want to do is just the first trick is that we want to forget about YIT. So I'm going to consider a new category, which is the category setup YT by generated by those other motifs. So this is the category we call IMOTI. Let's define this category, which is very natural. So I'm considering a sub-category of the motif which consists of direct sums of other motives. I marked mundane is the subcategory of the category of maturity generated by tetris of automatics. So let's be concrete. If you take an object like this, so it's an object M, which is isomorphic to some direct sum of twists or parameters. Those are peer project human genes by T. Here project human gene validity. Both the n and i's are integers. And then I'm just going to attach two very natural invariants to m. So the first is when the motive starts in some sense. It's like the minimum of this mi. It's what we call the hook of m. It's the hook of vector, and the second one is the number of factors. So here, scale is the number of factors. Let's call it BM. So this is where different So, this is well different because there is a Cauchman property here, so there is always the same number of factors. So, what we're going to do actually is not to prove the Catalan form, the motivation of RT, but actually inside this category. So, this is the following remote. Of course, you can develop the trace of an albitro. Of course, you can develop the trace of an arbitrary emoji, but in the same way. So, you can check examples between motifs in IMOD, identify trace of an ID field extension. And then there is a very nice concept of Carpenko, which states that if we take a motif of a project homogeneous motif, then actually it's inside this category I want. So it will His category I want. So it will solve the problem. It's nice to remember. So if M is a summary of the motive of the projective motivational variety, then M belongs to this category. In other words, if you take the motive, a direct summary and the motive of a projective reduced motive, then it's isomorphic to a finite direction of alternative or some other varieties. With the multi-developed change or we won't use it, I mean we will use it only if you want to specify the details, but actually there is Nikita clear. Those are projective and the for the symbol. But of course not the same. For the same. But of course, not the same, but for the same. And the good thing is that now that we formulate this in this context, there is a very cute proof, I think, a proof which is very like a little trick. And we can probably give out too much harm. So, yeah, just one like to point out. With this, we saw it's much more. With this, we so it's much more much better than the classification for the projective, it's also for all directions. It's much, much better. So this direction is clear. I mean, it's easy. The only one we have something to do. So what I'm going to do is that I'm going to make an induction on the number of vectors of n and n maximum. If these are all the automotives are trivial. Okay? So let's write up automotives. So you have the first one, M. Let's work this way. Okay. So another one, L.A. One of the things. So we're going to decipher what we can get with this property on tetrax. So if you look at E to be the several photos, so one important thing, we actually don't really need So one important thing, we actually don't really need this, but the proof is easier to explain like. What we have, we have like the take trace of M is the same as the take trace of M, property. So, but here it's the whole motif, so those motifs are actually isomorphic, and thus we have the start of the same place. So, and twisting, we can. So and twisting, we can assume that both start at zero. So it starts at zero, but of course there is a remaining note. So here we just keep everything which is shifted by more than zero, so it's called m this. Um this. Okay. Now I'm going to choose well some confidence function and natural one is to look what your on the photoshop of this. If you look on the philosophy of this one, so you know that the tetrace of M or this is the same as the tetrace of M or this. And what we know is that about this function field, this variety is isotropic, so there is a number zero, already. So it contains. So what can we deduce for it? Well, we know that over this field extension, there are some lambda zero here. It could not be inside this because the shift is too big. So there is one of the yi which is Plato. Yi, which is split off by this extension. Means that over this field extension, the one I11x, such one dominates I. Then, well, we don't know what to do, so the only thing we can We don't know what to do, so the only thing we can do is keep it on. So let's let's take the function phen of this y I one. So for E, we have the function phene of this y i1. Well, same business. You have a telemotive number here, so you have a 10-motive number here, so one of the i is split off by this extension. So there is vector, that's one more k substrate one more. Such that one dominates this i vector. So let's write this down. So here we have this ux by one 50 by 0. Here we have this mu x by 2 shifted by 0. We have shown that this y t dominates is 1 and this y t dominates is 1. And of course if I two was equal to 1, then both y T would be equivalent and we'd be happy, but yes. And we'll be happy, but yes, but it's not the case. Again, we don't know what to do, but well, at least we can keep on. Yeah, so let's keep on. We're taking the function of this. And here we get an I3 and a YI3, which is bitter by this Ix I2. And keeping on, we construct a sequence which is decreasing. Keeping on. We get a decreasing sequence x1, greater than 1, 2, 3. And of course, as there is only a finite number of IT here, at some point it loops. And so if it loops, it means that you can choose it to be constant at some point. You can choose it to be constant at some point. So it's not true at the beginning that i2 is equal to 1, but after some time there are two values here and here which are equivalent. So there are some alpha beta such that x alpha and y delta are equivalent. The type of equivalence. So now we can just change again the way we want to reconsider the motives. From scratch. So you keep w the beta fifty by zero, plus something, w y beta fifty by zero plus something. So, as the motives are equivalent, this is isomorphic. And those motives, we removed a factor. So, by induction, we have the same details because it's just given by the difference, the trace of n this. And so, by induction, you get that those notes are isomorphic, and it's an initial. So, it's really a little trick. But the thing is that we needed a class of objects which. We needed a class of objects which is stable upon removing objects, removing a summon, which is not the case for varieties in general. That's why it's interesting to pass through the side. So, let's get on to some applications now. So, the good thing is that, as we are going to see after, this state tracing can be expressed in terms of ticks index. For the quality problems, we saw it's the same as the lit index, so we really get the criteria for all the classical criteria. Can be we found very just directly from this current. So there is this tutorial. So if you take Take Q prime project provides and the remote isomorphic. If and only if for any field expression, the pit index of Q and Q prime are the same and if the dimension of the variety is the same, so it's if you're just You're just exactly saying that the tattoos is the same as given and determined for the y. You're just rephrasing this for the expression of the tattoos. So, another example. For instance, we can look at both MRIs. So, for both MVRITs, this is not very complicated. It's not the simplest case. Either there is no text motive, or there is one, but if there is one, the group is split. So, it's pure text. So, it's kind of a generic problem. Deny problem. So, if you take them of the same type, just I mean, it's just necessary, of course. Just so that the rank of the job will be the same after splitting. Of the same type. H1, the corresponding Oh yes, yes then the modules of x and y are isomorphic if and only if they are equivalent. So this is this is more or less known through the work of I mean it's quite in several papers but it's I mean it's it's in Carmé Seminov Preserves Emuli. So, to give another example of quantities which are non-isomorphic but with isomorphic multi, for instance, you can look at groups of type G2. So, this is an example computed by Bonnet a long time ago. The gen of type G2 that the vertices of this diagram and you get the associated Diagram, and you get your associated varieties x alpha and x beta. Then the motto of x alpha is isomorphic to multiple x beta. It's always true. And those varieties are not isomorphic varieties. And why? Because let's put this because we have a very clear expression of the data of these varieties. So this t trace. Let's take trace equal to so it's like some of five. Again, it's just a condition in the group and you can show that it's exactly the same for tattoos. Overall extensions. In the same way, you can put the criteria for involution varieties, etc. And so now this I mean the thing which is a bit hidden around around that is that the datace is related to classical invariant, so you in some sense it's related to the to the TC text. To the TC text, of course. So let's do it now. Do you write it again? I'm controlling. So I will write another application which I think is kind of surprising. At least it surprised me. So I take three quadratic, so it's a concentration problem. And it doesn't hold if you change the ring of coefficients. This is basically to this situation. Was it homogeneous? We assume that y dominates x and x dominates z. Then Then if the motifs of the progress are homotic, you can simplify the rise. And this thing, I mean, without writing the book completely, it mainly just relies on the fact that the datace of a tensor product, of a product of IT is the tensor product of a data trace. So if you notice and you put this hypothesis that there is no joke, this means that from the tetrace of the product, you can reconstruct the tetrace of the second vector. You can just simplify and remove the dots. Now let's move on to groups, three simple groups. Oh, sorry. Thank you. So, here I'm going to make a very sketchy and very fast definition of T syntaxes. So, you start from a group J, semi-simple. You can attach to it in Ziking diagram. And studying the isotopy of this group, you can attach to it its T-syntax. So, remember that if you take a subset of the vertices of the Z-Skinma, you can associate to it like a variety of parabolic substitutes. This is rejection. This is rejection. We define the t-sh index as follows. So the t index. So it's the t-sync diagram which is curled is this thing curled in the following way. So vertex I is colour or second if the value associated to this subset is isotopic, isotopic. So, now with this, we can make a link between the multi-project homogeneous values and the SIP syntax reports kind of slightly technical statement. So we take number of residual test P we take two groups of the same type So being of the same type means they have the same Dicken diagram so it's by means of there is an isomorphism between their Dicken agronom. Because they are D kilograms of an iso fish now, so we have a condition for kids index. So the following are equivalent. So the first condition is that So the first condition is that, yeah, so I fix fix I fix a subset of the mark G. So for any subset containing this subset, the motion is isomorphic, or the y is associated. This is This is the condition for motifs. And it is a condition for tits index, which is the following. It's a bit more complicated. So for any federal extension, which is p-special extension. So it means there is only p to the finite extension. only P to the finite extension and P s people agree? So we have so the variety x theta 0 g each as a rational point if and only if the corresponding one was 0. And the second thing is that over the field extension on which it is the case, then the tits index are the same. So it's just like the tits index are the same, but only over the extension which are isotropic fields for these ideas. So finally that search exemption file Don't effect is a is magnification get ready for the dis index of G E and of G prime E. So the proof of this is not too short, but I mean not too complicated I guess because so the main point is clear we are using the Channel Subkill MacodiF decomposition and if you read it carefully it tells you that the titrace of the projective over us MIT is completely determined by the data of this T C index. So if you have the same T C index If you have the same teeth index for all these field extensions by channels of Guillermo Collier decompositions in the isotropic case, then there is the same type trace or there are any field extension, and once we can just use the field analog to prove this condition two, E over F, is a algebraic extension or? No, it's a max, that is any necessary you want it to be PC. You want E to be P special field, but extension not necessary algebraic. So you can take the P special closure of function fields. This is the main example very well. So here I put just P special field exception to have one point and then the oscillators agree well. So just to remove the statements less. So to finish with all this, I would like to talk about some perspective on this call. So first, So first there is well nothing. So first the technique we use shows that this category I mod is kind of interesting because when you get all of this the results don't off. So well it raises the question which varieties are dermatic which belongs to this. It's very open question, an interesting question to have an idea of varieties which uh whose motives belong to this. Vices which was much belong to this. So one should construct examples. Also, well, there is a conjecture of Bartman. I mean, those motifs, so we showed that the data determines the motifs, the direct factors for producing motivation. But one could see these motifs in Rovo's keys, triangulated motifs. And here we just can, for instance, consider the triangulated category generative body. And actually, I didn't know about this, but it's Actually, I did not know about this, but it's a conjecture of Bachmann that it's something which is, in our case, the date trace, which is the isotopic multivic resolution. In our case, it's just the date trace. And so, what we show here is Bachmann conjecture for multivariate amounts, and it only remains to show this for codes. So, it's a very big step towards Barthmann conjecture. I hope we can discuss this with social discussions. Questions? So you said that this only works for groups of inner type? Is it obvious that it fails for other types, or is it kind of subtle that character examples are complicated? I mean, decoter examples are not very complicated, but it's subtle for them. So, it's a photo example, which is actually contained in the work of Kapenko, and this Katrinko projects. So, you can just consider, even it's already true in the case of Artin motives, Artine technologies. So, if you take extension and consider the You can consider the spectrum of this motif. And you can consider equations in not p equal 2, so in its sense it's enough, but it's a direct summit of the multi-focused quadrick with multivale discounts. It appears as a direct summit of no example, it's typically good. And if you compute the endomorphism, And if you compute the undermorphism, the marine of this, it's possible to find some, you get that this motif, it will have two nerve excellence, M and M. So this is the complex decomposition. But both motifs, M and M, you can show that they are not isomorphic. But this motif, either it has zero data or a complete space. So it means that those two motifs, we have the same data. We have any field extension, but we are not isomorphic. So even in this single So, even in this simple case, it doesn't work for the case because this is a two-in-a-with questions in FPP. So, yeah, so my something I forgot to repel as a perspective is that when we sent this to Stefan Guern, he told us that instead of the tetrace, we could take the zero-dimensional part of it, which would be not only the data, but also the spectrum of the field extension. And well, I'm not sure, but I guess that. But I'm not sure, but I guess that perhaps if you want to remove this P now assumption, we should not take the tech trace, but this artin tech trace. Should we just not take only direction of not pure tech motifs, but pure tech motif plus like motifs of the audio-management of motifs. Spectrum of extension. So that's another like things we would like to look at in the future. Your general results you will cover all known. General result, you will cover all known material isomorphisms, which is good, but can you give? I mean, I did not dig into it, but the fact that with Chanso-Ginner Korea's decompositions, I mean, if you take any motive, I mean, you know that the upper motives are isomorphic, so they are anisotropic on the same field, and on the field on which they are isotropic, then you can put it in the computer and it will give you the full trace in terms of the data of the groups, so of the Data of the groups of the tits index and the subset. So, I mean, it's not very, I mean, we could compute plenty of examples with generic, generic stitch varieties, yeah, but it's more or less normal. But, I mean, just with your computer and on the wheel, you can get many new examples, but I did not explain why you call this category I, Mojiv, and your category. Yeah, it's because of, I mean, it's not. So, I mean, it's not just for you or it's not a very mathematical reason. So, it's just because, I mean, when Nikita created this motif in French, he calls it superior. So, in English, it's upper. But I think here it's not only upper motif, it's also take twists. And take twists of upper motifs is called initial motifs, for instance, by Bono Carl. So, I took initial. That's one question. The problem is medical, but yeah, that's why it's initial. I wanted to make the distinction between shifted by zero and allowing shifts. Problem what you call the hook, it's actually a valuation. Have the equal valuation. The first and normal zero. Especially with respect to the formula, the probability is the bit as well.
