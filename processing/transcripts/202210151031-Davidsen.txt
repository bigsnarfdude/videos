Today I'll talk about some of the topics also that were the focus of Chris's research and one of them was Chimera States. For those of you who were at the new RAI meeting in Seattle a couple of weeks back, this will be very similar, if not identical, to what I spoke about there, so I apologize for that. The work I'm going to present obviously was not done in isolation by myself. There's lots of members, different collaborators involved within the complexity sciences group. Within the complexity sciences group, Wilton is obviously here. Javier Landi is the new, he's now the new CRC chair, which you just recently hired, and a whole bunch of students and postdocs here, Maria Marsolover, David Kurek, Mohamed Yagubi, and Daniel Koczynski. And it's also quite a bit of contribution from collaborators. Rujid is here, so some of the data you'll see is from his lab and group, so I all grouped them at the Campus Opera Neurosciences at Calgary as well as. Calgary, as well as the University of Lethbridge, and there are also some international collaborators. Okay, so what are Chimera states? Let's start with that. And I'm not sure, is that bright enough? Yes. Okay. So we'll look at a little video clip here. So what do we see on the top? We see metronomes. And we see four metronomes on the left, four on the right. As you can see, on the left, they seem to be synchronized, so we shine a line on them. So we shine a line on them, you see they do all the same. On the right, they're all over the place. So, this is despite the fact that all the metronomes are tuned exactly to the same frequency. So, when they're in isolation, they will do this. Let me just start this again here. So, in isolation, all oscillators here, all metronomes will be identical and will do exactly the same thing. Nevertheless, when you start them, you prefer under a certain initial condition, the one group synchronizes and the other one does not. The one group synchronizes and the other one does not. They're also coupled across, so they're strongly coupled within themselves and then weakly coupled across groups. So, this is one of these hormones, this coexistence of synchronization and desynchronization, even the presence when everything is identical. In the sense the oscillators are identical, the coupling is identical. So, that was a phenomenon that was first, well, it's not clear if it was discovered, but at least. So, clear was it discovered, but at least advertised by Kromoto back in the early 2000s, and then later by Steve Sturatz. He actually coined the term Chimera States for this. And I said, Mathematically, that was kind of weird because it's some sort of a symmetry grading. Yes, indeed. I mean, it's a Greek name. Why did he came in Chimera? I mean, what was the connection between physical? Yeah, so Chimera is basically these two-headed. Three-headed three-headed. Well, that is problematic. I think the interpretation was. Biology is an obvious thing. So the mango backs with three scroll rats, so he was going with two separate animals, and that's why he coined the term. And I think it really, even though Cromwell did the early work, it didn't really get a lot of attention until Steve Stories is very good at coining things, right? Giving him names, advertised everybody with his name. And so these chimera states, I mean, So, these chimera states, I mean, here's a very simple experiment. You can also see that if you have systems that show spiral waves, so there, the analog would be of regular waves, patterns are far away from the core, and the core, you get these unsynchronized oscillators that flip back and forth all the time. There are also 3D analogs related to score waves and notes. I don't really want to go into detail here. So, that's the phenomenon. And we see a simple experiment. We have some theoretical understanding of these sets related to symmetry, spontaneous. As sets related to neurosimetry, spontaneous symmetry breaking. But what's the role in neuroscience? And now we'll try to connect it to the topic of the workshop, epilepsy, because epilepsy is one potential candidate where these chamyer states might play a role. So the first proposition, though, in neuroscience was related to human hemispheric sleep. So dolphins and also certain birds, they do is they sleep with half of the brain and they can switch sometimes the left hemisphere, sometimes the right. Sometimes the left temperature, sometimes the right. And you want to interpret it as saying, well, one of them is in synchronized state, the other one is in unsynchronized state. That's obviously a very loose connection. And I'll talk a little bit later about how we try to make progress with the data from Majit's lab. And on the other hand, we have these epileptic seizures, we already heard a little bit about this morning. So there, what seems to be happening is that before seizures occurs, at least in certain Seizures occur, at least in certain cases, you see that some of them, I think on the next slide, I'll show what the experiment setup is, some of these large-scale oscillators will synchronize, others will not, and then you go after seizure, this is called. So there's something potentially a precursor of epilepsy in the sense of the chimera-like state that shows up before. Now, here's the way they recorded it. So they have a different channel. Recorded it. So they have a different channel, so I think about the order of 80 channels. Here's a technique, and they record it over different parts of the brain. The question here then becomes a little bit, in the example with the metronomes, right? Each unit was an oscillator. Here, they record from brain regions. So, which obviously have internal structure, they're made up of lots of neurons. Of lots of neurons, astrocytes, whatever, whatnot is in there. So it's not very clear. Well, if you see in this channel peripheration, which is basically an artifact of your observational tool, because you don't have a finer resolution, that's how you get these channels, what these things would be. Can we really think of them in terms of oscillators? So those are the types of questions I want to address first, namely, how can a chimeric state emerge at all and neural At all, and neural systems? And then, also, how does it go? Can it go between scales? If you think about it, if you have this perspective of individual nerve cells, how would that pertain to this brain region view? Why do we see a chimeras there at this more macro scale? How does this underlying micro scale dynamics lead to this? So, those are the questions I want to focus on initially. And so, we looked at this question. So, most of this work is done by So, most of this work is done by Maria Masoliver, together with Wilton and myself. And the idea was then to train biologically relevant neural systems to show this type of behavior. And here we go with a recurring neural network. And that means we'll just train it. So we'll give it to learn as a chimera pattern and then see, can it A, learn it? Can it learn it B under biological constraints? For example, Dale's law. For example, Dale's law, the ratio between incipitory and high inhibitory connection, and some others of that sort. And then, what does it actually look like? What's the internal structure to answer the question, how does it arise, how does it go, how does the micro scale dynamics relate to what we see on the microscope. So here's a little bit of mathematical layout of the methods, the fourth method, and I will most happily take any questions related to that. The system we looked on, we used to do the On, I used to for the training purposes very much all metronome pictures. So let me play a little video blip here. So we have the simplest incarnation, we have six oscillators. And you see the one community is synchronized, so they have all three dots on top of each other, and the other three are not synchronized. It's the same setup. They are strongly coupled within, weakly coupled across. And here you can see the time series. For mathematicians here, it's just a formula, it's just a simple chromote-zaguchi oscillator. It's just a simple chromote-zaguchi oscillators where you have a coupling term that is cosine, and you have the coupling within one group, which has coupling strengths of mu, and then the crossing two groups with the coupling strengths mu, such that at the end of the day, we really have only two parameters, which is so the detuning between these two, which is basically covered here by this parameter A, and the second parameter we have. Parameter A, and the second parameter we have left is beta, which is the phase angle. You don't want to have them, so there can be phase lag between the two of them. So there's only two parameters left in this type of model. And it's one of the standard models for Chimera systems to study mathematics. Now, so that's what we used for learning purposes for our recurring neural network. Here you see basically the supervisor that's just discussed, and then we train it in the network output. We train it in the network output, you can see down here, and it's indeed the system as expected. So that's great news. Not necessarily unexpected because this recurring neural network should in principle be able to approximate any dynamics, any type of dynamics. However, the more interesting part is that we could also recover some of the features you can see in the brain. Now, coming back to the sleeping, right, where we switched from the one. Where we switched from the one hemisphere being synchronized to the other one being synchronized. We were able to also reproduce this. So, here what we see is again these oscillators. And just with a little perturbation, this is the perturbation you'll see in a second, it will kick the synchronized group into the unconsynched state and vice versa over here. So, this is just a high-level summary of the things we found. As I said, we also looked at these biological constraints. Look at these biological constraints. Days law, one of them, sparsility of the network, all of what I showed here holds under these circumstances. So, this means these recurrent neural networks can, under biologically relevant conditions, indeed reproduce a Chimera behavior. It seems very generic and robust. And that then, our takeaway then is that, okay, at least that some sort of reassurance that they in real neuronal systems, biological systems, these mites actually occur. Biological systems, these places might actually occur and they might play a role. The other thing I mentioned is: well, how does this, what happens at the macro scale, relate to the unaligned micro scale? So, this learning here, just to be clear, these six oscillator type of behaviors, that was at the macro scale when you basically have a decoder that somehow separates the output of all the different neurons, which are of the order of 1,000 to 10,000. So, that's where you see. But what do the neurons actually do, the trained ones? Turns out they did not separate. Did not separate. You could have expected, well, maybe one group over here codes for the synchronized group, the other one over here, the other new ones for this unsynchronized one. That's not the case. There seems to be no community structure. So the information is somehow spread out over the whole network, which is to some degree good from a biological point of view, because if some of these neurons were to fail, right, obviously you don't want to lose the whole dynamics of the system. So in this type of robots, it seems to be at play here. Now, the open questions were The open questions we're currently working on is there not direct experimental evidence for chimera states in the context of neuroscience. I mean, I mentioned these examples, but they're very high level and there are quite a few questions. So we're following up with that. And then related to this, and that's what Maria also wrote a proposal about that, a while ago, how can we bring this to bear in the context of epilepsy? So that's here to discuss. It's great that you're here, so hopefully, we get some chance also to talk about that in a little more detail. Okay, so let's see the first part of my talk: the overview of the chimeric stuff I said I kept at a high level. If someone has questions, I can also go in much more detail about these findings. So what I want to do next is I want to go quickly back to the case of sleep. Okay, so I said this there was more analogy that has been made between this unit sleep and chimera states. Can we substantiate? Sleep in chimera states, can we substantiate this? So, what we want to do here is we wanted to tackle from a slightly different perspective. So, we want to look at it from so sleep broadly can be separated out into two classes, the rapid eye movement sleep and not rapid eye movement sleep, REM and non-RAM. They are fundamentally different, these two sleep phases. For example, the type of oscillations you'll see are very different. In the context of the cortex, one can say that the non-RAM phase. One can say that the non-REM phase corresponds to synchronized neural activity, while in the REM sleep and the cortex are other two desynchronized neural activities. So that's our starting point. And here on the right, you can see the three time series. One is the RAM, one is non-RAM, one is awake. So let's ask our mathematicians which one is which? It's funny with that one. Which one do you want? Tony used to be new scientists, right? There's a difference, you're telling me, one's got thicker than others. Well, if there's no difference, which one could you tell why there would know which one would not be different from, I mean, it's red. Would not be different from, I mean, it's random, non-rend, and do wake. Okay, let's solve that first. Yes, sorry. I was about to say the first one, then you can google what the frequencies, you're absolutely right, right? So these are, if you look at the frequency ranges, right? So these are the higher frequencies, these are lower frequencies. And well, the lowest frequency we have here is. Well, the lowest frequency we have here is basically the non-RAM, slow wave. Slow wave, exactly. And then we have the other two. Now it depends, right? RAM and the wave, that's very hard to distinguish. I'm not sure how do you have been able to tell the difference? No, so that's the thing, Joran. Exactly. How do you know these animals are sleeping with one hemisphere if you're showing this activity? You can only know during slowly. Well, come to that in a second. That's where we're going, right? So, this is the perspective. Going right, so this is the perspective grabs it right, that the whole brain is either in REM, non-REM, or awake. So, and the point is that that's not really true. We already talked about the unique hemispheric sleep, but more broadly, it seems that sleep is more a local phenomenon. It's not that the whole brain switches between one and the other, but it has a local component, so that some parts of the brain can be in a way. Of the brain can be in awake state or in a REM state, others are not. There's quite a bit of recent literature here, one really here, and again, I think Majeet would be the expert on that one. So then the question is, okay, if it's like a phenomena where there's a slope of dynamics, how can we understand this? How can we describe it mathematically? So that brings us to this next point, right? What is this coexistence? And again, we'll forget about a wave for now, because even a wave. Forget about awake for now because even awake, right, there appears that some parts of the brain might be asleep. Some of you might know right now. But so we want to focus on the sleep and we want to see what the transitions are between these and how they play out on a local scale. So we're using data from G's lab. It's animals with few natural sleep recordings. A little bit harder to get. That's why the bulk are under aesthetics. Our nanostatics. The analyst is such that it should maintain these transitions between RAM and non-RAM. And it's all white field imaging of the cortex. And we have a little video playing here. So that's the tau data. You get the recording of the cortex, you see how the activity changes the color correspond to the different activity levels. So now, what do we have to do? First, you have to define: okay, whether it's Define, okay, whether a certain pixel or brain region is RAM or non-RAM, so to speak. And one can basically do that, you just look at the power between the two frequency bands. So you look locally for each pixel of the recording if you wish, or you can also do brain regions if you like. You measure, you have the signal, like here, so this of course is a sense of die amplitude, and you look at the power in these two frequency bands, and if the one is threshold value, so you can actually die. Threshold value is significantly larger than the other than in the one state or in the other. And here we see it for one pixel, this type of transition, right? Here's a clear non-RAM signal over here and a RAM signal on the right-hand side. So we can locally establish whether given the region or pixel is in RAM or non-RAM. So if you do that, what you find is that basically typically you have the brain is in a non-RAM state and then you have the REM spreading. The REM spreading through the system. So, on the right, you see, here's again this little snapshot of the movie. Here we have a temporal evolution on the top, and what we have highlighted here are pixels that go into RAM. And now we've color-coded in such a way that if so the picture is it's a spreading, so if one region turns on to be goes into RAM, it will make it more likely that adjacent regions also go into RAM, and you can just track them with a simple clustering algorithm. Track them with a simple clustering algorithm and put them all together. So that means this would be one RAM spreading cascade, and here's another one. They can exist concurrently because they are different regions of the brain. So that's the way we think about this. In terms of the physical literature, the notion of avalanches associated often with this brain cascade, so that's why we call them desynchronization avalanches. And now you can study their properties. So you can ask, well, how are they? You can ask, well, how much do they get? How long do they last? Where do they start? All these types of questions. I'll only focus on the size of these cascades and their duration here. What one finds is, just focus on the solid lines here, that the distributions follow are very broad. They span, as you can see here, in terms of the sizes, five orders of magnitude, right? From really size of individual pixels to ten or thousands. Pixels to tens of thousands of pixels. And then the duration spans about two hours of magnitude. And the distributions follow roughly a power distribution with different exponents here, an exponent tau, 1.44, here with an exponent 2.0. And you can also look and plot how much does the size of this simulation average tell you about the duration. They're obviously not independent, but again, they seem to be scaling with one another. So if you give me the size, okay, there's a certain range of the duration, but typically Certain range of the duration, but typically the average is over here. So you can study this relationship as well. So all of this, this is just summarized here with these different power laws. There are some relations between, I don't really want to go into. Now there's a theory behind this of spreading processes, typically called direct interpolation or branching processes, where a lot of things are known, especially when you're dealing with the mean field limit. And we find that these exponents are very close to these mean field predictions. We can also go over Predictions. We can also go a little bit in more detail here. I think we can skip that. Just to be clear, why is this now? I said this is a critical spreading process. So these power laws, where do they typically show up? Where does this dark perpolation stuff show up? Well, the key is very often when you talk about spreading, and now we're obviously after the pandemic, we're all experts on that, right? There's basically a parameter, which is the R value. It tells you what's going on. If it's less than one, If it's less than 1, your epidemic cascade will die out. If it's bigger than 1, well, there's a finite probability that will never end. And if it's at 1, that's exactly this critical point I talked about. That's what it seems what we find for these desynchronization averages, that somehow the brain has organized itself that it's close to this critical point, which in between these two. And here's just that, I just told you, right, so this would be like the R value, specific case, but initially nothing happens, and then you go into C. Nothing happens and then you go into this epidemic spreading regime and this is base transition. So there's a lot of connection with that. Okay, so let me quickly summarize what we have here. So it looks like that these, we can understand this transitions from non-rem to rem as this transient quadratic synchronization process that spreads. So it's a simple spreading process. It seems to be somehow, for whatever reason, right, at this very close to this critical point. This is very close to this critical point. Now, because we're talking, this is really a transition between synchronization and desynchronization, some sort of an edge of synchronization phase transition, you could argue. Because if you push a little bit further right, the whole system might synchronize and you follow me in the epi-RAM state. But we're just sitting at it that we get these RAM excursions of any size we wish, so to speak. Now, this notion of criticality that you're at a critical point, it's a space transition, that has been debated quite a bit in the context of the brains. Quite a bit in the context of the brain. It's called the critical brain hypothesis. And I'll speak to that in a second. But that's typically disjoint from this synchronization I talked about. So this is the first example where you somehow bring together, well, brain and neural activity synchronization plays an important role, but it also seems to have these criticality type of features if you look at it through this lens. So the open questions, there are quite a few of them here. I mean, the request I showed was. Here, I mean, the records as I showed was on the cortex, right? What's happening in the hippocampus? And again, that's what the problem with Machiti should follow up on that: recording simultaneously with neural pixels from the hippocampus to see what's going on there at the same time. And then also, what's actually the functional role? So, REM is typically associated with memory consolidation. But can we really test this in the context of this new insight of how REM spreads in the brain? Okay, so last. Okay, so last few minutes, let me just spend then on this critical grain hypothesis more broadly. So, criticality we've already talked a little bit about. You should think about in this type of spreading process or this branching process. Here's the mathematicians. Here's just a picture of the simple branching process. And our R value, or here is called sigma, the average number of diet activation. In the context of the brain, would be one neuron fires, it activates in the Fires, it activates in this case three neighbors, which in turn, this guy activates two, this guy doesn't activate anybody, this guy again three, and then the whole thing spreads. So, this historically, this critical brain hypothesis was based on the view of the propagation of information between individual nurses. And then you have the same argument as before, right? If this average activation is low, right, then, well, this activity just dies out eventually, with probability one. With probability one. If this value is bigger than one, well, there's a finite probability that this cascade will never stop. So, in the context of neuroscience, what is this? Well, this means, well, this could be an epileptic seizure or something like this, right? Everything is firing. Total overload. This would be, well, can't really process information, right? So that's why from the neuroscience perspective, it makes sense to be at a point in between, right? Where if the flexibility that the information, maybe it's not going very far, maybe it is propagating the whole way. Maybe it is propaganda the whole way. And that's related to this assumed optimality of the brain in terms of information transfer and being able to respond to stimuli. That's an example I think one of my colleagues always makes. Well, if you see a flower, then your response is, I'll just smell it. Well, if you look at a tiger, then well, you better run. So the responses you have at your disposal for a single input should be very diverse. Be very diverse, and these two pictures will not allow you that, right? Because here will not do anything, here will always be hyperactive, right? So, you want to be somewhere there in the mathematical physical literature. This would be really just one point. Now, there are newer approaches where they broaden it. There's like talking about the Griffith space with a range, then. But that's still to some degree under investigation of the context. But they're just saying that this criticality hypothesis makes some. Hypothesis makes some sense in the context of neuroscience. And there's some theoretical work, and I'll show some of the experimental work in a second that supports this. So, on the experimental side, this goes back to Debar Betz and John Beck's work in the early 2000s. So, what did they do? They just recorded here from neural cultures here, slices of electrodes. So, this is a typical type of pattern you see. It's very persecutivity. If you zoom in, so here's time, this is the different electrodes of the humans. Time, this is the different electrodes or the neurons that fire. If you zoom in, you see, oh, there's a lot of clustering of activity. And the idea was then, okay, if then say they somehow activate together, there's maybe a causal chain, and it's really like the picture, right? One activating the other, then it stops. So that was really these events, these branching trees, right? Start from no activity, then you get maybe an spontaneous input, propagates, and then you stop again. And then they studied these properties and they found exactly what I showed you before in the economics of sleep, namely, you get this power law distribution. Sleep namely, you get these power law distributions, the exponents. Some of them look similar to what you would expect on this mean field example, some are deviate, but there's also no reason to believe that this should be mathematically mean field, right? Because you have obviously feedback loops, so other exponents are fine too. So this was historically the first work on level in nerve cells, and then Dante Gianbo and co-workers have taken this then to the fMRI scale. So what do you do there? You record full brain scale with fMRI. Full brain scale with fMRI. Obviously, you have very low temporal resolution. But what you then say is the same, well, some brain region activates, seems to be some spreading, and then it stops again. So they analyze it exactly the same way. And there's two of these examples. What they find again is that the size distribution of these spreading cascades again follows these power laws indicative of this critical spreading hypothesis or supporting atomists. Okay, so let me wrap up then. Okay, so let me wrap up then with a few open questions and the type of contributions we have been able to make. And I'm happy to talk about that in more detail today or tomorrow. So the one assumption obviously was that, well, since these spikes close in time, right, there's some causal relation. But do we really know that? Is this really causal? Because this temporal binning, yeah, it makes sense, but if you have lots of nerve cells, right, there's spontaneous activation, overlap, right, saw that. Overlap, right? So I was that going to work out. So these two things are some of our question marks here. The other thing, in the culture that I showed you there, mostly we're focusing on bursts. I mean, a lot of nerve cells activate, co-activate in a short period of time, but we also have a lot of numbers to these and then. So what's going on that one, right? In the context of the culture. So that's in vitro. And then in vivo, right? So with live animals, they have behavior. So here we know that depending on the behavior, things can be very different in terms of neural dynamics. Behavior things can be very different in terms of neurodynamics. So, how does that enter this picture? So, we've addressed some of this. So, I think here we have a pretty clear headway what you have to watch out for in order to ensure causality and how you deal with spontaneous activations. It typically requires you that you know really the wiring of the neurons. You need the network structure. Once you have that, you can work with this. If you don't have it, it depends. Okay, so then things are more challenging. So then things are more challenging. Now, what about this bursty versus non-versity? So, there was some mathematical work arguing that if the culture goes into bursty mode, it's critical, and then it's non-versity, it's not critical. So, well, we've worked with Michael Kolikos at Calgary, and we've shown that actually, even the non-bursty regime can be critical. The only thing that changed is the time scale. So, typically, when neurons communicate, it's of the order of milliseconds. Communicate is of the order of milliseconds. So, if you're in the non-versity dynamics, it seems that the time scales show up of the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which we're not sure about right now what that is. A hypothesis is it might be related to astrocytes, because the air dynamics is of the order of hundreds of milliseconds, and we know there's actually feedback between the neurons and the astrocytes going both ways. There's both way communication. So, we're trying to support that with new Girl models as well as more experimental work on that front. Work that front. So that's well, some of it will be in this one here. There's other follow-up work on these lines. Now, the last one is the behavioral side, and that's work we've done with Mojita and also Aaron. And it looks like behavior plays a very important role. Namely, what happens if you go, let's say, from one behavior to another, like if you talk about nice, right, going from a standing position to running position, you'll see different neurons are active, obviously. Active, obviously. However, if you treat these separately, right, let's say before the onset of running and after the onset of running, look at them, it seems that even though different nerve cells activate, they activate with very similar patterns, namely they have this scale-free type of behavior that I talked about. So it's just that the subset of cells are responsible might be different, but the statistical properties seem to be the same. So, well, some of this is published, some of this is in the progress, and that's another area where 24 helps. 24 helps. Okay, so hopefully that has been set the stage for some further discussion, and let me stop here. Thank you for your attention. So we go back and we're going to be following.
