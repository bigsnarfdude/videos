All right. All right. Good evening, everybody. Thanks for sticking around to see my club. I'm going to change gears a little bit. No yield of stress. Potential aluminum. Even though Ian was trying to convince me to give a talk on yield of stress, but I decided to give a talk. But I decided to give a talk on Forest Media. Assuming in the yellow stress food? Yes, it's assuming in the yellow stress food. But if you are interested in learning a little bit more about assuming yellow stress food, I would be more happy to discuss it with you later on. But I decided to choose Porus Media, but then the approximation that I'm going to use for Porus Media is the spherical chicken approximation. Which is, I apologize if you don't find it really people. So, I'm going to talk about magnetophoresis of metal salts in porous media. And this is a contribution from my graduate students, Alval and Lambeth, who've actually done a fantastic job on doing extra computation. But before doing so, let me just tell you a little bit about research in my lab. So the research in my lab uses the fundamentals of transfer phenomena and reality by combining experiments, techniques such as rheo optics, NMR imaging, rho-NMR, spectroscopy, microfluidics. Spectroscopy microfluidics with continuum modeling, a little bit of modeling, to tackle problems that are of fundamental importance to the science and also applied sciences. So for example, I look at elastic instabilities. We've learned about elastic instabilities in polymers. So we look at elastic instabilities in Taylor Coincil using world-mike micelles that exhibit a really particular behavior called shear banding. We also look at particle transport in magma-field, which is going to be a focus. Which is going to be a focus of my today's talk. We also look at problems that have bio-related application, specifically, you know, interaction between biotherapeutics for the interface, similar to what Gioani talked about, except that now we have a protein that gets to the interface. And also, we have some problems that are related to yield stress. And with application medicine health, specifically, we looked at recently a problem involving cavitation in the yellow. Involving cavitation in the yellow stress wood, and as well as locomotion in the yellow stress wood. So, if you're interested in learning about this subject areas, I would probably be more than happy to discuss. But aside from this, let's come back to the topic of my today's talk, which is about magnetically assisted transfer particles. So, let me just ask this question: How many of you have heard about magneto-forecises? Raise your hand. Excellent. So, I have. Excellent. So I have at least half of the audience have learned about, know about the magnetofree. So essentially, the technique involves a magnetic material and applying a magnetic field. And it's actually a very interesting technique that provides a clean, environmentally cost-effective method to separate things from each other with a broad range of applications. For example, you know, in separating nanoparticles for drug delivery, not to mention that it's Delivery, not to mention that it's been used for MRI contrast agents and as well as drug water purification. Here's a video showing how superparamagnetic nanoparticles with iron oxide would essentially undergo transport mechanism using a permanent magnet. So, if you look at the literature on this topic, you will see a myriad number of really interesting papers published that look. Papers published that looked at the interaction of magnetic field and colloidal particles in nanometer, all the way to micrometer Delta scale. And that's not going to be the focus of my today's talk. I'm going to actually scale down things and go back down to Angstrom scale and look at the solutents in much smaller length of scale and study how magnetophoresis would affect the transport of such materials. The triggers. But before doing so, let me just tell you a little bit as to what happens if you have a particle and you impose a magnetic particle and you impose a magnetic field to it. So when you think about it, you can actually back out the amount of energy that is being imposed to this particle with a radius of Rp. That is a dot product of magnetization times magnetic flux density. So this magnetization is actually determines how magnetic the material is. How magnetic the material is, which is really a proportionality constant called the magnetic susceptibility times the magnetic strength of the magnetic field. So, this is really important. It's like you can think of it as a viscosity of the fluid. And this is important because when you think about the fluid mechanics of the problem, you could actually easily differentiate the magnetic energy to give you essentially the amount of force that is being imposed to this magnetic particle. Okay, so depending on this magnetic energy, So, depending on this magnetic susceptibility, materials could be paramagnetic, meaning that they have positive magnetic susceptibility and move towards the magnet. Whereas diamagnetic particles or diamagnetic materials that have negative magnetic susceptibility would be repelled by the magnetic field. And this idea actually has been used to what is the word? I'll forget the word. I forget the word. Suspend the frogs. Levito. Levitate. Exactly. Levitate frogs. So that's a word. Thank you. Yeah, so experimental people actually have used magnetic field to levitate frogs. And by the way, our body is made of water. Water is a time magnetic material. And if you're actually given enough magnetic field, you can actually levitate yourself. Okay? Because of this, the negative magnetic associate. The negative magnets are sort of. But, anyways, so now imagine that this particle is in a fluid medium, right? And it wants its being imposed, so this amount of force is being imposed to it. If it wants to undergo transport in the limit of no inertia, no gravitational forces, the only force that is acting on it is a stochastic, right? You can do it by this. And then, if you do a force balance, you could estimate what the volume. You could estimate what the velocity of the particle would be, or the magnetofer frequencies velocity of the particle would be. Since I really like dimensionless numbers, you could define a magnetic Peclet number that would tell you the importance of the relative importance of magnetic connection compared to diffusion. So hold on to this magnetic Peclet number. I'm going to come back to it because I'm going to critically analyze the experimental results in the context of this magnetic Peclet number. Okay, so let's look at the literature. So let's look at the literature. And it turns out that there's actually limited experimental data reported in the literature involving metal salts under magnetic fields. So let me just start with this experiment. The bottom panel, what you're seeing is a porous media, top view of a porous media, that's sand. It's a silica gel, very simple porous media. And at the beginning, there is a droplet of a transition metalline, copper, placed in it. And if there is no magnetic field, you would imagine that things would radially out, you know, move radially outward due to the diffusion. Move radioly upward due to the diffusion, nothing really surprising. However, when you encose a magnetic, non-uniform magnetic field to it, you could clearly see that the profile is essentially moving towards the highest magnetic field. And this is, you know, sort of a magnetic forest use that has been reported. And these experimental results reported that if you increase the magnetic susceptibility of the metal ion, this travel distance is increased, meaning that the magnetic frequency is somewhat proportional to the magnetic susceptibility. To the magnetic system. And more recently, there are some experiments that have utilized a permanent magnet, a very small permanent magnet with the porous media sitting at the top of it. What they've done was to measure the concentration of a different metal ion. And by the way, this is actually being used in many of the products that you're using nowadays, you know, cell phone, laptops, things like that. And they've shown that if you look at the slice near the permanent magnet surface, you see the kind. Magnet surface, you see the concentration changes as a function of time, meaning that things are, the metal ion is actually moving towards the magnet surface. It's actually magnet force. Alright, so another interesting aspect of these experiments is that this delta C, the change, the total change in concentration at a given time, doesn't seem to be correlated with the magnetic susceptibility in contrast to what is reported in this paper. But even aside from this, coming back to the magnetic Piccolan number. Coming back to the magnetic Pickling number. If you use the size of the metal ion to back out what the magnetic Pickling number is, look at this number. It's very small. What would you expect if you have a really small magnetic percent? Shouldn't have up, right? Exactly. Should have been diffusion. Why is this happening? Magic. So the hypothesis that they put forth was the formation of clusters of metal ions. Formation of clusters of metal ions. Under, apparently, no, the idea was, the hypothesis was under magnetic field, these metal ions do interact with each other and form clusters. And as you could see, this peck lane number is, you know, proportional to the particle size. But this velocity is also proportional to the particle size squared. And that increases dramatically, and that gives rise to the magnetic transfer part of this. But even beside this, there are some limitations. This. There are some limitations in terms of these experiments. When you think about metal salts moving in a porous medium, something that is really important has to be accounted for: is adsorption, is a reaction. Things could get adsorbed to the porous medium that could affect, could get to the magnetic mares. There seems to be some inconsistent results in terms of the effect of magnetic susceptibility. And that kind of motivated us to design an experimental, a combination of experimental and computational study, investigate how. Know, study, investigate how metal ions do undergo magnetofourers. Thank you. Okay? So, in terms of experiments, we use a very simple experimental setup consists of a permanent magnet. And what you're seeing is a 3D printed frame where we use to hold the porous medium at a certain point. The porous media is a very simple silica gel, a bed sand, saturated bed sand, if you will. That's not if you will. And what we do in experiments is that at a given time, we extract the force of the cell and then we slice it into two parts and we divide it to near and far and analyze the concentration in these two different slices as a function of time. And for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to just consider two different metal ions, manganese, which is a paramagnetic metal ion, and on the other end, zinc chloride, which is a diamagnetic. And by the way, these are actually used in the playoffs. By the way, these are actually being used in the plateau microscope. That's part of the application of this process. And we would look at the effect of initial concentration over a really wide range of concentration variations. And here are some sample experimental results. So let me just walk you through what I'm showing here. What you see on the y-axis is the concentration of manganese ions as a function of time for different scenarios. So let me just start with the control experiments. The control experiments. Experiments. The control experiments is experiments that is done in the absence of any magnetic field. So we want to confirm that there is no confounding factor that affects the cell behavior. And that's why we did the control experiments. But when you look at the near slice, you see that the concentration increases as a function of time. And then obviously, since the mass is conserved, the far slice is essentially depleting. Meaning that manganese is actually, over time, is moving towards. Is moving towards the surface of the magnet. When we do the same experiments on a diamagnetic zinc chloride, we see the reverse behavior, meaning that the thing is essentially the zinc is moving away from the magnet surface. And that's something that is expected for a diagnostic treatment. Okay, so one can do a systematic experimental observation, experimental study, looking at different initial concentrations. Interestingly enough, what we found in experiments was that. What we found in experiments was that there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the effect of initial concentration and the amount of change, normalized concentration variation. Something similar to what other researchers have found. Another interesting aspect is that when you compare the magnetic susceptibility of manganese to the zinc, you see almost there is a variation around 20, a factor of 20. But then when you look at the concentration variation, it's almost a factor of 2, around 2. So that's kind of surprising. Around it. So that's kind of surprising. But even more importantly, when we do calculations, when we calculate the python number based on the metal size, the hydration radius of the metal salt, which is like an order of 160 picometer, you see that the python number is actually really low. And we're getting to the same point. Is this due to the formation of clusters of these metal ions under the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field? In order to be able to address this question, In order to be able to address this question, we perform 2D numerical simulations. And this is a multi-physics type of problem where we have to solve the details of the static magnetic field using Gauss and Gauss-Emperor's law. And then that is combined with momentum balance and mass spans, or dirt diffusion equation. And what you can see here is actually the contribution of the magnetic field, as you can see, the magnetic force coming into play. And the way that we take And the way that we take the porous media into account is by using the effective diffusivity, that spherical chicken that was referred to earlier today. Where effective diffusion is given by this equation, where epsilon is essentially the porosity of the porous medium. So that's all I have with the porous medium. I didn't include any details of the porous medium in the system, just except for the effective PC. So the first step is to, you know, measure the magnetic field. Is to measure the magnetic field in this domain, experimental and computational domain. And what you see on the left side, on the left panel, are the results of experiments for a magnetic field around a Tesla, which is actually really significant. Do you know what the magnetic field of the Earth is? Tesla? Oh, very, very close. Yeah, 60 micro Tesla. So even though this is a permanent micro. So, even though this is a permanent magnet, but you can get really high magnetic fields over a really small range of distances. But when we do 2D numerical simulations, by the way, there is no transport here yet. It's just static magnetic field simulations. There seems to be a really good agreement. We've actually compared this to each other. At most, we have 5% difference. And then, the most important thing is the magnetic field gradient that needs to be calculated because that's how we get. Because that's how we get the force, magnetic force, because magnetic force is related to magnetic field gradients. Meaning that if you have a uniform magnetic field, nothing is going to move around. You're not going to get magnetoforesis, at least to extent that you see, until you impose a non-uniform magnetic field. Then you would be able to introduce magnetoforesis. So let's get to this. Again, I'm showing the force relation here. That has two contributions. That has two contributions. I'm going to come back to this. This is so-called magnetic diffusion, this is magnetic convection. But the first thing that I want to do in terms of continuous simulations and experiments is I want to use metal size, metal ion size to calculate what happens to the metal ions in terms of simulations. And here are the experimental results that I showed a few minutes ago, showing changes in concentration. And here is the particle size, or metal ion size, that have been reported for this manganese ion. Been recorded for this manganese line, 160 people here. If you do the calculations, the 2D numerical calculations, you would not expect to see anything whatsoever. Okay? And the same thing holds for zinc, meaning that if these metal ions were to move around, undergo transport individually, nothing should have happened. Okay? So that's the idea of cluster size. They should move in a collective manner under magnetic field. Collective manner under magnetic field. So that's why I'm going to consider constant cluster size in this case. And I'm going to use this RP to be a cluster size as a feeding parameter. The way that I do it is that I look at the final osidious state, if you want to call it a final osidious state, in some cases not, to fit my model, the simulations, to the experiments, and then back out what the RT is, the feedout factor is. Factor is. By the way, in these simulations, nothing is in a fitting parameter except for this RP because that RP will tell me whether they have four clusters and what is the size of each cluster. And by the way, there seems to be a debate in the literature saying that a group, this first school of thought would argue that magnetophoresis is associated, is dominated by magnetic diffusion, especially when it comes to lithium batteries. Whereas there is a second school of thought. Second, you know, a school of thought arguing that magnetic convection is the dominant source of magnetophoresis. And the first thing that we wanted to do in the simulations was see which one is actually causing magnetofluoresis in our experiments. And that's how we did it. It's really nice, you know, in experiments you could observe this. But it's really hard experimentally to take this out and study, you know, how the contribution of this factor, this part is. Whereas in simulations, you can easily turn this off. Simulations, it could easily turn this off and then use this as you know to evaluate what the magnetofree concentration variations. So, if I just use the magnetic diffusion with a particle size that is, or a cluster size that is micro scale, I'm going to come back to it, I'm not going to get anything. So that talks, whereas if I look at the magnetic convection, I'm getting really close to what the experimental results are. And by the way, the dashed line here at least shows the combination of these two factors. Two factors. So, you know, at least these simulations suggest that magnetic convection is responsible, is the dominant mechanism responsible for this magnetic forces. But I'm going to come back to this again because I'm interested to know how this particle size changes as I feed my simulations to the experimental data. So, what you see is, this is both these factors. Again, using RP as a cluster size, as a thing. Using RP as a cluster size, as a feeding parameter, and finding the best match of the experimental data, and the results are reported. There are a couple of observations that we can make, okay, by comparing these simulations and experiments. One, simulations, even though there is fairly good idea over-quasi-steady response of the system, but simulations over-predict experiments on transient times. They could clearly see it. But then, when you look at the cluster size, that is. You look at the cluster size that is fitted, it is a feeding parameter as a function of concentration. You could see that as concentration decreases, the effective cluster size should increase, which is surprising, actually. Because if they were supposed to form clusters, by increasing the initial concentration, you would expect to see more, or even a larger cluster size, which is the other way around. Surprising. And then, more surprising is that the cluster size. Is that the cluster size is bigger for a metal ion that has a lower magnetic system, which is even more surprising. So, for the interest of time, I'm not going to get into these two aspects, but rather I'm going to focus on this, the first bullet point here, which is why we're seeing the overbreachings of experiments by the purpose of our hypothesis is, to give you a punchline, is that if you look at experiments, things are moving slower than C. Things are moving slower than simulations, right? Our hypothesis is that maybe this cluster size is not actually constant, so it evolves as a function of time. As things experience the magnetic field, they form a cluster and the cluster becomes bigger and bigger, so it's a function of, could be a function of time. And when we looked at the literature, yes, it's actually the case for superparamagnetic nanoparticles based on hydro and oxide. So it turns out that there has been very rich literature under out of those. You're under out of those on studying how the cluster size in superparamagnetic nanoparticles change as a function of time. And this is one example experiments. And people have shown that effective cluster size, and this is by the way, on the super paramagnetic nanoparticles, which is different from our case because we are looking at weakly paramagnetic and diamagnetic treatments, is that the cluster size depends on the time to the power of alpha, and then there are some experiments reporting that it actually. Reporting that it actually does depend on the volume fraction, magnetic field intensity. So we thought, okay, let's use this as a starting point and think that the particle size or the clusters, the effective cluster size, is given by this function, is a function of passive fraction times some power of alpha. And then fit the simulations to experiments, find the best match with experiments, and then that's how we can find this alpha angle. Okay? And this is what is shown here. And this is what is shown here. The continuous lines showing the results of numerical simulations using, again, k and alpha as fitting parameters, finding the best match for paramagnetic and diamagnetic metal ions. And the results are tabulated here. Interestingly enough, when you look at this alpha parameter for the paramagnetic metal ion, it does seem to vary a little bit as you change the concentration, which is really interesting. Somewhat consistent with what has been reported with the lip share for superparamagnetic metal. The glitch here for supermagnetic nanoparticles. Whereas for the diamagnetics in chloride, this seems to be a function of initial concentration, which we don't still understand why is that the case. And by the way, we couldn't find any experimental observation of diamagnetic analog origins. That would tell us, inform us where we are in terms of metal ions versus cool. Okay, so I guess I still have a little bit of time, but I have. I guess I still have a little bit of time, but I want to wrap up. So I hope that I showed you some experimental results that were unexpected, by the way, indicating that there is significant, and I use the word significant because when you calculate a Peclet number for this scenario, you shouldn't get anything. But you still see a couple percent changes in concentration, and that's why I think it's significant. Given the Given the magnetic susceptibility of this metal ions. And our hypothesis is that maybe the magnetic field is induced in clusters in the system. And when we look at the experiments, it turns out that the variation in concentration, so this is normalized concentration variation, whether it's depleting or enriching in different slices, does seem to be uncorrelated. Does seem to be uncorrelated with the initial concentration. If you look at it, at the concentrations, you know, enrichment for manganese doesn't seem to be depending on the initial concentration. Whereas for, you know, even for dimitosine chloride, it doesn't seem to be significantly changing its function of initial concentration, which is really surprising because you wouldn't expect that theoretically. You would expect that if the cluster size is at the origin of this behavior, you should form bigger clusters because you have more probability of metal ions. Of metal ions, you know, if you increase the initial concentration to heat each other and form magnets. And then we perform simulations, obviously, looking at different aspects of cluster size. If you use the constant cluster size, simulations show a fairly good idea with experiments, although the cluster size was a different parameter during a quasi-safety zone or window. Whereas during transient times, a constant cluster size always over. Cluster, a constant cluster size always over-predicts experimental observations. And that's why we believe that the cluster size in this case should be a function of time. And we were able to find some of these fitting parameters in order to find the best matchup of our experiments. So at the end, I would like to acknowledge my students, especially Mohammed and Alval, who, you know, Alval did all the experiments, and Mohammed did all the calculations, and obviously the fun important sources that make this work. The fun important sources that make this possible. Thank you very much for your attention. I will be happy. Any questions for Hadi?
