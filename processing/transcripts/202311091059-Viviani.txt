Let's continue our morning with Milo Vidiani, who will talk about on the infinite dimensional limit of standard states for the Euler side of the equation. Thank you for the introduction and first thanks to the organizer for inviting and for the organizations of and the hospitality, I would say, also here. I would say also here. It's a very stunning landscape and places I've never been before. So, my talk is going to be about Euler equations and in particular to this finite-dimensional model, the so-called Zeitlin model or Euler Zeitlin model. And some of you probably have already seen this talk and or part of this talk in other contexts. Contexts. But let me start from the beginning. So I start from somehow the classical case of Euler equations. And I just consider, just let's put in the context of classical solutions. And we take as a domain some compact Fieman surface. And the reason is that we want And the reason is that we want the Zeitrin model uh works in this co uh for these manifolds uh and uh we have the classical uh formulation in terms of the vorticity field and the stream function. But typically, if one runs simulation of the vorticity evolution equation, gets some picture like this. So it starts from maybe some let's say ensemble of Let's say ensemble of blobs in the domain, and here this is just the spherical domain. And I use the azimuth and the elevation coordinates, so phi and theta spread on the plane, so the flat Earth. And after an intermediate range of turbulent mixing, the pollution stops and eventually co-renewed structures that are sort of persistent. That are sort of persistent and stable in the shape and in the dynamics form. And so, this is well known as a phenomenon that's known since long, and it's still intriguing because it hides a lot of actually complicated questions. And in particular, one more reason is that the Euler equations possess infinitely many This has infinitely many first integrals. And as you know, so we have the energy, which is the L2 product of the string function, the vorticity, and the Casmer functions that are typically represented in this basis, so the power of the vorticity. And then, according to the symptoms of the domain, we might have other integrals which are very relevant for the Are very relevant for the larger scale structures. So trying to understand how these blobs, these large vortices generate is something that, a question that was addressed probably from Juan Carré, but the first real attempt to, or one of the most successful attempt seminar attempts to understand this phenomenon is due to Oron Sake. Is due to Orn Saker that for the point-vortex model, which is somehow specific, if you want, finite-dimensional solution of the Euler equations, found a way to explain why these large blocks generate. And this is due to some statistical mechanics that he was able to perform and shows that actually the Actually, the merging of vortices with the same sign gives the most probable state. And in particular, so if you have an ensemble of very small vortices, they tend to go to vortices with the same sign. And so this large blob generates. However, a more precise understanding of actually the real oil. Understanding of actually the real Euler equations, or even for the Navier-Stokes equations, was due to Kraken that, taking the ideas of Kolmogorov, managed to derive this famous double-slow energy profile, for which we have a double cascade of the vorticity, one forward, which is due to the non-linearity of the equation, and one backward, which is a typical phenomenon of 2D Euler equations. And the accumulation. Equations and the accumulation of energy at large scales is responsible for the formation of blocks. And more recently, statistical mechanic theory, now called the MRS theory, tried to have a more concrete description of how this statistical state could look like. And they found that the maximum And they found that maximizing entropy of the system while preserving the first integrals, a statistical steady state is eventually reached. And it's possible also to guess sometimes the shape of this profile, so the relationship between the string function and the vorticity. And for our case, so we will perform numerical simulations on the sphere because it's the natural set. Because it's the natural setting for Zytling. It was sort of predicted by Herbert that using this approach of statistical mechanics, the final state would lead to a superposition of a quadrupole and a dipole. And if you remember before, we have seen actually a quadrupole. Okay, another very interesting theory. Very interesting theory that, of course, most of you know here is the theory of Schneelman to sort of try to understand how the long time limit of the vorticity field looks like. So the theory of Schneiderman, if I'm not wrong, started already in 1993 and it is set in the L infinity with a weak star topology. With a weak star topology, and the limits are taken in the weak star closure of the quad joint orbit related to the initial vorticity while preserving the other strong invariants, which are the energy and, if present, the momentum, the angular momentum. For example, on the sphere, this forces the system to have three more invariants. And minimal states in the theory. States in the theory of Schneer-Remann, which correspond eventually to stationary solution of the Euler equation with a relationship between the string function and the vorticity for a F bounded and monotone, are seen as minimizer of Casimir arising from convex functions. And also, these minimal states, so minimizer of convex Casimirs, they can be seen also as maximally mixed states. So there is no Maximally mixed states. So there it's not possible to have further mixing of um of the vorticity. So eventually in the long time it seems that it's possible to quantify this limit. And so this theory, when I first read about the Schneider Mann theory, I think it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever read actually. To me it seems very neat and very satisfying. Very, very satisfying, also, the way it is presented. But the point is that while we perform numerical simulations, we somehow have seen that there are some discrepancies, or there might be some discrepancies according to the numerical simulation that you observe and this prediction. In particular, something that I will show later, we don't get a single function here, but what Here, but what typically in the numerical simulation we get is a branched function. So, and the relationship between the string function and the vorticity seems more local than global. And this is also quite intriguing. But I will discuss this a bit later. So, now let's go to Zythrin. So, some of you probably have already seen the Zythrin model. It's a finite dimensional Liposon system which comes from the geometric quantization of Keller manifolds. In particular, for Riemann surfaces, it's possible to write down the bracket in terms of commutator of matrices in SUN, so the Lie algebra of skewer Nichian matrices. And so the And so the Poisson bracket we had at the beginning of the earlier equations become a Lie bracket on the Lie algebra. And the original Poisson equation that relates the string function and the vorticity becomes a linear equation on matrices. And the properties of this tensor are quite well studied, in particular on the sphere, and are related to the and are related to the to the representation theory of SU two. So it's a it's a very in a way it's a discrete model of the equation which arise naturally from representation theory and geometry. And the way the cycle model relates to the original equation is that the vorticity function is represented by a matrix. And how does it work? So there is The crucial point is that there is a basis of SUN for any n which in a way approximates, which resembles the spherical harmonics. So now I repeat, but I will work out everything on the sphere. So there is a basis of SUN, which has the same algebraic property of the spherical harmonics. So the commutator Spherical harmonics. So the commutator of two of these matrices that here I call TLM has the same structure constants up to some error which vanish in the limit for n going to infinity, so for the dimension of the matrix going to infinity. And so we just have a Fourier decomposition of the vorticity, which is replaced by a Fourier decomposition here at the matrix level. And therefore we have And therefore, we have this estimate of the local convergence of the bracket. So, this is the crucial point, and the fact that here the convergence is not like super fast, I mean it's quadratic, but of course, if you use spectral method, you have faster convergence. It requires like. Requires like the very large simulation for xyclin. And this is somehow a bottleneck for xyclin. And we don't expect this to be a model for understanding the local accuracy of the evolution of the voltistic field. But the fact that the geometrical properties are conserved, and I will explain how in a second, I think can give some insight into the large-scale structures. And why are the And why are the geometrical properties preserved? The reason is that the fact that we started from an infinite-dimensional Hippo-Son system and we reduced to a finite dimensional Hippo-Son system means that we still have the same geometry underneath and therefore we have energy, conserved, and momentum, and certain sort of Casimir functions. Um in particular, the conservation of Casimir function for high order uh uh casimir casimirs, so for for k larger than two in particular, is very special of zythmi. So it's uh it's quite complicated to have a Liquisson system which conserves also Casimirs and approximates the Euler equations. So the fact that we we can somehow take uh put all together and in a single system. Put all together and in a single system, it's quite remarkable. And it might provide quite insight, especially in large-scale structures which are dominated by the symmetries and the first team techniques. Okay, so now so this is the sort of the part where me and Me and Class started to contribute in this field. In particular, the contribution here is where we decided to analyze how the cycling model behaves for a long time. So, the idea to understand how this happens is to consider a splitting of the vertices. Splitting of the vorticity field. And the splitting is very natural because so eventually we many theories from statistical mechanics or similar predicted that eventually the vorticity reaches a steady state. So a steady state of course means that the string function and the vorticity are are related to each other with a functional relationship and therefore the the commutator vanishes. Therefore, the commutator vanishes. So, this factor that happens for a very long time can be studied dynamically. So, we start at any time what happens to the part of the vorticity which commutes with the string function. So, this means that there is always a part of the vorticity which does not contribute directly in the commutator because it commutes with the string function. And therefore, we decided to study this. We decided to study this splitting. So, the vorticist split uh with the vorticity field, or the vorticity matrix, is splitted in two parts. One, which is projected onto this algebra, which is the stabilizer of P, so the matrices which commute with P, and the other one is the residual part. So it's possible to derive explicit formulas of this projection, and therefore we get also a set of equations which tell us dynamic. Which tell us dynamically how this part evolves. So the residual part is expected to become smaller and smaller in a certain norm because we know that eventually our commutator should become smaller and should slow down the dynamics of the vorticity, in a sense. These equations are quite complicated and difficult to analyse. Complicated and difficult to analyze, but actually, at this point, it's not the issue. We want to see actually how this splitting, what is the information contained in this splitting. And it's very interesting, just looking at the most fundamental integrals of the Euler equations, which are the energy and the entropy. Since the projection is Is an orthogonal projection with respect to the Frobenius norm. We have that the entropy of the Ws and the entropy of Wr sum to the total entropy. So Wr and Ws of course are L2 orthogonal. But most interestingly, the energy is actually the opposite. So the energy of Ws minus the energy of Wr is the total energy. So we have if this set of inequalities. Inequalities. And so, what happens if you just try to get a look numerically of these new variables? Well, this was the most surprising part, because what we observed is that at the beginning, the initial vorticity has some structure. Let's say this is our WS, look, and this is WR. So, there is no Not much actually to say actually, at the very beginning, the initial vorticity is quite smooth here, for example, and WS and WR are less smoother than the total vorticity. But while the turbulent evolution of the vorticity happens, WS evolves in a strange way in which the level In which the level curves of the vorticity of WS are not preserved and the blocks disappear one into the other. So, in a way, here can be seen also as a rib graph, and you can see that the singular points, or for example the maxima, the minima and the the subtle points disappear. So in a way it's like a graph which becomes simpler and simpler. WR contains all the turbulent and filaments. The turbulent and filaments, and eventually, at long time, all the information relevant for the large structure is contained in WS. So you see here that apart some residual structure in WR, there are two distinguished features. One contains the large scale and one contains the small scale. And this can be also seen in a very precise way. In a very precise way, looking at the energy spectrum of the vorticity. So, at the beginning, this is the energy spectrum of the initial vorticity, this is the energy of Wr and Ws, the blue one. In the long time, the energy of the total vorticity has this broken line profile. And the first part, so the large scale part, is actually contained in WS, and the second part is the same. The second part is actually contained in Wr. So it means that the vorticity at small, the energy of the vorticity at small scales is contained in Wr more, and the energy of the vorticity at large scale is contained in Ws mainly. The simulation is just it is not Zygon. This is Zygon, yes, yes. With the the next page? And this is also Zygman? Yes, yes. Yes, it's all it's all the same simulation. Yes, yes. Everything is related to the same simulation. And finally, the time evolution of the energy and entropy in time, it's very interesting also because we know that the sum of the astrophysics has to be conserved. So we have the total entropy and the difference of the energies. And the difference of the energies have to be conserved. But if we look at the energy of Ws, the energy of the entropy of Ws, it drops. So the entropy is the L2 norm of Ws, while the entropy of Wr increases. And this is actually what you expect from the forward entropy at the scale. The entropy falls at small scales. So there is a certain mass of vorticity which leaves the large scale and goes. Which leaves the large scale and goes into small scales. While the energy does the opposite. So the mass which is moved from large scale to small scales is actually lost. Somehow a loss of energy because if you move a certain amount of bodies to small scales, then energy utilities will be less and less relevant. So we have eventually. Relevant. So we have a measure that all the energy is basically contained in the large scales. And this is the backward inverse energy cascade. Okay, this is quite generic. So it's something that it's observed in any simulation. So it's not some specific initial condition which creates this profile. This profile. And I would stress that this is also a measure of the irreversibility of the dynamics. Because once you get here, in a sense, you see that there is no conservation of the entropy. So we specify that for the long time, if most of the information for large scales is contained in WS, WS will be characterized by content. Will be characterized by constant energy, so the energy will match the real one. And for the anstrophy and the other casmies in particular, there will be a loss of anstrophy and higher-order casmers. And this is striking because it really matches the prediction of Schneeremann. So Schneierman was looking at final state of the vorticity in a way that they are. Vorticity in a way that they are a minimizer of some convex function. And so, in particular, here we see that the entropy is in a way reduced along the dynamics while conserving the energy. So, these pictures seem to point in the direction of the Schneereman theory. So, we have conservation of Conservation of the energy, at least if you look at the large scale, and dissipation of the casimirs. And here, so this is just a lot of deciding, so this quantity cannot go to zero because it's not possible for a finite dimensional Himilton system to get to an equilibrium. But what we expect is that if this Is that if this splitting of the bautistic also holds for the infinidimensional case, this actually will go to zero. And so, in a way, this could be a norm to see that there is a convergence of the vorticity to Ws. So, Ws, which are the large scale, will represent the final state of the vorticity. And indeed, it's possible to generalize the To generalize the splitting of the vorticity to infinite dimensional cases. And so maybe I try to five minutes try to wrap up. So we start, for example, with the vorticine L P for P larger than 2, but could be, for example, an infinity. We have the weak bracket formulation. And the stabilizer is defined in the same way. In the same way, so the functions that commute with the string functions. And if p is larger than 2 and the function is sufficiently regular, then the stabilizer is a close subspace of L2. So we can define the projections. And we have the two fields, Ws and Wr. And actually, what is remarkable is that the projection on the stability. The projection onto the stabilizer as a sort of an interpretation or as an equivalent formulation, which is like the averaging of the vorticity along the stream lines. This is not new, it's known at least since 1983 in this paper of Rhines and Young, where they average passive scalars on the streamlines. So it's something that we found out. something that we found out starting from Xaitri, just from a purely algebraic fashion. And actually it turns out to be something actually quite established in the theory of Euler equations or 2D free dynamics. And so for the long time limits actually we have some let's say introductory results and in particular Actually, results. And in particular, we have the if WR vanishes for some time sequence in the H minus one norm, so in the energy norm, then also WL which weak star converges to zero. And this is actually what I was saying before. So if it's true that in the infinite-dimensional case, the energy norm of WR goes to zero, then norm of WR goes to zero, then we have that the long time limit for the vorticity in the weak star topology is actually represented by VWS. So what we observe as a WS is a candidate for the final state of the vorticity. But this WS is not in agreement actually with the, it's not exactly in agreement with the prediction. With the prediction of Schneerellmann. And a possibility is that maybe one could look at mixing operators which are less general than the one that Schneiderman uses. And so I identify this set of possible mixing operators, which are the projection onto the stabilizer of psi, such that the vorticity is in the closure of the option. The extract closure of the orbit and intersect with the energy. Okay, so this is just a conjecture, it's not just an idea, it's not anything proved. Okay, but here is here I conclude, and the conclusion is that it's actually possible to guess what happens in infinite dimension, trying to simulate the Euler equations in a way like that it's possible in a way like if it is if it's In a way, like if it were possible to go indefinitely in the limit where the energy of Wr goes to zero. And to do so, a very natural scheme to consider is the following. So I take an initial vorticity field and I extract the Ws. Then Ws we know has typically lower entropy and higher energy and possibly. Energy and possibly also different angular momentum. So, what I do now is I project this back to the right energy and the momentum level. So, this K H M is the projection onto this level set. And then what I get eventually is convergence to a state which might sort of resemble what Sort of resemble what is the true true infinite long-time limit of the vorticity. And here I have some numerical simulation. So the convergence is extremely fast, so it's just one second of simulation. But it can run manually, frame by frame. So this is just the first step of this scheme. So here I project to WS and then to the right energy level. And you see that from a very grainy vorticity, Vorticity, four blobs emerge. And this is actually a steady state of the Zyclium model. So this is an equilibrium. And it's an equilibrium which is not triggered. They are four blobs that are very similar to those that we have running in the Zaiti model. But also we can look at the energy spectrum. So the black dashed line is the energy of the Dashed the line is the energy of the total vorticity. The red one is the energy of Ws, and the green one is the energy of Wr. And so we see that eventually the energy of Wr goes to zero, whereas all the energy concentrates in Ws. And the profile here, this energy profile, has a slope which is k to the power minus three. So So it's not a non-trivial equilibrium and also it's not trivial in a sense that it's concentrated in few harmonics. It's spread all over the modes and does some structure. But as I said before, the relationship between the string function and the vorticity is non-single-valued function. So there are branches. Branches and therefore there are still some gaps to be filled among different theories and these numerical simulations. And here I stop and thank you for the attention. So do we have questions? So I just want to make sure. So I have two questions actually. The first one is just clarification. Ramification kind of question, I guess. So, using Zeitlin, you have this nice splitting with WR and WS, and then you have lots of ramifications of that. And then there's Schnurlemann, which is not Zeitlin, but general. And it's a point of your talk to sort of come to grips with the idea that in the real thing, there could be some WRWS-like splitting, and then you're going to try to. And then you're going to try to see it and connect with your own. Yes, yes. Yes, go ahead. Yes. Okay. And so you found various ways to do that, I guess. You found one particular, depending on the projection or whatever it was. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, and the reason I wanted to connect Schneider. Yeah, that's a big goal, right? Because the Zeitman is just a tool for finding out the real thing. Yes, exactly. But the thing is that. Yes, exactly. But the thing is that this is just a feeling. For large scales, retains quite a lot of information and eventually might be pointing in the right direction. Yeah, sure. Okay, so that would be a tool. Yeah. So the second question is, I'm glad you went to the slide. Is that you have a compact phase base? Compact phase space, measure perturbing flow, so you have a Poincaré recurrence here. Okay, yes. And you see this thing decaying here. Yeah. Did you estimate it? I mean, how big is it? How big is the truncation size? Yeah, so you have a point-brand recurrence there. Yeah. It's a finite dimensional thing. Yes. And it depends on the number of degrees of freedom. Yeah. Degrees of freedom. Yeah, so here the degrees of freedom are. So Boltzmann estimated this for gas. Okay, okay. It's big. It's going to be quite large here. Yeah, it's going to be quite large, but I'm just curious. One of the things you could do is do a small one and just watch it happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So actually, this was found by class recently. Yes, because I have an estimate. So you're right. There's no convergence here. I mean, it will eventually return. Return. Of course, we have round of errors. Yes. But actually, the converters to the blobs happen long before the round of errors sort of kick in. And I did some estimate, and I think it was if you can run the simulation in real time, size is what we run, which is about s you know, a thousand times a thousand matrices. And you run the simulation in real time, that you have to wait like ten to the power ten to the power nineteen years. To the Power 19 years. That's short compared to what Boltzmann got. It's our small system compared to where we have to go. But running it with just a few modes or whatever might be a fun thing to watch. Thank you. More questions? So, was this converging to a steady state numerically? Because I've I've seen versions before where the blobs can move around each other. Oh, yeah. No, so this is not state. They move, and I think they will continue to move because when you look at the at the reduced uh dynamics, there is W R W R here. So this cannot go to zero, of course, so that the Go to zero course, so that the but I believe that actually it should slow down more and more while WR spreads into the small scales. So I'm not sure if the unsteadiness is a numerical feature or if this is something that can be expected also for the original value. So this is something it's not totally clear. I think at least this. I think at least at least this uh thing that happens, we see these blobs in fact, probably it's like slowing down the future. Slowing down over the next bottle. So we never, so in a way you can view the splitting as a way first run some simulation and then stretch time in such a way that you can actually catch what will happen in extremely long time. What will happen in extremely long time? We run long time, not extremely long time. And so that's the only way I see that this would be compatible with the model. You've reached those states. Long time scale. And there you have interactions. And a much slower, even longer time scale. There you have a slow. There you have a slow uh that's my anyway some sort of method with zitland. Do you always get the same number of blocks? And if not, can you kind of predict how many blocks you get from the initial data? Initial data? Yeah, so typically the number of logs is related to integrability conditions. So for example, what really matters seems to be if the angular momentum is zero or not. To say if the angular momentum is zero and you have uh blobs, then four blobs are can be set in a in a com in an integrable uh dynamics. in an integrable uh dynamics. Yes, in the continuous setting they work. Yeah, if if the angular momentum is non-zero and sufficiently large, that this is not true, so they merge one more and you get three blobs, typically. And if this is extremely large, then you get just two blobs. So the angular momentum is really the one that determines the number of blobs. And the number of blobs then depends on the domain as well. So typically on the torus you have other symmetries and so you get different number of blobs. And if you for example would run a If you, for example, would run I expect if you run Zyton on a surface which is not sphere, so it's the Laplacian is not spherically symmetrical, then you get fewer drops. Oh yeah, yeah, it sounds like the segment is really coming from point to point. So like that the same applies to the continuous case. Let's say like if I have a sphere and I have some like, I don't know, like orbitary voltage 8, which is not. Which is not point voltage height. And then, like, I can still compute angular momentum. From this, like, can I expect, as if my angular momentum is not zero, can I expect I will eventually get four annual equivalents in a continuous setting? It seems so. There is no proof for this, but it seems so. I mean, numerical the numerical seems to say generically, of course. So that's a concept. Generically, of course. So that's a conjecture. That's a conjecture. So for a given angular momentum, you always get the same, or it's simple. For a given angular momentum, you always get the same number of blocks? I think what we measured was the ratio of angular momentum and entropy. So I see. Because if the entropy is extremely large, then it means that the angular momentum might be a small perturbation of the vorticity. So you have to normalize with respect to the have to normalize with respect to the size of the vorticity. So I I would think it would depend on the relative to size of all your finite dimensional cashmeres.
