And many thanks to the organizers for this invitation. I'm pleased and honored to speak at this meeting in honor of Bernard Leclerc. I don't remember exactly when I first met Bernard physically. It must have been in the 90s, but I remember I first met him mathematically at a meeting in Limini in the early 2000s, which was more or less the Which was more or less the beginning of Bernard's collaboration with Christoph Geiss and Jan Schreuer. As you know, this has been an extremely fruitful and important collaboration, and at its center are the surprising and deep links between representation of pre-projective algebras and cluster algebras and cluster categories. And this is also very much Is also very much in the background of the talk I'm giving today. I will use what one could call derived pre-projective algebras because they have more symmetries and I will be very much interested in symmetries. But the spirit is very much the spirit of the work of Bernard together with Jan and Christophe. Okay, so the title is the Blue versus Red Game and Versus red game and applications. And you can find the notes at this address: bit.ly slash colors notes, all in small letters and in one word. I will put it also into the chat for the online participants. And the plan is as follows. Is as follows. First, I will present the blue versus red game. As you probably know, blue and red are the colors of the two main parties in the US, but any resemblance between this game and American politics is purely coincidental. Okay, and then I would like to apply this game to construct actions on relative Actions on relative cluster categories. This will be the application. And so I first have to remind you of relative cluster categories. This will be section two. And then in section three, I will use the blue versus red game to construct braid subgroup actions, actions of subgroups of braid groups on relative cluster categories and then via D. And then via decategorification also on cluster algebras with invertible coefficients via quasi-cluster automorphisms. Okay, and well, I won't have time to prove the main theorem, but at the end, I would like to sketch why it works, at least in a special case, namely the Frobenius case. All the most important examples are covered in this. Examples are covered in this case. And we will see that it works for a very simple reason: a basic fact from homological algebra, but we have to check that we are in a situation to apply this fact. Okay, so let's start with the blue versus red game. First, some preparations. We work with an ice cover. So we have a finite group Q. We assume it has no loops or two cycles, and we assume that it comes with what we call a frozen subquiver. Well, that's just a subquiver F drawn in blue. It may be a full subquiver or a non-full subquiver. In the examples today, it will always be a full subquiver. So all the arrows between frozen vertices will be frozen. Vertices will be frozen arrows, they will belong to this frozen subquery. So, this is a typical example, and you probably recognize this as the example number zero from Geis Leclerc Schwer's work. Yes, this quiver describes the cluster structure on the maximal unipotent subgroup of SL3. It's of cluster type A1, so from that viewpoint, it is maybe not so interesting, but what is interesting. But what is interesting here already is the presence of this frozen subquiry. Okay, now as you see, here we have this frozen arrow, and it is important to extend the usual mutation rule so as to take into account frozen arrows. And this, to a certain extent, this is already present in the work of Fokken Goncharov. And Goncharov, but in a systematic way, and also at the level of quivers with potentials, it is a construction result due to Matthew Presland. He extended the rule to include frozen arrows, and he did this not just at the combinatorial level, but also at the level of quivers with potential. So he generalized the work of Turks and by Manzilevinsky. Okay, so this rule is. Rule is quite different from the classical rule. Yes, here you have an example. Yes, when we take this ice quiver and we mutate at the vertex number three, then using Presland's rule, this frozen arrow is reversed. Whereas, well, if we take such a three cycle and mutate at three using the classical rule by Furman and Zelovinsky, then this arrow simply disappears. Arrow simply disappears. Okay, so it is really different. Of course, as far as unfrozen arrows are concerned, it's the classical rule. Yes? So does it mean that this arrow is of weight one half? One can interpret it that way, and that's Fokoncharov's interpretation. Yes, it is actually different from the interpretation which one gets from categorification. Categorification. Yeah. But anyway, yes, that is one possibility of incorporating it into the picture. Yes. Okay. So we have this rule for mutating ice quivers at non-frozen vertices. But actually, it turns out that this rule continues to work if we apply it to mutations at certain frozen vertices, namely, Namely, we can apply it when we have a frozen sink. A frozen sink is a sink of the frozen subquiver where we have at most outgoing arrows of the non-frozen part. Or dually, we can apply it when we have a frozen source. So it's a source of the frozen subquiver with at most incoming arrows of the incoming non-frozen arrows. Okay, and this rule. And this rule in a special case actually appears already in the work of Chris Fraser and Mr. Sherman Bennett in June 2020 when they used it to construct cluster structures on positroid cells. Okay. But it is completely general. And now, okay, now we are prepared for the first example. Prepared for the first example of the blue versus red game. So, this game works in two stages. First, so we take our frozen quiver, sorry, our ice quiver, and we have a first phase called the reform phase. And in this reform phase, we perform mutations at frozen sinks or sources. So, we only sinks also. So we only perform mutations at frozen vertices here at three and then at sorry at first at five here and then at three. As you can see five is a frozen sink and so is three in this quiver. Okay so we have this reform phase, the blue phase, which transforms our quiver into a new Into a new quiver. As you can see in this example, this new quiver is actually just the opposite of the given quiver. Okay, so this is the first phase, the reform phase, with only mutations at frozen sinks or sources. And then we have a counter-reform phase, a red phase, where we try to undo the effect of the reform phase. So in this case, well, we just have So, in this case, well, we just have to pass to the original privilege, back to the original privilege by mutating only at non-frozen vertices, only at red vertices. And here we can achieve this just by one mutation at this central red vertex. Okay, this transforms this quibble into its opposite, which is exactly equal to the original quibble. Okay, yes, so that's what we do in. Yes, so that's what we do in general. We perform mutations at non-frozen vertices so as to undo the effect of the reform phase. This is, of course, not always possible. Yes, sometimes you just can't undo a reform, but we are interested in the cases where it is possible. Okay. And in some cases, it is possible, but not exactly. So, in some cases, we can do such Some cases we can do such, we can undo the reform at least up to some isomorphism, up to some quiver, ice quiver isomorphism phi, we can do it. Okay. Okay, let me show you an example in the applet of this more general phenomenon. Yes, in the applet, in the latest version of the applet, these mutations are implemented. Mutations are implemented. Yes, you can see this is the classical rule. This is the rule incorporating frozen arrows. And here we can mute at these two vertices. And then we can undo this reform by mutating at the central vertex. And now the slightly bigger example. Okay, I hope you can see. Okay, I hope you can see it. Okay, so we have this example. Yes, I mean, the experts will immediately recognize that this is a quiver which describes the cluster structure, the canonical cluster structure on the Grasmanian of three-dimensional subspaces in six-dimensional space. And you can see it is given by this ice quiver with frozen arrows. And for example, you can see. And for example, you can see that eight and five are frozen sources. Okay, so let's perform a mutation at eight and a mutation at five. So this was the reform phase. And now we try to undo the effect of this reform by mutating at only non-frozen vertices. So we first mutate at one and then we mute. And then we mutate at three, and now we mutate at two and at four. Okay, and now you see we are almost back to the original quiver. We get back exactly to the original quiver if we perform this cyclic permutation of these four central vertices. Okay, yes, so here we are exactly back to the original quiver. So this fine. Original quiver. So, this final permutation is the permutation, which allows us to completely undo the effect of the reform phase. Okay. Okay. Well, here, I will also show it to you in the slides. Well, here we have some empty space. Let me use it to show you pictures of the Show you pictures of the four young mathematicians whose work I have cited so far: Matthew Presland, then Chris Fraser and Melissa, who first used frozen mutations for cluster structures on positoid varieties, and then Eling Wu, who, well, he made this observation and he also categorified all these operations. And that will be important in the sequel. Important in the SQL. Okay, and here, so we have example two once more. So we have the first the reform phase where we do mutations at five and eight. And then we try to undo the reform. We mutate at the four inner vertices to get here, and then finally we do a And then finally, we do a permutation, like an ice-quiver isomorphism, which takes us back exactly to the original quivers. Okay. And now I would like, in the sequel, I would like to use this type of mutation of compositions of mutations and permutations to construct braid subgroup actions on. Brain subgroup actions on relative cluster categories. Okay, so let me introduce relative cluster categories, but first let me give you some hint of how it's going to work. So we take an ice prig, QF, and then with this frozen part, there is an associated artin grade group. Okay, it is generated by grade group generation. grade group generator sigma j associated with the frozen vertices and we impose a grade relation whenever there is a unique arrow either from l to j or from j to l okay yes so for example here this braid group would be an affine braid group of type a5 tilde and then to go And then to go to the categorical level, well, we look at the so-called procalabia completion of the frozen subquival. So this could also be called the derived pre-projective algebra of the frozen subquivil. If the frozen subquival is a connected non-Lincoln queue, then this derived pre-projective algebra is exactly the ordinary pre-projective. The ordinary pre-projective algebra. In general, it's some DG algebra concentrated in non-positive degrees. And we look at its perfect derived category, the full subcategory of the whole derived category generated as a thick triangulated subcategory by the free module of rank one. So, in this case, it's just the bounded homotopy category of projective. category of projective modules over the pre-projective algebra. And in this perfect derived category, we have the simple modules over this derived pre-projective algebra. And these simple modules form a collection of spherical objects in here. And the x1 between these simples are precisely given by the frozen subgroup. And that is why these spherical objects, if we Spherical objects, if we look at the spherical twists associated with them, we get a braid group action, an action of this Artin braid group on the perfect derived category. This is an old result by Paul Seidel and Richard Thomas from 2001. When we have such a spherical collection whose X1 is described by equivalent F, then the blade group associated with F acts via the spherical twists associated. The spherical twists associated with these spherical objects. Okay, and then the idea is from this action on the perfect derived category of the frozen of the derived pre-projective algebra of the frozen path, we want to get an action on the relative cluster category. So, this is what we want to achieve. This relative cluster category is very different in general. Cluster category is very different in general from this category, but well, there's a link and I will describe it in the sequel. So, but the origin of all the actions we have is this great group, which acts on this perfect derived category. Okay. Okay, so what is the relative cluster category? Let me first show you two examples. Let's take this example, yes, which actually, of course, describes the cluster structure on the Rismanian of planes in four space. Well, we take this natural potential, the sum of the counterclockwise three cycles minus the sum of the clockwise three cycles. And then the relative cluster category is nothing. Category is nothing but the bounded-derived category of the so-called boundary algebra associated with this Grismanian. What is the boundary algebra? Well, we take the pre-projective algebra of this frozen part. Yes, this frozen part is a connected non-lincy quiver. We take its associated pre-projective algebra, which coincides with the derived pre-projective algebra. Projective algebra. So it's described by this equivalent together with all the reasonable commutativity relations, yes, xy equals yx at any vertex. And then we impose an additional relation, which makes, so the corresponding quotient will be singular, it will be of infinite global dimension, and it's this boundary algebra. And the relative cluster category is just the Cluster category is just the bounded derived category of the finitely generated modules over this boundary algebra. The boundary algebra here is infinite-dimensional, but it is an Ethereum. So it makes sense to look at this abelian category of finitely generated models, and its boundary-derived category gives us the relative cluster category. Then let's look at a more finite-dimensional example. It's the example zero from Geislucler Schuer. From Geis-Leucler-Schuer's theory. Yes, here we have the natural potential, just a three-cycle. And again, the relative cluster category can be described in this case as the boundary-derived category of the corresponding boundary algebra. And in this case, the boundary algebra is just the pre-projective algebra of the non-frozen part. So here it is really the pre-projective algebra. So, here it is really the pre-projective algebra, not the derived pre-projective algebra. The boundary algebra, and it is given in this way. Okay. Okay, so in these examples, we have this simple description. In the general case, the data we need to construct are a bit more involved. So, here is what we need to do in the general case. Do in the general case. So, first we look at this algebra pi, which we have already encountered, the two-color BR completion of the non-frozen part. Yes, so it's a DG algebra whose H0 is the usual pre-projective algebra. And if F is a connected non-lincent privilege, then pi is just quasi-isomorphic to its H0. Then we have the so-called We have the so-called relative Ginzburg algebra associated to the I-squibber with potential. I will give you the definition in a moment. And between the two, we have the Ginsburg morphism. Yes. So we have this Ginsburg morphism is somehow the most essential part of the structure. And then how do we define the relative cluster category? Well, we take the perfect. We take the perfect derived category of the relative Ginsburg algebra and we divide by the thick subcategory generated by the non-frozen symbols. Yes, if we are in the absolute case, yes, if this frozen part is empty, then this is the zero algebra, and this is the quotient of the perfect derived category by the thick subcategory generated by all simples, and that's Anyo's definition of the class. That's unused definition of the classical cluster category. And in this general case, we have to, well, do this subtle modification. We only take the symbols associated with non-frozen vertices. And then there is also a general construction of a boundary algebra. It is just this idempotent truncation of the H0 of the relative Ginsburg algebra. So if you like, it's an idempotent. It's an idempotent truncation of the relative Jacobian algebra, where the idempotent is the one associated with the vertices, and in general, usually the derived category of this boundary algebra is very different from the cluster category. Okay, and well, let me give you these constructions just in the simple example number zero. Okay, so this is example number. Okay, so this is example number zero. We take the standard potential. Then the derived preprotuctive algebra is given in this way. So we add an arrow in the opposite direction for each arrow in the frozen subquiver. And we add loops of degree minus one at each vertex. And the boundary, yes, the Boundary, yes, the differential of these loops in degree minus one give us the pre-projective relations. So by construction, h0 of this algebra is the usual pre-projective algebra, but we actually have homology in infinitely many negative degrees as well. Okay, so this was this pre-derived pre-projective algebra, and then we have the relative Ginsburg algebra. Relative Ginsburg algebra. So now, well, we also add arrows in the opposite direction, but only for the non-frozen arrows. And these new arrows are in degree minus one. Yes, the color red is always for degree minus one here. And then we also add a loop of degree minus two for each non-frozen vertex. And we take the graded path algebra of this thing. Path algebra of this thing and endow it with the unique differential whose values and the generators are given in this way. So, if we take, for example, the differential of this arrow A star of degree minus one, by definition, we get the cyclic derivative of the potential with respect to A, and that is the composition B C. D of A star is B composed with C. B composed with C. Similarly, D of B star is C composed with A. And then the differential of the loop gives us the commutator between the old and the new arrows at the given vertex. So it's again quite similar to a pre-projective algebra, but now well with these different degrees. So notice that up to now we have only used the Have only used the cyclic derivatives of the potential with respect to non-frozen arrows. And but well, we also need to use the last one, the derivative with respect to the frozen arrow. And this derivative is used in the definition of the Ginsburg morphism. So the Ginsburg morphism is defined in quite a natural way. It takes these loops to the core. These loops to the corresponding commutators at the frozen vertices. Yes, these should be viewed as commutators in the same way as these should be viewed as commutators. Then it takes C to C and it takes this new arrow C star to the last cyclic derivative of the corresponding potential. So we use all the information which All the information which we also use in the classical Ginsburg algebra. Okay, yes, so these are these constructions in the general case. And now, okay, so now we know what the relative cluster category is in the general case and in our examples. And now we can construct the blade subgroup actions. So we imagine. So we imagine that we have played the blue versus red game. We have a reform sequence of frozen sinks and sources I. Then we have the counter-reform sequence K, and we have the permutation, which allows us to achieve the complete counter-reform. Okay, and now with these reforms, Now, with this reform sequence, we associate an element of the corresponding group. Namely, well, we take the product of the blade generators, respectively, their invertes, depending on whether the corresponding frozen vertex is a frozen source or a frozen sink. For frozen sources, we take the generator itself, and for frozen sinks, we take its inverse. Okay, this is a certain element of the This is a certain element of the Braille group, well-defined element of the Braille group. And now, with this element, we would like to associate an auto-equivalence of the relative justic category. And for this, we need a certain number of additional assumptions on the potential. So we assume that we have a potential which satisfies the following properties. First of all, it should be what First of all, it should be what the physicists call consistent, which simply means that the relative Ginzburg algebra is concentrated in degree zero. And so this canonical morphism should be a Parthius morphism. Then secondly, it should be what I call epic, which means that the Ginzburg morphism induces a sejection from the pre-projective algebra of the frozen part on the Algebra of the frozen part onto the boundary algebra. Okay, so this assumption is satisfied in the case of the Grossmanian. In more general cases, this assumption is not exactly satisfied, but it is satisfied after localizing with respect to a suitable multiplicative set in the center. So one can refine this condition, and it is necessary to refine it for the examples, but for simplicity, let me not state this. For simplicity, let me not state this refined version. And then, of course, the potential should be preserved under this whole sequence of mutations and permutations, preserved up to right equivalence. Okay, and so when all these assumptions are satisfied, then, well, we always have such a canonical auto equivalence. Constructed by Eling Wu associated with any such sequence of mutations. But this canonical equivalence, when the assumptions hold, only depends on the element of the braid group and not on the chosen representative of this element. Okay, and this also applies to compositions. And so if we have a composition of such elements, which such Of such elements which satisfy certain relations in the plate group, then these auto-equivalences will satisfy the same relations. Okay, and so as a consequence, we get an action of this of a subgroup of the braid group. Well, we look at the subgroup generated by all these elements associated with reform sequences, which admit the counter-reform sequences and the potential is preserved. The potential is preserved. This is just this generated subgroup. It's a certain subgroup of the brain group. And this, by the theorem, acts on the relative cluster category via, yes, via auto equivalences. Okay, and then one can decategorify. And under decategorification, these auto equivalences translate into quasi-cluster automorphisms. Quasi-cluster automorphisms of the cluster algebra with invertible coefficients associated with the I-square. So these are quasi-cluster automorphisms in the sense of quiz-fraser. Yes. So they don't send cluster variables to cluster variables, but they send them to cluster variables multiplied by monomials in the coefficients. So they're more general than usual cluster automorphisms. Morphisms and they work, I mean, they work well if we use invertible coefficients. Okay, okay, so this is the general fact. We get actions of subgroups of grade groups, and now we have to look for examples where this general recipe works. Okay, and there's a number of confirmed examples and a number of Confirmed examples and a number of expected examples. So, the first confirmed example, and which is actually the origin of the whole project, is Crismanian braiding as constructed by Fraser, published in 2020. So if you remember, it's an action of an extended affine braid group on the big positroid cell in the Grasmanian, and it is by It is by quasi-cluster automorphisms. And yes, so yes, so this is one action which we can get in this way. And in this case, it is actually an action by a Braille group again, but that is in fact a coincidence. So it turns out that in this case, the subgroup generated by certain reform sequences is Reform sequences is actually itself a braid group, but it is nevertheless a proper subgroup in this braid group associated with the frozen part. Yes, it's a subgroup of a braid group, which happens to be a braid group again. But in general, these subgroups will not be braid groups themselves. And then one can extend this also to certain actions of subgroups of blade groups on positroid cells. This is more recent. Cells. This is a more recent result obtained in collaboration with Chris Fraser. So these are the confirmed examples. And then there are many more expected examples here. I have compiled a list of papers where there are actions which we suspect should come from the application of this recipe. Yes, so the oldest example is perhaps due to Alexei Bundal. Perhaps due to an XA bundle from 2004. Then, examples by Frog Koncharov, Koncharov Shen, Sheikhov Shapiro, Inway Lamen-Plyovsky, Inway Ishibashi, and Oya, Koncharov Shen again in 2019. Then there are examples, very interesting examples related to representations of quantum affine algebras by Kashiwara, Kim O and Park in 2020. So here as So, here as well, we know that there are quantum cluster algebra structures, and we suspect that these examples should also be possible to obtain them from this general recipe. But this is, yeah, I mean, each of these is a paper and well, one have to probably write one paper, maybe, well, in the extreme case, one paper for each of these papers to see that it does work. To see that it does work. Okay, well, so we have this general recipe which is based on theorem one. And now I would like, I will not attempt to sketch a proof of theorem one, but only give you an idea of why it should be true. And I will do this in a special case, which is an important special case, all the examples. An important special case. All the examples we have seen so far fit into this framework, which is the Frobenius case. Okay. So let's take an ice quiver with potential, and we have the relative cluster category associated with it. For example, it could be the derived category of a boundary algebra. And inside we have a certain subcategory P, which is the additive subcategory. The additive subcategory associated with Eγ, where E is the frozen item potent. And then inside this relative cluster category, we have a very nice subcategory called Higgs category. So, this is the full subcategory of the relative cluster category whose objects have such presentations, they are cones. Presentations, they are cones of homorphisms F, where the Ti's are in the additive subcategory generated by the free module of rank one. And the morphism F has this extension property. Whenever we have a morphism from T1 to some object in P, this such a morphism extends. Yes, so that the P's behave like injective objects with respect to these. With respect to these F's. Okay, so this is the Higgs category. And let's look at example number zero. In example number zero, we know that the relative cluster category identifies with the bounded derived category of the pre-projective algebra. Here inside, we have the module category of the pre-projective algebra, and the Higgs category corresponds precisely to this module category. To this module category. So it's no longer a triangle related category. It's just an extension closed subcategory of the relative cluster category. And inside the Higgs category H, we have P itself. And P identifies precisely with the subcategory of projective inductives in the category of modules over the pre-projective algebra. Okay, so this is the idea. idea behind the Higgs category is the Higgs category generalizes modules over a pre-projective algebra and as you perhaps know modules of a preprojective algebra are just the algebraic avatar of Higgs bundles on curves so that's where the the name comes from okay and now to get to the Frobenius case we need to make a few assumptions A few assumptions. We assume that the reduced quiver with potential, yes, we eliminate the frozen vertices from our quiver and we remove the cycles passing through frozen vertices from our potential. That's the reduced square width potential. This should be Jacobi finite. The Jacobi algebra should be finite-dimensional. Then we assume that the I-square-width potential is consistent. The relative The relative Ginsburg algebra is concentrated in degree zero. And finally, we suppose that this category P is functorially finite in the subcategory add of gamma. Okay. Well, if you don't remember what this means, it's not so important here. And there are lots of examples. So we can take ice covers with potential. We can take ice curves with potential, which describe Grasmanians or positoids or consistent timer models on a torus with boundary. And then in all these cases, we have essentially the same behavior as in example zero. Namely, it turns out that then the Higgs category is a Frobenius exact category. It's projective injective from the subcategory P. From the subcategory P. This is in Elen Wu's work. And the inclusion into the relative cluster category extends to an equivalence between the relative cluster category and the derived category of this provenus category. This is a recent result by cell function. Okay, and so we are in a very simple situation. Yes, our relative trust. Situation. Yes, our relative cluster category is just the bounded derived category of some probeneous exact category. And its projectives are P. Okay, so this is the situation. And now what is why does theorem one work? Yes, so remember theorem one said that a certain auto equivalence only depends on a brain group. Only depends on a brain group element. And another way of saying the same thing is that this O2 equivalence is determined by its restriction to the frozen part. Yes, the frozen part, the braid group only sees the frozen part. So everything, all the information in this auto equivalence should be already visible from the frozen part. So it means that this auto equivalence should be determined by its. Be determined by its restriction to the corresponding frozen subcategory, and this frozen subcategory is just the bounded homotopy category of projectives inside the bounded derived category of our forbiddenness category. Okay, so we have this auto-equivalence. It should be determined by its effect on the projectives. And that is very natural, as by the basic fact from homological algebra. From homological algebra, that our objects in H have projective resolutions. Yes, we can take an object and replace it by a projective resolution. And if we know what the auto-equivalence does on the projectives, then we know what it does on the projective resolution, hence on the given object. So that's the very simple reason. Just the existence of projective resolutions. So in a more Resolutions. So, in a more precise way, yes, we know that the boundary-derived category of our Frobenius category can also be described using projective resolutions. So, in other words, we can describe it as the category of right-bounded complexes with projective components, which are acyclic in almost all degrees. Yes, so these are unbounded complexes, but right-bounded. But right-bounded. This contains this subcategory of bounded complexes. Okay, and if we have an auto-equivalence here, then it is and it is continuous in a certain sense, then it is clear that it should be determined by its effect on the projectives. Okay, on this projective part. So the projective, yes, the given auto-equivalence is determined by. Is determined by what the frozen see, and that's why the corresponding auto equivalence is determined by the braid group element or braid group associated with the frozen part. Okay, and well, this is, I think, the essential idea, which one then has to flesh out into a technical proof. And well, I'd like to stop here and Here and wish happy birthday to Bernard and thank him for all the beautiful mathematics which have inspired me and my students and collaborators and many, many other mathematicians. So thank you very much. Thank you very much, Bernard, for this wonderful talk. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? If the virtual participants have any questions, please just unmute yourself or raise your hand. We will start with the virtual participants, then we will go with the presidential participants. Yeah, yeah. Are there any questions from the audience? Yeah, sure. Yes, hello, Bernard. Can you hear me? Yes. Hello, Ralph. Yes. Yes, yes, that's me. So if I understand this right, your group, your subgroup G, you can understand it as a subgroup of the quasi-automorphism group? Yes, I mean. Yes, I mean, it maps to the group of quasi-cluster automorphisms of my cluster algebra with invertible coefficients. It's not clear that in general it's a subgroup. So that's essentially the question about the faithfulness of the induced action on the cluster algebra. Yeah, I don't know under which conditions this action is faithful. Yes. Is faithful, yes, yes, but it's that's certainly a very interesting question, yes. I mean, in of course, in yeah, I mean, it's it's easy, I think, to give examples where it is not, yeah, well, yeah, I think there should be examples where it is not faithful, but yeah, yeah, yeah, one has to look at examples. I'm not sure in which generality it the action might be faithful. Faithful. I think one needs more conditions to make it a faithful action. But yeah, yeah. And if it is, is there a sense, do you have a sense how big this subgroup is? Inside the whole quasi-cluster automorphism, inside what one could call the quasi-cluster modular group. Cluster modular group, if I understand correctly. Um, I don't know. I don't know. Yes, um, yes, this is also a very good question. Um, yes, again, one yeah, one has to look at examples. I don't actually, I mean, people have, of course, computed cluster modular groups for quite a few quivers. I don't know about quasi. I don't know about quasi-cluster modular groups so far. I don't know any computations in the literature, but. Yeah, I think only for finite type. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Greg Mueller is asking a question. Hey, Bernard, it's Greg Mueller. Do you have any idea how you might generalize? Do you have any idea how you might generalize the theory if you didn't want skew symmetrizability between the frozen variables or skew symmetry, some sort of skew symmetric matrix relating to the frozen variables? You want to do the same thing in the skew symmetrizable case? Well, honestly, even beyond that, you know, there's these augmentation maps that have just no skew symmetrizability conditions at all between frozen variables. And I'm sort of curious whether there's any sort of representation theoretic. Theoretic interpretation of this. No, I don't know. I don't know. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very good question. No, I don't know. Yeah, it would be very interesting to understand this better, but for the moment, no, I don't in particular, no, I don't understand the link to augmentation varieties. No. Conveniently. Hi, Bernard. This is Nisha. Yeah, yes, Misha. So I have a question. So about this reforming and counter-reforming transformations, can you also define them for the variables? Not just quiver mutations. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Yes, yes, yes. So of course the mutations at non-frozen vertices correspond to usual cluster mutations of variables. Of variables. And there is also a rule for transformation of the frozen variables for a corresponding automorphism associated with the mutations at frozen things and frozen sources. But then, so when you go back to essentially the same quiver, ice quiver up to up to permutational vertices, then can anything interesting be said about Anything interesting be said about the resulting virational transformations that you obtain this way? Yes, well, you get a virational transformation which is a quasi-cluster automorphism. Any conserved quantities, anything like that? Good question. I don't know in general. Let me see, is there anything obvious No, no, no, I don't see any obvious invariant in general. Yes. Yeah, I suppose that for specific classes of examples, one should be able to say something. And in general, I don't see. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Are there any more questions? Yeah, if not, the clerk is asking a question. Hi, Bernard. Hi, Bernard, and thank you very much for your beautiful lecture. Thank you very much. I wanted to be sure, if I understand correctly, about the fact that this does not depend, that this just depends on the element in the break groups. So you start by picking a certain reduced word for not even reduced, but the word. Yeah, just the word associated with the sequence. Yes. The world associated with the sequence, yes, and then you associate it with the sequence and a certain automorphism. Does it mean that you could then start with any word for the same element? Absolutely. You start with any word for the same element, it will give you an isomorphic auto-equivalence. Yes. But this means that, well, I had the impression with your examples that you could not have. That you could not have mutated in, I mean, you did one and three, and then two and four, and it was a little bit limited. So, this means that this precise element has a very few. Yes, so there is absolutely a limitation which comes from the fact that you have to use frozen sinks or frozen sources. So, if you have a vertex which is neither a frozen sink nor a frozen source, then this operation is not defined at the vertex. Is not defined at the vertex, unfortunately. One could extend this, but then there are quite serious technical complications. And I haven't looked at the more general thing which you could do, at least at the categorical level. In principle, there is no obstacle to doing something more general. But I fear that the link to combinatorics will then become. Become impossible or very complicated, and one probably has to extend the combinatorial side as well. One has to look probably to look at graded quivers. And yes, yes, so this I don't know so far. But yes, so there is this limitation which comes from the fact that you have to use frozen things or frozen sources. But yes, but if you choose a Yes, but if you choose a different sequence of frozen things or frozen sources, which defines the same element in the corresponding break group, then you get the same automation. But this explains also that the subgroup is kind of small inside this big break group. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. I mean, well, if you remember question. remember the if you remember Quersmanian rating, yes, then the subgroup, well, if imagine that you have n which is equal to say k times d, then the subgroup is generated by products of ray generators which are distant by d and and this well and this you can realize just using. And this you can realize just using mutations at frozen things and frozen sources. Yes. And maybe just another question. Is there any relation with the twist automorphisms which appear in Berenstein Fermi de Levinsky, for example? Well, let me see. I mean, I think if I understand correctly, the twist automatic Understand correctly, the twist automorphisms of Berenstein Zelawinski are very much related to the twist automorphism. Well, they are related to the twist automorphisms in your paper with Jan and Christoph on the chamber ansatz. Yes. So there, in your paper, if I remember correctly, well, you give a certain formula for these twist automorphisms, and this formula And this formula is one can reinterpret it, yes, I mean, as the shift, not in the cluster category, but in the derived category of, well, in this case, in the derived category, say, of a pre-projective algebra. So, yes, we have the stable. Of course, in your paper, you show that it corresponds to the Auslangeraten translation in the cluster category or to the suspension function. To the suspension functor in the cluster category. But instead of looking at the cluster category, which is essentially the stable category of modules over the pre-projective algebra, you can look at the derived category of modules over the pre-projective algebra. And in the derived category, you also have the shift functor. And this shift functor is of the type, you can construct it in this way using mutations at frozen things and sources. At frozen things and sources.
