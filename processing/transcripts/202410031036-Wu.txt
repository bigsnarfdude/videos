Dependence complex. Okay. Thank you very much. It's my great pleasure to be here. Today I will give a talk on the project that we had a few years ago. And then now I want to use a little bit different way to see it. The topic is about the battery number of independence compact of a ternary graph. So first way. Uh so first with the canary three is canary we have no induced C3K cycle or anything. Somebody also call it Trinity and the conjecture by Align is there are more than one conjecture. So maybe I will write down some of them. So first, if it is ternary, if G is ternary, then we will have Have the number of if you consider all the independent set I g is the independent set then you can see that the number of the odd independent set and the number of the event independent set the difference will be at most one They also conjecture that the committee number will be bounded. I mean, that it will be implied by others. First one is absolute value values. I'm sorry? The absolute value. Yeah, absolute value. And then the third one is about betting number. The betting number, you say that Let's call it the PNG. There's the sum of the reduced patent number. And then this one will be MOS1. Okay, I will introduce a little bit about what this means later. Later. And then first look at the history. And then first Honouni Shabi and Thomas A. Pull the second one, the Kaiji is bounded. And then which one should I go first? Let's go this one first. And obviously what should be the all the Suburka Alex Scott and Sigar first Simo Subberka pull the first one and And Alex Gund and Simon pull a very strong theorem. And then that line implies that if this line is bounded, so does its quality number. And by proving that if the combined number is big, then you will have the destroy cycle of the many cycles that have a length divisible by 3. And actually, even stronger, it can be any modular of any k. And then now let's. And then now let's go. This one will imply what's the relation between this number and then this number. Let's first see the definition of the independent complex. Independent complex initial complex is just the for us we can just consider that it has Just consider that it is close but subset of close and uh taking success. So independent set apparently certified the condition. And the independent component just formed by the independent set the ACTD address. Basically, just this, and maybe discrew the empty set for the complex. They do not like an empty set. And then we have a boundary. This is the boundary operation. Just something like if Say if you have a face, a simplex, if you have a simplex dimension 2, they call it dimension 2, then if you take the boundary, then it will be equal to 1 got 2 plus just 2 goes 3 and then plus M Okay. One strategy is that if you take the simpler, if you take the boundary again for any A, you will get the I zero. So for example, if you do it again, then you will have If you do it again, then you will have 2 minus 1 and then 3 minus 2, 1 minus 3. And it will cancel out, it will equal the 0. So I can basically say that, okay, if you consider the panel over here. Of here, and then image which one should I have either this one, k plus one or this one. Anyway, maybe I made a mistake, but this one could be k plus one. And then the dk of it would just equal to the dimension. Equal to the dimension of an HK. We basically say that topologically, say that how many independent holes there are when you consider it as a topological phase. And then basically, E0 equal to the number of components of G. Of G. If we consider the independent complex, no, if we consider the independent complex or it's a compliment, or the complement of independent That are not important. There will be fields, but you know, basically, if we consider this one, it's called the trivial one in here, then it basically equals most of the time it's the same. But you will not have a distributed one, you will equal the number of components minus one for the quick complex. But anyway, this is just some of the concepts that you may know better than me. I don't know that much about this algebraic topology. But we just use, what you do is that we use this one. This one to trend to combatorial property version. But let's go through more property. What's the relation between these two? This is called Hancair polynomial. If I use the F and then maybe I use a G, it will equal to equal to dk power xk and then if we take g x equal to 1 then it will be equal to the sum of them g1 will be equal to the sum of this one and then specifically if it have the g negative one it is called the Euler curvisky. So, for example, especially when we consider the context of a graph, there are two ways to consider it, two natural ways to consider it. One is that we only consider it have the phase only have up to dimensional one. Then you have only a vertex in the dimensional zero. Dimensional zero and then edge is a phase with dimensional one. And then there is the natural way to consider that. For that one, the Euler characteristic will be just the one that we are familiar with. For example, the planar graph will have the Euler character negative two. And then which comes with the face and Counter the phase and the thing of if you do the triangulation of planet block. And then there is a theorem that okay, if now we consider this number of the phases, the number of the phases, phases, for any complex, not only for independent. Any complex, not only for independence complex, but any complex, then this value will be equal to, if I use this language, let me first use that one first. Okay, but that is by the definition. Sorry. If you can see the oil uh uh current state, uh it is equal to the sum of the negative one power K e. Negative one power k d k, right? And then if we consider the faces, then this one will equal to just equal to the Euler curves DC and you will have Then you will have the absolute value of this one, it is less equal than the absolute value of this one, the total sum of them. And if we consider the independent set the difference is that we can see the the uh the faces. The faces, okay. This is the dimension of it. Then it will be a minus one when you consider the dimension of a face. If you have a sphere a minus dimension two, so this one will be equal to just the with uh reduced one and then you take a negative over uh if you test the n reduced one. The the difference is that this one equals The difference is that this will equal to minus one here, and then we do not take the empty set. So that means that that means that if you consider this one, it will be less than equal than the B ng equal to our number. We define this one to be the total betting number is less than equal to that. So that's why this is strong. This is strong because if you have the original people that maybe the betting number first. If you have a total bounded number of a betting number, then if the community number is bounded. However, if the total betting number is bounded, then the Betty number is bounded and the Euler current is bounded. So this is bounded. And this is bounded implies that Covati number is bounded. So this is the stronger form. And finish all the function of about the relation between this ilo islocharistic uh and uh and um betin or the betting number uh between the commander number. Between the command and but if you can see the this one and this one this is stronger because this one is basically equal to d k okay the alternating sum is less than equal to one so So, with my student Win Hao Zhang, appear of the EMS online in 2023, but it's not an official class. So, yeah, that FG is a category in price. This one will be equal to this one as the total battery number will be MOS 1. So that means that there will be either all of the Bi equal to zero or exactly one over the BK for some BK equal to one. Equal to 1. We use the difference that we use the Betty number, the property of a Betty number a little bit, but most of the idea come from the tool of this paper. So in this paper, they can see the okay, let FG, let's see that. Let's see that if let Fg equal to just this number Then there will be an easy observation that this one can be inductively equal to equal to this one minus G minus N V. By considering, when we consider the independent set, there are two kinds of set. One is that it does not contain V. So it comes out here. Uh the independent set does not contain V. If it do contain V, then you cannot contain any other uh those neighbors. Any other consonators. So and then you already have a negative one. So you will have this one. And then consider a graph like consider G minus if a given set destroy set vertex F A and B A and B, they further consider minus A minus this MP induction, so there will be a model about A B and uh it but this one is only uh But this one is only good if A is independent. So now I want to give an approach the structure of based on the Becky number instead of based on this Euler characteristic structure. And give a structure that is different than in our paper. So we consider such this model, we also consider the structure of what is the value of here. By induction, this value could be 0, 1, or negative 1, right? By induction of here, 0, 1, and negative 1. Let's see that. Let's see that why first why is the ternary graph first for betting number? For the topological side, is that if you have a independent even G Quite three. What is the minimum graph that have the betting number equal to two, beta equal to four? This is the from topological view. This is the question they will not answer. But minimal means that minimal means that any induced supplier, any proper induced subgraph we have. We have this one less than or equal to one. And when, if you consider a central complex, one is equal to greater equal than two. And especially for this kind of pure complex, and for like click complex or independent complex, what is the reason that it could be go up to two? And then by By considering this number, we know that C33K, this one C3K, we do have this total number equal to 2. That's the topological one. And then now I want to consider, now suppose, consider if let G Consider if let G suppose G is now we consider assume not necessarily assume that B and G is less A for the one assume maybe maybe the last the whole graph is also good but uh but maybe it could be uh bad. Bad it would be two equal to two for some uh that uh it's an argument. It's an argument. And then assume we have this property. We want to consider the case that not only we know that it will be equal to 0, 1. And now we try to focus on the subgraph of time form here and it equal to. We consider with B and G minus A minus N B equal to 1, and what can we say about this uh pair of A B? If A B uh maybe A B uh B will require to be independent. Required to be independent. To form this formula, we consider combinatorial structure that we have the graph flat edge equal to the edge. We have a V edge this way. So if we have the zero, one, two, and then let's assume that And let's assume that V equal to many of the time we can assume that V equal to N. And then we can see the two edges, vertices. This is the Q, hyper Q, that two are adjacent. First, surely we should have that integrated VH in this V. That's we agree. And then the difference by almost one exactly one position is H is too irregular because Because for every one position, you can go up or go down. And then now I want to consider how I consider this way to compare to here. What I want is that give it an X. We can see the uh this V uh V I, V one, V 0 X, oh no, V I X because those vertexes that X V equal to I. So it could be V 0, V 1, V 2 and I would like to use the V 0 V V V V V V V V V V I would like to use the V0 corresponding to the A and then V1 corresponding to B. So basically, I would like to consider Gx equal to G minus V 0x minus the neighbor of the zero minus zero. Uh neighbor of V1x. So this one will be the one V and then we will have V1B if we only come mostly we consider it that this one is independent set. Now I consider a subset of the vertices in here based on this graph. Let F be a subset of VH such that if you take If you consider such that, okay, first is that we will have first it will have the V1x is independent. Secondly, is that this graph This one we i if we consider the A is the independent set independent set in this G X it is you can consider it is even it is odd that means basically It is uh that means basically by induction it will be equal to one or negative one. But anyway, actually actually this one also not important. You can consider that it is just the sum whether it is whether it is the number of independent set is even or up. So we only focus on the one with the outer case that corresponds to those ones with betting number equal to one. With betting number equal to one. Then we will have a equal to 1. Then we will have a pre-proposition on F, this is a special vertices of F. So first is that if we consider the subblock induced by F, it is irregular irregular in is level two irregular. Secondly Secondly okay, let me just use this one. And then there's a let's consider there's a theorem that we are based on. But this is a need to use the this is the only part that we use this topological, the algebraic topological on the Betty number. But I will skip the process. Just give you the property of this F I So fast. I do not have the time for any of the proof, but maybe they give you the structure of it. So you will have that it exists if PNG is and let me say that if any If any induced subgroup of a tree has Pn less than or equal to one, then we will have function such that For any x, if you can see the modular diasvi, it will be exactly equal to the sum of x v. If you have two uh two vertices uh both of them I can Both of them I in F, then Y X in F, their neighbor. Then the difference will be equal to 1 if Y equal to X plus some like this. If we go up, so this Y equal to 1 at the this is 0 0 0 0 V. 000 V position. If we go up, then this value will go up. If we go down in this tree, for example, if we go from 0 to 2, then it will go down. So depends on the order. So this is basically that we have from the government by Maya Tobies. We are probably. But this is the only part that we need to use, the topological part. After this one, we will have the property that we can consider a walk between two, any two, if we have any close walk, the total value. If we have a walk, any walk With the total value equal to zero, the value is that if here, if you get IB, then you go up one. If this one is go down IB down I U, then you minus one. The difference can be uh one or negative one. So maybe I don't know how time but based on this structure we can finish uh the law was saying that based on whether this is uh good or not good, then the only pet uh the OGPEP walk Uh the only pad walk will be so the only pad walk will be uh that invoked the advertisements. You cannot be uh you cannot be uh not involved by one. So this one uh theorem is that now we consider a special case maybe G n is uh for any uh proper we consider proper uh case. We can see the proper case. Then the back case is that if there is this backwalk in F, then is this a backwalk on only two vertices? That means that we only change the position on two ways, then it could be the only bad one will be the. The only bad one will be this one plus u, plus v, plus u, plus v, plus u, plus v. This will be the only work that we can have. The second thing is that if, let's say that if I do not have the time for the definition, if you can see that the change is only on U and B, and let me say that the other one is equal to two. For the two is good. F u v w is good. That will imply that f uw is good. If you have a backwalk, then the one that form a two pair that is good, then it forms an equivalent class. And equivalent class give us a component. And use this component we we get that uh We get that, and then it will be similar to what they have in the pool: that you will not have any vertex should have a y in the component, and then you do not have two edges on two different components. Do not have this component, C1, C2, C3, C4, with two edges. This is the edges on the original one. Also, there is no one will have only one component. Then this is together it imprisones that it must be three components. Then every vertex have one go to the different side. One neighbor to go into the different side. Then each vertex will have one neighbor to here this time. Then you will form a Then you will form a induced CSVK. Basically the maybe last bed for the C S V K. If it's a bad. And maybe for the time, I can. That's a good prediction, right? I'm sorry? That would be a contradiction, right? Yeah, yeah, that would give the keep that if this structure must be C3K. It must be C3K. It must contain a C3K. Maybe you can stop the recording. Just stop the recording.
