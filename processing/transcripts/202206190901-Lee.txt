So I'm going to talk about something about quantum information theory and we are especially interested in quantum channels with some symmetric property. And this is a joint work with my former student Sang Yun and he is working in the same university, a slightly different department. Okay, so just a few summary or basic definitions. So we will focus on only So we will focus on only finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. So they are written in this way. And the first object we are interested in is, of course, a quantum state, which is a positive matrix or positive element in B of H with trace value 1. And so we will sometimes use this notation to denote the set of all states. And the second of And the second object we want to consider is a quantum channel. It's nothing but a linear map between matrix algebras. So this one is acting on the A side and the target is the Hilbert space with title B. And we call it a quantum channel if it is completely positive and trace-preserving linear map. So in short, the CPTP maps. TP maps. These two things are the fundamental objects in quantum information theory. And not just quantum information, in general, quantum physics or quantum theory. Of course, the general definitions of these two objects are quite easy, but the totality is just too difficult to understand. So we want to narrow down to some sub-families where we can do some further analysis. Some further analysis, and we usually use the concept of symmetry. And symmetries are usually coming from group actions or representations. So here is one possible connection to the representation theory. Let's say that we want to fix a state on H and we want to consider all the unitaries satisfying this property. So, in short, unitary conjugation with respect to this. Conjugation with respect to this specific unitary doesn't change this specific state. Then, of course, this becomes a subgroup, so we get a unitary representation, which is nothing but just a collection of these things. So, this is one explanation why it is natural to focus on the unitary representation of groups when we consider some kind of symmetry. Of symmetry, and we want to focus on the case of compact groups because it has a rich finite-dimensional representation theory. And as the title suggests, in the end, we want to mention a little bit about what we can do with compact quantum groups, but our main focus is the classical compact groups now. Okay, of course, this symmetry or states preserved on States preserved under certain representation is, of course, something we want to focus on. But we, in particular, want to focus on so-called the bipartite case. So bipartite means we want to consider two systems at the same time, so composite system, which means our Hilbert space is now in, it has two tensor components, HA and HB. And in this scenario, it is. And in this scenario, it is usually regarded to be natural to consider local unitaries. That means we just focus on the unitaries of this tensor form. So that means now we have to think about two representations. So our starting point is again a common compact group G, but now we want to think about two unitary representations. Unitary representations. Now, here comes the basic definitions. A bipartite state rho is called AB. This is the representation we fixed. Invariant if they are invariant with respect to this unitary conjugations coming from these representations, or when this equality holds for any x in G. And now there is a companion definition. There is a companion definition. So we call a quantum channel. Now, from A side to B side, it's called the same pi A, pi B covariant if the action on the A side of this group using this pi A representation becomes kind of pi B actions after we take this phi map. So these So, these two concepts are naturally closely related, and we will come back to that point again. And as you can easily see, I explained the definitions using states and channels, but it's quite clear that we can't apply the same definition for any operators acting on this Hilbert space or any linear maps between these two matrix algebras. Okay, so these two definitions they come along, and the connection between them is usually explained by using the Choi map, or more precisely, Choi-Jamiolkovsky map, or let me call it a C-J map. So, some definitions. Let me write LAB, that's the linear maps from this matrix algebra into this. This matrix algebra into this matrix algebra. And the CPAB and CPTPAB, you can easily guess what they are, the completely positive maps and completely positive trace-preserving maps. So what is CJ map? Maybe you might remember this formula. The linear maps from A side into B side, they can be mapped into They can be mapped into the operators acting on this composite system. And just one more reminder. This is the composite Hilbert space. And the formula goes like this. When we have a map, linear map phi, then we use the matrix units Eij and phi Eij on the right-hand side, and we take the sum. And after taking the tensor product. Taking the tensor product of these two. So this is an isomorphism. It's a linear isomorphism. And this one is what we call Choi map or CJ map. And what Choi and Jamiel Kovsky showed is that the complete positive property of this linear map is the same as the positivity of the corresponding Choi matrix or CJ matrix. Corresponding Choi matrix or CJ matrix. And the next one is what they call the state channel duality: is that among the linear maps from A side into B side, being CPTP is the same as C phi is being the quantum state. And at the same time, there is one more condition we have to consider. If we take the partial trace B side, that Trace B side that means this one is identity times trace on the right hand side then we should get this type of the easy to understand mathematically easy to understand state or maximally mixed state so using this machinery we can transfer many stories from states into the channels ones and at Channels once. And at the end of this talk, we will talk about some examples of that. Okay, so what we observed is that this so-called state-channel duality somehow extends when we consider this covariant or invariant properties. So one thing we have to keep in mind is that if we want to look at pi A, pi B covariant channel, then the corresponding choi matrix or choi state. Choi matrix or choice state should satisfy pi A bar, pi B invariance. So there is a slight change here, and taking bar is the conjugate representation given by this the usual formula. So we take the inverse inside and we take the transpose outside. Okay, so there could be some natural questions. So Natural question. So, the first of all, can we characterize these objects invariant bipartite states or, in other words, the covariant channels? And the second question might be, after we characterize these objects, how can we use these characterizations to figure out what kind of QIT or quantum information theoretical properties of those states? Properties of those states or channels, of course, more effectively than before. Before we give our own answers, let me explain what has been done in this direction. Of course, this concept is quite the natural for quantum theory perspective. There are many people who looked at this side before us, Werner and Holevo, you might remember these. Holevo, you might remember these big names and more collaborators of them. So, the first example they thought about is considering the case of UN, but they just focused on the fundamental representation. So, this is nothing but just the identity map. So, they just wanted to look at the unitary conjugation over all unitary matrices. But, of course, But of course, local ones. And the natural continuation is instead of looking at the unitary matrices, they thought about the orthogonal matrices. So here are the conclusions they got. So as the final product, they got vulnerable states, and the corresponding channels are called vulnerable level channels. And they got these names. And they got these names because they answered some open questions at that time. So, important examples in quantum information theory. They are coming from this symmetric consideration. Now, we are considering this UU invariant states. Or in terms of channels, they become U-bar, U covariant channels. And the conclusion is that they become a line segment. Become a line segment, so it's really just a line segment. And you can, of course, specify the end points. And for example, you can ask questions like whether these channels are entanglement breaking or something like that, some specific quantum information theoretic consideration. Then they found the dichotomy at which point the property changes, or something like this. And the second example is instead of looking at u pair, we can of course think about this u bar u pair. So this invariance gives us similar characterization. And when we move to the channel consideration, it becomes u covariance. And again, of course, this is a different family. We still get a lice segment or one simplex. And they are And their further study used this natural extension to the case of fundamental representation of orthogonal groups. But in this case, we don't have that many choices because the conjugate representation of this one is nothing but the original one. So we don't have that many choices. So we focus on all invariant states or all. Invariant state or covariance channels, then the conclusion is that now we have more complicated scenarios of too simplex. So we have something like a triangle. Okay, so one might say that, of course, this fundamental representation of unitary group, and we actually have to look at their tensor products. So we need some representation theorem. Some of the representation theoretic knowledge to get this conclusion, but as you can see, we have relatively easy objects like line segments or triangle. And now let's move to the next family of results. The former student of one former student of Benua Covin's did something about SU2. So let's recall the Let's recall the family, the standard family of irreducible representations of SU2, then they are parametrized by the natural numbers, and the corresponding dimensions are given by this formula. And she studied this family of representations and their corresponding covariant quantum channels. And she gave a complete description of extreme points because the one Stream points because the one we are looking at is a convex set of covariant channels. And she made the connection to the theory of invariant states mentioned before. And this is something we this is one instance we used, she used a serious representation theory beyond the fundamental ones used before. The fundamental ones used before. And there is one more I want to mention: that the data that she works into a quantum information theory community, and she looked at the finite group case, and they examined the symmetric groups of order 3 and 4 in a detailed manner. And they first used the terminology of multiplicity free conditions. Of multiplicity-free conditions for easier analysis. Okay, so what is this multiplicity free? You might remember that. Okay, so if we go back to this point, then when we go back to the bipartite state case, actually we have to look at this tensor product representation. Representation and multiplicity-free condition is about this tensor decomposition. So, when we have two representation, finite dimensional ones, on compact groups, then they decompose into this finite direct sum of irreducible representation. And if all the components are not equivalent, or if it has multiplicity one, It has multiplicity one all the time, then we call it multiplicity three. So, this case is really easy to analyze, and here is our main result. So, let's say that we fix two irreducible unit representation, because this is the case most fundamental. And fixing one representation irreducible is actually quite important. Without this one, Without this one, the program does not work. And we want one more condition on this tensor product. So pi A bar, tensor pi B, must be multiplicity free. Then our conclusion is that we are interested in the set of, convex set of pi A, pi B covariant channels. And our conclusion is that this convex set is a simplex. And we And we actually can specify what kind of extreme points they have. The set of extreme points are nothing but what we call the Klapsch-Gordon channels. And this is the new terminology we coined, and I will explain about it. So let's go back to this, the irreducible decomposition of this two-tenth product. Then this means that each pij is a sub-representation. J is a sub-representation of this one. But it is quite well known that the representation theory of compact groups and compact quantum groups, then they can make the cyclic cycles of inclusion. So whenever this happens, then you can actually shuffle them around. So pi A actually becomes a sub-representation or a component of the new tensor product. Of the mu tensor product pi B with respect to pi j. So j is one of those components. So in this case, we can actually find the intertwining isometry from the corresponding Hilbert spaces into HB tensor HJ bar satisfying this the intertwining property. Then whenever you have this kind of isometry you can use This kind of isometry, you can use it to construct a quantum channel using the Steinspring representation of CPTP maps. So we take this isometry as the Steinspring isometry, and the resulting quantum channel given by this formula is what we called Klapsch-Gordon channels. And the terminology is, of course, representation theoretic things. And shortly, we will call it C. We will call it CG channels. So, going back to the main results of ours, when we have nice conditions, the most important thing is this tensor product must have multiplicity-free decomposition. And if one of them is irreducible, then we have a very nice characterization of the resulting object. The covariant channels is nothing but a simplex, and we were able. Simplex, and we were able to specify what the points are. And they are nothing but these CG channels. So the study of this family of channels, actually it goes back to the idea of Benoit Collins. It seems like he actually wanted to find concrete examples of quantum channels satisfying this. This is the conjecture about the capacity calculation. So he wanted some new examples. And he did the same consideration about free orthogonal quantum groups and did the same thing. And hoping that it might give a concrete counter-examples of some conjecture. But unfortunately, the initial idea is probably not working. But anyway, But anyway, we looked at this family of channels for some time and we realized that it's a building block to consider this type of covariance of the quantum channels. And one important thing is this new, possibly new family of channels are really new. So if you look at any standard textbook about quantum information theory, then you will see a very short list of quantum information. See a very short list of quantum channels they consider. So they include quantum erasure channels, amplitude damping, dephasing, and depolarizing. These channels are not among this one. So we will talk about the SUT example shortly again. When we do the same construction for SU2 irreducible representations, then we get a bunch of quantum channels, but they are actually different. They are actually different, fundamentally different from the known examples. So, as a result, it's usually very difficult to analyze. Okay, so let me give you a few remarks on the proof. Ah, so I don't have enough time. But anyway, just a few remarks. We want to, in the end, understand the structure of covariant channels, but we move to the But we move to the states consideration. And because of nice assumptions on our representations, we can easily observe that they form a simplex in the states level. And the second thing is we figure out what the possible extreme points are in the states level and we somehow trace back to the channels. And we were able to check that as we explained, they are nothing but the Explained, they are nothing but the CG channels. So I can say that our main observation was that we actually have to focus on the choice map again and we can use our new family of quantum channels, CG channels, as the ingredients. Okay, so here is a list of the examples. Since I don't have enough time, let me just mention. Enough time, let me just mention something. So, SU2 case, this is what Al-Nuarirant already observed as a special case. And these unitary orthogonal group cases, what quantum information people already observed. And SN case is kind of new territory, but if we use the well-known representation theory of symmetric groups, then we can do a little bit more of. And we can do a little bit more of the calculations. So, for example, they give us a three-simplex. And okay, let me move to the quantum situation. So I included just a little bit of quantum story. The important thing is we can do most of the results in the quantum setting. And one interesting thing is we wanted to include all We wanted to include all types of quantum, the compact quantum groups, Katz type and non-Katz type. So, Katz type case can be done in a similar manner, but non-Katz type, we actually have to move to the dual picture of Heisenberg picture, saying that the UCP maps, instead of the CPTP maps, we actually have to look at UCP maps as quantum channels. And because we have quite a natural limitation, if we go to Limitation: If we go to the SUQ2 covariant channels, then we were able to show that most of the known examples we can possibly imagine are not trace-preserving. So, there are some limitations. Okay, so maybe I should stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you, Anit. Sorry about the shortness of the time. Have a question. Any questions? Ethan? Yeah, I guess when you don't have the multiplicity three condition, then you probably won't get as simplex, but can you say something in that setting? Yeah, actually, we found one interesting paper by a group of people, including Andreas Winter. They looked at the same property in a different title, but Title, but they made a little bit further observation that the simplex case is we go back to multiplicity-free conditions. So they are if and only if. Yeah, exactly. And they observed that they have good enough the quantum information theoretic interpretation for that scenario. Anybody else? How about out in the rest of the universe, people watching us on Zoom? That being the case, let us thank Hanhi again for staying up late and giving us a lovely talk. Thank you. Nice to see you. I'm sorry you couldn't be here. All right. Yes. So I have one request. Yes. Is it possible to share the list of the participants, offline participants? Foker, is it on the website yet?
