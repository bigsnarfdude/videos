Hi, so thanks a lot to the organizers for the conference, to Adel for inviting me, also for the nice talks that we had so far. I'm going to talk about a common project joint with Sebastian Krap, Francuhlmann, Daniel Bernard Solo, and Nikkei Lesla. So we are all here except Daniel maybe online. So it could be about the correspondence between The correspondence between the relations and automorphisms in certain algebras, and the correspondence is given by an exponential map. So, this is my entry in this before we start. I was asked to provide questions for everyone, so just my first one. What do you think? Anyone? Anyone? Yes, you can. Okay. Okay. Anyway, so it's just a way for me to say that there will be some non-commutative algebra in the talk. The exponential will be defined on some non-commutative objects. Okay, so before I explain to you why we started to look at this correspondence, let me just illustrate the correspondence with a simple example. So consider the So we contribute the entire function.
