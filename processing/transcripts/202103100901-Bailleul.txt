Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce our first speaker today, Ismail Bayor. And I'm trying, yeah, thanks for Bris for a tip how to butcher this name. So Ismail got his PhD with Yves Lejean. He's now at RAND, though, physically. At RAM, though, physically right now he's visiting Vancouver Sanderson, and he'll tell us something about gardening in the field of stochastic differential geometry. Thank you. Yes, so thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone. So, indeed, I try here to give you a picture from what I understand may be part of the history of the subject. So I'll be, it will certainly be fairly partial and biased. So I'll be happy if you, if anyone can correct me at any time. So perhaps as a stableborn mathematician, I'd like to start with what could be a definition of what we're talking about. And I spotted the following thing in a review by Daletsky from 81. The review was called stochastic differential. The review was called Stochastic Differential Geometry, and his first sentence was a definition of the subject. It's a good point to start from. So, his definition, up to a few words, was the following one. It's the study of random fields with values in or indexed by finite or infinite dimensional manifolds equipped with some geometric structures with the tools of stochastic calculus. I think that's a I think that's a fairly general definition in which you can more or less put everything, but it seems accurate. So when I talk about geometric structures here, one could think of the following things. Riemannian structure, well, any kind of geometric thing could be Riemannian, complex, contact, symplectic, calarian, finslarian, sub-Riemannian, Lorentzian fiber, dot, dot, dot, mixing all these things. All these things. And perhaps before going forward, the first question that one may ask is: why on hell would we have to work with stuff defined on manifolds? And well, I guess the first point and the point here is that in physics and in modeling nature, whenever you have constraints, the mathematical longures. The mathematical language which is adopted to talk about wild systems with constraints is precisely manifolds, as more less the definition of a manifold. That's a constraint on the system. So in Dalecksky's definition, you have this geometric structure and you have the fact that you can work with finite or infinite dimensional manifolds. So finite dimensional manifolds, everyone has a picture, but for the infinite dimensional case, beyond the more or less Beyond the more or less familiar path space or loop space, which we've heard of before, we may think of a lot more examples, like the gauge groups in some vector bundle, the diffeomorphism group of a domain, or a number of other very interesting examples. Right, so the history. Perhaps, I guess, the best, well, the way I understand things is to put things in perspective. is to put things in perspectives and the development of the history. So I've kind of splitted what I understand from the history in three periods. And I guess the first one is really from the inception of stochastic calculus by Ito to the year 67. And well, that was essentially the development of Ito's calculus of brain motion. Even in this period, Even in this period, well, I could spot a few works related to using both SDs or stochastic calculus and geometry in a number of works. And I've given here those that seem to be the most important ones. That you see that in 1950, Ito writes the first work about SDs on differentiable manifolds. And while the way he And well, the way he does that is just by patching local solutions of SDs. That was quite tricky. I looked at that stuff. Ten years later, in 63, something of much wider scope with Brighton motion and tensor fields on Riemannian manifolds. And that's the first, I guess, well, that's the first instance that I've seen of stochastic parallel transport, but still in local coordinates. In the meantime, In the meantime, McKinnon, well, McKinn introduced what will in the end be an intrinsic picture of parallel transport and more or less what was behind the frame bundle, the frame bundle, the use of the frame bundle that will come later. So it came at that time under the name of the injection procedure. Injection procedure in 1960 and in his book on stochastic integrals in 1969. And his PhD student Gong Godi in 1963 actually did something in this direction, that is, defining diffusions more or less by something which is not very far from the development procedure. Right, so that's what's really the Right, so that's what's really the prehistory of all, I guess. And the reason why I spotted the year 67 is that because of Quinita Wasanabe's famous work in 67, on which they define square interchequable martingals. That is, that period that I spot here, 6781, could be summarized, in my sense, under the following question. The following question: What is the scope of stochastic integration? So, this question is opened by the enlargement of the theory by the Kunita-Watanabe theory of squared introbible martingals. And I guess it's closed in 81 or 79 by the DeLashi-Bicteler theorem characterizing entirely what stochastic integral is and what are the integrators and the integrals in the theory. Theory. And that's in this period that, I guess, stochastic differential equation or stochastic differential geometry was born. I guess the main paper that is the birth of the subject is the Elts Ellsworthy famous paper about winner integration on manifolds, in which Caton development is. Folks, in which CATON development is introduced. Just a few, well, that wasn't, I, yeah, that wasn't, if I, okay, David will say that, but it already was in a finite or infinite dimensional setting. I mentioned that just two years after that, Koos made interesting contributions about biomotion and infinite-dimensional manifolds. At the same time, in At the same time in Russia, or in former Russia, there were groups of people working in this direction as well. But from what I understand, what really gave the impetus to the subject was Maliavant's fundamental works, in addition to Els and Elworthy works. So, of course, I can't not mention his fundamental work about stochastic calculus of variations. Calculus of variations, in which ideas, geometric ideas, and the idea of doing some geometry on path space was already inside. And of course, his Geometrie differentiator stochastic, his lecture notes, Geometrie differentiator stochastique, in which, in 78, in which the transfer principle from ODs to SDs was explicitly, well, highly involved and developed. Involve and develop developed. And well, and Eles Elwersi's Carton development was just an instance of that transfer principle from ODs to SDs. Emphasize that I guess that was one of the first times that I saw such a heavy use of the machinery of stochastic flows that was to be developed around those sites by different guys. Mariela himself, Bismille as well. Maliavin himself, Bismille as well, and Counita, and so on. Here is an interesting stuff that I've seen on a review of Maliavan's book in a journal. That was differential geometry is no more than a chapter in the theory of ODs. That's the reviewer who's writing that. And it's therefore not too surprising that any novelty in the field of ODs, that is, stochastic differential equation here, contributes new. Contributes new insights in the whole of differential geometry. It seems to me that that's indeed a fairly relevant point of view to say that the development of SDs and stochastic differential equations should have, and it's natural that it has, an impact on part or all of our understanding of stochastic differential geometry seen from the differential points. From the differential point of view. By the way, the reviewer, slightly after that sentence in his review, was saying that Maliabin's book, Hero Géometris Differencille Stochastique, was entirely ununderstandable for anyone who is not really very much involved in the subject. So it's happy that we arrive 40 or 50 or more 40 years later than that. So, going forward, I'd like to mention a different direction that the subject has taken at some point and which is not so much undertaken anymore. And that's the Schwarz-Meyer point of view. That was actually very close to the point of view developed by a number of people in the former Russia. Russia. So the main two things here that I mentioned are the famous gémétrie differential solarme, so that differential geometry without tears of Meiller rewriting things done by Laurent Schwartz in the early 80s. And the point here is that from the purely probabilistic point of view, what they've done was the best option. They were inventing and formulating things in such a way that you can things in such a way that you can write Ito equations even in a geometric setting. While from the geometric point of view, the best option seems to be the Stratonovich formulation, which is the best because it obeys the usual first order calculus, which is precisely what's behind Maliavant's transfer principle to have a copy and paste from usual ODE to SD. OD to STs. Right. But somehow this point of view was kind of abandoned, not very much followed, because it required a real investment in the objects that you had to learn to manipulate the subject, whereas Stratonevich's differential equation was not such an investment. And in this early period, I like Period, I'd like to mention, of course, David Ellworth's influential book on stochastic differential equations and manifolds, in which he really had a truly infinite-dimensional point of view on the subject. He was more or less, yeah, rather than solving a point motion on the manifold, finite or infinite-dimensional, he was really defining the dynamics in the space of flows on the manifold. On the Manifold. A very influential book. So I guess that was part of the elements from which the where that was the primitive C, if I may say. Adding to that, I guess we can't forget about everything that happened outside of the probability or mathematical community, and in particular, And in particular, there were fairly related things happening on the mathematical physics side. And the obvious thing to say, I guess, is to say that problems from quantum mechanics and quantum field theory actually fed the subject even just as a source of inspiration. Just think of the Feynman Kuck formula. Feynman, there's this Feynman inside. There's this finite inside. And well, let's say, let me make a stupid parallel to emphasize that point. The Newton's dynamics of a particle, it's this equation that I've written. So the acceleration, nabla of Q dots, is proportional, is given by the gradient of a potential. That's Newton's equation on a manifold. When you quantize that in a good way, you end up with the you end up with the the the heat kernel well with the heat operator plus the multiplication operator by the by the potential it's an object that pops up naturally in the study of of random motion and manifolds okay so in in in its very simplest form here you see that the consensus of the newton's equation gives you some something that is very familiar to us uh perhaps more importantly uh but More importantly, but that was too hard, I guess, at the time. The analysis in past space and loop space done by the physicists via the users of functional integration, that is really the fine-minded picture of quantum mechanics, was a real source of development for building a proper measure-theoretic analogue of these functional integrals. Of these functional integrals. And moreover, there's actually still a real need of developing measures on loop groups or path space in order to have some tools to study the representation theory of loop groups. That was stuff that had been around for ages in the mathematical physics psyche. And fine, yeah. And fine, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so just to mention that, as always, the business in the mathematical physics community is way ahead of what we can do at a given time. And that was the case already at that time with development of stochastic calculus on manifolds. If you think, for those of you that may have given an eye to these things, Eye to these things, the quantization, stochastic quantization, the program of stochastic quantization by Parisi and Wu, which dates from the 81, if you, one or two years later, there were indeed some SDs, those stochastic differential equation on configuration spaces of infinite dimension geared towards implementing the Paris-Vu picture of quantization. So that's still done from a mathematical Still, that what that was done from a mathematical physics point of view, but that's really the part of the business that we should be doing right now. Okay, so we are 40 years behind the physicists, but still in progress. So, the period of the early 80s, I guess, one of the landmark events was the early works by B. Smith, which we've heard of about his integration by Paul. We've heard of about his integration by parts in the previous talks. So, in his famous green book, The Large Deviation Malevin Calculus Book, he introduced the fundamentals of the gradient formulas, integration by parts, while doing tricky things involving flows, variation of the initial point, variation of the path, transfer from one another. That was too much for everyone at that time, I guess, except for Maliava and a few others. And well, he used that in the amazing paper about the Atiya-Singer's theorems, which marked, I guess, his departure from the probability world to the geometry world. Right, this was once again fairly well in advance for his time, and it took time before it was digested. And I guess that the second and much. And I guess that the second unmarked paper of this sparkling period is, of course, Driver's paper of 92, in which he managed to really put a framework that could be the basis of all the foundations of what we could be doing regarding past space analysis in Windows space. So, in this Menma paper, he introduced Elmart paper, he introduced the appropriate definition of what a Cameron-Martin space on pi space over a manifold could be. And he was able to show that it generates a flow given any element in the Cameron space. You have an associated flow on the past space on the manifold for which Wiener measure is quasi-invariant. That was really a foundational paper, which opens the roads. Which opens the road, from what I understand, to the analysis on past space. And one of the reasons for that is, well, having these, well, these differential calculus opened the way to defining Ornstein-Leonbeck operator, Malayavan calculus, and so on, talking about functional inequalities associated with that Ornstein-Leonbeck operator. That was really. That was really a very big and important work. I need to mention here, in parallel to that line of development, the line of development that happened on the stochastic calculus over winner space, the flat winner space to start with, with the Japanese school. And of course, Grossworks as well. Right, so from that time on, so it kind of opened a number of doors that have been followed by, well, the whole of us. And I mentioned the, well, two important doors, the project, Mali-Vance project about Riemannian geometry and past space, and in parallel, well, the Elworthy Lee project, say, about building a hard-durant theory on past space, that is, try and On pass space that is try and end. Well, since now we have a differential operator where these drivers work, we have a differential operator, we have a calculus on pass space, we can try and impart what's known from finite dimensional analysis on manifolds to this infinite dimensional setting. Perhaps history says that the initial Mali-Vance project about Riemannian geometry and past space has in the end taken a different line. Space has, in the end, taken a different line with a different direction in the early, well, 20 years ago, with the development of the Washelstein calculus and pass spacing. It was something unforeseen at that time. Let me mention that it actually, so that driver's work was, and the first works in this direction were set on a compact manifold, and that was useful to have that compactness here. And it actually turned out to be fairly non-trivial to leave. Be fairly non-trivial to leave the compact setting. And this can be understood from the fact that, well, the machinery that has been developed uses the flows of differential equations, say, of stochastic differential equations. And if it's easy to have flows on compact manifolds, it's not easy, it's not obvious to have complete flows on non-compact manifolds. And it actually took, from my understanding, Took, from my understanding, quite a bit of energy to get the good ideas to make things work on a non-compact manifold. Right, so for beginners like me, where to learn these, well, pieces of these now classical theory of stochastic differential geometry. I guess these three references here are very good references to learn. References to learn. Driver has a number of lecture notes that are all more amazing one than the other, but the one called Curved Winner Space Analysis is really excellent. Sue's book also is really an excellent source for learning, I guess. And there is this book by Emri, in which you can learn the different ways of talking about stochastic differential geometry using the Schwartz. geometry using the Schwartz and second order tangent bundle, the Schwartz picture. Right. Now I'd like, if I may, come back to the definition of Dalitsky, that Dalitsky gave of stochastic differential geometry in order to point a number of directions that might be relevant for future. So let me recall you. That's the study of random fields with values That's the study of random fields with values or with values in or indexed by finite or infinite-dimensional manifolds, equipped with geometric structures, and all that with the tools of stochastic calculus. Right. So the directions that the subject has taken, the subject as a whole has taken, I see a few main streams, main avenues in the different directions that have been taken. In the different directions that have been taken, one of those is to use all this stuff in order to reprove or improve or go beyond some known results from geometry or analysis. So one could say, for instance, as reproving the famous Li-Yao's inequality from the stochastic analysis point of view. Well, it's fairly non-trivial. In this direction, let me, I'd like to offer you Let me, I'd like to offer you a little problem, some stuff that I've been working, well, not working, thinking of for ages, and I've never managed to do that. So, I'm offering a Kreprinren to anyone who will show me or show anyone a probabilistic proof that harmonic functions of a smooth elliptical Perele on a manifold actually have the unique continuation property. Okay, that's a fun little problem. Proving the unique continuation. Proving the unique continuation property using stochastic differential geometry. Okay, that's a think of that as a kind of an analogous of a Mali-Avan's proof of Homondo's hypolytic theorem. This is another landmark statement. The unique continuation property of solutions of smooth elliptic operators is a landmark work, is a landmark. Landmark work is a landmark statement. So I'd be fairly happy if anyone can come with a probabilistic proof of that stuff. Fine, so a crepry is offered for that. Right. So the different directions. Doing what analysis or geometers do. Okay, or doing that better. Spotting the Daletsky is the finished. The Daletsky's definition. Let me emphasize a few things. Things about geometric structures. What can we twist about geometric structures? What has been done? Well, there's the direction of having not smooth geometric structures. That is, working and doing stochastic different geometry, not on smooth manifolds, but on metric measure spaces. Okay? And the development of the functional calculus of Of the Macrian really do a gamma-to-calculus was really given a real impetus in this direction. Let me make some add for the next talk that will be in this direction by Hassel Offer on his wonderful martingale calculus over past space. A different direction. Not so smooth, okay, not so Riemannian. Well, there's a lot of work nowadays on diffusion. Lot of work nowadays on diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds, and that's a fairly interesting direction. But I could also mention a different direction. It could be working on diffusions on Lorentzian manifolds. That's something that has been very little explored. And well, there's a lot of problems in these directions that are waiting for you to try and solve them. The main difference between Solve them. The main difference between Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry being the fact that the Lorentzian geometry is actually much harder than the Riemannian geometry. The large-scale geometry of Lorentzian manifolds is something fairly tricky, whereas the local analysis is the same. So it's begging for you to go there. Okay, still about Riemann structures. It can still be Riemann, but it could be. It can still be a Riemann, but it could be an evolving, a time-evolving Riemann structure. There are a fair number of very interesting works in this direction, especially related to the analysis of the geometric flows like the Ricci flow. Okay. Right. I complain now about the infinite dimensional direction. Of course, the study about The study about the diffusions and loop on past space by, well, I mentioned driver and gross because there have been some phenomena things in this direction. It's been a main source of development. But it seems to me that as a whole, the subject has been very much left untouched. We can think of a number of different infinite-dimensional spaces of geometrical nature. Of geometrical nature for which it would make sense to look at stochastic evolutions in these species. So I'd like to mention some of them. Let me go back to the Newton's equation. So the acceleration is given by the gradient of a potential. But think now that the state space is not going to be a point on a manifold, but that's going to be a diffomorphism of a manifold. Of a manifold. So, phi here is going to be a diffomorphism of a given fluid domain, say M. So, the motion here that I'm describing here is a motion in the space of, in the diffomorphism group, a motion in the space of diffomorphisms of that domain. So, that stuff here actually has an actual, well, has a number of different Riemann geometry you can put on that space, but one of them is the simplest one is maybe the kind of L to me. Is maybe the kind of L2 metric, and well, that was something understood by Arnold, Vladimir Arnold, in 66. He understood that when you look at the geolitics of this altometric in the space of diffomorphisms, you actually end up with Euler's equation of hydrodynamics, of the incompressible fluids. Right, so here, if you go a step forward. So here, if you go a step forward, looking at Newton's equation and not only the geodetic flow, well, what you have is actually you end up working with PDs, here a system of PD involving the velocity field V of your fluid motion and the density of the fluid, the rho here. And well, you see, this kind of system actually describes a fair number, a really large number of fairly Really large number of fairly interesting class of PDs. Well, the incompressible fluids, the compressible fluids, shallow water equations, Camasa Home KDV, and dot dot dot. It's a whole family of PDs that can be understood, PDs on configuration spaces, that can be understood as solutions to Newton's equation on an infinite-dimensional space, here, the space of diffomorphisms of a given domain. So, given that situation, it's really Given that situation, it's really fairly tempting to ask the following thing: add or import some random dynamics in these deterministic dynamics in an intrinsic way. So could you define for me Branian motion in that setting? Well, a Branian motion, because we know that Branian motion in an infinite-dimensional setting is a definition linked to its Camel-Martin space. So, what can we say about So, what can we say about ground motion in that setting here? Can we do random perturbations of Newton's dynamics? This is precisely what is behind an object called the kinetic bore motion, which perturbs the geodesic flow, say, by perturbing with little Branion kicks, not its position, like for Berlin motion, but its velocity. So that's a random C1 pass for which the velocity is subject to some random. Subject to some random Branion kicks from its environment. Think of a particle in a fluid for which the motion of the particles of the fluid would result in having a velocity that has some small wigglings. Can we think of any kind of integration by parts formula for these potential diffusions in this kind of environment? Do we have some homogenization of the following form? So kinetic brand motion. Of the following form. So, kinetic brand motion, actually, that's a family of random processes in that setting here, the diffomorphism group of a given field domain. And this family, indexed by one parameter, gives you an interpolation between geodesic motion, solution of Euler's equation, and a kind of Branion flow on the configuration space. So, it's kind of a parallel to Bismuth's Laplacian. Okay. Right. What I'm saying here, I could repeat it with a different, fairly interesting, in a different, fairly interesting domain, which is I can ask the same question, look at the geodesics and the random perturbations, but not this time on the space of diffomorphisms of a given free domain, but on the space of Riemannian metric of a given matrix. Manifold M. Okay, so let me ask you the following thing. Can you think of what a Brandon motion on the space of Riemannian matrix over M is? Can you give me some properties of that Brandon motion? Well, what happens as time goes to infinity? Well, I guess, well, depending on the metric that you choose to work with, you may have different answers. But. But what I want to say here to summarize is that there's been a lot of efforts put in the study of the loop and the path space of groups. That's really cool, but we have other infinite-dimensional configuration spaces that are waiting for us to try and say things from our probabilistic point of view. These are just two examples. Okay, this Okay, this was about the infinite-dimensional aspect of what's been done so far. I have complaints as well on the direction of stochastic calculus to formulate. Well, not really complaints, but hopes, say. We actually, I think we're all biased by the fact that a one-dimensional parameter is a time. Okay, so when we do stochastic calculus, we think of So when we do stochastic calculus, we think of t, the time as a time. And actually, I guess we should make some efforts to think of t, the one-dimensional parameter, not as a time as well, sometimes. And here is an example. Think of t. So let me imagine we have a random field in a geometric background. Okay, think of t here, the time parameter, not as a time, but as a scale parameter. So you have a Parameter. So you have a field zeta here. And if I regularize zeta with a given approximation of the identity indexed by the parameter t, my smoothen field becomes a field indexed by the parameter t. And t here doesn't play the role of time. It plays a role of an accuracy parameter, a scale parameter. In that picture, In that picture, if you take, for instance, white noise, you regularize it with a convolution, the meaning of t will be that at scales lower than t, your smooth field will essentially be constant. Whereas at scale higher than t, it's going to be, oh well, it's going to have oscillations. Okay. Okay, so it happens, it seems to me that in this direction, using stochastic calculus to do analysis of random fields, but with time replaced in our minds by an accuracy or a scale parameter, that should be something fairly useful. And I'm thinking precisely in this direction to the business about the renormalization of random fields. Of random fields that appear in the study of singular stochastic PDs. Somehow, it seems to me that, and that's an example of using stochastic calculus in a geometric background in an infinite-dimensional setting here. It seems to me that in the end, all this business about renormalization should somehow summarize under the sentence that, well, the renormalization process. The renormalization process that I've invented for some reason, actually, they are in the end. The only thing that they do is that they allow us to convert some fields or functionals of fields into martingals. And by doing stochastic calculus along the scale parameter t that parametrizes the regularization operation, that should give us the reason. That should give us the reason why these renormalized fields converge in the end, just by turning fields into martingales, say. So to summarize here, I think we should make some efforts to, well, not only to study at random motion indexed by time, but to also study fields, that is random fields, and to import the time technology. The time technology in the analysis of those fields via the use of a regularization operation, in which time actually has the meaning of a scale parameter. Right. Something else happened in this direction of stochastic calculus. So let me go back to a quote that I gave you about the review of Mali Avant's works. Of Maliavan's works earlier. The reviewer was saying differential geometry is no more than a chapter of the theory of ODs. It's therefore not surprising that any novelty in the field of ODs contributes new insights to the whole of differential geometry. Now here's the point. Ito theory changed the world of ODs into SDs. Fine. Actually, some of the things that are the same. Fine. Actually, something similar happened some 30 years ago. Stochastic calculus has seen the birth of Lyons' theory of rough pass calculus. And it seems to me that has been not so much used so far. I guess we should try and do stochastic differential geometry by using the tools of rough pass calculus. That is, let's try and build a kind of a rough... Let's try and build a kind of a rough differential geometry rather than a stochastic differential geometry. So, for those of you who don't know what this business is, rough pass calculus, it's actually a deterministic theory of controlled ODs, so ordinary differential equations driven by some irregular paths. And Lyons has invented a world where, well, you can actually work with paths as irregular as random motion or fractional brand. As brand motion or fractional brand motion, or these kind of ugly guys. But in his theory, you have a solution map, that is, solution to your control ODE, which is a continuous function of the control. In stark contrast with the fact that in Edel theory, the solution to a stochastic differential equation is just a measurable function of the driver here, brand motion of the martingale. Motion or the mounting air. So, something really strong happened there. Lyons invented for us a setting where you have a continuous solution map. And moreover, and that's the important point for us, his theory encompasses Ito's integration theory, provided you have some sufficient regularity of the coefficients. So, I guess we can't let that fact aside. We need, in some way, We need in some way to use the strengths, where it would be useful to use the full strengths of Rothman's calculus to go in some directions beyond what has been done with the tools of stochastic calculus. Because I'm going to point here for you a few directions in which RoughPass is definitely much, much better than stochastic calculus. And it actually echoes a little David's remark, David Elwes'. David's remark, David Erwess's remark of yesterday about differentiating in some non-camera martin space direction. The discussion after the last talk yesterday. So what can rough pass calculus make for us? Well, the essential thing is that all the, well, the calculus of rough pass is a deterministic theory for which everything you can draw. For which everything you can dream of works. Okay. So if you want to formulate, well, the problem about stochastic calculus and Mali-Vance calculus and these things is that it's really tricky. It turns out to be tricky and fundamental, as Elton Seuss said yesterday. You need your transformations, your translations in camera matter space to preserve the winner space, the winner measure, otherwise you can't do probability with that. You can't do probability with that, and it's a fairly strong constraint. And the wonderful thing about the rough pass calculus is that the deterministic calculus doesn't care at all about the winner measure. So everything you want to do with variations of pass, you can do it for free in the usual way, because this setting here is actually a balance-based calculus. So everything you want to do, you know how to do it, and you can do it. And you don't have to take care about probability, and especially you don't have to take care about. And especially, you don't have to care about adaptedness. So, typically, drivers' flow equations, where drivers' flow, solving driver's flow in a rough pass world is something obvious. You solve a first-order OD in a space of controlled pass. Okay, the local time, the fact that the driver's flow is well defined locally in time, it's just obvious. In the same way, in order to construct the To construct the heat measure on the space, it's almost obvious. You have the heat measure on the flat space, you use rough pass to do a development procedure from the flat space to the curved space, and that's all done. And that's what Inahana and Kawabi did some 15 years ago. So, you see, it has real benefits. It may have real benefits to use a mixture of two settings in which the Of two settings in which the calculus part is obvious on one hand and the probability part is dealt with on a different ground. So here in this direction, I'd like to mention the fact that the following things haven't been looked at yet. So, in that for past setting, doing stochastic analysis on past space typically defines On pass space, typically defining what a tangent space to the past space is, to defining differential forms, to look at Hadam theory for non-linear maps, to look at fixed points and degree theory. All this stuff is waiting for you to have a look at that. This is a part of what's been done in the stochastic setting that will hugely be simplified by the using of pass calculus. Roughpass calculus. Okay? By separating everything about dynamics from everything about probability, and that's really the point of Rothpass calculus, even when applied to probability theory. You decorrel the two, you deal with dynamics on the one hand with some deterministic tools, and you deal with the probabilistic side in a prior step or in a step after. Step or in a step afterward. Right. This may not be obvious or easy, depending on the language that you choose to work with RefPass, but is waiting to be done. Now a purely speculative remark to conclude. Remark to conclude still about the um the Dalitsky's definition of what stochastic differential geometry could be. So, I commented on the fact that we have some work to do in the direction of looking at some more examples of infinite-dimensional dynamics taking in an infinite-dimensional geometric setting. One, I made some remarks about the stochastic calculus, the fact that The fact that we should leave aside the fact that time is time, and time can be well, the one-dimensional parameter can be something else. That's one thing. The stochastic calculus could be replaced by some rough pass calculus. That's a second thing. And now I'd like to make a comment on the fact that actually there might be something to look at in the direction of what a manifold is. This is purely speculative. Speculative. But you see, what I understand from the development of rough pass theory and the business about singular stochastic PDs to high-risk business about regularity structures is the fact that one of the things that is coming out of that is that we have a new way of thinking about what a smooth function is in a rough environment. That's one of the environments. That's one of the main things to understand in these theories, rough paths or regulat structures, is that we have actually a way of doing analysis with functions defined in a rough environment. So for the rough pass, the rough object I'm referring to for the rough pass is the rough control, the control of the OD that is not regular in a regularity structure setting for P. Setting for PD setting, it would be the fact that in your PDE you have a noise which is fairly irregular, and you build with this noise some functionals that are still fairly irregular. So it seems like the usual calculus and the usual notion of a smooth function or a regular function is thrown away. But the point is that the building block of these theories is the fact that we actually have a notion of smoothness or regularity, even if you Or regularity, even if in a rough environment. So, this calls for the question, the purely speculative question of: well, is there in this kind of settings an adaptive notion of what a brilliant motion would be? Can we associate in these rough environments some notion of brilliant motion? Brand in motion, yeah, some new notion of brand motion. And once we'll have that guy, okay, we will ask the question about how can that guy define some new dynamics. So I kind of foresee the fact here that one could develop stochastic differential geometry in a setting where there's Setting where the smooth manifold we used to will be replaced by this kind of rough environments. And once again, from the physical point of view, these rough environments are fairly motivated. A number of natural situations lead to this notion of the need of using this notion of Notion of a rough environment. Okay, this is for the next 20 years. So I guess I'll stop here and thank you for listening to me. Thank you. Let's thank and now for questions or comments. Anyone want? One one two
