Raquel Perales, who will speak about upper bounds on the revised first betting number and tourist stability for RCT spaces. Please. Thank you very much for the invitation. And yes, I'm going to talk about some first-betting number and torus stability for RCD spaces. And these are theorems that actually And these are theorems that actually have been proved in the smooth setting, and that's what I want to recall. And I'm sorry if you have given, if you have already seen this talk. So it's very similar to what I have talked about in previous conferences. And before starting giving the results that we are going to generalize to the RCD setting, I want to tell you what is the setup. What is the setup at least in the smooth case? So, in the smooth case, we have a closed Riemannian manifold, and then there we can define the fundamental group. And once that one has the fundamental group, we can define the commutator, which are elements that can be written as ABA minus 1, B minus 1. And these A's are here in the fundamental group, in case you don't remember. Also, the B's. And also, the base. So, this is a commutator. And then one can define the betting number as follows: so, the rank of this abelian group. So, this abelian group is finitely generated and thus it can be written as some powers of the integers to the s times some torsion. So, some sets p i's, and the rank is actually this power. Is actually this power. So, this is the rank. And in the smooth setting, we have all these isomorphisms which we don't have in RCD spaces. So, our definition of first revised Betty number will come from this line. Okay, so let's now start with the theorems. The first theorem, it's not going to be generalized by my work. By my work with Ilaya Mondello and Andrea Montino, but it was generalized to the RCD setting by Digli and Riconi. But let us state this theorem because here is where the story starts. And it says that if you have a Riemannian manifold, here the dimension is important of dimension n, and assume that is closed and orientable with. And orientable with Richie curvature non-negative, then this first betty number is bounded by n, which is the dimension of the manifold. And the quality holds if and only if our manifold is equal to a flat torus. And then later on, Gromov and Galo study the case in which instead of having reaching non-negative, Instead of having Ricci non-negative, you allow Ricci almost negative. But you have to multiply by this diameter square. So for any manifold of dimension n greater or equal than 3, there will exist a small epsilon that depends on the dimensions of the manifolds that we are going to consider, such that if our closed Riemannian manifold satisfy this condition, Manifolds satisfy this condition, then the first Betty number will also be bounded by the dimension of the manifolds. Okay, so we are going to generalize this first theorem and then the story goes like this. A colding in 1987 proved the following stability or rigidity theorem, which says that if you further assume equality on the first Petty number, On the first Petty number. So, equality will mean equal to the dimension of the manifold. Then, what you get is a torus. Well, you get that your manifold is homotopically equivalent to a torus if n equals 3 and homeomorphic to a torus if the dimension is greater than 3. This was in 1987 in a paper by Colding. By Colding, which is called Ricci Curvature and Volume Convergence. And Chigger and Colding improved this result, and they concluded that actually the manifold has to be by holder to a flat torus. Okay, so the aim of this talk, as I have said before, I'm going to present in joint work with Ilaria Mondello and Andrea Mondino, generalization. Mondino, generalizations of Gromov and Galot's result and Chiger and Colding's result. And these generalizations are going to be in the setting of RCDK and space. Before that, I'm going to give a general idea of the proofs in the smooth setting so you understand why we need several results in the RCD setting. But before doing that, But before doing that, also let me tell you that there is a nice talk about this work given by Ilaria in my website. Okay, so let's see what is going on here in the smooth setting. So in the smooth setting, one can define universal cover space of a manifold. One can define a first fundamental group. And then one can define One can define the first betting number. Okay, and another thing that we have, so actually we have these coverings, so we are covering M and if this is satisfies Ricci greater or equal than K, then the manifold, the universe I've covered, also satisfies Richie greater or equal than K. So we need to make sure that in the RCD setting, Make sure that in the RCD setting this is true, which actually is true by Montino anyway. I'll tell you about this later. But we also in the proof will be playing with some quotients. So we will have another quotient here, which we will denote by M tilde. And this quotient is also going to cover our manifold M. So we need to make sure that this or in the That this, or in the smooth setting, we will also have that the rich lower bound passes to this portion m theta. And then, so the proof consists in having some groups, gamma prime, which are going to be isomorphic to set to the power b1 of m, so the first betty number, and these are groups gamma prime. and these groups gamma prime are going to act in this space m bar and then we are going to take a further quotient so in other words let me just explain more about what happens in the proof of the smooth setting so i told you in order to prove chromov and galot's result what one is going to do is study this m bar study this M bar. This M bar is basically take the universal cover mode out by H and this manifold is going to have big diameter and it's going to have the same Richie bound as M tilde. And here we are going to use some Bishop-Gram of volume comparison. Okay? Okay, and then in order to prove the second result, which is trigger and colding result, what one has to do is take manifolds of this form and take a sequence and check that the sequence is getting closer and closer and closer to some Euclidean space. And once that one has that, one has to caution out by One has to caution out by these groups that are isomorphic to set to the power n and see that in the limit we get actors. Okay, so we are going to be dealing, I mean, maybe what I'm saying doesn't make sense now, but what we are going to do is we are going to deal with quotients of manifolds and we are going to be dealing with passing lower bounds to Passing lower bounds to these quotients, and then we are going to have some groups acting on that or on these manifolds. Okay, so let us start with the RCD setting. And I'm not going to say too many things about it. There are a lot of people that have worked on this, and probably you know this. Well, I just want to mention that probably the RCD story started here. And well, let's continue. And well, let's continue. So, here I wrote the definition, which probably you all know. If you don't know it, then but you know about Riemannian manifolds, just check that here we will have a weak Bochner inequality. Okay, so here we have weak Baulkner inequality, and remember that R C D K N spaces stand for simple. stand for synthetic notion of Ricci greater or equal than k and dimension less or equal than n. And they are metric measure spaces that satisfy these four properties that I'm not going to read. And this is my slide in which I tell people why RCD spaces are good. Probably you know this, but they contain Riemannian manifolds with rich Riemannian manifolds with Ricci lower bounds. They also contain manifolds in which one can bound the bachelor-emeri Ricci tensor in this way. They contain Alexandrop spaces. They contain some quotients of spaces. And a lot of things are satisfied within this class, such as Bishop-Cromo-Bolling comparison, Laplacian comparison, Tiger-Cromo splitting theorem. splitting theorem. And I mean, here I'm just citing the results that were proven at the beginning when this class was defined. There are more and more results that hold for this class. And okay, and I mean this last result is about the existence of universal coverings that satisfy the same synthetic Ricci and dimension bounds. But I'm going to Bounce. But I'm going to say more about that in the next slide. So let's just move on. Okay. So first, in order to start talking about fundamental group for these metric measuring spaces, we are going to replace this definition by something that is called a revised fundamental group. So here is the definition. So here is the definition of revised fundamental group if you want to skip the first part. Otherwise, let's treat the first part. So in the first part, I remind you what is a universal cover space. And a universal cover space is just a covering. So it's if you have a space X, and let's assume that the space is X. So a universal covered space is going to be Cover space is going to be a map, which is a covering, and that satisfies the universal property. That means it satisfies this nice commutative triangle with other coverings of X. Okay, so that's a universal cover space. And notice here that I'm not requiring Y to be simply connected. So Y not necessarily simply connected. Yeah, simply connected. Good. And then the group of Beck transformations is going to be defined as all the homeomorphisms between y and y. So we define this for a covering. So given a covering, we define the group of transformations, the group of the transformations of y. Of y and given x, this is just some notation as homomorphisms that again satisfy this triangle or this composition rule. Okay, so that's a group of deck transformations. And the group of deck transformations are very nice because then we have the following properties. So there is going to be a bijection between the fibers. Between the fibers and the group of deck transformations. The basis space is actually the quotient of y divided or mod out by the group of deck transformations. And we have this isomorphism of groups. So notice that when y is simply connected, then this is the trivial group, and then we have this isomorphism. Isomorphism. Otherwise, we have to caution out this group. Okay, and well, now we are ready to say again what is going to be our revised fundamental group. And it's going to be just the group of the transformations of the universal cover space. And this was a definition given by Sermani and Gway. Or money anyway. And now let's talk about the existence of universal cover spaces for RCD spaces and that also satisfy the same Ricci, the synthetic Ricci curvature and dimension conditions. And this was proven by Mondino and Wei. And it's just what I just told you. If you have an RCD space, then it will have. Then it will have a universal covered space that is also an RCDK space. And in this paper, they proved other things. Here I just wrote them for, so you can see which things they proved. And some of them look very similar to what we are going to do later on. For example, they obtained that the universal cover is isomorphic to this type of spaces. Of spaces, so a product of an RCD space times some Euclidean factors, and they also get some dimensional flat turbos. I'm skipping all the hypotheses, but these things are very similar in case you are interested and want to look at them in that paper. Okay, so now I'm ready to state the theorems that. The theorems that Mondelo, Montino, and myself generalized to this setting. Okay, so first, what we need to know is what is going to be our replacement of a betting number, first betting number. And as I told you before, what we are going to do is we are going to replace the first fundamental group by the revised fundamental group. And so the And so the rank can be defined in this way. And in order to define this quantity, one has to make sure that this group is finitely generated. And so this is a well-defined number. And that's what we did in the paper using work of Sermani and Wei. So using work. I mean, they have a similar proof for manifolds, and the only thing that they are using is a bishop-chromof. Using is a bishop-chromof volume comparison, which for the RCD class it holds. Okay, so once that we know what is going to be our first betting number, we also, as I told you in the proofs, we need to pass to some quotients. So this is a theorem that tells us that we can pass to some quotients. So here we start with a metric space that is compact, and then we take a subgroup H of the revised fundamental group. The revised fundamental group. And then we can quotient out this space, the universal cobalt space. And we take the appropriate distance, the one that actually makes this locally isomorphic to, or that makes this locally isomorphic to the universal covered space. And this new space is also going to be an R C D K N space. And it's going to be covered by. And it's going to be covered by the universal cover, and it will cover x. So, once again, we will have this commutative triangle that I told you about one has for manifolds when one uses the first fundamental group. Okay. And so now that we did this, we can prove these theorems. So the first theorem is Chromov and Galot. Kromov and Galot's result that tells you that if you have a dimension, then there is a small number that depends only on this dimension such that any compact, and here we are putting compact instead of closed oriented manifold, sorry, closed manifold. Here we just need compact RCDK in a space that satisfies, and now this is our replacement. this is our replacement of diameter square of x multiplied by Ricci greater or equal than some epsilon n. So this is our synthetic way to say that this condition is satisfied. So if our metric measure space satisfies this condition, then we have that our revised Betty number satisfies that it's Satisfies that it's bounded by the floor of n. So here we have floor of n because remember that here the dimension is any number between one and infinity. Okay, so that's the first theorem. And the second theorem is the theorem of trigger encoding, well, the generalization. And remember that they want to conclude that in the end, if you assume, if you further assume. If you assume, if you further assume that your first Betty number equals the dimension of your manifold, and in this case, it's going to be floor of n, we have a torus. And I mean, because n is any real number, we won't have that unless we assume at some point that our dimension bound is a natural number. So let's treat this tree. If you have 3 tree. If you have as dimension bound a natural number, then what will happen is that the measure of our RCD space that we started with is just going to be a multiple of the Hausdorff measure. And in this case, we can conclude that our metric space is by Holder homeomorphic to an n-dimensional flat torus. Well, in the condition, well, condition well and having that that our metric space is by holder homeomorphic to an n-dimensional torus will tell us right away that the first betty number the revised first betty number is going to coincide with the first betti number that that we know how to define from from the manifold case okay but this is just Okay, but this is just a further consequence and it's just an observation. There are other things in between that have to be proven because we are in the class of RCD spaces. And the things in between that we prove are the following. That our metric space is going to be fluorophene rectifiable, and also that a cover. A covering of our original space XDM is going to be Gromov House of close to a flat torus of dimension floor of n. This is when we don't assume that the dimension bound is a natural number. And as I told you before, a generalization of Bogner's theorem was done by Gigli and Triconi, and they don't use our Our definition of first PETI number, but they use the definition of the dimension of the first cohomology group. Okay. Sorry, can I interrupt for short? Do you know anything about the relation between these two notions of Betty numbers? No, I mean, it could be nice to study this, I guess. To study this, I guess it's hard. Yeah, okay, thanks. I was just curious. Yeah, we don't know anything at this moment. Okay, thanks. Okay, so I want to give proofs in the smooth setting. And just at the end, I'll tell you how the proofs go in the RCD setting. So in the smooth setting, we have first this theorem. We have first this theorem in which we want to find a bound on the first Betty number, a bound actually in this precise way, if we have a manifold that satisfies this condition. Well, actually, we want to find this epsilon, small epsilon, such that if our manifold satisfies this, then we also have this bound. And as I told you before, we need to pass to this question. Pass to this question. So, here actually we have an action. And so that's why we have an action of H in. I never know if the arrow should be this way or the other way. But anyway, we have an action and thus we can take this question because we are looking at the fundamental group as deck transformations. Okay, so. Okay, so now we have this question, and what do we do? We have to use or one has to use this lemma by Gramov in which once that we are in this space m bar, one picks a point. So I pick a point here. So this is my picture, x-bar, and I'm going to choose a k. And now, what is going to happen? I'm going to have To happen, I'm going to have a small ball. Well, actually, a ball of radius k diameter of m. So, this is k diameter of m. And then the bigger ball, so the one that goes from here to here, is has radius 2k diameter of m. And what Gramov tells me is that one can find a subgroup that I'm going to denote as gamma k. Not as gamma k and that is generated by some list of elements. Actually, we have big one m elements because this group is going to be isomorphic to z to the big one m and the elements in this group are going to satisfy the following. So, if I want, if I take an element here, gamma, in this group, then it's going to move my fixed. Going to move my fixed point x bar to this part. So here is going to be gamma x bar, gamma x bar, as long as this element is a non-trivial element. And then what is going to happen is that the generators are not going to move far away. They are not going to leave this bolt. So actually, at the end, we are not leaving this anus. So we are, if we move x-bar by any of those elements, we are not going to go outside. Okay, so now we are going to use this lemma to prove colding, sorry, to prove Gramov and Galot result. Okay, so let's start proving this. So first, at Richie greater or equal. At Richie greater or equal than zero, we don't need to do anything. So, sorry, Ricci positive, we don't need to do anything. So, then we only need to care about Ricci less or equal than zero. Okay, so once that we are in this case, we use Gromov's lemma and we use Gromov's lemma with k equal to 1. And so, we have this group, this abelian group. This abelian group, and this abelian group we know that satisfies these two conditions that puts almost all the generators, or when the generators move X bar here in the center, they go in the anodus. Okay, so we are going to use these conditions to generate a new class of or a new set. So, this is going to be a set of is going to be a set of the gamma one and it's going to be given by elements that can be written in this way. Gamma is abelian and that's why I can write it as a sum and here what I'm asking of these coefficients is that their sum, their absolute value of their sum is less or equal than r. And this r is the one that I have here. Okay, so I have this. So, I have this set, and what I can quickly check just by definition is that the first betty number is less or equal than the cardinality of this set, and that for any integer, I have this equality. Okay, so this is very good. And now, what we are going to do with this set is basically we are going to create some pizza. To create some pizza. So, how do we create this pizza? It's by acting. So, we have this fixed point, X bar, and we can act by each element gamma in the set Y R. And when we act on it, so we have here, we create some centers of some balls. And the balls that we Of some bolts, and the bolts that we are going to take will have radius diameter of m divided over two. So we are basically having creating this pizza. So all of these are gamma x bar, where gamma is in here in gamma one. Okay, and notice that they are going to be mutually disjoint, and it follows because of this condition. Because of this condition, and because of this second condition, we know that these balls that come from taking, I'm sorry, I am taking gamma in IR, okay, because I took gamma in IR, I know that all these balls actually are contained in this bigger ball of this precise radius. This precise radius and center at my fixed point x-bar. So now we use, we count, I mean, we count the volume of all of them. The volume of all these balls is going to be this because they are isometric. And then it's going to be less or equal than the volume of this bigger ball. So then here we have a Bishop-Romov volume comparison, or we can use Bishop-Romov volume comparison. We can use Bishop-Roma volume comparison and get this estimate. And now, to finish the proof, this is a function that depends on these three elements, but we can tailor expand around this quantity. And we want this quantity to be close to zero. We tailor expand around zero, and we are going to get something like this. Okay, and once that we get. Okay, and once that we get something like this, we will get a contradiction if we assume that our betty number is greater than the dimension, because remember that we already have that the cardinality is 2r plus b to the 1. So this is going to give us, I mean, we have to put this together, this and this. So here we have a power to the n, and in this case, n and in this case we will have a power to the n plus one for example so greater than n okay and so one arrives to a contradiction so then that number that we're looking for that epsilon exists okay so that that's the proof of the of the first theorem and to prove the second theorem i want to mention something that want to mention something that happened in the proof um in the previous proof so in the previous proof what we saw is the following uh remember um the pizza picture in the pizza picture we had a collection of balls and they were mutually disjoint and they covered uh this bigger ball okay and i knew how how to count or i i had i i knew how I knew how to count how many balls I have. So I have precisely this amount of balls. Okay, so then if I further assume that the diameter of my manifold is one, we get that for any r greater than zero, the ball Br X bar contains at least this amount of disjoint balls of radius one half. And I mean, basically, this And I mean, basically, this comes from this. And here I am missing a B to the one. Okay. Yeah. So the previous proof tell us that this remark holds. And this remark is going to be important in what I'm going to tell next. Okay. So to prove, so now here I'm presenting again the theorem that we would like to prove. The theorem that we would like to prove, the torus stability. And what we want to do is assume, further assume that the first Betty number of our manifolds equals n, the dimension, and that they satisfy this condition. So actually, we want to find this small epsilon. And at the end, we want to conclude that our manifolds are by Holder to a flat torus. Flat tours. So, how does the story go, or how does the proof go? It's as follows. So, as I told you, we have here M tilde for a manifold. Then we pass to a quotient which is going to be M bar. And this M bar is M tilde mod out by the commutator of the first fundamental group. And we are going to. And we are going to show that this, that manifolds like this, are chromohaus of close to Euclidean space. Well, actually, they're both. Okay, so let's read this theorem. So we fix a dimension, then we pick an epsilon, and we can find a small number delta that depends on epsilon and n. Then some epsilon and n, such that for any closed Riemannian manifold that satisfies a small Ricci lower bound in this in this way, precisely in this way, first betting number equal to n and diameter equal to one for some delta here. Then the ball center at x bar that I'm fixing of radius epsilon. Of radius epsilon to the minus one is Grammo-Hauser close to the ball in Euclidean space of radius epsilon minus one. And the closeness is given by this epsilon as well. Okay, and that's going to be our first step to prove the stability. How does this proof go? Here, this is just a quick review. This slide is not telling you that much. Light is not telling you that much. It only tells you that colding proceeded by induction. So, by induction, you are picking points, which are going to be centers, and you will be picking or you will be proving Chromofhausdorf closeness, but not to Euclidean Rn, but to an Euclidean factor times another factor. Times another factor. Okay? And you are doing this by induction. And in order to continue the induction or to make sure that this induction can be done, what was very important was the remark that I told you before. So the remark that tells you that you can cover a ball by at least this number of balls of radius one-half. Radius one half. Okay, so this is telling you: okay, you can continue splitting lines. And more precisely, what Colding did was using what now we call delta splitting maps. So this is the slide in which I just say that Colding uses splitting, delta splitting maps. Inductively to create a Chromov-Hausdorff approximation. And in the non-smooth case, we didn't use these delta splitting maps, we used Mondino-Neighbor's almost splitting theorem. Okay, so let me continue. And once that you have this condition, You have this condition that your balls in M bar are closed. So let me write balls in M bar are closed to balls in Rn. Then what one can prove is that when one takes a sequence of this type of manifolds, so of this type of quotients, the following is. The following is going to happen. Okay, so maybe let's read the proposition. We start with a sequence of manifolds that satisfy these three conditions, and we are taking the Ricci curvature to zero. Then we take these questions, and here, okay, we take these questions, and then we are going to do the following. We are going to take a further quotient. Further quotient. So to take this further quotient, take mi and quotient it out by gamma i3. And remember that these are actually isomorphic to set to the big one M. And these three only has to do with this annulus thing, like to which annulus all the elements transport the fixed, all the non-trivial elements transport. Non-trivial elements transport this fixed point. Okay. So now that we have created this new sequence of Riemannian manifolds that will satisfy the same British condition, we can prove that any Grammar-Hausdorff limit of these quotients is an n-dimensional flat torus. And what does one use here? Well, basically, one uses. Well, basically, one uses equivariant pointed convergence theory. Equivariant pointed GH convergence theory. So basically, I mean, what one has is that because of this result and because the curvatures are going to zero. Carbatures are going to zero, we have that the mi's are converging in Gromovhauser sense to Rn. Here, this is the dimension. And then, sorry, here I have to put the bars. So then m i bar with the fixed point xi and with this gamma i three converges in Converges in pointed equivariant chromo-Hauser sense to Rn zero. And here we can put C big one. Well, actually CN. Okay. And in order to get, I mean, because these are abelian groups, then in the limit, we will get an abelian. We will get an abelian group. But then we need to make sure that this abelian group is actually set to the end. So to make sure that that is true, one has to use this condition of the elements that are moving your fixed element and don't collapse. Okay. Okay, so now what we got, okay, and once that we have this equivalent combination. Once that we have this equivariant convergence, we actually know that a further subsequence, and that's why here we have any GH limit, it's going to be a flat torus. It's going to be Rn mod Z N. Okay, so this implies that for a further subsequence, we have this. Okay, good. Okay, good. But this is just a sequence Mi'. And here we are just concluding that the limit is a torus. And we want to find this epsilon that tells us that we are by holder to a torus. And this is a theorem proven by Chigar and Colding that Bruet mentioned in his talk. So So, well, he mentioned it in a different version, but we are going to use this version. So, the version is as follows: if you fix a closed manifold, then there will be an epsilon that depends on this manifold, but such that if you have another manifold that satisfies a rich lower bound and it's chromo-hauser close to your original manifold, and closeness is measured by this number. By this number, then both manifolds have to be by Holder. Okay, so then with this result, one can conclude that actually the MI primes for I sufficiently large is by holder to an n-dimensional flat torus. And then, I mean, one would like to say that NEMI is by holder to an n-dimensional flat torus, and for that. And for that last part, one has to use some topological arguments to say that one doesn't have any torsion in the fundamental in the groups. Okay, and let us finish this talk by saying some remarks about the proofs in the non-smooth setting. So, here I just rewrote the first theorem. So, this is Theorem. So, this is the generalization of Gromov and Galot's theorem, in which one finds an epsilon such that any RCT space that satisfies this scaling invariant condition has to have a revised first-betty number bounded by floor of n. And the proof, it's actually very similar to the smooth case. One has to generalize. One has to generalize Gromov's lemma, but Gromov's lemma only needs that we have a good action. So the good action of our fundamental group now is replaced by the good action of the group of deck transformations. And then we only have to make sure that these quotient spaces are also RCD star. Are also RCD star k and spaces. And that's basically the only thing that one needs to reprove Gromov's lemma in this case. And now let me talk about the torus stability. So here I rewrote it again. And well, we have to prove, we have to do several steps in order to reach the conclusion that we have at the end an n-dimensional. Have at the end an n-dimensional flat torus. And I'm just going to drop some names here. But if you are interested in knowing the details, please tell me. Okay, yeah, before dropping names, we have some similar statement as Colding has, in which he has to prove that spaces that satisfy That satisfy conditions like this. So they are almost non-negative. Multiply, well, the curvature bound times the diameter square is almost non-negative. And the first Betty number equals fluorophn. One also can prove, as in colding, as a starting point for the overall proof, that balls in this type of spaces are going to be close to balls. Be close to balls in Euclidean space. Balls of a very large radius and Chromo-Fausdorff closeness measured by this epsilon that we have here. Okay, so this is our first step. And just remember that in our case, we didn't use delta splitting maps, but we used Montino's neighbors almost splitting. Neighbors almost splitting splitting theorem so instead of like creating more harmonic functions, we are just splitting more more lines. Okay, and now I'm just Okay, and now I'm just going to conclude this talk by, as I told you, dropping some names to prove that one has essential dimension equal to fluorof n in that the space is floor of n rectifiable as a metric measure space. One has to use a monondinot neighbor result in Bruce a Mola result about the that that one can That one can define essential dimension. And in order to prove that if one has a bound, a dimension bound that is an integer, one has to use on that result to conclude that the measure is a multiple of the Hausdorff measure of the right dimension. And then if one wants to If one wants to prove that these further quotients are Chromov-Hauser to a flat torus, so this is what we were doing with equivariant-pointed Chromov-Hauser convergence. And we have to use a Chromov's lemma in the same way that now we know works in the RCD setting. And then for the last part, well, one that one knows that our measures are knows that our measures are actually housedoor housedoor measures one can use a philippistigly result that tells you then that tell us then that actually this uh convergence is meshu-chromo-hausdorff convergence or closeness and then use a mondino-kapovich result which is the replacement of a chigger coding result to show that actually this To show that actually this quotient is by Holder to an n-dimensional flat or I forgot to add it, but then same topological reasons show that actually XDM is by holder or homeomorphic to the torus, to a flat torus. To a flat torus. Well, um, to a flat torus, sorry. Okay. So this is the end of my talk. Thank you very much. And are there any questions or remarks? Questions, remarks, suggestions? So suggestions I mean if not I present you Monteneus Neighbor almost splitting map that one uses to keep splitting factors until we reach our floor of n. R flow floor of n r to the floor of n an induction argument happens here to continue splitting factors and so basically one has to prove that the factor that is non-Euclidean has big diameter so then one almost split another factor and this is the replacement of a jigger encoding result that tells us that one has Poss that one has a byholder well that one ha is byholder to Adorus. It was a really nice talk. Thank you. I wanted to ask you: in the case when this RCD space is known to be semi-locally simply connected, for example, if it's on Richie Linux space, is the proof any easier or it just Is the proof any easier, or is it just equally complicated? I mean, I guess if you assume that the dimension is the house of dimension, then it should be the same. Well, yeah, like it should be. Yeah, but then if the dimension The dimension bound is any number, then I don't know if it helps to have semi-localism. That's really nice. Thank you. I have a question, kind of more related to a question that was posed about whether it's known that the first betty number is related to the rank of the first homology. Number is related to the rank of the first homology. So, what about for Alexandrov spaces? I mean, would it be even known there that the revised fundamental groups, first Betsy number, is equal to the rank of the first homology? Have you thought about that? Actually, I haven't thought about that, but I know that one can define, I mean, those spaces, they are actually relatively good. Relatively good. So, I think from the beginning of my presentation, you at least have the first homomorphism. Oh, sorry. Yeah, maybe an expert on Alexandrov spaces can say something. Yes, of course. But in Alexandrov case, it's all true. I mean, the Alexander. True. I mean, they are similarly connected, they're even locally contractible. So, yeah, the fundamental group makes sense, the relation with schoolology makes sense. And the result that you mentioned, right? They are sort of known. Okay, great. Thanks. Yeah, so I guess it's shown by this locally contractability or even Lipschitz locally contractability, and then you see. You don't really need Lipschitz, but don't really need lipsticks but uh yeah just the fact that local contractibility implies that the space has a nice universal cover and all the covering theory applies and you have standard relation between homology and fundamental okay thanks for that and maybe a question of like something that could be extensions of this so what about for example for infra npotent uh i guess spaces or groups of Spaces or groups of polynomial growth because I know that already Mondino and Wei have like the analog for Gromov's polynomial growth theorem in their paper. So do you think that you could get something similar like that, like a say a stability result for something that's very near to a nilpotent manifold or an infinite nilpotent manifold? Actually, I haven't thought about this. I mean, when I started working with Ilaya, we were actually With Ilaya, we were actually thinking about cato manifolds, and then we saw it would be difficult. So, then we started this project about RCD spaces with Andrea. And for Kato manifolds, we also tried these questions that they were asking, and that was hard there. But now, Ilaria has some results for Katomanifolds, and probably now for Katomanifolds. Probably now for catomanifolds, maybe it's easier, and also for the yeah, I haven't thought about this. Thanks again. More questions. Well, if not, let's thank Raquel again for this nice talk.
