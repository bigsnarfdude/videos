Thank you very much for the introduction and also to all the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak here. I hope next time I'll make it in person. So indeed, I'm going to talk about uniformity in certain cases of the dynamic Albogomolov conjecture, and I just add it with a relative perspective. With a relative perspective. Okay? This is all joint work in progress with Harry Smith from the University of Basel. So first, a brief outline. So our motivation came from recent breakthroughs in the context of the classical Mani-Mamford and Bogomolov conceptions and their uniformity. And their uniformity. So I'll start by describing this and then present an instance of Zhang's dynamical Bogomolov conjecture in the setting of split maps. And once I set up all this background and notation, I will be able to describe our results. Or our main result can actually be seen. Can actually be seen as an instance of a relative dynamical Bogomolov. And as a consequence, we will infer uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov across what we will see as one parameter families of polynomial split maps and curves. Then, finally, depending on the time, I'll talk a bit about Talk a bit about the proof and mostly two further results we need to establish to that end. One concerning that I'll call a height inequality and another that I'll call roughly functional transcendence. Okay. K will be a number. K will be a number field if it ever appears again. Now, the classical Manny-Manford conjecture established by Reynaud at 83 said the following. Say we have a curve inside this Jacobian. Then it will contain at most finitely many torsion points unless it is a group. It is a group, so unless it has genus less than two. Some years later, Ulmo strengthened Reynolds' result and proved what is now what was known as the Bogomolov conjecture, which asserts that not only does such a curve contain only Contain only finitely many torsion points. But further, all except at most m of the points in the curve, so m is now some number that depends on the curve, stay a uniform or an epsilon distance away from the torsion points. Okay. And here we saw in the last talk the distance that I'm talking about is That I'm talking about is counted via a neuron tate height in the Jacobian, which has a key property that it vanishes precisely when the point is torso. So one can infer the Manning-Manport conception from the Bogomoli, but not the reverse. Now, recently, Now, recently, in a series of works, we obtained some uniformity in these constants epsilon and m from before, which recall initially dependent on the curve. Habager, Dimitrov, and Gao, following previous work, building on previous work of Habaker and of Gao, and of Habeger and Gao, proved that Proved that as long as the curve is arithmetically complicated enough, like it has height, at least some constants depending on its genus, we can choose these constants epsilon and m to only depend on the genus of the curve and none of the other data. And actually, shortly after they proved this result, They proved this result. They also observed that one can remove this assumption on the height of the curve altogether if one assumes a very far generalization of Bogomolov conjectures in families of abelian varieties, which they doubt as the relative Bogomolov conjecture. But shortly after, Kuhn managed to remove this Manage to remove this assumption on the height of the curve without actually establishing this relative Bogomolov context. So these are kind of our philosophical inspiration for our results. But I should say that before this, already David and Philippon in 2007 had obtained analogous results for curves with special dacobions that are a power of an elliptic curve. Of an elliptic curve, and also around the same time as Habeger, the McClough, and Cow, the Malco, Krieger, and He established an analogous result for certain curves of genus II, which are in living in the product of two different lesion relative curves. And of course, there are many past results to this end, but this will suffice for now. Now, and in what follows, I will actually focus in settings such as these last two results, which I'll call split. So, our goal is to understand these conjectures dynamically, as Zank did, and inspired by an analogy between three periodic and torsion points. And torsion points formulated a dynamical generalization of the classical book of Mollov conjectures. And this analogy should be familiar to most of you, so we'll go fast here. But the torsion points of an elliptic curve, for example, right, are certainly pre-periodic for the duplication map on the set elliptic curve. And for me, it's also useful to It's also useful to think of them as preperiodic points for a latajma that is given if one identifies a point in the elliptic curve with its inverse and projects it down to its x-coordinate so that the duplication descends to a rational function on p1 okay and And the torsion points of an energy curve were the zeros of the neuron take height, but can also be thought of as the zeros of a Cole-Silverman canonical height. Here to each rational function defined over a field with product formula. Here I take a number field and of degree that we will fix to. Of degree that we will fix to be d, at least two, we can associate a canonical height function, okay, which is given via something similar to the neuron tape height, an iteration procedure, by evaluating the whale height of the nth iterate of a point, dividing that by the degree of the nth iterate. Degree of the entity rate and taking the limit as encouraged infinity. Okay, so importantly for us, this will be always a non-negative real number, and it will be zero precisely when the point is pre-periodic for the map. So it has finite orbital interiterates. Okay. So as I said, we focus So, as I said, we'll focus on a split setting. And here I have reformulated the classical Bogomolov conjecture for curves in the product of two elliptic curves, which I now want to think of dynamically. The first thing one might do is to replace the two To replace the two elliptic curves just by two rational functions, say, corresponding to a Latt√®re map in each elliptic curve. Then the condition in the classical setting was that the curve didn't respect the group structure, was not a group itself, right? And here, my condition can analogously be that the curve that I fix in. curve that I fix in P1 plus P1 is not respecting iteration via the action of the split map given by F and Z. So it's not pre-periodic. This split map, to be concrete, acts in a split fashion on its coordinate of P1. So it maps the point x, y to f of x, z of y. Z of y so that the variables don't mix by any of the functions. Okay, and in the conclusion, I just copy the statement that there exists some epsilon and m and replace the neuron tate height, which is here the sum of the two neuron take heights, or we can choose it to be, by the sum of the cost. The sum of the Kohl-Snilvermann canonical heights of the two points. So if this statement were true, it would also imply that the curve contains at most finitely many points, P and Q, for which the X coordinate is The X coordinate is preperiodic under iteration by F, and the Y is preperiodic under iteration by G. Okay, but I have three question marks and many of you are already alarmed. Something is wrong with this statement as is, right? I could first try to take the first map to be just a square map and the second map. And the second map to be the cube map. So now the canonical height is for both of these maps just the veil height, which vanishes precisely at the roots of unity. And I can look at the diagonal, which contains infinitely many roots of unity, or points with both coordinate roots of unity. Or points with both coordinates roots of unity, right? So the set here in the conclusion is infinite, but the diagonal is not pre-periodic under iteration by this map. So I have to do something to fix this problem. And for this, I will assume that the two maps have the same degree. Okay, so now this example can. Okay, so now this sample cannot happen anymore. And indeed, in Zhang's conjecture, which was again in a more general setting, this assumption was present. He was working with polarizable endomorphisms, and it would amount to this condition here. Okay, but I have added an extra word over here, and there should be a reason, right? This is more sadly. This is more sadly, but Joker Takir and Zank actually found a counterexample to Zank's original dynamical Bogomolov conjecture, Enman and Manford, which actually came from elliptic curves with complex multiplication. And so my non-exceptional assumption here is to also exclude this example from my consideration. Example from my consideration. Exceptional maps will be maps that relate to something with a group structure, either an abelian variety or a multiplicative group. So more precisely, they will be conjugated monomials or series of polynomials or La Desmas. And in this form, this dynamic. In this form, this dynamical Bogomol of four split maps has been established recently by Joka, Nguyen, and he, who in fact also established a generalization for higher dimensions of variety and for endomorphisms of a higher power of P1. And in fact, they didn't necessarily have this condition, except the conclusion would change. So I added it here. So I added it here for simplicity. Okay. Now, our goal, as I was saying in the beginning, or at least one of the goals, is to prove a dynamical uniformity in this result across one parameter families. Families. Okay. So going back, I want to allow my curves to vary in a one-parameter family and my maps to vary in a one-parameter family. And I want the epsilon and the m to not depend on the parameter t but only on generic geometric input. And just to have it in mind. And just to have it in mind, this will follow from a different sort of Bogomolov type statement called a relative dynamical Bogomolov for one parameter families of speak notes. But to make both of these results precise and maybe some more results that will come, I will just now introduce some notation that we will stick with. And it will be in a more higher generality because one of the results works in higher generality. So to do this, I'll fix B to be a smooth projective curve, okay, defined over some number field. And the bulk letters will always refer to geometric objects defined over the function. Over the function field of the curve, okay, which will be the bolt k. So I'll also fix L for some number, one or two or three, four or so on functions defined over the function field of the curve. Okay, for example, I can take f1 to be z cubed plus t and f2. plus t and f two to be z cube plus dz plus one and see them as single polynomials defined over k okay and i will assume all fair that these functions are not isotrivial i really want them to be able to define families so isotrivial here or non-isotrivial would mean not conjugate Not conjugate to functions that are defined over the field of constants, so q bar z here conjugate over k bar. Okay, and I will also assume them to be non-exceptional, which now, since they are not trivial, amounts to not being plates marks. And I take them all to have a fixed degree D in Z, functions of Z. Okay, so this has degree 3. Okay, if I take all these maps together and tact with me them coordinate-wise in P1 to the L, I get an endomorphism of P1 to the L. And they can now spread this out over the base, right, to get an endomorphism of a cosproted variety, which is like a punctured version of the base curve cross a power of P1, okay, which acts fixing the parameter and the base. Fixing the parameter and the base and acting coordinate-wise by the specialization of the corresponding map above that parameter on the base where the point belongs. So in this example, Z cube plus T would map to Z1 cube plus T, some others. And this finite set that FXQ did is Finite set that I've excluded is just to ensure that the degree of these specializations will all remain D. So there'll be no indeterminacy set away from this quasi-protective variety. And if that's true, then I can also consider a cyberwise cold silverman canonical height. Which acts on its point in my cost-projective variety by taking the coarser canonical height of the projective point with respect to the specialization of the map above the corresponding parameter. Yes. What did you say about indeterminacy for this family? There's none? I'm excluding it. I'm trying it all away. I'm assuming, yeah, that all the degrees of FIT is D for all T in B naught. In particular, T equals zero. Yeah, okay. Yeah. B naught is not B0, right? Sorry. The notation may be bad. Right, sorry, the notation may be bad. Right. Yes. In particular, it equals the in this example, z plus t, we would have to throw away t equals infinity. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. If there are any questions, yeah, feel free to interrupt. Okay. And identifying this. I'm trying to understand why you're excluding the isotrivial case. Anyway, no, yeah, you can ask later again. Thank you. Yes, I'll explain. I may not need to for now. It's in progress. Yes. Okay. And this cursive mechanical height will be given as a student to be the sum of the cursive mechanical height of its component, as we defined it earlier. Okay. And I will keep these assumptions fixed. We keep these assumptions fixed in everything that follows. And the notation. So now I can state the first theorem. Okay. Okay, not yet. I also pick as a variety of P1L defined over K, which I can spread out to view as a variety of my quasi-projective space. My quasi-projective space. And for each T in the base, X sub T will be the specialization of this variety above T or the fiber of it above T. Now I can state this here. I fix an endomorphism of the second power of P1, which is given by two polynomials generic. Generically over the function period. And I also fix a curve over the function period that is not generically pre-periodic under iteration by phi. Then, along the specializations of these geometric objects, the set A set that was earlier bounded in cardinality is now uniformly bounded in cardinality with a constant here the two constants epsilon and m only depend on the geometric data and in particular are independent of t. And the yeah, I think that's the And yeah, this cannot be true for every T, even after throwing out these finitely many bad parameters. I have a finite exceptional set that needs to be there and can be described. It should, of course, contain all the parameters T for which the curve specializes to a pre-periodic curve for the corresponding map. Okay, because for these parameters, the set will be infinite. But this should be proved to prove the theorem or follows from the theory. Okay. And to do some talk about some examples, I just need maybe a very I just need maybe a better way to understand the pre-periodic curves because a priori, well, how can I write them down? What does it mean? But since my map is given by polynomials, we can understand how to write down equations of such preperiodic curves through a theorem of Mehmedeffens Carlon. I will not go here in detail and read this. The idea is that The idea is that if a curve is preperiodic under the action of f and z, coordinate wise, or here just invariant, so the iterate is contained in itself. Then essentially, up to some mass, f will look like z and we can write the curve down, looking like the one coordinate is f of the other. F of the other, or the second iterative f of the other, or more generally, any f theta that commutes with f. And having this, I can write down an example, right? I can take my curve, the generic curve, to be given by the diagonal. So in each fiber, I have the same curve being the diagonal. And I can take my map given by these two non-code codes. Given by these two non-conjugate cubic polynomials. Then our theorem implies that these two cubic polynomials for each T have a uniform number of common pre-periodic points. I said for its T, it's for its T in Q bar, but then it's not so hard to get that it holds for its T in. That it holds for its T in C as well. And Joan may want to compare this with a recent theorem of DeMarco Trigerengi, who worked precisely with the quadratic polynomial Z squared plus T and precisely with the diagonal, but in a two-parameter fashion. Here they proved. Here they proved that two different quadratic polynomials like this have at most a uniform number of common preperiodic numbers, good points. Our approach is pretty different from theirs, though, and as I said, relies on a relative. On a relative statement, which we have to establish, and this is what is present here. Now, my assumptions are again exactly as in the previous theorem. So, the map is given by two polynomials, and I fix a curve that's not pre-periodic generically. The conclusion is different. I'm not now looking at each fiber individually. Individually, but I'm looking at the entire variety involving the base as well, as a relative Bogomolov nature of this statement. Okay, the conclusion looks similar and it now asserts that the point in the threefold given by the fiber power of my surface. Of my surface, which is here telegraphic X over the base, that have fighter-wise called Silverman canonical height small in each coordinate are few. Here, this means they're not the risky dense in the entire pre-fold. Okay. This may be more hard to process, but it really fits into philosophy, the known philosophy of unlikely intersections that many here are familiar with, that was made more precise in works of Bombieri, Masser, and Zanier and of Tilke and Zilber independently. Okay, but to processes. Let's pretend that. Let's pretend that epsilon is zero, okay? So this would be a relative Manning Manford. So I'm looking at the points in a threefold, okay, this has dimension three that have fiberwise perceive heights equal to zero. Okay, each condition here on the height gives me two relations. Which are given by in the form of the first coordinate being F sub T preperiodic, the second being G sub T preperiodic. And so these relations are not only four, but are also kind of special in that they relate to my family of dynamical systems. They respect iteration in some sense. Okay, so I'm interested in. Okay, so I'm intersecting a threefold now with a varying union of sub-varieties of codimension at least four that have this special property. And one would predict that this intersection should be small, right? Dimensional reasons would suggest this, unless there is some reason that it should be bigger. Here, this amount to X being pre-periodic, the net. Being pre-periodic generically. Lower dimensional instances of such a relative Bogomolov type statement were known earlier or were explored earlier, starting in this dynamical setting by a theorem of DeMarco and Baker and DeMarco, which was inspired by a theorem. Which was inspired by a theorem of Masser and Zamier in the classical set, right? Which now takes the case, considers the case that x, my curve earlier, is just a point. Okay, so now my curve is just a point. I have just to unmap and essentially I'm asking for this point to satisfy two relations. So for both So for both alpha and beta to be preperiodic for z squared plus c or more generally to stay away from this preperiodic locus with an epsilon. One should expect again that this would happen at most finitely many times unless Finally, many times, unless the point, there's a special reason for it not to happen, which here amounts to alpha being plus or minus beta, which would also mean that Z squared plus alpha sorry, alpha squared plus T is beta squared plus T. So it stays there in an invariant sub-variety. Okay. Okay. Now, getting from this relative statement to the uniform statement that I alluded to earlier is not hard. So I can fit it in almost a slide module of the details. And let's see how this works. Right, I have for each T. for each t sigma t to be the set whose cardinality we want to bound uniformly from above. And the conclusion of the relative Bogomolov theorem is that this calligraphic M, which is the Zariski closure of the set in the theorem, is not Zariski dense. So has Not Zeliski dense, so has dimension at most true. And taking some cases, the hardest example here is when M is actually dimension two and it's actually a flat surface, so it's dominant above the base. And by definition, for each T, the second Cartesian power of sigma t will be within the fiber of this m above t. Of this m above t, which is also within a surface given by the second power of my curve. And to one of the projection maps of the specializations of M to the one coordinate of the curve, one coordinate curve will be dominant and it should have it's a map of curves and it will have a finite. A map of curves and it will have a finite degree, which would be controlled only by the geometric data or by the entire M but not by the fiber. So in particular, for this point in sigma t, I have finitely many or at most the pre-images, and I can cover the entire product by By these fibers to conclude this inequality here. Okay, which, as long as we know that sigma t has finite cardinality, implies a statement we want. And we already know that it has finite cardinality, assuming we exclude that finite exceptional set. Okay, and so this brings me to the third part of the talk, which is what we actually need to do to prove the result. Okay, and I said earlier that we need to establish two main new theorems, which I will call height inequality and functionality. Height inequality and functional transcendent. Okay, and we'll start here by talking about this height inequality. And in this theory, I forget about my assumption that phi is in p1 squared given by polynomials. It can be in any power of p1 and given by any kind of functions. And also I forget that x is a curve. It's arbitrary dimensional, some variety, generally. Genetically. But I still have to assume that it's not preperiodic. Then, this theory, under this assumption, allows you to compare the fiber-wise cold-silverman canonical height with a height on the base. Okay, so here P is uh the structural projection of the surface to the base. Projection of the surface to the base. And H is a choice of real height in the base. The constants will depend on this choice, but that works for now. And this kind of height inequality comparison is valid for most points in my variety or for all outside a Zadiski closed set, which I can describe explicitly. Okay, I want to exclude points that be. I want to exclude points that belong in flats of varieties that are not that are pre-periodic. Okay, this result, actually, I don't need the non-exceptional assumption anymore because in the exceptional Latt√®se case, it was already established in this form by Habaker. This form by Habaker in fiber powers of elliptic curves in 2016. And another case of feed was actually known, namely the case where phi is just given by one map and the variety is just a point. Point. Then the conclusion follows combining two results: one by Collis and Silverman, and another established by Benedetto and Baker for polynomials and rational maps, respectively. So Colin Silverman proved that That this for a point now, this Kausilierman canonical height would be at least some generic height. So this is a geometric height minus some small amount times the height of the base minus some other amount. Okay, but then Benedetta. Benedetto and Baker has proved that this height is zero if and only if the point is pre-periodic. And here I use that phi is non-isotrivial. Okay, so our theory has to generalize both of these results. Both of these results to higher dimensions. And I should mention here that also recently and independently, Juan and Zhang did generalize this first part to a very general setting. Okay. Okay. This inequality actually allows you to conclude kind of an analog of the original result by Dimitrov, Gau and Habiger. Namely, if I have a pre-periodic point in X, then this height will be zero, right? And so the very height of the point will be bounded. Point will be bounded. So I get some uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov in any dimension and one parameter families as long as the parameter on the base has height that is large enough. It in fact also has other consequences in uniformity in the relative Bogomolov, but I will skip this slide to focus on the second main ingredient. Because the height inequality works in general, right, for any rational functions and for any third measures of variety. Ferdinands of variety. And so there must be a reason why we restrict to curves and polynomials for the uniformity theorem. And the reason is that we can then establish this second theorem, which I call functional transcendence. Okay. Roughly, to each rational function, now defined over C, because this will be a completely Because this will be a completely complex result. I can associate a canonical measure. This measure is invariant, meaning two things. The push forward of itself stays invariant and the pullback defined in the sense of currents multiplies it with the degree. Or one can think of feed as the limit measure. As the limit measure of iterated pre-images of points of some sort via an equidistribution theorem of Berlin, Jubritz and Frederick Lopez-Magnet. Okay, so our theorem here then says that one can track whether the curve is pre-periodic. The curve is preperiodic by just looking at the two measures induced on the curve by these two coordinate functions f and z. Should pause here for a second. These kind of statements are present often when one tries to prove any kind of Bogomolo formulation. Any kind of bugamolo for Manning Mamford. And in fact, Joker and Gwen and he also established a related theorem, even for rational maps, but under additional assumptions on the maps. Now, for them, for the point wise men in Manford, they were allowed to impose these additional restrictions. Impose these additional restrictions. They actually had a very nice argument. But the reason is that they had extra rigidity. They kind of knew that one point in the curve will be preperiodic for F, if and only if the other will be pre-periodic for Z. Something that we don't have. So we really need to rely on this full statement and respect to polynomials sense. Okay. Are you going to tell us how you take advantage of the Um, how you take advantage of the fact that they're polynomials to prove, yeah. I mean, in a few words, yes, uh, they then have a bottle coordinate which plays a role of the uniformization and the elliptic curves. I see, I see, see, yeah, it's a more concrete way to look at this measure. Yeah, yes, yes, and to write down equations, yeah. And the bottom cordon we understand much better, and eventually it boils down to results of Levi. Eventually, it boils down to the results of Levine saying, like, yeah. So there's people that I haven't mentioned. And I hope in the questions, maybe they'll come up. But still, right, we need to find out a way to put these two results together, right? And this involves a recent equidistribution theory established by Joan and Zank. Huan and Zhang following Kuhn's analogous theory for families of abelian varieties and also by Gauthier. Kuhn also proved such a distribution theorem first so that he could prove the uniform Bogomolov conjecture. Except he could also use the geometry of the abelian variety. So it was maybe better for him to apply this theory. For us, we don't have the geometry, but instead we have the split structure of the maps. The families of maps are split. And we rely on it to use the contribution and the previous theorems and prove the relative Bogomolov. And the idea in Kune and Zang and all of these aforementioned works that actually follows by Ulmo's original idea in the Bogomolo was to kind of use a co-distribution twice. Okay, and so here I have the scales of the proof in the case of the diagonal, so that the exposition is possible. Okay, so what we want to prove. So, what we want to prove is that there is no sequence in this fiber product of the diagonal surface with itself that is generic in the sense that every infinite subsequence is a risky dense in the threefold and is small in the sense that the canonical height the fiberwise canonical height of the sequence tends to zero. Height of the sequence tends to zero. Now, from this one sequence, we can get two of them. Or here, these two are just really one, except they are small. For now, two maps. In the first map, I act on the first coordinate by F one and in the second by F two. And in the second by F2. Okay. Now the height inequality, or the theorem we have on the height inequality, tells us that we can actually apply this recent equidistribution theories. And we infer the two measures defined by Juan and Zhang and Gauthier are actually the same. The same and subsequently, we need to understand how to get a contradiction from this statement. To this end, we want to apply this equality to a specific, it has to be a compactly supported continuous function that only depends on the parameter in the base and the first P1. And the first P1, okay, because now I have four P1s, or like three here, sorry. Okay, and we find this function, we construct it through this theorem that I called functional transcendence. And And to do this, we actually have to understand these measures fiber wise. This is kind of the proof and yeah, I hope it clarifies things, but I see I'm out of time, so thank you. And yeah, any questions, of course, are welcome. Thank you all.
