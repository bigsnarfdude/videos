And also my apologies to the organisers for not giving them a title until yesterday, upon which Astrid, when she found out I was obviously going to talk about classification stuff, asked if we could play classification bingo. And the moral of the story is don't give me a bad idea because I do have an idea. So yeah, rules, I have to say the words out loud. Okay, not just write them out. Okay, so as my title suggests, I would like to. Title suggests: I would like to look at classifiable C-star algebras that come from dynamical systems. So, what do I mean by classifiable C-star algebra? I mean ones which fit into this classification theorem. So, this theorem says that if we have two simple, separable, unital nuclear Z-stable C-star algebras that satisfy the UCT, then we can classify them up to star homomorphism by something called the Elliott invariant. What is this? It consists of K-therian traits. It consists of K theory and tracial data. So we have our ordered K0 group, K1, the traitial state space, and then a map which pairs the traitial state with states of K0. And in fact, by now, this order structure data is a bit redundant. We really only need to either include the pairing map or the order structure, because we know by now that they actually give us the same information. So there are probably some words that are not necessarily familiar. Probably some words that are not necessarily familiar to people, especially those who don't come from C-star algebra. The first one being nuclear. So, nuclear here means that we have good approximations through matrix algebras. And this can maybe be compared to what we saw in Sven's talk talking about hyper-finite things. This is somehow like a C-star analog of that. I'm not going to give you the precise definition because I only have 20 minutes, but this is sort of the reason we have that there. Reason we have that there. They're not so far from being finite-dimensional in any suitable sense. Now, Z stability, that is something a little bit more tricky. So the Z here stands for Jang Su algebra. And this is a simple separable. Unital, nuclear, infinite-dimensional C-star algebra with the same Elliott invariant as the complex numbers. So, if one expects So if one expects a classification of this sort, then because this invariant works pretty well with tensor products, you expect that whenever you tensor something with Z, it's like tensoring something with C from the point of view of the invariant. So you just get back that guy. And we say that A is Z stable if indeed there is such an isomorphism. And the point being that, okay, so we know that everything has to be Z-stable if we're going to classify it here, but there are non-Z-stable, simple, separable, neonutral nuclear C-star algebra, so we really can't afford to toss this away and still have a theorem. So it's also true that Z itself, Z-stable, it has something called a strongly self-absorbing property, and it should be compared to what we heard in. Compared to what we heard in Sven's talk, the hyperfinite two-wind factor. So it's kind of like a C-star analog of this hyperfinite two-wind factor. Okay, so, oh, right, and this UCT, this is something that one uses deep in these classification theorems to relate KK. Classification theorems to relate K-theory and K-theory. I don't want to say much about it because I don't really know much about it, but the important part is that it is known to be satisfied for any nuclear system we can find, but it's not known if nuclear complies the UCT. So it's possible that this is superfluous, but we're not sure. That's an open problem. But in particular, whenever you have a Cartan subalgebra, you satisfy the UCT. So for everyone in this conference, we're probably very happy. Everyone in this conference, we're probably very happy to just ignore these finer details. Okay, so as Sven told us in his talk, some of these ideas come from Bun-Meuman algebras. And there they have a very nice classification, which we were told about yesterday of factors, into these types. And we do see something similar happening here. In particular, we do get classification. We do get classification, a classification dichotomy into things that are stably finite and things that are purely infinite. So I'm going to say that A is classifiable if it satisfies these adjectives. Separable simple nuclear position stable and CT. Zable and T. And then I'm going to say that curly C is the class of these guys. The class of classifiable guys. Yep. For the puppets of theta, you can tell some truth with theorem. I guess one would say there's a large number of people that have done this, so it's built up bit by bit by bit. How many times did you say? How many Hans did you say? I don't think anyone named Hans was involved, actually. Okay, so we have this nice dichotomy where this splits into, as I said, so C splits into purely infinite analogs of So these are analogues of the chemistry factors and stably finite. And this happens precisely depending on traces. So if you have a tracial state, your state is finite, otherwise you're purely infinite. Okay. Right. So What is in C? What is in this class? So we do know the range of the Elliott invariant of C. This is due originally to George Elliott, who showed that there are always ASH algebras with slow dimension growth. ASH, slow dimension growth, I guess even no dimension growth in this case. Models realizing Realizing every element, fair intimacy. And this was later sort of used by Shin to construct groupoid models. So he mimicked these inductive limits in the groupoid setting. Saying. And the nice thing here is that this shows that they all have Cartensal algebras. Okay, but I am sort of interested in what sort of more naturally occurring things. Naturally occurring things might fit into C. So, what do I mean by naturally occurring? I mean, we saw in Sven's talk that the hyperfinite 2,1 case, these you can realize as cross products, L infinity x cross z coming from erbotic probability measure preserving transformation. And the analog in the C star case is, of course, cross products by Z, which come from dynamical systems. So let me write that a bit more precisely. So the C star analog is, we take X, Phi, X is a callback metric space. And phi is a minimal homeomorphism. This means that if you have a non-empty closed subset that's invariant under phi, then it has to be everything. And we can form the cross product, which we can think of as being the Zer algebra where we The Zeaster algebra, where we throw in every continuous function, as well as an extra unitary, which implements this action, so it satisfies. Now, these are always going to be stably finite because they have tracial states coming from the invariant measures on the space. They're simple because phi is minimal, they're separable, they're unital. They're separable, they're unital. So one might ask: do we get some sort of analog of this? Well, here there's only one guy we have to try to get, and that's the hyperfinite to one factor. Here, we have to try to reach a whole range of invariants corresponding to stably finite guys. So this is already much more difficult. Okay, but maybe there's some hope. But actually, we lose. But actually, we lose that hope very immediately because these are not even necessarily Z stable. So that's the first problem. But the good thing is they are in nice cases. So I'll just say maybe usually are, though that's definitely not meant with any precision. With many precision. So, for example, whenever the dimension of x is finite, when there are countably many, or at most, let's say, ergodic measures or if the entropy is finite. The entropy is finite. So you have to really think outside the box to somehow come up with something that's not going to be that stable. Okay, so the next problem is that there are k-theoretic instructions. Fuster, okay. I can't really know what's going on. You're avoiding certain words. Yeah, so we have a nice way of computing K-theory for these guys, which kind of makes them nicer than just your average group boy. We have the Pentagon-Boykolescu exact sequence, which Which tells us that the K-theory of these guys depends on spaces and the introduced pathos on them. So this is one minus 1 minus, or sorry, the identity, I guess, minus the math on K theory. This is just the conclusion. So we have a good chance of trying to figure out what K-theory is even possible in the first place. And indeed, we can do that. So we restrict ourselves to when the space X itself. The space X itself has finitely generated K-theory. And alpha, or 5 rather, is any homomorphism, not necessarily minimal, then there exists There exists finite helium groups, G0 and G1, and some D that's at least one, such that the K-theory of the cross product So in particular, we can never get rid of this copy of Z, which means that in K1, we can't have vanishing K-theory, which means we can't even get the Jangsdu algebra, which I claimed was our R-type character here. We can't get any AN algebra. So that's also slightly disappointing. That's also slightly disappointing, but some good news is that we can find a space admitting a minimal homeomorphism realizing any of these k-theories. So that's due to Robin and Ian and I. You're rapidly burning out of time. That's bad. Okay. Okay, so, you know, I mean, I guess I could stop now and say, well, that's that. But, you know, we're kind of greedy, so we would like more. And this is when we cry to our von Neumann friends because they had it so easy back in their day. Ford house by 30, had kids, dog. We have one year postdocs and We have one-year postdocs, and then you tried to steal the neighbor's dog. What sort of dog? Totally not asking for ping milk. Right. Look for a terrier. So yeah, for Regretian we want more. Now in a Von Neumann case, you could do things like miss little sets of measure zero, and you still are sitting nicely inside this cross product. Nicely inside this cross-product setting. If we try to do that, of course, you know, this messes up the dynamics to some extent, and we're no longer in the cross-product setting. However, we can do a very nice related construction called orbit breaking, which allows us to do something similar at the cost of leaving cross-products but staying in Guvoid-Cister algebras. So the idea here is you take So the idea here is we take some, okay, so we have x, phi as our communal dynamical system. We take some y and x, and we want it to meet every orbit at most once. And then we look at our We look at our orbit relation as a groupoid and we construct a subgroupoid where essentially what we're doing is we're going to break the orbit in half every time it meets y. Now since x is compact, forward orbits and backwards orbits are always dense, this means that this new groupoid will still have dense equivalence classes. So we're still going to get a simple C-star algebra. And I'm going to call this And I'm going to call this a y inside c of x cross z. What does it look like? It looks like, again, we have all of these continuous functions, but now instead of taking the whole unitary, we're only allowed to multiply functions which vanish on y. Yeah, so this is still simple, separable, you can still. So, this is still simple, separable, unit still nuclear. It has the same cartan, in fact. But we have many, many more possible K-theory. So, I will say what that is, if I can find it in my notes. Okay, right, so I guess that the first thing to notice is that we don't have this unitary anymore, and this was one of the things that was. And this was one of the things that was causing this k-theoretic obstruction in K1. So getting rid of this means now we can get things with K1 equals 0. For example, the Jenks 2 algebra, that was the first thing we sort of looked at constructing with Robin and Ian. You can get any AF algebras that comes out of the work on canter minimal systems by Thierry and Ian. And even more, you can get the following. So there's two. So there's two parts maybe. You take the i to be arbitrary countable groups, abelian, of course. And then we can get that k i, well k zero of this orbit breaking guy is going to be z plus zero and k one. T0 and K1, and it's going to be G1. And these will always be projection list. Now, at the other end of things, we have a real rank zero example, where now we can get same. This is going to be t plus t zero, where t is countable to Belian. Uh G0 is a dimension group and K1, this is K0, is any compatible given group. Okay, so that's much, much nicer, but of course it's not a full range result. We don't know that we have everything in the Elliott invariant this way. This is certainly, there's certainly more. Way, this is certainly, there's certainly more in there than just this, but this is as far as we could push our constructions at the time. Now, there is suggestion that maybe, so these are examples of groupoids, Easter algebras, Shin's work, maybe also Renault's work, suggests that maybe we need to add twisted groupoids to this mix. And we can actually do that in a very nice dynamical way by instead of looking at just By instead of looking at just automorphisms of C of X, we're going to look at invertible Hilbert bimodules. So you can think about C-star algebras as being objects in a category with morphisms, star homomorphisms, but you could also look at these as having morphisms, C-star correspondences. So I want to write Hilbert module with a non-degenerate homomorphism. Homomorphism. So map A to B here would be a right Hilbert B module with a non-degenerate homomorphism from A to adjoinable operators. I'm definitely running out of time, so I should just maybe give you guys the upshot. One can just as easily construct. One can just as easily construct a cross product in this setting if we have C of x here. And just like we know that our automorphism of C of x comes from a homeomorphism, we know exactly what an invertible y module looks like. It's going to be of the form gamma V alpha, where V is a y module over X. Alpha is a minimum homeomorphism. A minimal helper mortism. And this guy here is a module where, as a right-helper module, it's just the sections of B. And then the left action is given by the right action after composing with alpha. You can create a Kuhn's Pinster algebra out of this. It's quite similar to the thing I just erased. You can think of it as a C-star algebra now generated by C of X, but instead of just a unitary. X, but instead of just a unitary, you throw in an element for every guy in your module. And it will satisfy this commutation relation that's exactly this. I guess I don't write it down, but it will satisfy it precisely this. If you think about the cross product as a transformation groupoid, then you can show that these guys will actually be exactly twisted groupoids over the transformation groupoid, and every twisted groupoid should actually arise this way. These are classified under presidential. These are classified under precisely the same conditions, but of course, now we have this added vector bundle in, which potentially will give us more K-theory. So, if I can have like two more minutes, I will just write this down. We have a new exact sequence. Again, looking at C of X into now our Plus-Bunser algebra. But now instead of taking 1 minus the map alpha on K-theory, we take 1 minus the class of this module. So, okay, we don't know for sure that this is giving us more things. Don't know for sure that this is giving us more things because we haven't tried to calculate the range of both. But what we do know is that even if they give us the same things as the cross products, it does allow us to potentially find new cartens. Because there are examples of cross products of C of X by modules that can't be realized as cross products by this on the same space. Okay, so just one last. Okay, so just one last comment is that this still doesn't tell us anything about purely infinite CSER algebras. However, if we replace line bundles and allow ourselves to have higher rank bundles, so this is now just going to be a vector bundle, then if the rank is greater than one, we actually get something that's purely infinite. And we have the exact same We have the exact same six-term exact sequence here. And now we can see that even just by, say, taking a trivial rank two bundle, sticking it into this exact sequence, taking x to be, say, a sphere, running this through the machinery, we get O2. So we can get, in this framework, in this sort of generality, potentially, hopefully, all classify Caesar algebras. And nobody coming though. Sea strawberries. And nobody caught bingo. It was an Irish terrier. Bingo got bingo.
