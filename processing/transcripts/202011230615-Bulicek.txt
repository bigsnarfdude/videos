Large data analysis for Kolmogorov's tool equation model of turbulence. Okay, Mira, the time is serious. Okay, thank you, Agnishka. So just today I decided finally to talk about this Komograph model for for the liquidation of many reasons. One of them was also that my that my colleagues So is that it is exactly the case when you are speed just with one model. The part is based somehow based on these two drippers. One of them is Miroslav, I can't hear you properly. Sorry? At least I cannot hear you properly. There is some kind of echo and it's very flowy. Yes. So is it better now? Do you hear me? Yes, but now there is some white noise. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, but as I mean, there is some white noise now. But it's probably better than the other option, or you can also. Option or you can also what you can do is stay in the headphones but be a little bit closer to the microphone and without moving. So now, do you hear me now? Now, yes. Good. So I will do it in this way. I do not know what is. Don't move. Okay, I will try to do my best. I see the point. I see the point. The point was that Before I was sharing the video with some, so I should really share the video without sound. So now the sound should be okay, I guess. Am I right, Akishka? Yes, it's good now. Yeah. So the talk is based on these two papers. Both of them are with Josef Malek, and the co-author of the first one was Roger Wandovsky. And basically, what we were And basically, what we were interested in was in somehow solving this system of equations. So, what this system is described, okay, basically, you look for these four quantities. So, this is space-time cylinder sq, and basically you look for the solution of this system, and this system is usually called common growth model for turbulence. And the meaning of the letters is the following. The meaning of the letters is the following. So, if you think that this 3D V and 3D P is the solution to the standard Navier-Stov equations, then this both V is just kind of average velocity, something we already see, and this V bar is some fluctuation, and it has some kind of more or less kinetic energy. And we denote it simply by B. And there is also something called frequency, which is somehow really. thing called frequency which is somehow related to the typical typical lengths length k so this is the small l and this frequency length k and this square root of the kinetic energy are related by this formula and somehow Kormogorov proposed by some arguments based on the scaling and such things that turbulent motion could be described by these sets of equations if you look so If you look, so this is the Comograph, and he did it already in the 40s. So it is very, very long, very old model. Unfortunately, unfortunately, well, it has also certain limitations. It should be used or it can be used only in case that the turbulence is somehow fully developed. Otherwise, you are losing some information. But for fully developed turbulence, it is believed nowadays that this is quite good model. that this is this is quite good model with which could very probably to describe describe the real evolution of exactly what you see what you see in the pictures so sometimes people are not solving these two additional equations for l for omega and for for b and they simply think that this length scale is given by for some for some many reasons it is For some many reasons, that it is a given function of x. And then, if you just plug this given L into the system, then you will see that this omega is not there anymore because it is given. And then they usually reduce the system to the so-called Tk epsilon model. But this is just a reduction, you basically neglect an unknown, you really think that it is already given. But this is somehow not our goal. We really would like to keep the the home order from the very beginning. The whole model from the very beginning, and really we would like to say something about the model. So, if I start again, so this is the model I am interested in, or the set of equations, and this is in 3D setting, right? So, my domain of interest is 3D. This constant here, this kappa 1 up to kappa 4 and theta naught, they are given numbers, and even Kolmogorov. Numbers and even Kolmogorov himself proposed exactly based on some scale and arguments that there are some particular values that we should be able to cover. But for the analysis, it is somehow not important what numbers are here. Important is that they are just positive numbers in given and positive, strictly positive. This is important thing. So you can see there are some differences between available stokes and these models. And one of them, and the most essential, is that here the WIS somehow. Essential is that here the viscous, somehow kind of generalized viscosity, which is sitting here, can be in principle unbounded and also can vanish. If B explodes, so this is exploding, if B is reaches zero, so basically if there is no turbulence, this viscosity is not there. The same is for the frequency. And the measure of the length scale, so typically what you observe is exactly this quantity. What is also interesting on this system. What is also interesting on this system is the fact that the scaling for this system of equation is exactly or can be exactly the same as for the Navier-Stokes equations. So from the point of view of scaling, you can simply use the scaling for Navier-Stokes, but then you end up that this system of equations have the same scaling. What else? Just on the first look, you can. Just on the first look, you can say about the equation is some other feature. Not only it has the same scaling as Navier-Stokes, but surprisingly, there is some one parameter of scaling. So not only the scaling for Navier-Stokes, but you can really introduce this kind of more scales, right? So this makes the problem quite different to Nabier Stokes, where you have just one scaling, but So, where you have just one scaling, but here you can may have the whole family of scaling, which is really quite surprising. And maybe it can lead to some better properties to the system, which is also believed that the system should somehow be regularized. So, there should be some regularization of Navier-Stokes, and therefore, we should get a better solution in principle for this kind of system. Next thing is that. Next thing is that there are also some troublemakers, right? In aviation stocks business, the usual troublemaker is this convective guy, this convective term. So immediately here, the first troublemaker is this possible unbounded and also vanishing viscosity. But the second troublemaker is also this disgusting guy on the right-hand side, which in principle will be only in L1. And from the point of view of regulatory, if you look at it, so this is kind of, you may think. So, this is kind of, you may think, parabolic system with some critical growth on the right-hand side. So, from the point of view of regularity, this is the biggest troublemaker. This really sits on the right-hand side here. Also, I was up to now just talking about the equation inside of Ominga, but one should also prescribe some initial data and also some boundary data. It is somehow a big. It is somehow a big deal in this theory of turbulence. It is believed that the turbulence is really created somewhere on the boundary through some inflow or unflow or just by some mechanism on the boundary. And therefore, we should be able to keep this possibility. So we really don't want just to prescribe some no flux boundary data for omega and B. We should really would like to prescribe some kind of any kind of Dirich data. Kind of any kind of direct data on the boundary for this omega and for B. This is the first point. Second point, okay, this is the weak point of the analysis. We still need to consider the internal flow. So basically, there is no inflow and unfold, which is a little bit ridiculous. But for that reason, we really need to prescribe that on the boundary there is some source of turbulent energy and some source of frequency. Because if simply we would have B equals to the b If simply we would have B equal to zero initially and also on the boundary, then B would be equal to zero, everything is zero, and we just end up, and this must be also zero, and we end up with Euler equation, basically, if B is zero, which is not, of course, our goal. We really want to have the model where there is some turbulence and there is some viscosity. So, for us, the initial conditions. The initial condition will be some given, and we somehow need to prescribe them in some reasonable manner. So, first of all, of course, the initial velocity must have free divergence, must be free divergence, and there is no outfall inflow. And this is the standard function space for the velocity. If you look onto the equation for omega, so you see that this is well more or less good guy on the right-hand side, nice equation. Relevant hand side, nice equation, and this is negative. So, immediately you see that there is no problem with the minimum, with the maximum principle. So, if the initial data and boundary data will be bounded from above, immediately you see that omega will be bounded from above as well. On the other hand, you can do the same thing also for the minimum principle. Okay, there will be some loss, so you will maybe have some exponential decay, but still, if initially the If initially the the omega, this frequency will be very very far from zero, it will be there forever. Okay, it will tend to zero, but it will be always non-negative. So for concerning the omega, the only reasonable assumption that this is really the initial data and the boundary data are bounded from above and below, and then it will not cause any trouble. But for the turbo and kinetic energy, again, Kinetic energy again, if you look to the simple equation, so this is positive term, okay, this doesn't, this has, this is this opposite sign basically, but there is this B. So basically, there will not be a problem more or less with some kind of generalized minimum principle, which means that if we control at the beginning the logarithm of B0 for the initial value. For the initial value, then we control it forever. As long as the boundary data are compatible with this observation. So, this is some minimum assumption we would like to do. Basically, it corresponds to the fact that if you simply, okay, this is not enough on the level of formulation because we have just the record data, but simply if you just divide this equation by b, you will. By B, you would see that you are getting some nice information provided that you control a priori this logarithm of the initial condition. Of course, this works in the setting of zero flux. In case of direct red, you have to do it more carefully, but in principle, something like this is also working. On the other hand, four bombs from above, there is no chance how to get it just from this. How to get it just from this equation. Basically, you will see at the end of the day that this is just L1 quantity, and then you will do just with kind of parabolic equation with L1 on the right-hand side. And then basically, all the estimates from above for B are just dictated by the theory for such kind of problems. So basically, because we Because we have just L1 right-hand side, the minimal assumption and the reasonable is that initial data for B0 must be in L1. There are also boundary conditions. I already mentioned that we prescribe the Richard data for omega and for B. And then there is a point what to do with the data for diversity. I said already that we consider only the internal flow. only only the internal flow which means that this is this is just simply zero this cap this board n is the normal vector on the boundary and then it is a big question what to ask you on concern about the velocity on the boundary yeah i think that nobody knows what should be there definitely no slip shouldn't be there otherwise you do not produce any anything anything concerning the tuberance so there might be maybe some something something more clever this is kind of This is kind of prototype of boundary condition we have chosen here. In fact, in the paper, they are much more general. This is just kind of prototype which would do the job. And just it tells you as long as this stress is not large, this one, then there is no slip. But once you reach some value, so once you reach the sigma star, the velocity, the tangential part of the velocity, so this. The tangential part of the velocity, so this is this quantity, is just related to the stress. It is, it can be called some stick-slip boundary condition. Basically, it tells you that if the stresses are not large, there is no sleep, if they reach some threshold, it really starts to flow. Moreover, in the analysis, even this threshold, sigma star, can depend also, for example, on B or on the frequency or whatever. It should be just a continuous function. It should be just a continuous function of B or omega, and also of the position or time if you wish. But this is somehow the basic scheme we are able to cover. So the message is that this is essential for the analysis, and also if you want to create really some turbulence on the boundary. And then we just this we have chosen for simplicity, but also it has really good, good. it has really good good good reason on the on the on the physical side yeah usually there can be no slip if the stresses are not large but once the stresses are large it really starts to it really starts to flow also on the boundary and then okay there is a question what kind of theory we would like to build and of course we are dreaming in in global in time existence of Time existence of weak solution and for large data. But for such a theory, this term on the right-hand side is our biggest enemy. And well, in 3D, and I am not sure for this system, maybe also even 2D, this guy destroy everything. So once we would like to have this equation, we are not able to pass the dynamic. And there are also several papers where people are treating this problem. People are treating this problem, but then some additional non-negative measure is appearing on the right-hand side of this equation. But this is exactly the way we do not want to go. We really do not want to put here some artificial measure. This is one reason. Second reason is: if you really look how this equation is derived, or from what principles is this equation derived, you will see that it is. You will see that it is very much to do also with Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. So basically, this equation was not the starting point. The starting point was the equation for this, for this quantity. You can call it somehow the energy, if you wish. You really start, you evaluate, you take your average stokes, you compute this average edges, then you intro. this every wedges then you introduce you introduce also the equation for for the for this guy for this capital e and it has now this form and as the consequence if if you now you believe that this is this is correct equation then you can just take the you can just take the kinetic energy coming from from this problem you subtract it and you end up you end up with this guy here and so basically these two from these two formulation boxes are equivalent In boxes, are we equivalent on the level of weak solution? Oh, sorry, on the level of classical solutions, or to say it correctly, they are equivalent as long as you can test the momentum equation by the velocity. Also, equivalent as long as the kinetic energy equality holds. So, then this is really equivalent boxes. These are equivalent boxes. If this is not the case, then you shouldn't forget what was the starting point, and it was this equation. Was this equation? This was the primal equation derived by Kormogorov, and this is the equation for this energy. And then, if you really want to have some equation for B, you do this formula male operation, and if you assume everything is nice, you can derive the equation for B. But this is also already not rigorous if you do not know that you can test the balance of linear momentum by the Of linear momentum by the velocity. So you see, but this is a good message: is that this critical term, which is basically only in L1, disappeared and was replaced by some guys under divergence, which are hopefully much better for getting the convergence. And there's also one price, and this is this pressure. Okay, sorry, he's missing one brief, but then the pressure. Break it, but then the pressure appeared here. So it also tells us immediately that if we want to deal with the weak solution for this problem, we really need to reconstruct the pressure. And this is the mathematical reason why we assume that we have a sleep boundary condition, and also why, to be honest, we are not able to cover the case of no sleep boundary condition. Exactly, just because we want to introduce the pressure. Introduce the pressure. Okay, I will just go quickly. And here is the list of estimates you can expect. This is the estimates based that you control the energy. And this is just really what you are able to get. So basically, these are the standard thing for the velocity, for the symmetric gradient, and also for B, just from the equation. And I will take the value if you somehow divide by B. If you somehow divide by b, which you can justify somehow, you immediately see that this logarithm is under control and that the symmetry gradient is also under control in L2. And this is just interpolation. So this is nice. So you know that symmetry gradient is in L2, which is perfect, but there is some missing information. And if you look at here, so basically here is the gradient of omega squared, but here is. Gradient of omega squared, but here is some coefficient here, which in principle can vanish. Okay, not so much, but this is the rate of possible vanish. Okay, vanishment, if it is an English word. So it doesn't tell you so much about the gradient of omega. So basically, you cannot claim from this equation that omega is a symbol function. But still, you can solve it. You can rewrite this term here in the following. Here in the following way, you can just rewrite it, and now it is nice because you can really justify that this multiplication together is a subordinate function, and therefore you can really give the meaning to this operator. And now, this is very well defined, and you can give the meaning. And then you can construct the solution. And okay, as you can see here, there is not so much space, it is basically maybe luck. Maybe luck. We are very happy. If you just put your estimates to all the estimates together, and you would like to look into which space these quantities belong. So you see that the biggest troublemaker is exactly this one. This is coming from this global energy. And you see that this thing is just in the Lebesgue space L80 over 79, which is still better than L. Which is still better than L1, and therefore we are still able to get the existence of weak solution by using some proper Gallerican scheme and some approximation method. But somehow, this is the biggest troublemaker, but still it is better than L1, and therefore the whole analysis is possible. Okay, there is also a possibility that if you assume initially that B is better, sure that B is better, so above it from also below, so far from zero, it will also remain far from zero for the whole time. And then you do not need to do these tricks concerning omega, because then you can claim that omega is also a sobular function. But if you in principle would like to allow some banishment of the turbulence in the interior, then you are also in troubles. So I think this is Also in troubles. So I think this is all I want to say. These are stated precisely the CRM. So this is for Como-Grove model. It is from 2019. And this is for the TK epsilon model. So this was the starting point if you reduce the model for one equation. So I think that's all I want to say. And thank you. Okay. Thank you, Mira.
