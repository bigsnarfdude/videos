So, I want to thank first the organizers for kindly inviting me to the meeting. I should say that I am not a quantum theorist or quantum information or anything like that, so I'm a bit of an outsider from this community, but I will use. I will use the fact that here says that there are some mathematical aspects of quantum theory, so I will talk about that. And basically, as you can imagine, I'm going to be talking about geometry and its applications in quantum theory. So the first one can ask, of course, is whether there's any role or what is the role of geometry. Is the role of geometry in the formulation of quantum theory? We are pretty much used to standard formulations in terms of Hilbert spaces, operators, and so on, but probably the geometric. Okay, I don't know what to do here. Okay, thanks. So probably the geometric formulation or how exactly what is the role of geometry in the formulation of geometry in formulation of quantum theory might not be very well known for everyone, so I think it's a good opportunity to talk about this. And the question is whether this brings any new insights or is this just Or is this just a way of indulging mind? So, if you like geometry, then you're happy, if you don't, then you're unhappy. So, I think it is very useful to view the theory we are concerned with, which is quantum theory from as many different viewpoints and perspectives as one can. And maybe with that in mind, one can have some breakthrough. So far, this is just standard. I'm just going to talk. Just standard. I'm just going to talk about standard quantum theory, not even interpretations or anything, nothing conceptual. And the particular question I want to ask in this talk is whether we can use this geometry to visualize and understand squeeze states. And by squeeze states, I'm going to focus my attention on vacuum squeeze states, which is a subset of all the squeeze states. And at last, one can ask whether this new perspective or this technology is of any use in, for example, cosmology, which is what I did some work on, and that's why I can talk about all this stuff. Okay, so first I will just tell you or recall what is the role of geometry in the formulation. The role of geometry in the formulation of quantum theory. I will take the most simple system, well, not the most simple system, but one of the simplest systems that physicists normally consider and look at the vacuum and squeeze states in that case from the perspective of all the technology I will have introduced by then. And if there is time, I will tell you about the application. And if there is time, I will tell you about the application to cosmology and the role of these squeeze states in free quantum field theory. Okay, so what is the role of geometry in quantum theory? There are two different ways in which geometrical objects are fundamental in quantum theory. The structures are the same in both cases, but they are conceptually different. So it is, I will tell you about both. It is. I will tell you about both because sometimes there's a confusion and one is someone is talking about one of these and the other is talking about the other one and then there's no communication. So the first one, which is not the one I will use, but what is conceptually important is to go from Hilbert space to projective space and then look at its geometry. There are two fundamental geometrical objects that become relevant. Geometrical objects that become relevant. One is a symplectic structure, and the other one is a Riemannian metric. And by Riemannian metric, I mean with the signature of Euclidean signature. So it's a truly Riemannian metric, not the pseudo-Riemannian that physicists use in relativity. And interestingly, each of these geometric objects describe different aspects of Describe different aspects of quantum theory, and I will tell you more in detail. The other way in which geometry arises is in the process of quantization, that is, if we start from a classical phase space, and then, of course, classical phase space is already a symplectic manifold. So, here introducing a metric which is not in the classical theory, a metric. A metric on phase space is going to play a fundamental role in the process of quantization, that is, going from a classical theory to a quantum theory. Okay, and this is where I will focus for the rest of the talk. And here, the like the main message that I will repeat many times is that a metric on phase space and is important. And I will tell you what is the role in the definition of vacuum and in quick. Definition of vacuum and in squeeze states in general. Okay, so first, the geometry on Hilbert space. We know that a Hilbert space H has a Hermitian inner product that is part of the definition, and I can simply decompose it into the real part and imaginary part. It turns out that the real part is symmetric. That the real part is symmetric. And now I'm getting confused with this. So the real part is symmetric, so it is a Riemannian metric. And the imaginary part is anti-symmetric, so it is a symplectic structure. So just by having any quantum theory, you have naturally these two objects on Hilbert space. But we know, and this is one of the possible is one of the postulates if you want that michael reisenberger was not talking about this morning is that the true space of states is not the hilbert space but it's actually the projective space where one can one has to take the quotient by the usual equivalence relation that allows one to multiply one one state by any complex number different from zero and this From zero. And this is no longer a vector space as the Hilbert space was. And it turns out that these two objects, I'm using the overline to say that these are objects on Hilbert space. One can project both the symplectic structure and the metric to the projective space. And we have the quantum state space, which is, well, the projective space with. The projective space with a symplectic structure and a Riemannian metric. Now, the important thing is that I was telling you that these two objects will have different roles. All the unitary transformations that happen in Hilbert space can be described in terms of the symplectic geometry on the projective space. This is as if it was classical dynamics, and this is defined purely by omega. Okay, so the unitary. Okay, so the unitary evolution, for instance, generated in a Hilbert space by a Hamiltonian is now generated in the projective space by this function. So, because you have to talk about the standard Hamiltonian formalism, so in standard geometric, I mean, symplectic mechanics. I mean, symplectic mechanics, one needs functions. The function is the expectation value of the operator. There is a Hamiltonian vector field, and then we have this fundamental equation, which is just Heisenberg's equations written in this geometric language. Oops. Sorry. Okay, so what happens is that unitary transformations become simple morphisms in this quantum state space. Quantum state space. This is, therefore, this symplectic structure omega is responsible for what Penrose calls the U-process of quantum mechanics, which is a unitary part of quantum mechanics with no measurements or collapse or anything like that. And then on the other hand, the metric G is the object responsible for the more quantum aspects of the theory, which is what Benros calls the R process. Penros calls the R process. In particular, there are two ways in which one can see this: the role is that if we have any observable on Hilbert space, an operator, if one computes its uncertainty or fluctuations, this turns out to be proportional, modulo H bars and so on, to the norm of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Hamiltonian vector field given by the metric. So, I mean, the Hamiltonian vector field is something that comes naturally from here. So, that means that the larger the Hamiltonian vector field is, the larger the quantum uncertainty on that quantum state is. Eigenstates are those for which Hamiltonian vector fields vanish, so therefore the norm is zero. The norm is zero. And the other aspect is that if one computes the probability of transition between two quantum states, the fidelity you want, this is exactly given by the cosine square of the geodesic distance between these two quantum states. So there are two quantum states. We are in some manifold. There's a metric. There's a unique geodesic connecting them. One computes the geodesic. One computes the geodesic distance, and then cosine squared gives us the probability of transition between these two. So that's the way that in this formulation metric comes and has information about this more quantum aspect of the theory, which is related to probabilities, uncertainties, and so on. Okay, so that this is the quick reminder of. Quick reminder of this formalism. Now, I will tell you about the other aspect, which is what I'm more interested in, which is the process of quantization and geometry. So, here the starting point is space is very different, of course. This is the classical phase space. In the other case, the starting point was already the Hilbert space. So, here we have the classical phase space. A classical phase space gamma. This is already a symplectic space with a symplectic structure omega. I'm here denoting omega and the metric G with lowercase letters to distinguish them from the uppercase, which were the ones in Hilbert space projective quantum projective space. So we already have a symplectic manifold here. And now the quantization, not what The quantization, not what we will understand by quantization in this from this perspective, is to define, and one can view it in two different ways. One is to define on the phase space a compatible complex structure. This is exactly what Guillermo was doing on Monday. So, a complex structure is some operator on the space that is That is whose square is minus one, it is compatible if it defines together with the symplectic structure a Riemannian metric. So one could think, people that like to think about J, I will take the viewpoint in this talk that I'm just defining a metric, but there was a simple structure in the middle, or you can define the simplex structure from the metric and From the metric and the symplectic two form. Okay, so now the space with this extra structure one defines is has the same structure as the other guys. This is some manifold symplectic to form an A Riemannian metric. Okay, and this is actually just the first step in quantization. I'm not done quantizing anything. I just defined on face page. Defined on phase space another classical object which is a Riemannian metric, right? So there is nothing quantum there. The sec, the step, the actual step of quantization, that's up to you, which method you like the most. But in all of these choices, everything follows from this. I mean, whatever you decide to use as your quantization method, everything is going to be determined. Is going to be determined and selected once you chose this classical metric on phase space. Okay, I will just tell you two, but there are, of course, more. One is that you can, and this is what is normally done in field theory, you take the phase space, you define now a Hermitian inner product using omega and g, how exactly the way that one has it. I mean, one has defined. One has defines real part with g imaginary part with omega, combines it, one has a Hermitian inner product. And one uses that Hermitian inner product to go to define a Hilbert space. You're in finite dimensions, you are done. If you are in infinite dimensions, you have to complete it. Dimensions, you have to complete it with the inner product. You arrive at a Hilbert space, and this is exactly what one calls the one-particle Hilbert space. And then the next step is to define the full Hilbert space by using the Fock construction, right? So there it is. That's your Hilbert space. You know how to define operators and so on. There's another way of doing the quantization starting from the same structure, which is the GNA. Which is the GNS construction that is starting from a positive linear functional on the Bile algebra of operators. That positive linear functional is defined uniquely by G. Once you have G, you define a positive linear functional in a unique way. And in this construction, you have in a very simple way a preferred vacuum state, which I will denote by this. This depends. this and this is depends on on the choice of metric that you you have in you have in in on face space and this is uh for those of you who listen to to guillermo's talk he was relating precisely the complex structure to a vacuum state in cosmology right so most of his talk was talking about equivalent or inequivalent quantum theories defined by different j. Quantum theory is defined by different j's. So, this is exactly the thing he was talking about and thinking about. Okay, so let me now go to the simplest example I can think of, which is a simple harmonic oscillator. In that case, phase space is two-dimensional with coordinates Q and P. I will define for simplicity a dimensional quantities. Quantities, uppercase q and p, defined by this combination of constants. So how do we arrive in this case to the standard quantization, the one we already know and love? Well, one has to choose the complex structure in such a way that the Vendometric, which, as I told you, was constructed out of omega and j, has this form. And J has this form, okay, the Euclidean metric. H-bar has to be there, just for dimensional things. But in these coordinates chosen in this clever way, the metric, the Euclidean metric is the one that is going to give us the standard Schrodinger, I mean, the vacuum that we know. And note that this is completely kinematical. Completely kinematical. I haven't considered a Hamiltonian or anything, right? I could have chosen wrongly the coordinates Q and P, and then I would get something which is not the lowest value of the Hamiltonian. But for whatever reason, this simplest choice is precisely what gives us the basis state of the Hamiltonian. Okay, now just as... Now, just as we had in the case of quantum phase space, fluctuations of these operators and the vacuum. Okay, I told you that G determines uniquely the vacuum. I'm not telling you right now what the vacuum is, but if one computes the vacuum expectation value or the fluctuations of Q and P, one gets in both cases H. And but the way, I mean, this is exactly equal to. This is exactly equal to, as before, the norm given by the metric G of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields associated to Q and P. Okay, so this is exactly how the role of this classical object in computing quantum object quantities, right? So uncertainties. They're directly given by the metric G. Now, since I knew Now, since I knew that Christopher is going to be here and I didn't want to not have an answer, if he asked me what is the base state of the harmonic oscillator, in this representation, well, if you choose the position representation, then the vacuum state in this case is just has this very simple form in terms of this coordinate q. Coordinate Q. Okay, so this is how we are going to understand quantization of the harmonic oscillator. The vacuum state is going to give us this quantity, right? So one thing to notice is that fluctuations in Q and P are completely symmetrical. This has to do precisely because this is a Euclidean metric. So basically, the metric looks Q and P in the same way. The metric looks Q and P in the same way, right? And therefore, gives us the same fluctuations in Q and P. There's nothing to be surprised about this because this is exactly what everyone expects. Okay, so what is the information that we can draw here from the metric? Apart from the fact that fluctuations are evenly distributed between Q and P, and that has to do, as I was telling you, with the And that has to do, as I was telling you, with the isotropy, isotropy of the metric. We can think, for instance, we look at the QP plane, the phase space, and we can ask, so what are the points that satisfy this? This is that norm of the corresponding vectors connecting the origin to that point is just a constant. That is a circle, of course, because we have the. we are we have the euclidean metric so one can geometrically think i have phase space this is a plane and i can construct in my imagination this big net like function which is just has this form this is a gaussian now q and p constructed precisely with with g and this is a rotationally symmetric gaussian so this is like a volcanic So, this is like a volcano, right? So, it's completely symmetrical in every direction. I can rotate it, and this is invariant on the rotations. And then I can visualize in phase space this function as giving me the information about the vacuum state. Okay. So, this is just an intuitive way of thinking of the vacuum as the asymmetric state in phase space. I'm not claiming that the I'm not claiming that my phase space is defined by these functions. I'm just saying that this is a visual to think about these states and width of this telling me precisely the uncertainty in the corresponding coordinates, right? In Q and P. Okay, so now if you believe everything I just told you, then I will explain you how. I will explain you how we can understand squeezed vacuum states from this perspective. And this is very geometrical. I'm more a relativist than anything, so I like to think about coordinate changes, metrics, and this kind of thing. So this is having fun with this or in quantum mechanics, right? So the squeeze vacuum states. Okay, the idea here is to, and to illustrate the point, I will perform symplectic transformation on phase space. On phase space. So I start with coordinates q and p, and I go to q prime, p prime, linear symplectic transformations, but I will just focus on a very particular subspace, subset of such transformations, one that elongates, takes one of the axes and just stretches it, and the other one has to squeeze it, right? Because we know that we have to preserve the unique. To preserve the U bill area because, in order for it, this to be a symplectic transformation. So, this particular set of canonical transformations, I'm just multiplying Q by some real number alpha different from zero and P by the corresponding inverse, right? So that's stretching or squeezing one of the coordinates, one of the x's axis, and doing the opposite in the other way. And doing the opposite in the other one, right? Now, there are two things we can do with this very simple transformation. First one is to write the metric, the original metric, in the new coordinates, right? So it's very simple. I just make a change of variables and so on. And I look at the old metric, the original metric in these new coordinates. Or the other thing I could do is define a new metric, G prime, that looks Euclidean in the new coordinates, right? So I say, Coordinates, right? So I say, okay, I forget about the original g, I define this new g prime, and now this one looks Euclidean just as the other one looked, but in these new coordinates. Okay. So this is exactly what one knows in R2. There is not a unique flat metric in R2. There are infinite number of flat metrics. One normally just chooses some coordinates, x and y. X and Y, and writes the Euclidean one, but the target is not unique. There's an infinite number of ways. This is an example of precisely this. And then I can do the opposite, write the new metric in the old coordinates, right? Everything is very simple. I'm just multiplying by alpha or alpha to the minus one. Okay. Is there a way of removing this? Because this. This is on the on the no it's the same thing okay so now let's recall that given the metric on phase space one can define a quantum theory and in particular a vacuum state so now in the second case where I define the new metric g prime I can I can have a new vacuum state, which I will call this vacuum state prime, is different from the original one when alpha is different from one. Of course, if alpha is one, it's just the same thing. I haven't told you. I just told you two ways in which you can do it. You can do the fork quantization or you can do the GNS, but it's precisely given. This is just. But you don't have to. The thing is, you don't have to know what the vacuum state looks like. You can compute all the expectation values using G. I mean, I just told you the, well, at least the two point functions you can compute just using G, using this. So, this is telling you that if you want to compute the two-point functions, you just need to compute these classical objects and take the norm with g. And that is what you would get if you had some Hilbert space operators and computed the vacuum expectation values for your operators. Sure. No, but it's just classical. This is on phase space. This is completely phase space. This is completely phase space. This is Hamiltonian vector field on phase space. This is a classical object on phase space. And this gives you these two-point functions on the quantum. You don't need to... I mean, the beauty of this is that you don't need to do all the work of going to a Hilbert space representations of your operators and computing vacuum expectation values. Because if you do that, you will get this. Do that, you will get this. That's why I'm not doing it, and I wouldn't have time to do it. I just did it just for your sake, because I didn't want you to ask me this, and I wouldn't have an answer. Okay. So, with this new metric, I would have a new quant new vacuum, which I wrote it also for you in the case of In the case of high Schrodinger representation in the position representation. But for an observer, and here I'm not suggesting that I have observer, I'm just saying that anyone that chose the coordinates q prime, p prime as their Euclidean canonical coordinates on phase space, and everyone is free to choose whatever coordinates they want. That's what they tell us in. They tell us in relativity, that observer will decide that his Euclidean metric and the vacuum prime are the natural ones, right? So for me, the natural one was the one from the previous transparency, but somebody else likes this other alpha different from one. And she decides that that's a good one. And now she will have a different vacuum state. She will have a different vacuum state, which will loop her coordinates like this. And this, everything is natural. In according to geometry, well, they're both equivalent, right? In a sense, because nobody tells you which is the right one, right? Okay, so, but what does the original observer, so the one that had coordinates P and Q without primes, think of the new vacuum, the prime vacuum? The prime vacuum. Okay, so we do. We just use whatever I already wrote, which is just look at the metric G prime, the new one, in the old coordinates. I already have it. So here it is. The new metric in the old coordinates. So here it is, very simple. And now the question. For instance, if now I want to visualize what happens with this new metric in the old coordinates, this equation is no longer a circle, but is given me an ellipse, right, or a squeeze circle. So if I use this representation of thinking about phase space and about this, the metric defining me circles or ellipses or so on and so on. I understand it. Uh, I understand the difference between one metric and the other metric on the same on the same space, right? So, the new metric is giving me now squeezed circles, okay? And now I compute my expectation values of the so I am the original observer with who that has observables Q and P, and I want to compare. And I want to compute the fluctuations of two point functions of my fundamental coordinates in the new metric, the metric which is natural for somebody else. And I use the same formula because this is the only formula I know, which is computing the same Hamiltonian vector fields I had, but now with a new metric. And it's not surprisingly. It's not surprisingly, we get some different, I mean, the opposite inverse result. So it's no longer h-bar, but depends on this parameter alpha. Same for P. So now what this is telling me is that if alpha is greater than one, then the fluctuations in Q, in this In Q, in this new state defined by G prime, becomes smaller. So this observable is becoming squeezed. The other observable, of course, has to be stretched so that the product of insertatin remains constant. Of course, I just told you about this particular simplective transformation, which doesn't do other things that stretch and squeeze, but the general. But the general one combines also a rotation, right? So, I mean, the formulas are a little bit more complicated, but conceptually, it's exactly the same. Okay, so this is like the main idea here. I am what I wanted to tell you is that we have this family of these vacuum squeeze states from the geometry. States from the geometric perspective, I have a phase space which is just R2. My original metric, canonical one, was in my coordinates Q and P, was the Euclidean metric, but I can perform linear symplectic transformations, canonical transformations on this on classical phase space. And for each one of them, I will have a new vacuum state or new state. New vacuum state or new state. That vacuum state will look natural in the corresponding coordinates, new coordinates, but for the original observer with coordinates q and p, these states will be will look squeezed. Okay. I even wrote, I think, the I didn't write the corresponding. One can write the same thing here. The same thing here. And now for the g prime, so the Wigner-like function, and instead of being a symmetrical rotational Gaussian, will be something which is going to be squeezed on one side and stretched on the other side. I mean, one can one Google squeeze states, one will find many of these figures in many, many places, right? And I am not advocating. Uh, I'm not advocating a big nerve quantization or anything like that. I'm just saying that if I do that, I can visualize on phase space using the metric these functions. And the information about this function, the information that this function is going to give me is precisely by its width, it's going to give us the fluctuations in the corresponding observable that I'm probing. Okay, so that is like the main lesson. Lesson in terms of how to understand geometrically vacuum squeeze states. Now, these are vacuum squeeze states because these are states that we obtain from the vacuum by these transformations. In the definition, one sees everywhere about squeezed states involves like two parts. One is generating a coherent state. Generating a coherent state, so which is like translation, so this is translating the vacuum to any point on this case in phase space, and then applying a squeezing operator. I'm just looking at the vacuum without the coherent part, so I'm just applying, if you want, in the language that everybody writes is making visual this squeezing operator that people write in the People writing in the definition of squeeze states. And okay. So I will just go very, very fast to the applications. We use this for inflationary cosmology. I mean, my tour with my collaborators. In inflationary cosmology, this is just to describe the The idea is to have a framework for understanding the structure of the cosmic microwave background. This is a field theory on a fixed background. This is field theory defined by some scalar field. This is one normally takes a linear scalar field defined on an expanding. On an expanding background, this is exactly what Guillermo was talking about. For simplicity, one normally writes down the field in terms of its Fourier modes for each k. And one of the aspects that is important in the discussion of inflationary cosmology is how quantum fluctuations, which is what we have because this is a quantum field theory on a classical background, how is it? Classical background, how is it that each of these fluctuations become classical? Because astronomers, when they compute, when they evolve things to compute the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, they're not using quantum field theory, they're using classical equations to evolve distribution functions, right? But how do we go from the quantum theory to these classical distribution functions? That is something which is is something which is has drawn a lot of discussion in the cosmology community and we just offer a perspective using these geometrical quantities these objects and one can focus on different aspects i will neglect a and i will just talk about two one is how cool how can we apply our our geometric understanding of squeezing to this uh the case of To this, the case of this evolution of these fluctuations in a cosmological background, in particular in the inflationary case. And the other one is how can we construct an exact positive classical probability distribution function from naught such that it approximates the quantum expectation values. So the true theory is quantum. So it involves Hilbert spaces, operators. Hilbert spaces, operators, vacuum expectation values, blah, blah, blah. But we want to approximate this by something which is classical. And this object, if we are able to find this object which approximates very well the quantum quantities, then we can live with on this side, which is exactly what astronomers do when evolving perturbations. Okay, so I'm going to just use whatever I already To just use whatever I already told you, so now instead of Q and P, I have these modes of the field labeled by K. Now, this is phi and pi. Now, these are actually complex, but that is not a big problem. The idea is actually the same, the same, namely, that if I want to compute fluctuations of these operators, this is given, which is normally just. Which is normally just this. I mean, this is the formula that defines the left-hand side. But using whatever I told you, this is exactly given by this metric now, in this space of modes, of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. So this is exactly the same formula I already told you. This can be used to compute the fluctuations of these cosmological observables. Okay, this is my time is up. Um, so and this is all this also tells us that we can define this possible this probability distribution function on phase space that is going to mimic the quantum two-point functions. Okay, constructed out of optosometric, right? So, uh, here we what we see, for instance, in inflation. See, for instance, in inflation, is that we start with the initial vacuum state. And as I explained to you, the usual nice state, one can always find coordinates in such that it looks like a circle. So I'm now using all this technology and my way of visualizing. So I start with a circle originally. Normally, this is what is called the Bonch-Davis vacuum. And I want to see how this evolves in time, right? Now the Hamiltonian. Right now, the Hamiltonian everything is time-dependent, of course. So, the vacuum is not invariant, it's going to evolve, and it's got precisely going to go through all these vacuum squeeze states. It started with a real vacuum, which is like a circle. Now, as time evolves, this circle is going to be stretched and so on. And then I want to understand exactly how this is happening depending on the dynamics of the back of the. Dynamics of the back of the background, which may include inflationary periods. Inflationary just means that it has a very violent explosion, I mean stretching in all the directions, right? Okay, so there's a notion of a cosmological horizon, which is important. At some point, these modes cross the cosmological horizon and that. Cosmological horizon, and that changes something. And then, what we see is that already at crossing, this is something that cosmologists are very interested in. What happens before crossing, after crossing cosmological horizon? Well, it happens that already at the crossing of the horizon, these ellipses are already very squeezed in one of the canonical coordinates, the field. Okay? Okay, and of course, the details are going to be different depending on the parameterization. This is exactly one of the points that Guillermo was doing. Things look differently if you look at fields phi or if you look at field chi, which is just a product with the parameter A in Frigner, Roberts, and Walker. Okay, so this geometric way of understanding. Geometric way of understanding these squeezed vacuum states gives us a very precise understanding on how it is that the vacuum in inflation gets squeezed and appears to freeze after crossing the cosmological horizon. And here, what is notable is that the variable that gets squeezed and therefore becomes classical because it's Therefore, it becomes classical because there's not very much spread, it's actually very localized, is the one of the field. And the observatory in the other one on pi gets very large, right? But interestingly, all the observables, the observations that we can make for defining the correlations in the cosmic microwave background only look at phi. They don't look at pi. They don't look at pi. So with this, we have a very nice way of understanding why this look very classical in some sense, and they're very sharply peaked on the field's phi. Okay. The other part, which was how to define a probability distribution function that is related to the vacuum expectation value, then I will use what I already wrote twice, which is to define. Wrote twice, which is to define this function on phase space using precisely the metric on Q and P, basically. And this gives us for the canonical vacuum, as I was telling you, this Gaussian. And one can use this and show that actually all these different operators with arbitrary powers in the With arbitrary powers in the by ordering, the vacuum expectation value of these operators are given by this classical by the moments of this classical distribution function. So we do get an exact relation between this quantum objects and classical distribution function, which is what we wanted. Okay. Well, so this is already what I was telling you. And so we, I think, with this. So I think with this geometric understanding, we can give some deeper understanding of this process that is normally called this transition between quantum and classical regimes of the theory. The universe is always quantum, but it is okay to look at it using classical tools because of this, the way that this, the vacuum. That this the vacuum evolves through the inflation dynamics. Okay, so let me just conclude. Here, the main message I was saying is that one can understand quantum theory in the way the standard one and also quantization in this geometric language. There are two geometric structures that have different roles in quantum theory. The quantumness is associated to a metric, it's different. It's different in depending on these two. The squeeze vacuum states can be understood in a very simply, very simply, in a very geometric and intuitive way, in my perspective, starting from the vacuum, an ordinary vacuum. And one can apply this to inflationary cosmology.  Assure. Okay, do we have any questions? Yes. Could you please repeat the main argument of the application in inflationary cosmology? Because Inflationary cosmology because I didn't understand in what sense squid states are like emulating or representating this process in the phrasing of the other degrees. I didn't understand that part. You can you agree that you can look the the field You agree that you can look at the field as made out of these modes, right? Defined by k. So the vacuum state, actually, we're in the same representation. So there's only one vacuum. But you can think that as if you start with a vacuum state and then you it evolves. And what happens is that it evolves through all this or through one parameter family. One parameter family of vacuum squeeze states, according to this interpretation. So, what this allows us is to visualize and see how this original quantum state that is called the Bonch Davis at some point is arbitrarily chosen at some arbitrary initial time. But once you made that choice, that original starting vacuum state. That's starting vacuum state. You can visualize circles in my language for each of the modes. And then you can see how each of these modes evolves through time through this. For each mode, there's a one parameter family of vacuum squeeze states. And then you can see how is it that each of these modes gets squeezed and they're not getting squeezed at the same time because each mode has its corresponding wavelength. Has its corresponding wavelength, and what is important is the relation between, I mean, the wavelength with the cosmological horizon, right? So each of these modes is going to behave at a given instant of time. Each one of these modes is doing something different, right, depending on its intrinsic size. But as each of these modes crosses the cosmological horizon, I mean, as I was telling you already, when they are crossing the cosmological horizon, they are very, very squeezed. I mean, very squeezed in the sense that there's 10 to the 8, the quotient between squeezing one direction and the other is like 10 to the 8 or something. But they get squeezed even further as they keep growing and they, because everything is inflating, so everything is expanding by this and that. Everything is expanding by this and that defoldings and so on, but they even get more squeezed, much more squeezed after crossing the horizon. One of the things that cosmologists talk about is that there is this freezing of the modes once they cross the cosmological horizon, and that they become classical because they freeze. That's just because you look at the wave equation and something happens after, for each of the modes, something happens after. For each of the modes, something happens after you cross the cosmological horizon. But here you see it in a very, very graphic and geometric way. How is it that each of them becomes a squeezed? Any more questions? Well, I have one. I'm definitely not an expert on this, but Not an expert on this, but my question is: what you're arguing here is that essentially this circle becomes a highly squeezed ellipse. So if I look at the squeezed direction, I have a very sharp state. So the field does not fluctuate a lot. And then, of course, the dual variable oscillates wildly. But then you still have a quantum state, not the classical one. Not the classical one. And then in cosmology, and that's the part I'm not very sure about, but in cosmology, I understand that somehow there is a miracle where these quantum fluctuations, big or small or whatever, become classical fluctuations that we can look through a telescope or something. So does what you say explain this quantum to classical jump? Can jump. So there are two parts, right? So one is that through this squeezing, one can one can say, oh, yeah, it makes sense to think of the field as something very classical in the sense that it's getting very sharp values, right? The second part, that doesn't give you exactly how to do the second part, right? How to construct a classical object. And that was the last part I was talking about, right? Which is how to So, how do I go? Well, this is still the way around. Yeah, it's not operating anymore. Ah, here. This is this part, right? So, what I do is I am constructing a classical object. Okay, it's also not working. So, I'm constructing a classical object which is just this row naught. This is a distribution function on phase space. I use the metric to do that, which in the case of the oscillator I was looking, telling you is this exactly this Gaussian. And now the result is that you can use this distribution function. The question is whether this is true, right? You have the quantum theory on the left-hand side. This is the things that really exist in nature, but you want to see whether you can approximate all those quantum results by computing classical objects, which are the moments of the observers. These are classical observers, O1, O2, with respect to this distribution function on phase space. So now you're doing. Space. So now you're doing statistical mechanics on phase space, classical statistical mechanics. And the answer is that, yes, you can do it with this choice of distribution function, which has the metric there, therefore has information about the quantum theory, as I have been arguing all along. Have been arguing all along. And the result here in equation four is telling you the left-hand side is quantum. So this is vacuum expectation values in the bile ordering of all this power of X and P. And this is an exact result. This is not approximate. This is an exact result. And on the right-hand side, one is computing the moments, these moments. These moments x to the m p to the m on this classical distribution function on phase space. Now, of course, this is for the bile ordering. So, you say I don't want the operators in the bylordering. Then if you rearrange, then you will get h-bar corrections. And then you can say, okay, I want this, but then you will have control on all the h bar corrections, right? Okay, any more questions? Okay, any more questions? Rafael has raised a hand. He raised it before, so Rafael, go ahead. We cannot hear you. Mr. Rafael is trying to talk. Can we hear him? Just a moment. So it has to be a little bit more difficult. I think it's buying Oh, I see the problem. I accidentally was muted. Sorry. So I started off by saying that thanks for a very beautifully organized talk, but that I had a similar question. If that was Chris O'Malley's who talked before, I'm not sure if it was, but if it was, I have a question along the same lines. Can you hear me now? Yes, excellent. Me now? Yes, excellent. Okay, so where is it? I don't know. Equation four has disappeared, but if you okay, give us a minute to bring the image back. We can hear you fine now, but we lost the image. My question is: Isn't equation four just as true for the unsqueezed vacuum as it is for the squeezed vacuum? And if that's true, why should this classical distribution function on phase space be any more or less valid for the squeezed than for the unsqueezed? Yeah, this is you're completely right. This is for any vacuum, including the unsqueezed vacuum. So this is just as a justification of so there are two parts, right? So there are two parts, right? This is telling us that we can actually build a classical distribution function with this property equation four. That is true for any vacuum and any squeeze vacuum, right? And the other one is that using the information that we gain from inflationary dynamics. Uh, inflationary dynamics and how these field operators get squeezed, then we can further justify using this object, right? And saying, okay, yes, we're doing we're using this classical thing, and furthermore, this thing is very much squeezed on the field operators. Yeah, so I think the question that both I and Chris and Malice were wondering about is: why does the square? Wondering about is why does the squeezing in itself justify using this classical distribution? Well, whereas it's justified for the unsqueezed it's not that it completely justifies, right? This is like two parts. So you have to use both results to feel confident that what everyone is doing is okay. It's okay, right? And so everyone is doing. I don't know if you are using this probability distribution that we are constructing, but if you use this, then you have this nice property four. And furthermore, this is like two parts, right? One doesn't justify the other, and then not the other way, neither the other way around. Two parts taken together justify together, exactly together. And you have effectively classical. That's what I just don't understand. Why using two of them you feel justified? This is not a proof anyway. This is a way of helping gain confidence on the fact that many people are doing these kinds of things. And sometimes the justification. And sometimes the justifications that they have in the literature are very, very shaky, so to say. And this is just making precise statements about these two aspects. One the squeezing and the other the classical probability distribution. Okay, but let me ask one, try one. Are you, I mean, people would usually point to other things. Point to other things. Now, at the present time, no one thinks we're looking at the inflaton when we do CMB observations. So there's a whole bunch of intermediary things that involve entanglement with other matter degrees of freedom, gravitons, and so on, and so on. But if we leave all that aside, are you claiming that the squeezing in itself is somehow? Is somehow a step towards classicality? And if so, why? Well, there are other things that people do, like comparing. So, as I said, this is not a foolproof criteria by itself. Anderson's proof, just heuristically, why is Heuristically. Why is reasoning as just because it is making the field operators very sharply picked? That is the zero order intuitive answer, right, to this. So that would say that if we are only interested in the value of the field operator, then we get a very good job. A very good question. Yeah, we are. I mean, there's no observable that depends on pi. Everything that is computed in terms of two-point functions and correlators, three-point functions, all so non-Gaussianities, everything just involves the field operator phi and not pi. And that is, I think, I mean, it could have been the other way around, right? That it got squeezed on pi, and then we would be, there wouldn't be at least. Been at least not this intuitive argument for justifying. I see. But wouldn't we say that now in that other case, we would just say that we could, there was still some well-defined CMB, but we couldn't make a very good prediction about it because if we were measuring, it was based on pi, it would just be all over the map. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Any other question? You had one. Thank you. Yeah, maybe it's a bit technical. So is there a very simple way to pass from, I mean, to get this vacuum or the metric G if one wants to quantize with the path integral instead of a canonical quantization? I mean, in the choice I gave you, what was the four quantization GNS? You could have done also geometric quantization because that's natural. You regard the polarization and this and that for a path integral. Well, I mean, my understanding is that you need already a Hilbert space to compute the path integral, right? And one way of viewing path integral is tool to defining probability amplitudes between states on Hilbert space. So doing not doing that, which is, I think, your question, I don't know exactly how that would be done. James, any more questions? Okay. One by Harris. Well, I would like to play the role of the advocate of the people that disagree with the idea that classicality can be explained this way, as is the standard practice. So what people are saying, and what I'm also saying, is that usually classicality criterion involve time evolution. So you need to consider unequal time correlation functions if you want to treat something as classical. And because this is going to be a source. And because this is going to be a source, for example, in classical fluctuations that enter into the simulations, let's say for a galaxy formation. So, what I'm saying is that a single moment of time probability is not enough. One should see a classical evolutionals for these observables. And this also involves not only phi, but its conjugate variable as well. Yeah, so I had here A is what exactly becomes small when you are at late times after. And in the paper, we do have a full section discussing precisely these kind of things. And then what we do is we compare commutators. Commutators, for instance, at different times with anti-commutators. You could argue that anti-commutators are more classical objects and commutators are truly quantum, right? And then so we take vacuum expectation values of anti-commutators and commutators, and we look at the ratio between these objects. And then we see also in a very precise way how is it that becomes classical in the sense that anti-community. Classical instance that anti-commutate vacuum expectation value of anti-commutators dominate for different times and so on after crossing the cosmological horizon. So that is also just another aspect of media that discussion that is in many of the papers in literature talking about commutators and commutators and so on. So we do have also that that is not doesn't depend very much on squeezing, that's just a fact and that, but we do have also. Fact and that, but we do have also some discussion on that. I didn't mention it here because I was focusing on geometry and squeeze states. Let me try to ask Daniel's question again, slightly differently, maybe. So, and So, instead of thinking about the path integral, but something which is really related to the path integral view on that. So, this metric in quantum field theory, in curved space-time, the choice, the correct choice, so to speak, of the vacuum is usually related to some asymptotic boundary conditions of the field, right? So, I was wondering. So, I was wondering, trying to reinterpret Daniele's question, if this transition to this squeezed metric can be interpreted in such a way, or if you have thought about this. Yeah, no, I haven't thought about this and exactly what it means for the problem you're referring to, which is what Guillermo was talking about. Which is what Guillermo was talking about, the non-uniqueness of the choice of vacuum or G or J in the case of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which is open question. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, I think it's about time to wrap it up for today. So let's thank our speaker again. And so, well, we can have a coffee break. Thank you.
