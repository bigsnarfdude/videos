Okay, well everybody, okay, so we don't start this section with our first With our first speaker this morning is José Antonio Carrillo, whom I'm very honored to introduce. And yeah, I would like to say a few words before introducing the talk. Professor Antonio, well, these are the words that I will be saying also on behalf of the organizers, but also on behalf of especially the people in Ethiopia, the people at IMA in Arama. So this whole VRDRS in RDR partnership was actually started also thanks to Costa Employment's help in the director's place when his agreement with BIRS was set and he provided essential support in the application for the funding and also scientifically but also for the Scientific adventure also for the well he is currently part of a member of the scientific advisory board and you are also on the EMARG steering board for this Maria de Maisu funding. So these are, you know, there are plenty of reasons for which the IMAC department, but also other organizers, we have to thank you for. Thank you for, let's say, having collaborated to the setup of this partnership between IMAC and the other nice, which also gave us the opportunities to apply and to organize this work. So thank you very much for this. And so back to the talk. This will be about the criticality in Canada models, a grain and flow perspective. A green flow perspective. Thank you. Thank you very much, Marco, for the nice introduction. Thank you very much for all the people at DIMA here. They are doing a fantastic job as far as I see. And it's a pleasure, as usual, to hear a talk in my hometown. The other day, in fact, Juluiz started the talk saying something about 1996. Today is exactly the 27th year since we. 27th year since we did that. So I hope to pass my exam again. Okay. So, in any case, I want to report about several recent works that we have done in the group at Oxford on Kahn-Hillier models. So, I will explain you the story from the modeling perspective at the beginning, and towards the math analysis. So, in fact, it's a summary of three works with Ruth Baker and Carlos Valco is the modeling part. And then we have started the analysis with Carlos Valco, Antonio Sposito, Carlos Valco, and Alejandro Fernandez. Carlos and Alejandro are PhD students online there. And I have another paper also that I will report, in fact, with the child. Will report in fact with Charles Elbar and Cuba. I will not try to pronounce his surname because I don't like that. Okay, good. So the outline of the talk is this one, as I said. I will start by the modeling side and then towards the analysis of it. Okay, so what was the origin of the questions here? It's a series of experiments that That I got interested in through my collaborators in Japan. I will go back to that a bit later. But, anyhow, these experiments are known in math biology. Let me see. Yeah, well, it works more or less. In math biology as the Steinberg experiments. And it's about cell-cell addition. Let me just explain you that in a few words. So, cell addition is about the binding of cells through cell surface. Of cells through cell surface proteins and cells, essentially through proteins that are produced in the cell that trigger the binding of the cells on the surface of the membrane. So it's a fundamental mechanism for the formation of organs and for tissue growth in general. And most of the experiments, in fact, that we were looking at is about tissue growth. So the question is. So, the question is: how does addition determine cell migration and how it determines the different patterns that they see in the experiments? So, let me start with just two of the experiments that are coming from the original papers of the Steinberg in the 60s and then later on in the 2000s, much more advanced experiments in the same spirit. This is about the cell organization due to the addition, they were measuring, they were able to measure. were measuring, they were able to measure in the most recent experiments, they are sure that the ones that they do the fluorescence in green or red corresponds to different ability to adhere to another cell. And the hypothesis is that due to that, they are able, changing the ability of adhere to the different cells, they are able to organize in different, let's call them patterns in the sense Call them patterns in the sense that they are mixed at some point and then they organize in this way that usually we refer as in government. Okay, just to give you the four already the different patterns that typically you see in the experiments, and that you will see probably later on in some of the simulations. At that time, they were thinking in the 60s that they were treating this or thinking about it as a model, as a mixture of two liquids. As a mixture of two liquids. And they were thinking about the different addition, the relative addition between cells as a way of modeling, well, I mean, as a way of controlling relative surface tension. That's how they thought in terms of developing the modeling. Okay? So we started to look at it from a different point of view. And probably I will not, sorry, I don't, I just prepared the slides these days, so there will be plenty of reference. There will be plenty of references that are missing, but let me start with one, probably the most relevant to me in this direction, which is due to Arnstron Sherratt and Painter and Sherat from the British math biology community. Years ago, they proposed a model for this based essentially in simplifying a little bit how they propose the model, but essentially they end up in a model of this kind, which I hope is. I hope it is quite popular here in the group. So it's just essentially linear diffusion plus this term with the gradient of a potential that is modeling for them the attraction. But I mean, they try to use these kind of models to recover some of the experiments in this business. I'm just copying some of the pictures from their paper. And probably I would like. And probably, I would like to put your attention in the sorting, for instance, case. There, you have somehow the plot of the two species, and as you see, I mean, you could expect that from the very beginning, due to the model of based on linear diffusion, I mean, they are not really able to capture any real sorting in the sense of separation or segregation between the individuals. That was respected, in a sense. That was respected, in a sense, and but at least they can see that by varying the different parameters, they go, they have these different behaviors. But it will be much clearer probably in the next slide. That's where we enter a bit into the game. And with my collaborators in Japan, we look at these experiments from a different point of view. And again, simplifying a little bit how we got to there, because it's a two-species model, really. Species model, really. The basis of our analysis was on an equation of that type, in the sense that even just by changing slightly to non-linear diffusion, the diffusive part, and as you see, it's the non-linear diffusion with a very particular exponent. I'll come back to that in a second. That's like Laplacian of Roscoe versus just attraction, and attraction. Versus just attraction, an attraction model non-locally to model the addition between the cells that usually happens at a certain distance. So the non-locality makes sense from the modeling point of view. I don't want to discuss that much on that. But if you do that, here you have some of the simulations of the model that we were using. Really, by taking care of the differential addition between cells, you can see that you. Cells, you can see that you can pass from one type of patterns towards each other in the sense that if all of them like each other at the same level, then they mix essentially. As soon as you have some differential addition, say here, the Greece, they like themselves much more than for the rest. You produce an engulfment, one engulfs the other. Partial engulfment, would you change again the differential abhisibility? The differential addressivity, and for instance, if you go to the string case in which green doesn't like at once red, you will have segregation. Okay, I mean, how we got to the model of two species, explaining a little bit this. So, again, this is just a simple explanation based on the fact that most of you know about the mean field limit in this community. So, you know, if the potential is nice and it's Uh, if the potential is nice and smooth, I don't want to enter now on that and on the technicalities of that. You can recover this PVE as a kind of the mean field limit of interacting particles through the potential W, meaning that you take the empirical measure associated to the dynamical system, and under certain conditions, you can get to that equation. So, what we did in order to introduce some of the modeling. Introduce some of the modeling coming from the assumptions in that type of experiment is to introduce volume exclusion. How we model volume exclusion? We model it by a strong repulsion at short distances, meaning that in the potential W, you model the strong repulsion at the origin by a D-RAC. Okay, so formally, if you do that and you leave the attractive part on the normal. And you leave the attractive part on the non-local term, just you substitute there, and then what you recover is exactly the kind of model that I wrote in the previous slide with the non-linear diffusion sponge and the attractivity. Okay, well, the same thing you can do for the two species model, let's say the one that were fluorescents in green and in red in the experiments, and you end up in a system of that type. Okay, so it's a system of. Okay, so it's a system of what we can call them aggregation diffusion equations because you have now your potentials of interaction between the two types of cells, which you want to think about then, think about them of the same shape, just that the relative strength is different. Okay, so the potential has the same shape, say the characteristic of a ball, or something more complicated than that for the gradient, but just multiply by a different strength. By a different strength. And in most of this, and in most of what I'm going to say today, in fact, the W12 and the W21 are the same. So I'm going to say, this is for studying the system. You don't have to do that assumption. But for that experiment of cell addition, W12 and 21 are the same. They attract, the cross-attraction, say, between the two different types of cells is the same. Just as the, I repeat, the strengths are different. I repeat the strengths are different. Due to the volume constraint that I'm assuming, you do that at the level of the two species. What you get is this term over here, which corresponds to a non-linear diffusion, or you want, you can think now in a different way, that term gradient of the sun is like, in terms of the more macroscopic modeling, it's like having a pressure that is due to the Having a pressure that is due to the total population present instead of each one separately. So, and you see that it's the same term in both because I did assumption on having this deductive strong repulsion for each of the two cells with the same strength. Why I'm paying attention to that? Because, first of all, for the gradient flow community here, if you assume that that Community here, if you assume that W12 and W21 are equal, this system has a greater flow structure. Second, precisely because you have here the sum of the two species, that complicates your life enormously. And why that complicates your life enormously? Because probably you can think about many ways in getting probably regularity of the sun, but there is no reason why. Sum, but there is no reason why each of the two populations has the good regularity that you can multiply the row times the gradient of the sum. So, in fact, the difficulty is so that up today, even if this model has already like seven, eight years, none of the people have worked in this business have been able to do a good well-posedness theory of this system in two dimensions. Okay? Yes. Yes, they are the same. Almost only in that case, and Marco will know better than me, then this has a great infrastructure. Yeah, because essentially, when you take the derivatives with respect, I mean, the formal variations of the function with respect to rho. function with respect to rho and eta only in that case you can see that they corresponds to the problem still even even in that case independently of that even independently that is a gradient flow the difficulty remains okay so now instead of looking at that system which is not the objective of today I'm gonna have a look at another system which is a limit of this one so Of this one, so let me just talk about the local model. Okay, Claudia had to go a bit faster at some point. So the local model, as I told you, you can assume that, sorry, you can assume that all the potential, they have the same shape. And only the difference between the potential is going to be just the strength. So let's say that they have. Strength. So let's say that they all have the same shape with the same scaling parameter. So you have a shape for the potential that is phi with a scaling parameter that is the same for everyone. And then you multiply by different strengths kij. Okay, you do that, you see k12 equals k21, as I told you, that's the case in which I'm going to move all the time. And then you just look at the convolution and expands in terms of A. Formally, you do the Taylor expansion in terms of A. Taylor expansion in terms of a, and you assume something about phi on their moments. Say that phi is symmetric, that all the even the all moments are zero. You just keep the first two moments on it. What you get at in the expansion in terms of A, the two terms, the first two terms, what you get is this way. You get rho, essentially, and then the Laplace of Rho's, the second order of term, if you just plug them in from here. Them in from here you get again some term which corresponds to a non-linear diffusion that you will put together with the other guy over here, and from here you get the Laplacian, you get that system. Okay, so formally what you get is a kind of Helier type system now in which the competing terms are the fourth-order kind of diffusion term with respect to the second order terms again, which Again, which are bonus medium-like, but with the choice of signs that I have here, they will be anti-diffusive terms. Okay, they will have the negative terms. So the competition will be between the diffusive fourth order terms and the, let's say, anti-diffusive terms of second-order time. I mean, of borus-medium time. Right. Right, one thing I wanted to mention at this point, for obvious reasons, I have here a kind of matrix that corresponds to the second order for the Laplacian term, for the fourth order terms in the equation. So I will assume that that matrix is elliptic. So the kappa is larger than alpha squared. Okay? Good. So if you look at this kind of system. If you look at this kind of system now, this looks very much like the thin film Cantilier type, well, the thin film type equations, just with that we have again mobility with the sponge one in front. The first thing that that's the biggest difference, I would say. And the thing is, well, from the modeling point of view, the question is: is this simplified now local model able to Local model able to recover again this kind of differential addition hypothesis by different parameters, and what can we do also from the theoretical side? How can we connect, for instance, this to the original model, the non-local model, or what are the properties of this system? So let's go through that. Okay, so again, yeah, well, I don't have to tell you. I don't have to tell you in this crowd that this equation has a kind of a gradient flow structure, but just in case, you write the corresponding one single equation instead of the system, that you can write it as a gradient flow in the Basque style or Otto sense as you prefer to call it of this free energy, which corresponds to just the Dirichlet integral minus the L two. Lay integral minus the L2. Now we have a square on the L2 third layer. Ah, yes, of course. Thanks. Yes, thank you. Good. So, just related to the fact that you can recover or not these patterns, let me just remind you a little bit the connection of some of the parameters to the original parameters of the model, because in this way it's easier to understand. This way it's easier to understand the relative terms. So, omega and alpha are the parameters that play an important role because they are the cross addition or repulsion type of parameters. So the alpha corresponds to this ratio and the omega corresponds to that in terms of the shape and the ratio of k12 and k22. But the important thing is that if we assume, as I said, kappa larger than alpha square, so I will be working in this range. So, I will be working in this range. And essentially, you can guess that you're going to have two different ranges depending on the relative values of omega and alpha. If omega is less than alpha, it's essentially saying that k1, 2 is smaller than k2, 2, or vice versa, for omega and less than alpha. And then essentially, this corresponds to weak cross-addition, and this corresponds to strong cross-addition. So, you would expect if it works. If it works, that in the weak cross addition omega less than alpha corresponds to cases in which they are segregated or partially engulfed, and the mixing and the engulfment should happen in the other range. Okay, so while this slide is just to show you that that's exactly what happens if you do good numerical schemes, which are in fact finite volume schemes, that conserves the fact that you have an energy decreasing, although I have. An energy decreasing, although I haven't said that, but the system, the Kahn Hillier system, has also great infrastructure. I'll show you in a second. So these numerical schemes, they show you precisely that you go along, for instance, that curve of parameters and you take these snapshots. These are the steady states that you get with periodic boundary conditions. So you go from essentially segregated steady states to partially engulf and mix. Gulf mix. Of course, when you have fourth-order diffusion, you always are going to have some intersection on the supports. This doesn't happen in the full model, as probably several people in the audience know, but that's the price you pay by the locality. I mean, this I like to show if it works. Yes, you see how the steady state changes by going through the parameter curve there. And then essentially, you recover what you wanted to from the very beginning to see if the local model was able to. Okay, you recover this kind of change of patterns at the level of the system. Okay, great. Let's go to the analysis part. So, first of all, I already mentioned that the first thing that you recovered that you hid from the original model. Recovered that you keep from the original model that it was a gradient flow is that still this is a gradient flow with respect to Wassenstein, the system. And let's see that. Essentially, sorry about a bit of the change and some notations here and the free energy, but you can write your candidate to free energy. Again, there is where it's important that the alpha here, the coefficient here and here is the same. This corresponds to the fact that it's symmetric in the other model. Other model, and that's the energy that you get. And you can, I mean, you can see, I know that most of you are doing the computation in your mind now, that you do the variation of it, you recover that formula that you have over there. Okay? So, in principle, this has a good structure. The question is, being a system and being fourth of the, can you push the theory for that? Can you push the theory for that? And I'll come back to that in a second. Let me see what I have here. Yeah. Again, just to say that you can see at the level of the gradient flow, at the level of the energy, the two terms that are important for the pattern formation. I mean, the type of pattern that you get. And these are simply the cross terms in the free energy. And just to finish the power. Free energy. And just to finish the part of the modeling, probably it's nice to see the system in 2D also recovering this kind of patterns. So let's see if all of them work. Yeah, hopefully they are running. Yes, they are running. So as you see, if you have this kind of coarsening behavior like typically in country type models, but then you get to steady states and you get exactly the kind of behavior. Still, there is some movement over here. Still, there is some movement over here, as you see. It takes a while, as usual, in Kanheer models. The relaxation goes naive, no steps, but essentially, you get to the kind of patterns that were predicted in the theory for the biologist. Okay, great. As I said, let's go now to a little bit on the analysis to give you an idea what we have been doing. Been doing, just some of the basic results. Some people are thinking about just computing the steady states. Here, one thing that one can do, at least in one dimension, is to compute the steady states, not almost explicitly, but by assuming that you need to solve some second-order differential equations numerically. It's almost explicit. So, for companies supporting the steady states, States, you can find them by solving this system of elliptic equations and finding also the support as part of it. So it's a bit complicated. But if you assume in one dimension that you look for the supports, one embedded into the other in order, and you assume that you have the sum of the populations to be continuous at the boundaries and things like that. And things like that, like it's done in the non-local model, then you can recover the steady states by solving numerically certain second-order differential equations. So you can do some computations even explicitly in 1D that gives you some idea on that. But let me go then to the systems part. I'm taking advantage of the great inflow structure. So yeah, as I said before, here. As I said before here, the only point I have is just to say that there, this equation, I mean, the single equation resembles equations of that type that were studied some years ago. So I have here some lists, or probably I'm not sure if I have the full list, but some partial list of the references here. This equation were studied mainly by Bertozzi and Pugh in the 90s, and then Laughesen and Pugh. Then Lao Desen and Pio, at the beginning of the 2000s. And they studied already different ranges, for instance, in one dimension, what they call the subcritical cases when m is less or equal than m plus three. And in those cases where they were able to do certain things, I mean, global assistance, and they find some blow-up for supercritical cases when M is larger than. Supercritical cases when m is larger than m plus three. Then, lately, probably the other two papers that I want to put more attention are these two, which are the ones by Matthews, Macan, and Sauvere and Licini, Mates and Sauare, in which they studied equations of very much of the type that I have here, except that the Polish-Median equation in most of the cases was with the other sign, the positive sign. The positive side. So there were no competing mechanisms. Although you read very carefully their proof, one has to admit that they can push the proof up to some negative range, but not too much. I'll come back to that later. Okay, in any case, can we get advantage now of the gradient flow? So I will start with one simple equation, first of all, to understand why. First of all, to understand why there are some critical cases again in the game, and instead of giving me just the problem that comes from biology that would be with the sponge 2, I'm going to put a desponin n there. And I keep just a digital delay integral here. In that way, the equation I'm looking at is this equation. And as you know, it has the corresponding gradient flow structure with respect to this minus the intra rho to the n. Great. Great. Well, again, all the experts in the room will be thinking why the clinical, and probably some of them they have arrived already to this ponen. The clinical exponent is 2 plus 2 over d, and it comes just by arguments that you can do easily over the free energy in terms of scaling. If you just do a scaling of a given profile that preserves the mass, you really see clearly that the only way in which you can compensate the net. Which you can compensate the negative contribution with the positive contribution due to the D Luzzle interval, is that you have this relation that M is less than 2 plus 2 over D. And the critical case will correspond exactly to M, what I'm calling here Mc, 2 plus 2 over D, in which they exactly balance in terms of the scale. So this resembles very much. This resembles very much like Keller-Siegel model. Okay, and in fact, there is a lot of parallelism, not in the techniques, but in the kind of results that you can get. So M less than Mc You can think about it as the sub-critical case, M equals Mc. You have a critical case, and in fact, there is a critical mass, very much like in the Keller-Siegel model for chemotaxis. From where it comes, the critical mass. It comes the critical mass. So, I mean, you could think that the candidate was clear also in terms of the free energy, but it's what it is. It's a particular Gamerdo-Niedenberg inequality, for which you would like to know the critical, the Schar constant, and the Schar constant will determine the critical mass. But let's see how it goes. Essentially, what you need Goes essentially what you need is a Glenelian-Niedenberg inequality that relates you the LM norm with the L2 norm of the gradient and the L1 norm of the density, which is not in the family of the Go and Del Pino, but a different one. And well, I mean, for the sacritical case, then you play with that level of inverse of level of inequality, then you can compensate, then the negative part. Compensate then the negative part by the positive part to bound from below the energy, and then essentially you get something very similar what you do in Keller-Siegel. The fact that you have the bound from below on the free energy, and for free, you get also a bound on the L2 norm of the gradient. So that's like the first step if you want to do any analysis. You want to do any analysis on here. Let me just mention that for the critical case, that's the critical Galileo-Midden-Berray inequality, which has the right scaling to be used in this case. And that's the one that, in fact, we are using to get the Shark constant. In fact, these inequalities mentioned with the Shark constant. And with the sharp constant in one dimension, the papers of Ertozzi and Q already in the 90s, and they referred for the proof to a paper of Nagi in 1D. But then there is a recent paper by Yang Guo Liu and Jinghua Wang some years ago, 2017, in which they proved the inequality which are constants in all dimensions. And yes, sorry. Ah, yes. Sorry, the paper was by Nitaski, but not from Bertosi. In fact, in any case, so that's the inequality that gives you again the critical mass at that case. With respect to the comment I mentioned earlier on the paper by DC, Macan and Savare, if you just read very, very carefully everything that they do with the techniques that they do, since they don't realize about using. Inequalities, they can push it a little bit for negative m, but not too far, it doesn't arrive to the critical. Okay, uh, good. So, yes, well, I mean, again, I'm gonna give you some ideas of the main ideas of the proof without entering into details. What we do is to apply the JKO scheme and to prove that the JKO scheme is complete. And to prove that the JKO scheme is convergent, we construct global solutions for the sacritical case and the critical exponents, a critical mass. The kind of solutions that you would like to show are solutions that are good solutions in that sense. And essentially, these are the main steps. And there is nothing really new in the steps that we take in order to prove this existence. So they are the steps that. Assistance. So they are the steps that again most of the experts in the room will know how to attack the model once they realize about all of this. Probably the most important comment to make are how to take the bound from below in the case of the system also, and also how to get the good regularity that allows you to pass to the limit in these two terms here. Okay, so for that, So, for that, you need the flow interchange lemma, as introduced by Macan, Mathes, and Savare. And for that, you can what is what you can use? I mean, the formal computation is easy, and then you have to work with it to prove it for the JKO step, but the formal computation is to use the entropy. The entropy is what saves you here. There's a Boltzmann entropy because the evolution of the Boltzmann Entropy because the evolution of the Boltzmann entropy, if you do the formal computation just for that term, the rest that you can do. But that is the important term in which you realize why this is going to work. If you just keep the fourth order term, this is going to give you minus Laplace row squared, if everything can be done in this computation. And from that, this situation is where you are going to get your estimates on the H2. Okay. Okay, so that's just a quick summary of how you will pass to the limit. Because of that, you will be able to pass to the limit weakly in the Laplacian and strong both in the gradient and the density. And that's why you can pass finally to the limit there. Some of the techniques are written here. I don't think it's important to comment on that at this point. Okay, so what about the system? If I come back to the system now. System, if I come back to the system now, let's see we have several of these ingredients there. So if you go to the system, that's the free energy. The first thing that we need to see if we can bounce from below the free energy and we can get the gradients bounce from the free energy as in the sacritical case for one single equation. So essentially, you don't have to work that much. In fact, at the end of the day, you just End of the day, you just bounce from below by Cochin's part here in the product of the gradients, and then you rearrange things. And you use, obviously, strongly the ellipticity of the part of the fourth order terms. You use the fact that kappa is larger than alpha squared to choose a small epsilon in such a way that you can bounce from below the corresponding quadratic form that you have here for the grade. Quadratic form that you have here for the gradients that will give you the bounds that you need on gradient rho squared and gradient eta squared. There are more steps to do, it's just that in this way you reduce to the case of the sun free energy of very similar type for one of the density plus the free energy on the other density, and then you do the same trick as before. Then you apply Kochi, Galero-Niedenberg, and so on and so forth to balance this from below. So essentially, with this, you reduce to the So essentially with this you reduce to the one-dimensional free energies, I mean the one species free energies that I bound from below before. Okay, so this gives you the first step. And believe me, the second step with the entropy works exactly in this very same spirit. You compute the entropy of one plus the entropy of the other, then you do the algebra, then you use the electricity of the matrix with the electricity of the matrix, you reduce it. Of the matrix, you reduce it essentially to a very similar trick, but you can control again the Laplacian squares of the two densities. Okay, and the final three minutes, I just want to mention to you how to connect both worlds. So, this is a mistake. Sorry about the names here. That should be the one with. That should be the one with Charles, Elbar, and Jacob Kuba, in which we connect the two systems: the non-local system and the local conhelier. Okay, so the first thing that you need to do is to rewrite your non-local system in an appropriate way. So, believe me, this is just to rename the constants with respect to the first expression. The first expression that you saw with the gradients of potentials. And you see, I kept kappa alpha one the same here, while here I'm changing the constants because these are the ones that change. You just add terms of the corresponding to vorus medium type, add and subtract, and in this way you can write it like this. Essentially, every non-local term here is of that type. Of that type. Okay, that I prefer to see it in this way. So you have the density minus, I mean, the part that will be the convolution with the density with the profile omega. And you do this scaling. That's part of the assumption that we do. We assume that we have this scaling with one over epsilon square. The one over epsilon squared is precisely the idea like what I told you at the beginning, the formal expansion. The formal expansion and the formal Taylor expansion to be able to get as a first order when I do the Taylor expansion, this guy will kill this term, and I will end up with this assumption on omega, I will end up with the second order terms that will give me the Laplacian formally again. Okay, so the first step is just to rewrite it like this. And the second step is to realize that again, as I mentioned to you, this has a great influence structure, and I write it again. And I write it again in an appropriate way. So it's not the standard way with the convolutions of potentials, but I write it in that way that it's more helpful here. So in that, you see the corresponding non-local terms that corresponds to the regularized versions of the gradients are all of these terms and then the second order terms. So you realize that it has a good So, you realize that it has a good infrastructure, and again, you define the entropy in the same way as for the system. And this computation is just to tell you that you have essentially the same ingredients. If you just work at least at this point formally, you have the same ingredients. So, you have a dissipation. I mean, that's the gradient flow structure. And you can bump from below the energy. But I think I have the next slide if I have time. I think I have an extra slide if I have time. And also, you have dissipation of the entropy. And in the dissipation of the entropy, you get all these terms. Then, again, they resemble like the non-local version of the Hessians or the Laplacians. Okay? Good. So just to finish, I want to just mention two tools that we use in order to pass to the limit when epsilon goes to zero. limit when epsilon goes to zero and prove that that non-local system converges to the Kahilier one. One of them is a result of compactness by Burgund, Versis, Vironescu and Ponce that gives you some strong compactness in L2 of a sequence of functions under this bound on that kind of On that kind of non-local gradient, something like this, you want to think about it in that way, and also the other ingredient is a kind of non-local Poincaré, which is the reason why I haven't mentioned till now, but I mentioned now, is the reason why we work on periodic boundary conditions here and not in the whole RT or passing through the limit in the non-local, because it's the place in which we know how to do this, actually. We know how to do this, in fact, if not, we'll be able to do it in RD. But we will do periodic boundary conditions because we have this kind of non-local point carry, which is the ingredient that you use to bound from below the energy. Okay, that's what you use instead of the Carlero mini versus whole F as in the previous case in the whole F. Okay, so I hope you enjoyed. You enjoyed the talk, and as I said, it's just a summary of these three works. That one is to appear, and the other one is a preprint, and this one that very, very soon I hope we have it also on archive. So, thank you very much. Thank you, Gratemara, for the meeting hall. Antonio, for the business talk, any questions? So, actually, some of the non-mathematical question in terms of modeling, right? Well, when you started with these tissues, I expected that you would get a model, right, where it would be something like a phase field model for two phases, but are the density with more or less concentrated phases, right? That you get two tissue set for, you know, like in half period is a phase model. Whereas here, most of the mass is concentrated. Most of the mass is concentrated in this blob with empty space in between, and within blob the desk is not nearly constant. Would you prefer to have nearly constant desk human tissues and get a phase field like model in the limit biologically? It's a good question. We started with that. In fact, the biologists that we work with, I didn't put that reference in here, but we are working with a lab in Princeton that Ruth Baker has contact with. That Ruth Baker has contact with is the lab of Daniel Cohen. And precisely, this is an experiment of this guy. I didn't put it at the beginning, I didn't run it. That's tissue growth. That's the kind of experiment that they would like to have. So in fact, they want to have some space in between, let it grow, and then see when they meet. So they are interested in the interface. But once they meet, this is kind of a monolayer thing. Meet this is kind of monolayer thing, so it's almost a constant density in each of them once they meet and they arrive to steady state, but not before. So they're interested in the sharp boundaries. I mean, you see, they kind of, in fact, they were trying to reproduce patterns and tiles with this by tissue growth. So that paper is very interesting, this paper in life that they have. I would recommend to go and look at it because they try to recreate even eschers. Try to recreate even Asher's kind of paintings by tissue rolls. Maybe this related without just the channel. When you actually get emerging, right, and you have all this white space, which is empty, somehow the because you start a different blood, which is very important, is that they don't get close to each other, but they somehow segue. To each other, that they somehow segregate depending on the cases, yes, yes. So, so here is my question: Is that part of what is observed? Because that could be part of the choice of the potential that you are putting to do the rescaling in FCM. In other words, yeah, yeah, how you yes, no, I understand. The thing is, we thought in terms of it depends on your objective, it depends on the application and the spectrum. It depends on the application and the experiment that you want to do. So, you are thinking of a tissue growth or a tissue is already present, then you are almost on a fully packed region. So, it depends on the experiment that sucks. But it's occurred to me if you make up my saving list. You can do this with fractional diffusion. Fractional diffusion. Well, in some sense. And if you put something that doesn't console. That doesn't possibly have a doubt. You know, the shape of the potential, I did you see, the shape of omega is free here. I just have those assumptions. So you could play that omega is chosen in a way that looks like fractional diffusion because of the singularity of omega. But there is no reason why. I mean, the phi, the shape of the potential, you can think about it as the parameter in the model. About it as the parameter in the model, if you want to use it in practice, and you would like to find a good approximation of that in terms of the biology. In terms of the biological terms, that's where the modeling enters. And that is something that we are looking with in G cell, trying to have ideas how to estimate the shape of the potential in an aspect. Have you considered trying to do a probabilistic version of these results? Let's say like for other bright versions? Well, I mean, you know, um with the nonlinear diffusion, that's gonna be a bit more complicated. It's not gonna be like Robin motion, but something else. Some people have looked at uh that. Some people have looked at that. I don't know what the status, the full status is, but let me put it. Well, there are a couple of results. Another result by Oshinager with a non-linear diffusion. With the fourth order, it's going to be, again, more complicated. I don't think I ever seen anything with fourth order. But with a non-linear diffusion, yes. And I think that's essentially it. But no, most of the fourth order model. The fourth order model, I don't know how to recover them from the stochastics. Okay, so let's next pose Antonio again.
