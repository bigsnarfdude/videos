So now we are talking about the dimer model and Hamiltonian has a two-term. Yeah, the limiting case is very easy to study. If we choose the hopping t to If we choose the hopping t to be a positive value, then for the potential goes to positive infinite, we can find the Hamiltonian actually prefer to have a ground state which has a minimum number of flippable plaquette. When v goes to the negative infinite, then the ground state must have the maximum number of flippable plaquette. In between, there is a phase transition at v equal to t. This transition is called equal to t, this transition is called the RK point. In the continuum limit, we use the height representation to write a continuous field theory for the phase transition and the two phases. The Lagrangian of the continuous theory is a sign-Golden theory with a single height field, phi. So the Lagrangian has the derivative term and cosine term. So if we require this type of zito symmetry, we notice that the And we notice that Lagrangian describes a phase transition. If we tune the physical coupling of this quadratic derivative term, we can realize this phase transition. When rho is a positive value, then the height field phi tends to have a constant value. When rho is a negative value, then the height field is position dependent. Both cases correspond to the collominal phase and the stigma. To the columnal phase and the steiger phase. At the critical point, we enforce this quadratic term to be zero. And also, a previous study shows that the cosine term is actually irrelevant at the critical point. So it's very simple to write down the critical theory. It has a dynamical exponent equal to 2, and it's a free theory. This theory is Lipschitz theory to describe this RK point. Point. Now I want to use duality to study the theory, the whole theory. So as we know, the Sein-Golden theory can be due to the U1 gauge theory. The main idea is to map the boson current into the electric field line. Accordingly, the boson density is mapped to the magnetic flux, which is also the gauge invariant quantity. And in the dual gauge theory, we have the gauge transformation like this. Transformation like this. Besides those fields, we can find another object in the sign-Golden theory which carries non-trivial winding of this bosonic field phi. So this is the vortex in the bosonic theory, which corresponds to the electric charge in the dual U1 gauge theory. If we put the duality on the lattice, it's very simple to see the relation between the two. Between the two theories. So if we have the square lattice, then on the original lattice, the boson lives on the side. Then the boson current lives on the link. So this means the electric field lives on the link of dual lattice, dual square lattice. And the charge lives on the dual lattice side. The magnetic flux lives on the dual plaquette, also equivalent to the original lattice side. So because it's side. So because it maps to the boson density. Then besides all those ingredients of the mapping, there is another thing. So in the sign-Gonen theory, we have the bosonic creation operator. This corresponds to the instanton event in the Buwang gauge theory. This describes the flux creation process. And also the gapless mode in the sign-Golden theory when the cosine term is irrelevant. Irrelevant is that has the linear dispersion. This corresponds to the photon model in the U1 gauge theory. So, so far, we have all the ingredients of this mapping for the two dual theories. Then we can write down the Lagrangian for the dual theory. It's the normal Lagrangian for the electromagnetism with the instant term and the Gauss law constraint. If we modify the Gauss law to have to introduce the electromagnetism, Have to introduce the electric charge into the system, then we have additional charge coupled to the gauge field determining this Lagrangian. This is quite a general Lagrangian we can write. Then we want to use this duality mapping to understand the arcade point between the VBS phases. In terms of gauge deburrow freedoms, we can find the phase transition we talk about actually can be realized by tuning the Can be realized by tuning the coefficient of the E-square term. This means in the two phases on the two sides of the critical point, have different background E field. And also, the instant term is relevant in both phases, meaning the instant perliferate in both phases and form the gap the phases. So, this is another interpretation for the VBS phases. This seems a little bit redundant and not very straightforward for the VBS patterns, but we will see the duality, the stinking by duality is quite useful later. Now we consider a simpler case. If we forbid the instant on term, forbid the instant on event, this means in the launching we are not allowed to add the instant on term. Instant term, then we can realize such a phase transition between gapless state. Because the instantone no longer proliferates in both phases, then we have remaining gapless photon mode in both phases. So this is a transition between the different electromagnetism with background electric field. And we can do it to the bosonic language to see what it is. is. Now we can define the bosonic field as e to the i phi. The for freedom of instant on event means we impose a global UN symmetry on this boson number. And then the Lagrangian which we can get has this form without any cosine term. We can find the two find the two phases driven by this transition by tuning the coefficient of the quadratic term is actually between two condensates. So when the phase factor phi preferred to be a constant, then this is the zero momentum condensate, which is also the superfluid we are familiar with. When the phase factor is position dependent, then this is a finite momentum condensate. Finite momentum condensate. The momentum characterized this phase can be obtained by adding the marginally relevant term into the Lagrangian, and we can. Sorry, sorry, I thought the early studies by Ash Fing and Le Young says that the last term is such marginally relevant. That's why the RK Poet is a very fine-tuned critical poet, Diner Bob. This term is marginally relevant, right? I thought their conclusion was that this term is marginally relevant. Wait for a second. So the work by Ashley and Leon, they study the transition between VBS. VBS to VBS, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. With instant on the point. Well, instantone is irrelevant anyway, as RK point, right? So that shouldn't affect what you are talking about here. Yes, yes. The critical theory is the same. Alright, then that term should still remain marginally relevant. I mean, it should be the same as the I mean, it should be the same as their conclusion. Yes. You mean this term? The last term, the U-term, that you. Yeah, the U-term is marginally irrelevant. Yes. I thought it's marginally relevant. Relevant? Yeah, that's my impression. Well, I mean, we can make that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can check that later. Yeah, but yeah, this doesn't affect the result anyway. Because this this affected the value of Q. But, yeah. But yeah, we can so we can solve this, we can minimize the action to get the value of q. Okay, so far we play with this duality back and forth and we arrive to two puzzles. The first one is the critical theory and the article point actually has quadratic dispersion. has quadratic dispersion. So if we do map it to the vector gauge theory, we need to enforce the coupling of the E-square term to be zero, meaning the dielectric constant for the electromagnetism should diverge at the critical point. So this seems very unnatural to have a divergent quantity to describe some physical thing. And there's another puzzle study from originates from the Originates from the previous study that those people study the incidental operator at a critical point but at finite temperature. So they calculated the two-point function of this incidental operator. They found the two-point function is exponential decay in space by power law in time. So this behavior is weird because it can it It strongly indicates that there is a phase which is different from the total disorder phase at infinite temperature. So in order to resolve those puzzles, we map the critical theory into a tensor gauge theory to introduce more degrees of regions. Now let me talk about how to do the duality mapping from leaf shoes transition to the tensor. From the leaf shoes transition to the tensor gauge theorem. Okay, the main idea is very simple. We just write down the symmetric electric field as the word sheet of the boson current. So because it has two indices. And in this mapping, we keep the magnetic flux as the same as the boson density. The same as the boson density. Then we can solve the symmetric tensor gauge field, which is conjugate to the electric field. Then we can find the gauge transformation for this symmetric tensor gauge field. It means the Gauss law should give us vector charge. And then if we use those dual fields to write down the line, To write down the Lagrangian, we can get the E squared plus B squared, which is the which likes, which just the same as the ordinary maximum gene. And also, this theory has quadratic photon mode, which is the same as the, it should be, as the Lipschitz transition. Okay, let's put those duality mapping and those theory on the lattice. We can see the See, the dual gauge field and the E field lives on the original lattice as the boson degrees of freedom. The diagonal component lives on the site, and off-diagonal component lives on the plaquette. And the Gauss law, mm Gauss the Gauss la the the Gauss law of the vector charge theory give us the vector charge lose on the link of the original lattice. Use on the link of the orange lattice. And also, the magnetic flux is the same as the boson number second. Okay, things. So this is not the end of the duality mapping. So now we try to find the relation between two mappings. Since the Lipschitz transition can map to tensor gauge theory and also can map to vector gauge theory, then these two mappings Then these two mappings must have one relation. Then, according to the definition of the electric tensor field and electric vector field, we can find such a relation related by derivative. And we can draw the lattice and dual lattice and find the relative r relative location of those fields. Also, the tensor A tensor A field and vector A field is also related by some parts. Also related by some derivative. According to the Gauss law, in the tensor gauge theory and the vector gauge theory, we can find the relation between the vector charge and the scalar charge given by the vector gauge theory. This is the relative location of the vector charge and scalar charge on the original lattice and the dual lattice. So by solving this, So, by solving this, we can find that they have this type of relation. The vector charge is a derivative of scalar charge. And if we do integration on both sides of the equation in the whole bottom of the system, then we can find the scale. The scalar charge in that theory is actually carries the angular momentum of the vector charge. So it carries the same angular charge moment of the vector charge configuration of the whole system. So one unit of the scalar charge is a dipole of the vector charge. So if So if we schematically represent the vector charge as one arrow, then the scalar charge, we can represent it at like two arrows with opposite direction. So this is a very important relation we found by using the two dualities. By doing this identification of two mappings, we can find there are two We can find there are two types of charges in the tensor gauge theory. The one is the vector charge, it's a one-dimensional excitation. The other is a dipole vector charge, corresponds to the scalar charge, yeah, as I told before. So this dipole vector charge is fully mobile because we can create other charge pattern to let it move along both direction, x, y direction. XY direction. And in the Lipschitz theory, those two charges correspond to two types of vortices. The first type of vortex carries non-trivial winding of delta phi, and the second one carries non-trivial winding of phi. So by computing the angular momentum of the vortex 1, we can get it. we can get it doesn't carry any angular charge moment, but the vortex the second vortex carry non-zero angular charge moment. So this means the vortex the vortex one corresponds to the single vector charge and vortex two corresponds to dipole vector charge. Of course we don't need to do Of course, we don't need to do those things. We just match the index. We can match the two type of vortices to two type of charges in the tensor gauge theory. Also, let's study the instanton event of the tensor gauge theory. So it's easy to have the single instant on event, which is a creation of single flux. This corresponds to the both. This corresponds to the Bolson creation operator in the Lipschitz theory as the same as the mapping to the vector gauge theory. Then, if this term is relevant, then the incidental event is going to proliferate. And meanwhile, the dipole vector charge, this scalar charge, gonna confine in this situation. But besides this information coming, which we can Coming, which we can obtain from the mapping to the vector gauge theory. We have additional information by mapping to the tensor gauge theory. This is another type of instanton called dipole of instantones. This is nothing surprising. So because we can create a dipole of flux, this corresponds to the dipole of bosonic creation operator in the bosonic theory. Operator in the bosonic theory. If this operator is relevant, then the dipole of instant is proliferated and the vector char, the vector charge, single vector charge is going to confine. So how to see this? So notice this term is actually the Boson-Hopping term in the Lifts G's theory. If this term is relevant, we get the sign-Gordon theory with the quadratic term. This is the Quadratic term. This is the same as the ordinary superfluid, which can be mapped to the ordinary U1 gauge series. So the vector charge must be confined in this situation. Of course, we can do detailed calculation to get those behavior clue. Okay, let's see what's the physical consequence of this Of the discovery of those degrees of freedom. In short, the physical consequence is the new phase at the finite temperature. Let's look at the zero temperature first. At the critical point, the single instanton is not allowed or irrelevant at the critical point. So we don't need to consider it. So, we don't need to consider it anyway. But we can still compute the two-point function of the instant operator. It has the power law. And meanwhile, we can compute the interaction between the scalar charge, the dipole or vector charge. It scales at 1 over r. So there are well-defined, deconfined excitations in this situation. And about the About the dipole of instant tones, since we suppress the dipole of instant tone by doing the fine-tuning, otherwise we are not at the critical point. So we still don't need to consider it. And we can compute how the vector charge interact. Their interaction scale as log r. So this means actually the new information is not that important at zero temperature. We can use the ordinary U1 gauge series to understand. U1 gauge theory to fully understand the zero temperature behavior of the Leafschief transition. But finite temperature physics is a little bit different. Let's look at the information from the vector gauge theory first. The single instanton, they have the, if we compute the correlation function, they have short range correlation and also the scalar charge, they condense. They condense. This condensation will give us two facts. The one is the single vector charge become fully mobile in the background of those scalar charge. And also, the interaction between single vector charge should be modified by this background. But fortunately, the form of the interaction doesn't change. It still remains the log R. And besides, we can still. And besides, we can study the dipole of instantal event. This dipole of instantal operator has the power law correlation. This gives us some particular feeling of the quasi-long range order and reminds us the KT phase above the superfluid phase at finite but low temperature. Fluid phase at finite but low temperature. But differently, in the KT phase, the power scaling is given by the single instant operator. But here, our quasi-long range order is given by the dipole of instant operator. So this is why we call it axis on both liquid. Let me distinguish those concepts again. So we have several phases. Several phases need to be considered because they are similar to each other. So, the one is the KT phase. It's a finite temperature phase of 2D boson condensate. So, it has a quasi-long range order given by the single instant operator. And we also have infinite temperature phase, which is total disordered phase. And the exon-bosed liquid phase, as I said before, is different from. Before, it's different from both of them. It's like a KT phase of 2D exciton both condensate. Why? So there's exciton for the bose condensate because here we condense boson-hole pair at zero temperature. And at finite temperature, we give the KT phase of this condensation. So in that paper, actually, the scaling dimension is actually highly. The scaling dimension is actually highly UV dependent. Scaling dimension of what? That's a dipole creation operator. UV dependent, you mean depend on this the coefficient? No, depending on how you regularize this gradient on the lattice. That was a. You mean different lattice will give you different gradients? Yeah, yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um yeah, I think so. Uh would you explain yes because because there's like vector charge, this here yeah here this type of like derivative I think will affect the the like the form of the correlation. Because on the square lattice we have the delta x. We have the delta x, delta y, but on the honeycomb lattice, it will change somehow. Yes, previously, those people studied the exon-bose condensate phase. So they can stabilize this condensation as a phase because they, so the difference between, rather than the critical point, the difference between their phase and our critical point is that they don't have the diagonal. Diagonal hopping terms, meaning so this term describes the double hopping term on the same direction of the boson. So when they don't have this term, they can stabilize this condensate to be a phase. But in our case, we are at critical point has the relevant direction. So we can organize all of those informations in one table. Information in one table. So we list the behavior of this two-point function of incidental operator, two-point function of the dipole incident, and the dipole vector charge, vector charge. So here, I list all the behavior, corresponding behavior in three phases. We can see, it's very clear to see that the EVL phase is actually the boson whole pair of the KT phase of the of the KT phase of the boson whole pair. Because any behavior of the KT of the KT phase, we can replace the object from boson to boson whole pair and we get a behavior of EBL phase. So this is what we can find for these three phases. So since the EBL phase and the total disordered phase at infinite temperature are different phases, we expect Temperature are different phase, we expect a phase transition between them. If there is a direct and second-order phase transition, then it's likely to be described by this type of continuous field theory called vector coulomb gas theory. It's like the vortex on binding theory, but since the object has an index, so we need to consider the uh how does the index point in the space. Point in the space. So this theory was studied a long time ago, and it also described the melting transition by unbinding the dislocations. So the universality is a KT universality. Now schematically, we can draw the finite temperature phase diagram of this system. At zero temperature, there is a critical point between the finite momentum condensate and the superflow. Finite momentum condensate and the superfluid. And at finite temperature, there is a critical fan. So at low temperature, in the critical fan, there is an EBL phase expected to happen, distinguished from the disordered phase. So the EBL phase can be understood as the proliferation of the dipole back to charge, where the total disorder phase is a proliferation. Phase is a proliferation of both charges. Is that a sharp transition? Where? This one? Yeah. So if it has a phase transition and continuous phase transition, then we can have some still with this product, just like completing transition. So in what condition would it have a real transition? I think I I don't I don't I don't know how to like what condition forbids there is this yeah Because we naturally think that the vortex two type of voices they proliferate one by one at a different temperature so so it's like it's a temperature So it's likely to have this type of KT translation. Very naively. So, so what dimension is this system? Sorry? Oh, two plus one? Yeah. Yeah, I think in three plus one there could be a transition maybe, because I think three plus one, actually, if you have a, for example, a dipole conservation, you know, actually the low temperature EBL phase could be a quasi-lowering order. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. You have a quasi-long range order of the title correlation operator. But in two plus one, I think it's but two plus one has the KD phase, right? No, but but this is not KD phase, right? You're finding an analog of KD phase. Yes, yes. Right, I think that analog will appear in 3D. 3D. Yeah. And what type of first channel? Yeah, we can talk about later, but. Yeah, sorry. So, as I said, I expect this transition to happen by considering the two types of vortices. They proliferate one by one. So, therefore, there are two transition temperature, critical temperature. If we are very close to the quantum critical point, then the critical channel the then the critical the transition temperature to proliferate both vortex is larger than the transition temperature to proliferate only a dipole vector charge. So in this case we can find a finite range of EBR phase here. But away from the critical point very far, we cannot the proliferation of single vector charge is already at very high. Is already at very high temperature. So, this means we don't have the EBL phase extend that far. So, we can only find it close to the quantum critical point. Okay, so previous study forbids the instant on event. So, now we want to add it back. If we add it back, we still expect this type of transition happening, just the transition. Transition happens. Just the transition between BBS and high-temperature phase is not very clear to where it happens. But we still expect this to happen. So maybe in the future, some numeric calculation on the diamond model would verify the existence of the EBL phase. Okay, this comes to the, let's come to the summary. Let's come to the summary. So, in this talk, I talk about the Lifts transition mapped to the tensor gauge theory with vector charge. And by using more degree of freedom, we found two type of voltages in the bosonic theory, which we need to consider. Because by proliferating them, we can verify this new finite temperature phase for the Liechtenstein transition. And thank you for your attention. Any questions? So actually the concept of content is more south of compact. It's not the same concept for the ordinary U1 JD series, for the JPM4. For the HP example, this would be the concept of compactness for the HPOC for the symmetry tensor H theory. As far as I understand, I don't see this considerably short. Even though we seem convinced manual literature, people use the compactness. But what if the A field take zero to two pi value? Like like we choose the value to be compact. The value to be compared? Right on the latest or dealt with. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, like the mapping on the square lattice, they always have the A field to be 0 to 2 pi and E field to be integers. I think this can be satisfying. Do store some type of like uh topological objects or like a convexity. I guess that's a good idea. You mean for tensor gauge theory? The object you mean like the monopoles? So here I talk about 2 plus 1d. So the monopole is the instantone. Right? So here I can find the correspondence of the instantome event. But in general, like In general, like I yeah, this is not on my top of my head. There's some like typical construction of those things. For example, let's keep some U1Bs here. That's in triple. So we will say here some objects to decide here we want. So we have Wilson box. So Wilson lights are all options. Wheels and lights are warlocks of fight. Warlights are a warlock of the market. A lot of things you can be quite extraordinary. Oh, the anchor identity is something like that. I think I think this m can be done. Yeah, the the the like um but But I think there are more Bianca identities for the tensor gauge theory because there are more symmetry rather than the global U1 you have in the tensor gauge theory. But I didn't rigorously write down those equations, but I think it can be done.
