So, we all want to be home. I'm organizing this. This has been just so inspiring and fantastic. I want to take you all home with me. So, anyway, so I'm going to talk. So, I struggled too a little bit about what to speak about today, and I took the selfish route, which is giving you a smorcus board of all the things that are happening, sort of that I'm involved in at UCSD, and hoping that, and speaking about some modeling approaches that we've taken, hoping that I can expand my reach of people that we model. My reach of people that want to work with me. And everything I'm saying today is really the work of this fantastic team of students and staff, statisticians, and collaborators that I have. So just a little bit about me. So I work in what I'm going to talk about today is mostly about health behaviours and disease prevention. So sleep. I'm interested in sleep, physical activity, diet, etc. My early work, I did a little bit with measurement, error, and diet assessment, but then I realized that rate care. And diet assessment, but then I realized that Ray Carroll had already done everything. And so now I'm working in physical activity data, and I'm learning that that's also already been done. But anyway, I enjoy it. And I also have a life in omics, which I'm not going to talk about today. So a little bit about studies and on wearable sensors. So we have a study ongoing on sedentary behavior and interruption. So it's an RCT. And there's also an observational large cohort, which I'll say something about. The RCT is in progress, I won't say anything about it. I won't say anything about it. There is also, we've had several physical activity interventions, which I'll say a little bit about the data there. And then we have an ongoing grant to look at machine learning to classify postures, such as sitting, standing, moving. And that's actually work mostly done by some of my computer science collaborators. But I'll say a little bit about that book. So I don't think I need to say anything here. Everybody knows what output of an accelerometer looks like. The only point I want to make is something that Jennifer made, is that we used to just use That we used to just use thresholds, or we still use thresholds, and we classify minutes above or below some threshold. But there's information in this whole curve, and should we be using it? And so I'm going to say a little bit about functional data analysis. I know you've heard a lot about it and eloquently about different methods. And so my goal here is just to emphasize how useful it is, and also sort of a debt of gratitude to all the people in this room, many of whom have developed this methodology. I'll say a little bit about cluster analysis. I'll say a little bit about cluster analysis, the post-tele classification, and then about comparing sedentary behavior metrics. So I'm going to be jumping around different data sets and different methods, like I said earlier, so bear with me. I'll try to point out. So again, I'm also going to just hit the highlights of slides and not really talk about everything on the slide. So I think we've seen this before. We could treat the entire profile, the accelerometer profile, as a curve in space, in time. In time. And so we have a mean and then we have the functional decomposition. We get the scores. The CKs are the scores for each person, and the Ï†k's are the sort of pattern, the principal components, the eigenfunctions. And so we know that the patterns tell us the modes of variation, and the scores tell us how much each person subscribes to that mode. So that gives us information about each person's pattern. And so what I'm going to do is just apply this to one of our Do is just apply this to one of our data sets on physical activity. We had about 58% breast cancer survivors of this study. So these are the principal components, four of them, and they actually look a lot like what others have presented. So the first principal component is really about level shift. The second component is about contrast between sort of about getting up and moving. So if you're red, it's an added, so if you have a high score, so red is add. High score. So red is add, so the blue line is the mean, the red is adding one principal component, blue is subtracting one principal component. Oh, good question, good question. So we're just taking it, it's 12 hours from the start of where. So I need to register, so this is one of my questions. The start of where, so it's a different time for each of the. Yes, it's a different time for everybody, and we just truncate it after. Yeah, thank you. So time, x-axis is just functs. x-axis is just from the minute we know they start where to. And so this is Hipmoron exclamation, it's not 24-hour. And so anyway, so if you have a high score on the first component, you're generally more active than the average. If you have a high score on the second component, you're sort of a leader starter than the average. So that's the idea. So we looked at these. So you can do lots of things. Jeff has talked about functional regression. About functional regression, et cetera. And so here I'm just looking at something very simple, just looking at our cancer and our controls of this population. And so you can see that I'm just doing t-tests, so nothing fancy. So you can see that there's not much difference between the first and the third principal components. You know, the p-value is not at all significant. There's a slight signal maybe in the second and the fourth principal components. And so the PC2 was the component where we had a later start, right, or a slower start. And so the cancer control, cancer. And so the cancer control, cancer population generally has sort of a slower start to their slower start after they start wearing their accelerometer to the controls. But the main point I wanted to make from this kind of analysis is that if you just looked at the metrics, which were over-the-day metric, you actually don't see any difference. So if you just looked at MBPA, which is the minutes above some threshold, they both have roughly 18 minutes a day. And if you look at center, 18 minutes a day. And if you look at cemetery time, alas, it's much longer. But they're both around 440 to 450 minutes a day. So, what's nice about this principal components idea is that you actually manage to gather, you can get some temporal information which might help you intervene. So, if I'm interested in the cancer survivors, maybe I should be doing something earlier to increase the activity. It tells me something about the population temporally. So, these data, of course, are much more complicated generally, and we've heard, again, lots of great talks from Again, lots of great talks from Jeff and Hao Chung about the nested level, and I think Irina also. So there's nesting, so usually we have multiple days for each person, and so there's multi-level data, and there's again beautiful work by several people here in taking into account this nesting. But you can play the same game, you can still decompose the signals into principal components. The signals into principal components. So you have the person level and then the visit level deviation from the person level. And again, the names here, I think most of the people whom this work is attributable to, we've heard from in these talks today and yesterday and over the week. So anyway, so we applied this to one of our data sets, just an overweight group. And you can see, so my main point in this is that you can do this, and there's wonderful research out there. And there's wonderful research out there. There's subject deviations, which convey some of the information, but I think what's more telling, and I'm just giving you a piece of the information, a piece of the output here, is that the visit level deviation is also very informative. So you can understand how much visit level deviation there is. And that maybe gives you a lot of information about the patterns of behavior in individuals. So I'm going to switch gears. That's it for principal components. And my goal here wasn't to say anything methodological. My goal here wasn't to say anything methodological except that it's fantastically useful. So, I want to switch gears. This is now a different study. It's actually the study that Amy referred to. It's called the OPAC study. It's a sub-study of the Women's Health Initiative study. And my collaborator at UCSD Anne Villa Croix is the PI. And so this is 6,000, so this is now switching gears to sedentary behavior. There are 6,000 older women. They wore the accelerometer for up to seven days. For up to seven days, at least ten hours a day. So, sort of, we discussed about what valid wear means. They had about six years of follow-up. So, what we did is we used the accelerometer output, and just the cut point, and it's hip-horne accelerometry, so I'm slightly relieved to hear from John that it's also unbiased. And we clustered participants based on their center trajectories. And the way we did this is we kind of did this two-phase clustering. We kind of did this two-phase clustering. First, we clustered days, so by hour of sanitary time per day, and then we clustered participants. So pictures are probably going to be much more clear. So what we have here is on the left are the day clusters, and we just used k-means over the day. So we had, and we used usual sorts of statistics to derive optimal number of clusters. So the y-axis is the number of minutes in that hour that the person is sedentary for that day, right, and at that time. At that time. And the x-axis is again hours of where. And then we started at zero and we went to, I think it was 14 hours for this study. And so the left one, then, so it says that there's kind of a red pattern up here is kind of the most sort of sedentary throughout the day. So LS, everybody's sedentary time seems to increase over the day. The pattern seems to suggest increasing. But this is the most sedentary day. This is sort of the least sedentary day, and there are two in between in how they accumulate their patterns. So this is a pattern. Their pattern. So, this is a pattern where they're more sedentary. The blue is more sedentary in the morning, the earlier part of the day, and then less so, earlier part of their wear, and then the green is sort of the opposite. They're less sedentary in the earlier part of their day. And then what we did, so if I did the study, I might have two days of the red and three days of the purple, and a couple of days of the blue and green. So, what we did is we looked at the proportion of days of each cluster, and we did a hierarchical clustering on that. And we did a hierarchical clustering on that, so that we get a subject-level cluster. And so that's what these are. So this B and C are, so the x-axis on B, of course, it's ordered, is participants from 0 to 6,000, and the y-axis is the proportion of each type of cluster. So this is the left, the cluster one is kind of predominantly red. These are people who have most of their days are sedentary days, sedentary, follow this pattern, lots of sedentary minutes in each hour. And the purple pattern is one that's. And the purple pattern is the one that's the least. And then the in-between two are a combination of whether you're more sedentary earlier versus later. And so then you can look at these clusters. So we had, this is a big study. So we had roughly around 1500-ish, plus or minus, in each cluster. And so we looked at an outcome. And this is just sort of just to look at it. We can look at different outcomes. We actually have mortality here. We haven't looked at it yet. We haven't looked at it yet. But the idea here was: so, there's a lot of information here. I'm going to just try to condense it towards what I think is useful. So, there's, so the left, so we stratified by MBPA because there was a different effect of sedentary time on the outcome. So, the outcome we're looking at is physical functioning over time. So, we have six years of follow-up, so looking at physical functioning. And we're looking at association between the sedentary cluster, moving four clusters. The sedentary cluster moved by four clusters and longitudinal physical functioning stratified by MVPA. And so, what you can see is that the red cluster mode is sort of the most sedentary cluster. And so they, and y-axis is physical functioning, higher is better. So they generally have worse physical functioning and they decline. What to us was interesting is, if you look at the low MBK group, that they all start off kind of similarly, but the green group seemed to have... The green group seemed to have the sharpest decline. It's actually, if you could test it, it's actually more than, it's a steeper decline than the red group. And the story is somewhat similar for MBPA, although it's, for the higher MBPA, generally mitigates the effect of some of the physical functioning deficits. So this is sort of interesting to us, mostly because we thought, well, the green group is sort of the group that does their activity. Is sort of the group that does their activity actually is less sedentary in the morning, in the earlier part of the day. So that was kind of interesting. So, is there some latent subgroup? Again, it's hard to draw any causal inferences here, so I won't claim any causality. But it still was sort of interesting to see that there was a difference in pattern based on, even though the blue and the green groups have essentially the same sedentary time over the day, their pattern of decline was different. I know it's hard to characterize, but can you say something about how different the Can you say something about how different the classes were with respect to the amount of sanitary time? Yeah, so we have that. I have that here. We did control for total sanitary time, actually, in this analysis. So we controlled for a whole bunch of things. I can tell you that. I think on average, the total sensory time was around 10 hours, 600. And I think it varied some, but not hugely. So it's mostly the cluster chain, mostly patterning differences. Yes, patterning. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, thank you. Good question. And we've controlled for comorbidities. We've controlled for comorbidities, and this is a huge data set with lots of stuff, and we've done a bunch of sensitivity analysis. I can speak more offline here. Okay, so that's it for clustering. So I'm going to move now to another study and another analytic approach. So this is an ongoing study, and this is a little bit of a cartoon picture, and it's lots in there. So I'm going to talk about posture classification. So this is the machine learning study that I'm involved in. Study that I'm involved in. And the goal is posture prediction using accelerometer data. So, what this is, is this is seven days of wear. The circle part of the valid days of wear. So, think of this as sort of a little bit of a cartoon. The solid stuff is the active PAL-derived posture. So, red in the background, alas, which is most of it, is sitting. The kind of turquoisey one is moving, stepping. And the darker ones, the darker, this is just standing. Darker. This is just standing. And so that's the data. And what we've overlaid is, again, this is the cartoon part: the squiggly part is the vector magnitude accelerometer data in there. And then we have a whole other bunch of things. I'm not going to get into those bars, but it has to do with sleep and non-wear and et cetera. Maybe I missed that. Is this hip or wrist or? This is, okay, it's a good question. So this is hip one accelerometry, but the active pal is on the thigh. So it's an influenometer, right? High. So it's an inclinometer, right? So it tells you what your angle is. So the solid stuff is coming from the active path. And is this the active graph, or was it a different GTA? Yeah, it's a GT3X. Because the active graph has its own posture estimation. Okay, we didn't use that. This is active pal, which is supposed to be our ground truth. I think Yarek said it's sort of an alloyed ground truth, but that's what we're using as our ground truth. So our goal here was to. So, the goal here was to train our model using the actograph, so the exferometer, to predict the postures using the implanometer, the actopal as our truth. So, I'm going to say something about the machine learning, but it's really not my area. So, I'll tell you the results, but any questions about it, please ask Andrew. So, that's a joke, quite easily. That's a joke, quite easy. We're all flattering. We're not flattering. So, anyway, so the way we conceptualize this is we thought of this as a three-dimensional. So, it's actually tri-axial, and we actually have 30 hertz data here, so that's why I told you that was sort of a cartoon, what I showed you. So, we can think of this as a time series with a mean, a seasonal component, S, and volatility. And I just wanted, and I think Jarek had a picture that was very similar to this. And so, again, it's repeating. And so, again, it's repeating, so it's a nice thing about going to the end. Everybody's shown you everything. But the main point I want to make here is that when you're sitting, it's very flat and there's no volatility. There's a clear, there's a sort of periodic component to stepping. And the standing is sort of in between. There's some volatility. So that's one piece of information. And it's also clear that there's some change. So within each posture, the means is sort of roughly the same, but constant. Roughly the same, but constant, but for each person. But when you go across clusters, especially from sitting to standing or stepping, there's a shift. So I have a collaborator in the maths department who, a graduate student actually, who came up with this idea that maybe we should use a change point approach. And so again, we've heard about this from several others as well. And so I'm going to say a little bit about what he's done, about his approach, and then I'll. About his approach, and then I'll also say something about the machine learning approach. So, what he did is he segments the time series using the change points. So, within each interval, the posture is assumed to be constant. And so then, so that's for the first step. Then, he derives a feature vector from the ectography in that interval. So, for example, it could be mean, median, quantiles, standard deviations of the ectography in those intervals. And then you build a In those intervals. And then you build a classifier for each posture: sitting, standing, moving, from that. And I think you used a random forest classifier. And then, so what it turned out is that, so this slide, so we were hoping we could just stop there and we'd be done. But it turned out, and I think several have alluded to this, in fact I think I think John, you mentioned it too, is that it's very hard to separate out the sitting versus standing behaviors from in this in this kind of work. So so we In this kind of work. So his model did really well in separating sitting or standing from moving. It did very good accuracy, but he couldn't do this. But what we realized is that we can exploit the fact that the mean is different from sitting to standing, the mean and the actigraphy signal. So we use that. So this is, by the way, totally preliminary work we haven't even thought about publishing yet. There's still a lot of work to do here. But that's the idea, is to use the mean shift. To use the mean shift. And I think the cool thing is that the mean for standing is very similar to the mean for stepping. So if you have a good classifier for the stepping part of it, what you can do is you can get the mean for the stepping part because you're confident in it and use that as your standing mean to build a test to say, is this interval that I'm not sure whether it's sitting or standing really, which one is it based on the mean? So that's the idea. On the knee. That's the idea. Is that because the orientation of the hips is sort of similar when you're standing and walking? But it changes when you're sitting? Is the poor classification? Oh, the change in. That's a good question. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, I don't know. So the acceleration is similar for walking and stepping. That's what you're using as the mean. The mean. Mean acceleration. The mean. The mean over the across the three axes. Yes, across the three axes. Yeah. So there's actually some all kinds of problems with orientation of this data set, which I'm going to gloss over. So, okay, so this was the idea. And so we also applied kind of this deep learning CNN approach that our computer science collaborator worked on here. And so this is very much. And so, this is very much pilot data. Our plan is, of course, to apply this to a, and actually that work is also in progress in a larger cohort, which is actually what the grant was funded to do. And so we had, so this is just pilot data, and I'm just showing you the results. It's all work in progress, but you can see that the change point model had about an 80% accuracy. This is test accuracy. This is 28 people. I think we had all the model was developed on 22 and test. Developed on 22 and tested on 6. And CNN did very well, but this is very, this is kind of a proof of concept early analysis. So we have work in progress. Our CNN collaborators incorporating these time series basically approach. So it's got a bi-long, short-term memory component that they've added to it. And we're also looking to improve our change point approach. And so my last, so that's it for that project. My last project thing I wanted to put in, I just put this in because. Thing I wanted to put in, I just put this in because we John and I were talking, John was talking about having label data and validity. And so I just, so this is, don't take too much away from this, except all we were trying to do here is just comparing a bunch of different sedentary metrics. So the first one is just total sedentary time, time spent in bowels over 30, et cetera. And just comparing the odds of ratio, odds of predicting obesity versus not, using both the Active PAL and the ActiveGraph. And so you can see that. And so you can see that there's differences in the estimates, in the point estimates. And I think this brought up this point to me, which John had mentioned about coming up with calibration models. You know, it's a measurement error and calibration models to calibrate the hectography to the active path, assuming the active path is a round truth. But a measurement error analysis, you don't have to assume that, right? You can just assume there's some latent truth. And so that might be food for thought to work on. So I think that was my last. Um so that's I think that was my last technical slide. Oh, I have I'm I'm a bit of a Johns Hopkins groupie. So Giawe has this really nice uh paper on again, you probably have all seen this, but what was very fantastic for us was that this idea that you could do this two-step modeling where you had this probability of activity at any given minute. So that's probability of engaging in MVP at any given minute. It's a little bit like what Jennifer was talking about. Bit like what Jennifer was talking about. So that's you first model the probability, then condition on the person being active at any given minute. So here they're not act, they're not engaging in MVPA, here they are. You can model associations with the actual continuous MVPA kind of thing. So that was sort of the idea. And what was fun is, so this is another student of mine worked on this for one of these rotation, we have rotation projects, like little independent studies. And so what's cool is you can. And so what's cool is you can get all these very cool graphs from this. So the top part is the log-odds ratios, the logistic regression, the probability part, and the second part is the modeling the continuous MVPA conditional being active at that time. So anyway, so I won't say much about this, but again, just to say that this is a cool approach. And what's nice is you can sort of see that when it's below zero, it means the probability of engaging in MBPA is. Is so the odds of engaging in MVP is less than the odds of not engaging in MVPA because it's a log odd is negative versus positive would be the odds. So again, you get sort of this time-varying effect that you can see when people are active or not. So I think that's it for the technical part. Thank you for listening. So a lot of these questions have been brought up, and I think people have come up with great solutions. So I need to follow up, and I'd love to continue some of these discussions. But some of the things that we've Of these discussions, but you know, some of the things that we struggled with is code registration device drift. So, when you have two devices, you know, one of them sort of drifts off a little, and so that's something that we've struggled with. We've tried to align things. Sometimes we can. Sometimes we don't know what to do. We just, you know, either we discard it if it's too bad, but I'd love to have help knowing what other people do. The orientation of the device, the active PAL is not a problem. It's taped on, but the hip-horn accelerometry is a problem. Although, you know, in one of our Although, you know, in one of our studies, actually, they wore it on a belt and it was taped. So I think that was good. And even within a person, you can have variation in orientation. So one day they wear it up, and one day they wear it down. So even within a person, it can be tricky. Varying device wear times, we talked about that a little bit. And then the 24-hour day, and I think a couple of people mentioned compositional approaches, but I'm really interested in learning more about those as well. And then time, and I think what would be really helpful, especially for And I think what would be really helpful, especially from a group like this, is coming up with some sort of best practices. And I think those are well underway from hearing from about the ARC Consortium. And then NHANES has a bunch of tools up there. So I think that's great. And of course, communicating all this to our collaborators. So I'll stop here. So this is just my students and staff who are all responsible for most of this work. I have wonderful collaborators. Arun Kumar, just two names to point out. Arun is the computer scientist. Is the computer scientist, faculty member who's involved. And Jaclyn Kerr is the person who actually got me into this field. So I owe a debt of gratitude to her for engaging me in a bunch of these studies. And of course, there's funding, and it's obligatory that I tell you, show you a picture of San Diego. You can do that now. So please come visit us. Thank you. What a wonderful session. Thank you so much, Doc. Thank you for listening. Are there any questions for the last speaker? Please, can you tell us more about how you segment or transfer? How you stop the point or transaction? Yeah, so it's a very good question. So for the first, so when we are training, we actually know the intervals, right? So for that part, because we have the ground truth, so that's what we do. So for the other, for the other So for the other, for the second part, we basically did a bunch of different things. So when you don't have to run through and you just have a time series, we used this method. So I think it's in a package actually. So we used two. So we actually tried to use the multivariate time series, which actually looks for changes in the marginal distribution. And it actually picks up, it has lots of false discoveries. But as it turned out, it was okay for us. It didn't matter too much. For us, it didn't matter too much. Because afterwards, because we have multiple steps of our predictions. But then we, it was computationally huge. On a 40-core machine, a 10-hour interval took, I don't know, like several, like three hours. And we're going to have thousand people who study VMs. We couldn't do that. So we then started looking at just a single, so using vector magnitude or just one of the axes. And that's much faster. But again, those are the sorts. Faster. But again, those are the sorts of things we're trying to improve. Because that's a key point, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So finding the change points. Yeah, so it actually, we get false discoveries. We get too many change points. But that's actually okay because we're doing the smoothing later. So it doesn't matter as long as we're capturing enough. Any one more question? Not less than all the speakers. And Angel, uh I apologize.
