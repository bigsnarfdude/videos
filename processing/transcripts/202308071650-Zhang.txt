Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank Professor Mei for the very kind introduction. And also, I would like to thank Professor D and the committee, Professor Pan, for the kind invitation, for giving me the opportunity to give a talk here. And today I will talk about the work in John's with Professor Yao Chen Li and also Professor. Professor Yao Cheng Li, and also Professor Pen Chu in Fudan University. And that's Rongzhen, post-doctor in Shanghai Jiatong University on the non-uniqueness problem for some free models like the hypertensive Navy-Stokes equations. Okay, by the way, I will try to speak as fast as I can to save time for the dinner. Okay. Okay. So we consider this is a famous 3D now with Stokes equations under the incompressible condition. Okay, so here V is the velocity and also P is the pressure. So today in many talks, many experts have already shown these equations. And also here we consider a closely related equations, a so-called 3D hyperdeceptive. Called 3D hyperdeceptive NS equations. So, hyperdeceptive here means that surface cost the exponent alpha can be larger than one. And particularly, we will be interested when it is larger than the Leonzy exponent. So, in 1934, in this paper, Larry proved the famous result that there exists global weaker solutions in Georgia. Global weaker solutions enjoy the following properties like the regularity in the energy space, the energy inequality, and also partial regularity, which means that there exists a singular set. Outside this singular set, the solution is very smooth. And this singular set is very small in the sense that one-half of her stop measure is zero. So after this work, So after this work, since then there have been extensive results devoted to the web postness and also E-Postness problem to the re-hopeful solutions. So, and this is one famous open problem in the fluid equations. So, below, I will list some existing results related to our work. So, let's first see the positive results. Well, due to Result. Well, due to the well-known results by Leons, the hyperdecipitative NS equation is well posed in the energy space if the viscosity exponent is larger than 5 over 4. So this exponent is also called the Leonz exponent in our talk. And then another condition to guarantee the web posting is a so-called LPS condition. so-called LPS condition, which means that actually any weak solutions in this space, L gamma L P space are automatically unique regular solutions. And if the exponent gamma and p satisfy this condition, moreover, there are also many results devoted to study NS equation in the critical space like Lebigger L3. The bigger L3 space due to Katu, and also lack the BMO dual space due to Koch and Tataru. Another well-known result is by Cavaradi, Kohn, and Niernberger showed exist Larry solutions with a singular space-time set of zero host of H1 measure. And this result was recently extended to the hyper-deceptive NS equations by Chrome. For NS equations by Cloneboard, Dalis, and Mazar Cecy. So, all these are the positive results. And here, it might be interesting that in order to establish the varposias, maybe these spaces seem very different, but behind these spaces, actually, they are closely related to the scaling of the equation. And for example, the energy space, CTL2 space. The energy space, the CTL2 space, is a critical space when alpha equals to the Leonzy exponent. So here one can also see the meaning for the Leonzy exponent, why this value comes out. And moreover, by simple calculation, one can also find if one are interested in this L gamma W S P space, then the critical relationship is that the exponent gamma P S satisfies this identity. LPS certifies this identity. In particular, if s equals to zero, then it is exactly the LPS condition. Okay, besides the well-post-ness results, in recent years, there are several progress towards your post-NIS result. Like in 2019, Bogamas and Vicosi proved there exists non-unique weak solutions to 3D Navistok's equation. Two 3D Navistokes equations in the energy space. And the CM method is mainly based on the intermediate convex integration, which was introduced. Convex integration was introduced to OLI equations, and also it proves successfully to solve the flexibility of the on-site conjecture. And it also proves very successfully in Professor Fraser's talk. In Professor Fraso's talk, thank Professor Fraso very much to introduce, also to introduce the convex integration in this conference. Okay, and move on. So for hyperdecibility for novice stoic equations, this equation is your post if the exponent alpha is less than the Leonzy exponent. So from, and this results were first proved by Lowe and Was first approved by law and TT, still by convex integration method. And here one can see that the Liancy exponent is actually the sharp viscosity value for the webinars in the energy space. Correspondingly, there are also your positives results for the 2D hypotenuse neural stoke sequence by Lua and Qi, and also recently, one of the most important And also recently, one important result is proved by Professor Ketkidofu also here, and also by Rochelle Yutao. She proved the non-uniqueness in the L gamma, L infinity space for any gamma less than two. And I would like to mention that this result is sharper in view of the LPS and critical LPS condition. Okay, at last, I'd like to mention another non-unique use result, also recently, very recently proved by Al Britton, Brew, and Crumble, where they showed that, okay, in all these above previous results, the non-uniqueness is for weaker solutions. So, weak is in the distribution sense. But in this papers, they can prove the non-uniqueness of Larry solutions. Our resolutions for 3D Navistokus equations with a particular force intent. So, here, so with a false intense open problem, your post-ness will happen for the very helpful solutions. And this method actually is very different from the previous method. Actually, it's based on the spectral instability. But today, our talk will mainly based on the confidence. Will mainly based on the convex integration. Motivated by this progress, we ask ourselves in the seminar hosted by Professor Li, whether, so first, due to Leon's vibrance result, when one knows that usually the high deceptive can help to get vibrance. However, we ask ourselves that even in this high deceptive regime, is it Deceptive regime: Is it still possible to find the non-unique and non-rehelpful weak solutions? This question actually is also related to the second one. It is inspired by Professor Keik's Kiddofo and Ross work. So, in view of the generalized LPS condition, is it still possible to find the non-unique wheel solutions in the LPS? In the L gamma WSP space, if the exponents are in the supercritical regime, furthermore, inspired by CATU and Kohatataru's results, so for critical space, one has the local web person's result. But so, one natural question is that do there exist non-unique weak solutions also in the supercritical space, CTX space, where CTX space, where X might be the Lebiga basal or even triple spaces. So these questions actually motivate our work. And our main result actually gives a positive answer to these three questions. So here we consider the equation in the weak sense, that is in the distribution sense. And we mainly focus on two supercritical regimes. two supercritical regimes where the where the exponent gamma sp satis these two can this satisfy this condition or this condition okay maybe it is quite complicated when we first meet this condition but it might be interesting to note that so the borderline of the first superclutter regime contains the one LPS endpoint Endpoint and subordinate of the second supercritical regime contains another LPS endpoint. We draw one picture where S equals to zero, and one can see this picture. So the supercritical regime A1 and A2 are exactly the blue-colored parts in this picture. So we see that, for example, So we see that, for example, for A1, its endpoint is actually this value, which corresponding to the, which corresponding to CTX Lebesgue space. And if alpha equals to one, it is exactly the cartoon space. Another endpoint is this one. The endpoint of the second regime. And here it's the endpoint space is this one. And both we call it. And both we call it endpoint because it is the endpoint of the classical LPS condition. This black line. So our main result in one word, in one sentence, is just that non-uniqueness happens in this blue color path. Okay, more precisely, for any given smooth dimensions-free and mean-free vector field, there exists the vector field. Exists the vector field U and a good set G, such that this vector field is a weak solution, has the same initial data with a given vector field. Moreover, it lives in the mixed biggest space, and if we restrict it to this good set, it is smooth. And this good set is actually very large in the sense that it's complex. In the sense that its complement is very small, has very small hostoff dimension. And this eta star can be any small given, a priori given. Okay, furthermore, the constructed solutions can be close to the given solution in the sense that their temporal support can be close to each other and also they can be close to each other in the mixed biggest space. So So, because the chance of the given vector field is very flexible, given any flexible field, we can construct this solution. So, one immediate consequence is that we have some non-uniqueness in the mixed Lebric space. And in particular, this non-uniqueness is in the strong sense, as in the sense of the paper by Professor Keskido for Andelo. Professor Keskido and the law said any weak solutions to the hyper distributive NS equation is not unique. Another consequence is that so another special case is that if we take gamma equals to infinity, then we immediately come to this level. That is, we have the non-uniqueness for the CTX space, where x can be any of the X can be any of the following three types of supercritical spaces, like the Lebesgue space, the basal space, and also the triple space. Furthermore, it also holds a strong viscosity and vanishing viscosity limit. So here I would like to thank Professor Ten in turn already. In Chen already, Professor Chen already shows us his deeper result on vanishing viscosity limits. Here, we also have some corresponding results constructed by the convex integration method. So, which means that given any solutions, weaker solutions to the OLI equation under the incompressible condition, one can find a sequence of weaker solutions, which converges strongly to the given. Strongly to the given OLR solution if the viscosity vanishes. Okay, so these are two main results in our paper. And let me give some comments. So first comment is that, so here, as we already see that the first question is about the beyond the Leonzy exponent. And we already see that the Leoncy exponent is a sharp. The Leonzi exponent is a sharp threshold for the web postnias. So, actually, when we study this problem, we check many literatures. In many literatures, when one talks about if alpha is larger than five over four, it's just the one sentence. Okay, so NS equation is well posted and get it finished. But here we see that once we talk about the way. We talk about the well-posedness even beyond the Leoncy exponent. Actually, we shall be very careful about the space, which means that actually in this energy space, it is well posted. It is no problem. It is right. However, if we enlarge this space slightly, enlarge it slightly, even slightly to the supercritical mix the bigger space, then the uniqueness will fail. And in particular, one space. And in particular, one special case is alpha equals to the Lyons exponent. Then in this case, uniqueness would fail in the CTLP space for any p less than 2. And this result is actually sharper due to the Leon's while post-ness result. Comment is about the regularity. So, this comment just means that one picture here is that, so Leon's result tells us there is. The result tells us CI exists one unique Larry solutions. And if we consider a very small tube around this Larry solutions, and this small tube is measured in this space, then actually, even in this small tube, there will exist infinitely many weak solutions around the unique resolutions. And all these solutions will have the same initial data with. We have a single initial data with the largest which, yes, please. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you very much. Yes. Okay. So here alpha is larger than 5 over 4 and that's strictly less than 2. Okay, so and these weaker solutions actually Solutions actually is very close to the Larry solutions and is smooth outside a very small singular set. So, third comment is about the non-uniqueness at the LPS endpoint. Actually, our work is mainly, as mentioned above, our work is mainly inspired by Professor Keskidofu and Rose paper. So, here, our non-uniqueness results. non-uniqueness result actually provide us a non-uniqueness for two LPS endpoints. So these are the endpoints. Also interesting to notice that so actually to our best knowledge, corollary tool appears to provide us the first non-uniqueness, non-unique weak solutions for hyper solutions for hyperdeceptive nowistox equations in CTX space, where x can be the Lebesgue, Besof, and the triple spaces. And so now uniqueness is sharper in the Lebesgue and the Besof space due to the previous existing web postness result. I would like also to mention that the non-uniqueness in the Beso space also complements the previous your post-ness result. The previous year post-NIS results proved by Professor Keskidofu and also Professor Dai, we are seeing proved the norm inflation instability in this paper. Normal inflation instability is actually another type of Europosness. So your postness in base of spaces. And this is a phenomenon that CCO post. And this phenomenon, CCO post phenomena, also happens for distributive equations, like for the non-linear shooting, like for the non-linear shooting equations. In this paper, in juncture with Bourchia, we proved the norm inflation for the first order nonlinear shooting equations with a quintic nonlinearity. Don't worry. So, as a last So, at last, I'd like to show some further works. And so, just now we see some non-uniqueness results for now-stokes equations. And recently, we also obtained some progress for the MHD equations. And it should be mentioned that MHD equation is very different from the NS equation. For example, the intermediate. For example, the intermittent jet for NS equation are not applicable to MHD equations. So this actually requires us to construct new intermittent flows to respect the particular geometry or MHD equations. And in this paper by Bicky, Bogomas, and Vico, they first constructed intermittent flows for ideal MHD without the Labrashing. Lablashing. So, the flows constructed in their paper has 1D spatial intermediency, which, however, cannot control the difficult Laboratory term. So, in this paper, in joint with Professor Li and Zhen, we construct new intermittent flows, which have 2D spatial intermittency and plus 1D temporal intermittency. So, together, this intermittency. Together, this intermediary can control the Labrador and give us the non-utignance by convex integration method. Another remark is for the hypert CPT4 MHD equations, where we also proved the non-uniqueness at one LPS endpoint space together with the partial regularity. And furthermore, we also considered, we also try to understand the non-uniqueness for compressible. For compressible fluid models with viscosity. So, this is the result that proved in this paper that the non-uniqueness also happens in this class of solutions. And I would like to use this opportunity to mention that actually the compressible fluid model is very different from the incompressive model. Model. One bigger difference is that for the compressible model, the pressure turn cannot be removed simply by the reprojection. Actually, for incompressible Navier Stokes equations, for example, actually, the pressure contains a very large error, very large error during the iteration argument. But in that case, the system can be just removed back. system can be just removed by the reprojection but for compressible models it is not free it is not free so in every iterative step we have one should be very careful to control this pressure and this in turn requires us to construct new intermittent flows for both the density and the momentum and in this paper the fetch or Fature of the intermittent flow is that it is homogeneous in space, but inhomogeneous in time. Now we are also working on the stochastic MHD equations driven by Wiener process. And we try to prove the non-uniqueness over probability strong and analytically weaker solutions. Analytically weaker solutions. This is also related to one open question in the SPD field to construct the global existence or probability strong solutions for fluid models. It's mainly based on two stages. One is a growing stage inspired by the proof of the on-site conjecture. Of the on-site conjecture. And another stage is a convex integration. And which just which, roughly speaking, it means that one consider a relaxed now is to talk to the renode system and try to show that this additional renoded term converges to zero. And this is obtained. This is obtained and quantitized in these five iterative estimates. Five iterative estimates. And in order to obtain these five iterative estimates, one needed to control suitable velocity increment. And the key ingredient is to construct suitable intermittent flows. Okay, thank you very much.
