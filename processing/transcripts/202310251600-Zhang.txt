It is short because Berger's equation is simple. So, I will introduce this with Berger's equation. This equation is special because it is a three-point equation, it's not quadrilateral, and it is consistent around the curve. And probably there is no Lagrange for this equation. So, this can be an example that the lattice equation, which is consistent around the curve. Which is consistent around the curve, but so far, no, like London is far. So let's have a look at the burgers finally. Here we have four equations, and the first one is a continuous burgers, and that mu is a parameter, constant parameter. And the second line is we call the semi-discrete, our differential difference, burgers equation. And the third one is our The third one is the fully discrete equation. And the fourth one is still the fully discrete. The two fully discrete equations, I mean, I say this discrete purpose one and discrete purpose two. Both of them are given by Dash O'Librio and his collaborators. And he got the And he got the last one just from the discrete last pair. But if you make comparison and the last one looks more complicated than the third one. So we like the third one. So I will give a very brief review about this burger family and including some connection with. Uh including some connection with one plus one dimensional integral systems and one plus and two plus one systems, and also some something about the integrity of the display progress. The continuous progress equation actually was found as early as in 1915. As by Bateman, as a model to describe the motion of a whiskers fluid. And okay, and then the burgers consider this one. And we can see it, so it is a couple system. And there is an interval. The interval is for the model, it's a finite interval from zero to B, and B is a number. And our Euler Purgatory equation. Our Euler Burgers equation, we don't have B term, we don't have this term. And that means that we can consider this Burger equation is for the infinite interval about this model. And the small U is for the velocity of the fluid, and the capital U is some mean velocity. And this continuous Burger's equation is well known about. About the we call the Kerrhof transformation because it is linearable, and also in the morning, is a professor Peter Owers mentioned this equation as a C integrable because it can be linearized. And the transformation was first given by this florin, but the paper it is in Russian. Eating in Russian. The burgers has a hierarchy and it is integrable, it has lux pair, and the last pair is the first order spectral problem. And for the hierarchy, it has a recurrent operator, and the operator is given by actually including the name of the recurrent operator is given by Keith Aurora in 1970. Given by Peter Aurora in 1977, and in his paper, he gave a hierarchy of symmetries of the brokers by just using this recurrent operation. And the whole hierarchy can be linearized also. And this whole hierarchy has infinite many symmetries and it has infinite many kind of warning laws, but unfortunately, there is no Amtonian structures. And the recurrent And the recursion operator is also related. This recursion operator T is also related to the so-called Bayer's polynomial, which is related to the binaryization of PDV equations. If we only look at the burgers, it has Galileo transformation. But for the hierarchy, for the high-order burgers, for example, for the next member, for the third-order Burger equation, and the Equation and there is no Galen transformation. You have to, if you want to have, and you have to make use of the second order equation together to consider them as a fault system, and then the fault system can have a Gadlier transformation. So, this is some interoperability about the continuous Burger's equation. And how this equation is related to other systems. Okay, this is one of Random, we call that derivative nominal Schrödinger equation, and it is also called the Chenli-Lioux equation because there are three derivative nominal Schrödinger equation. One is this one, and one is from Carpenter, and one is called the Gi is a very clear about the E1 equation. And okay, for this equation, and the derivative, the derivative is clear, the derivative is just. is here the derivative is just you know the no not for the whole non-linear scrum it's just for one function and if you make reduction if you make like a q like you can take in i is one or r to be one and then you can you can get a progress and you can this uh this reduction makes sense for the total hierarchy so so we can get So, we can get the Berger hierarchy from this derivative non-linear hierarchy of the Chenly Liu type, we say. If you look at the spectral problem of the Burger's hierarchy, it is the first order thing. And if you look at the modified Kp hierarchy, and it is related to the pseudo-differential operator. A pseudo-differential operator, like this. So there is this, we call this a constant term. But by content, I mean there is no integration or derivative. So we can just cut. Cutting means we can take u2, u3 to be zero, and then we can, and then this is the, this, this will give the spectral problem of the burgers around. Problem of the burgers are lucky. And here we have AM. AM is, we can take the power of this pseudo-differential operator, and then we can take this positive term, our pure differential term. So this is one connection with the modified KP. And another connection is we can consider this sig term because Kp for the Kp. Because Kp for the Kp hierarchy, and we can have the last pair, the first line, and we can have the adjoined form, second line, is two formulas. So if you, you know, when pi and phi are the eigenfunction of this max spire and the quadrant log spier, if you put them like this and you take derivative, and this will be the symmetry of the whole modified k-b ratio. Kb hierarchy since ux is also a symmetry, and then we can make this kind of constraint. We take a zero symmetry, and then we will have this constraint, and then make use of this constraint. This pseudo-differential operator can be rewritten as in this very compact form. And this, and then you substitute this. This operator, and into that spectral problem, and then you will find after some gate transformation, you will get this we call the Chenlil spectral problem. Chen Lilio spectral problem, which is there. So that means we can get the derivative nonlinear spectral problem, and we can also get the also get the channel hierarchy from from these two from this psi tim and phi ti from this two and they are they are uh nothing but the the continuous training new hierarchy so since we have the hierarchy and then no you know we can make the reduction and then we can get the burgers hierarchy so this is another another connection with modified kg this is the continuous kg KP. This is the continuous case. So now let's look at the semi-distributed case. The semi-distributed Berger equation, we can have two, but they are simply connected by some reflection transformation. You can take n to be minus and something like that. And it has a simple spectral problem and a simple recurrent operator. And this And this semi-discrete Burger-sky rocket can also be linearized if you take this discrete type of Kirkholet transformation. And this is a linear version. Not only that, and we can also take continuous limit and the relation between this discrete function in the same discrete burgers and this continuous u in the continuous burgers. Continuous U in the continuous vergers, and this that is the relation. And you can just directly define this epsilon, this epsilon is a spacing parameter and multiply by n and define this to be the continuous variable x. And then you take continuous limit. And before you take continuous limit, you need to make some combination because here this is a discrete requirement. Is a disc discrete recursion operator and your plus one. So, this is the combination of the semi-discrete burgers flows, and then you take continuous limit, and then you can get the hierarchy of this continuous limit, a hierarchy of its continuous burgers. So, this is the one result. And one more result is we have this semi-discrete, semi-discrete burgers hierarchy. And you can consider that X is not, it's just the T1. So we have this. It's just the T1. So we have this semi-distributed Burger tier. And this semi-distributed Burger tier is nothing but the Bacon transformation of a continuous one, which means you can consider that N is a solution and that N minus one is a new solution. Or you can consider that N minus one is a new solution and that N is a that N minus one is a some original solution and that n is a new solution. You can consider that. Consider that. So they are Bacon transformation of the continuous data. But this kind of theory is not new, it's known in, I think, in whole integral theory of integral systems. But this is for the seven discrete workers. What happened? What happened? Okay. Okay. So the semi-distributed verbals can be linked to relativity strata. So this is different from the continuous ones. Continuous ones and the connection with one plus one. One plus one system is a derivative non-linear shooting. Now you can see these semi-discrete burgers. And this is the we call the relativity totality, it is a spectral problem. And this is a whole hierarchy and the recurrent operator. This is the first flow in the first equation in the In all the first equation, in the relativity of total hierarchy, actually, there are two hierarchies of the relativity one is recalled positive, one is recalled negative. It depends on, you know, you can probably, when you find the hierarchy, you can expand something in terms of this theta, you know, positive curve and negative curve. But anyway, from this, you can see if you take this reduction, is r is minus. is r is minus that our r is minus r n is minus and that n plus one is kind of priority and from here from this first two equation and you can get this seven discrete progress so this is one connection in semi-discret case and another connection is uh is we call it semi-discrete uh derivative nomination Derivative non-interstruction or same distributed Chenney-Liu equation. Actually, this spectral problem, this spectral problem was found by Datimo-Miwa in their paper. They have five papers, and probably this is in the number two, paper number two. Okay, so this is the semi-discrete spectral colour, and you can And you can calculate the hierarchy, but the calculation is maybe not easy. And you can write out this hierarchy and write out this recursion operator. And unfortunately, this place is too small. Okay, so we skip this recursion operator, and this is the first flow of that equation. And then you can take very simple reduction, like a n plus one. Like a n plus one is that scan and b n is one, and then you can get the displayed workers. So, this is the some you can see some correspondence from the continuous case because in continuous case, and you can do the reduction from the continuous chain local radio, and then you can get the continuous growth. So, this is the same detail. Okay, so that means there should be connection. There should be a connection with the d or differential difference modified kp. Here, this differential difference modified kp means we have two continuous variable and one disparate variable. If you want to get this hierarchy, you can start from this pseudo-difference operator, this error, and then you consider the first. And then you consider the first line, the first line. The first line is, I call it maybe the triplet. By triplet, I need to introduce this variable x. But you can consider this x is the same as t1. But if you want to consider matrix symmetry, it should be independent of the x, it should be independent of t1. So So, okay, so we will have this leader-modified KP hierarchy. And then we can also consider this square eigenfunction symmetry. So, this is this, and we need to use its psi and phi. And then we can make the constraint. We can make because vx is also a symmetry, and then we can put them together. Symmetry and then we can put them together, and that is a con that is a constraint. And then we can define this precise an and this part is b n and the way is then is a n multiplied b n and then the eigenfunction, then the difference, pseudo-difference operator can be written in this form, in this form. And then this eigenvalue This eigen our spectral problem, after you know, some gauge transformation, and we can get this relativity total spectral problem, which is that which is that one from that side TIS and the phi ti's, you can get the whole hierarchy of our Twitter, your team Twitter, and then so that means. And then, so that means from the hierarchy, you know, from the hierarchy, we can get we can get the semi-discrete burgers also by eruption. So, this is one connection with modified Kp in the differential difference case. Okay, so I for this K let's consider another you know connection with the Connection with the differential difference modified Kp this is the same as the real that this this this difference operator that pseudo difference operator is the same as this one same as same as this one except I put spacing parameter h there and and and later you know you can take continuous limits by taking this h to be zero and then you can recover the continuous You can recover the continuous modified KP and also recover the continuous Chinese local ratio. But anyway, you know, for this pseudo-difference case, and we redefine this V bar, like one plus H V turn, and then we can rederive the modified Kp hierarchy in terms of what V turn. In terms of what we choose, and then we can introduce this constraint of squared eigenfunction symmetry. And then, you know, the difference is here, everything is considered in terms of V2. But in the previous page, is V. So that's able to. Is we so that is the difference so that that place is we and here is we bar and we bar is one plus h v to but but everything is considered in terms of v to in this page and then we can get uh uh this uh constraint and then we can rewrite this uh pseudo difference operator in terms of this a n and b n and this constraint and then we can get this uh Then we can get this we call the semi-discrete chain illegal spectral problem. Which is this problem, this problem. So more than that, this precipari and the precise star t by s and these two equations we get will give the same bit squared chain routing. So this is the same discrete case. And that means that And that means that some of these progress also related to this deductible modified KP hierarchy. So this way. So finally, let's look at the fully disclosed burgers. Okay, so one way to get the fully discrete burgers is to consider the Bagnon transformator and the zero-bagnon formula. And so let's we start from that, the first line. From that, the first line is that is a Burger's hierarchy in continuous. And then we introduce the spectral, we introduce the parameter lambda as a Big Land transformation, a Baknant parameter. And then this is these two equations. We will give the Pignon transformation for the progress hierarchy. And we if we look at the first equation, the Pegnan transformation, then the first equation is the Pegnan transformation. Further equation in the Bayton transformation, and we define this. Uh, uh, okay, Z is a known solution, and P is some Bacon parameter, and that Tura is a new solution. And we can consider another quickness transformation by using Q as a new quicken parameter, and then the solution is called the Z hat, and then we can cancel something. And then we can cancel something, and finally, we get this something like two-solid solution, this supercondition formula. Okay, so this equation is three-point equation. You can consider it quadrilateral, but this point is not related. So, it is three-point equation, it's a triangle, and then this kind of triangle, you can put it on the six faces of the curve, and it is consistent. Of the curve and it is consistent. So, this is a three-point equation which is consistent around the cube. And once you have the consistency, and you can have a Baylin transformation of the mass pair using this consistent cube, and you can also introduce this kind of transformation to linearize that nonlinear form, to have this linear form. This is the linear form of the distributed progress. The linear form or the distributed progress. Okay, so this is the last page. So this is the last page. Okay, so I just introduced the first three equations and their integrity. And my talk is actually the pre-talk of the sandpit. So maybe I can read the question. So, maybe I can read the question because this is in the morning. I asked Peter Our one question. The Burglars equation, he said, the Burger equation, there is no Nagla involved. And then we have the fully discrete Burger decision. And this fully discrete one. This fully discrete one continuum considering. Considering around the curve, but probably no lag language also. So please think about that. Maybe you can find a new line language for this.
