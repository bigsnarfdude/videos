To see what people are doing around the world. And so I'm very happy to be here. So I want to tell you about the, well, this, I think it's better to call it the composition of One, one, not with Genus G, but well, and this is joint work with Mario Dabe and Enrique Ramirez. So I'll start reminding you what is a GB node. And I think Scott mentioned this briefly in his talk. And so we say that a node in a string is a GB node if it admits a G B naught if it admits a B bridge position with respect to the standard genus G surface in S3. So for instance, here is a well a cartoon of a knot in a 3, 4 position. So we see these arcs, the bridges are arcs containing the respective handle body, and these arcs can be Are can be pushed into the genus G Higar surface for S3. And well, I'll be focused on one, one nodes. So these are nodes which admit a one rich position with respect to the standard torus in S3. And so let me, I'll start saying a little bit why these knots are interesting and well, this family of knots is interesting. And well, this family of nodes is interesting because, well, this family contains all the rational nodes, for instance, and all the satellite tunnel number one nodes, and one, one nodes are tunnel number one. So here in these little pictures, it's just a reminder of the construction given by Morimoto and Sakuma for tunnel number one satellite knots. Like nodes. And well, this just a little reminder what rational nodes look like. And tunnel number one nodes are not for which you can find an arc so that the arc just touches the nod in its ends. So the graph you obtain, while the complement of that graph is a genus to handle. So well, so the talk also involves genus of not. So well, just a quick refresher. I'll be talking about two type of genus for nodes. The orientable genus, so just the plain genus of a knot, is the least genus of any cipher surface for a knot. And the cross-cap number of K will be, well, the least. the the least genus the the least non-orientable genus of foreno okay so we are be uh we i'm i'm gonna we are gonna combine these two um uh properties of a nut the one one position and the gender so let me tell you what is the uh very quick the the the history about these um relations so gene So genus one, one one not has been classified in 2002 by Matsuda and Charlemagne in 2004. So what they, well, combining the work of various people, Charlemagne finally proved that the three families that I mention here is the same. In the case of In the case of a genus 111. Okay, later on, Enrique and Luis classify cross-cut number 2110. That was in 2004. And in 2017, Mario Enrique and myself, we classify genus to one one nodes. genus to one one nodes and well and finally we did it for for genus in the general in the general set so i'm gonna say a few words about one one nodes of genus two so just to tell you what what was the the idea um that led us to you know to to the general description in the case of an arbitrary Case of an arbitrary minimal genealogy. So for one, one knots, well, we describe this operation on one, one knots that I, well, here it says it's called the vertical sum, but later I think I grow the vertical band. Well, because this is made along the band. So if we have the nice things about the nice thing about about the nice thing about one one notes is we can arrange them in the toros cross i the torus cross i um so what we do we take two one one knots and and we arrange them in this concentric um way so the the k one knot is say laying on for instance For instance, in the region, this is if we think this is the torus cross zero, one. So K1 is in the torus zero cross three quarters, I thought. Well, I hope you understand what I'm saying here. So the thing is that to perform this operation along one, one nodes. One one knots. So we can think that this arc of the node K1 is a minimum with respect to this torus cross I structure. And for K2, we have this arc that we can think of it as a maximum. So what we do when we take this vertical sum is we just remove small r. small arc from k1 and small r from for this from this minimum and from this maximum and we just glue them uh with uh with two arcs um that do not introduce any any um any critical point for for for for the node with respect to this uh torus cross eye structure okay so i Okay, so and this is called a vertical sum of one one naught. So this in this picture is done for two one one nodes, but you can have more one one nodes and perform this construction. And the thing is that this vertical sum is again a one one node. Okay, and this will be denoted by this symbol. This symbol, okay. So, this B is because well, it's this sum is defined via a band, a rectangle. Okay. Fabiola, is that unique or really not unique? No, no, no, not unique. Okay, no, no, no. So, this is a very, yeah, the bank can list can have a List can have a, I don't know, zero cross, zero crossings or you know, positive or negative crossings. Probably the bank can go around, you know. But the thing is that it doesn't introduce any other. Yeah, these two arcs intersect each torus in the structure torus cross. The in the structure torus cross i just in two points, okay. Okay, so in that case, in the case of one one knots of genus two, we show that it can be decomposed, a given genus 2, 1, 1 knot is a vertical sum of two knots, k1. Of two knots, K1 and K2, so that, well, we have all these cases. So both K1 and K2 are rational genus 1 nodes, K1 and K2 are satellite genus 1, 1, 1 nodes, or probably K1 is a satellite genus 1, 1 node, and K2 is a rational genus 1 node, or both K1 and K2. Both K1 and K2 are cross-cap number two, rational nodes, or K1 can be a trivial node in certain position, and K2 can be any of the rational node, a satellite genus one, or a trivial node as well. Okay, so given this description, well, we wanted to have a a general To generalize this description for the case of genus G11 max. So let me show you some of this very quickly, some of these, the pictures of some of these, the examples of this theorem. So here you can see in a case where K1 and K2 are both rational genus one-nodes. Here is another example where K1, that is, well, this. That is, uh, well, this one is K1. I see it green, but you know, I don't know if it really you see it green, and the other one, so K1 is a sedala genus one node, and K2 is a rational genus one. This case above, K1 and K2 are cross-capped one, one nodes. And well, anyway, so some few examples of Examples of descriptions. And so, as I was mentioning, so the nice thing about the one-one notes is that we can work with the torus, the standard torus cross-eye. And so we can put the node in such a way that the arc, the bridges are contained. Are contained, look like in this way. So, here is the torus cross I. So, so the triosphere is divided by this, I think I'm calling this H0, the torus cross I, and the other, and here is another solid torus. Okay, and so we are going to consider this height function. This height function from the torus cross eye. And well, so we are, you know, just for any regular level, for any height here, the pre-image under this function is just a torus level here. Okay, so we are going to use this height function, and what we are going to function and we are going to combine this with the with the cipher with the minimal cipher surface for the nut so uh ah sorry sorry sorry so uh so yes s yeah so so the the thing is that uh in this product structure well the node has no critical points Not has no critical points. Okay, you just see arcs connecting these two points to these two points. And so now, okay, and here, so I will be considering a surface, a minimal, a minimal genus cipher surface F for K. And so, with respect to this, to this this to this uh function uh i want it to be uh to be a morse function when this when it is restricted to the to the cipher surface okay so there is there is this lemma uh that says that uh well that for any essential cipher surface uh so the cipher surface uh will have some pieces in in pieces in in this handle body some pieces in in this hand in in this handle body and well something going on here okay so in this lemma it says that we can arrange you know that um well we can isotop this uh cipher surface in such a way that inside the the product structure here there are only saddles for the for for the For the cipher surface. And outside the product, the torus cross eye, we are gonna see canceling this, one canceling this on each side, and probably, well, we can have many annuli for the surface. And it says more stuff about the number of critical points of the number of the saddles here inside the Here inside the product structure. Okay, so this was like the lemma we used to do the classification of in the case of genus two. But in the general case, so basically what we did is to look at the type, the type of saddles inside this and play with the order of them and look. With the order of them and doing things like that. So, in the case of genus 2, it was kind of easy to manage, but for genus G, we wanted to get rid of some problematic combination of saddles. And so to do that, we had to modify a little bit more the cipher surface we were working with. And so what we did is What we did is to perform a surgery for the cipher surface along annuli. So, since we are in this world where everything is oriented, so in this picture, this piece here is a torus level, denoted by SR. And since everything is oriented, And since everything is oriented, so when the cipher surface intersects this level torus in, well, in close curves, in this way, that such a way that the two disjoint curves have opposite orientations. And so this, so of course, this is the cipher surface. So the cipher surface, you know, it's doing You know, it's doing something. And in each level set, besides having closed surface, we are going to have also an arc. So we take a pair of curves with opposite orientations. So they co-bound an annula, an annulus in this torus. And so we can always find such an annulus that does not. always find such an analyst that doesn't contain the the the arc of intersection of the surface with this level set and what we do we just you know cut along the the surface along here and and well we construct another a new surface in this way by well using this this annual annulus here and so we get rid of of this this intersection this pair This intersection, this pair of intersections with opposite orientations, and that's what we call an a surgery of F along this annulus. And we can do it for every time we have this situation. And the thing is that we can again accommodate our surface in such a way that, well, we have a similar lemma as before. Similar lemma as before with these important properties. Again, in this product, we have only saddles for the so the Morse function is just have saddles here. And we can get rid of the annuli, all the annuli that were popping out in the handle. Outside the torus cross eye. And any pair of parallel curves in each of the surface intersecting any torus level have the same orientation. So these are the nice properties for this surface after a finite number of annuled surgeries. Okay, and so we call such a cipher surface satisfying those conditions. We call it, we say it is simple. So this the previous lemma can be stated as saying that every one one naught has a simple minimal genus cipher surface. So now So now we were ready to start looking at the saddles inside the Taurus cross-eye region. And because the surface, well, this is a surface, we just have these four types of saddles. So a saddle that joins an arc with itself. A saddle that joins and arc with itself, a saddle that joins and art with a closed curve, a saddle joining a closed curve with itself, or a saddle joining two curves. And so this is in the general set for any, even for a non-simple cipher minimal surface for Lena. Okay, so we prove that. Prove that a simple minimal genocipher surface for F for a 11 naught can be isotope so that the saddles inside the product, the torus cross eye, are only of type T1 and T2. And moreover, these saddles will produce only essential curves. So we get rid of this and this. Of this and this. So that made the classification easier. Okay. And here is the statement of the theorem. And so it says that, well, it says that for a given Well, it says that for a given one one naught and a minimal genus G simple cipher surface, denoted by F, then for this pair, we can assign a collection of slopes for each a collection for slopes, a collection of numbers, gi. Of numbers gi and a collection of surfaces. So, such that this, the boundary of these surfaces are one one nodes. Well, the boundary of this surface is a one-wing node of genus GI. So that the node, the one-white node of genus G can be decomposed as this vertical sum. Vertical sum. So this is going to be a one one naught of genus G0. This is when one node of genus G1, and so on. Such that when we add up all the genera here, we obtain the genus of the one one nut. Okay. And so this is what we what we prove. And well, I left here a page for, well, I don't know if I'm going to say something about how we prove this, but well, basically is just to well start looking at well, just just finding. just finding in this in this in this torus cross eye looking at level torus where there are no close curves and well when you look at at the piece left be in between you have a um a one a one a one one that piece uh will give you um Will give you a one one nut of smaller genes. Okay, and well, well, but we say a little bit more about the description of each piece. So we said that each each genus GI Which genus GI11 node that we found, even it is going to be even probably will be a trivial node in certain positions, except for the zero and one level, or it will be a rational genus one, one, one node, or a satellite genus one, one, one naught, or it's going to be, if not any of these cases, it's going to be a There is going to be a vertical sum of other pieces where, well, each piece is a one, one knot. Yes, the first piece, the first piece and the second and the last piece of this vertical band are going to be one one knots whose cross-cap number are no bigger than two. Than two. And each piece here is going to be one one naught, either with cross-cut number bounded by this number, or its genus will be smaller than this number. Okay. Okay. So that's like the composition for a one note of. A one nod of minimal genus with given a simple minimal cipher surface for it. Okay. And okay, so another stop another thing we did is that, well, we apply this to a vertex. We take G. uh we we take g genus one rational nodes and we take the vertical sum of of those genus of those g genus one rational nodes and we proved that that vertical sum is indeed a rational nod of genus g. So I'm going to just to show you with a picture how this how we how we How we did this deformation. So again, we take, well, here we can see four genus one rational knots. Again, they are accommodated in a concentric way in the torus cross I. And we perform a vertical sum between between them, but this vertical sum, the vertical sum that is shown here. Some the vertical sum that is shown here is there are no crossings, it's just a you know the like the most silly vertical sum you can do, okay? And so we are not just taking the genus one rational nodes, we are also taking the well, the genus one cipher surface, okay. Okay, um, so the idea is just well, you take several gene nodes like this, and we are going to start with the innermost genus one, rational node with respect to this torus cross I structure. And we are going to start isotoping the surface and the node. And so here are the examples. So here are the examples. I hope you can see it. Let me see if I can do it to zoom it. Okay, so we are just isotoping the band, the innermost band. So we are kind of push here like this. And so we obtain something like this. And we just start sliding. just start sliding this this like this little foot of the band along well along this along the well along the only way we can slide it along and so until we end up with something like this and so this is like the final of course after going sliding um we are going We are going to introduce or crossings and so they may cancel or increase the ones that were the original here. And so we keep, so this is sliding, this is called the E1 band alone, the other one. Okay. So and we keep doing that. So when we end up, I sorry. Sorry. With this picture, we now go to the next one and we isotope in the same way and we start sliding. So we do it in a very well precise way. And we do the same, blah, blah, blah. And we end up with this. And then in this case, we are just left with this band. So we slide it again. And so we obtain this picture. We just, well, isotope. So the surface looks like this. Well, here you can almost see that this is a genus 2. Sorry, a genus. This is a rational node, a tub rich node. And so this is. So this is the general picture of the general case. Looks like this. So this proves that after doing these slidings, we end up with a rational node. Here is the surface and it's the same. So this surface for this rational node is exactly the surface. The surface will turn after slightly. Okay, so that's it. Thank you. Okay, let us thank Fabiola for her talk. Thank you. And we're running a little late, so maybe we'll have like a minute before the next talk, and we can hold back.
