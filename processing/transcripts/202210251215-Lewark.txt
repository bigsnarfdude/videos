Yeah, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for inviting me here to this great conference. So the results I'm going to present are from a recent paper together with Claudius Tibrobius. We uploaded that to the archive in August. And this is the first time I'm speaking about these results. I'm really excited. I want to encourage you to ask. I want to encourage you to ask questions also just during the talk. And yeah, let's go. So I'll start with some ancient history, namely 2004 and 5. So Rasmussen asked the question in 04 whether the Higher-Fleur-Tau invariant is equal Fleur tau invariant is equal to half the Rasmus invariant for all knots. So I guess you all know the answer, but bear with me. The reason why this is a hard question at first is that both tau and the Rasmus invariant half are so-called slice Toros invariants. So and I'll write those new. Write those new. So tau and s hub are slice torus invariance. And I'll tell you the definition, what this means. That means three things. They are homomorphisms on the smooth concordance group. Morphisms on the smooth concordance group C to the integers. They give a lower bound to the smooth slice genus. So nu of k is less or equal than g4 of k. So that's the slice part of the name. And this And this bound is sharp for torus knots. So ν P P Q is equal to G four of P P Q for all PQ greater or equal to one coprime. So I think it's fair to say that Livingston is the one who started looking at invariants that satisfy these properties. And then from And then, from these properties, maybe don't seem so restrictive, but as it turns out, any invariants that are slice-forwards invariants will agree on a huge families of knots, for example, on all alternating knots. So we have tau equal to s half on many classes of knots. Of knots, including alternating knots, quasi-positive knots. And so in recent work, oops, with Peter Feller and Andrew Lopp, we introduced the class of squeeze knots. They also agree on that class, which is quite big. And so, arguably, if you look at all knots and huge knots, then probably generically these invariants disagree. But you know, when you start computing for small knots, then most small knots fall into these families. So that explains why it was difficult in the beginning to answer these questions, to answer this question whether talent and Question: Whether Talent has agreed. I will tell you. So we need a good class where we can distinguish these knots. And as it turns out, a good class is precisely given by twisted wide-tail doubles. By twisted whitehead doubles. So let me draw you twisted white head doubles. So this is my notation W for whitehead plus for a positive clasp of 2, 3. So that's the satellite of the right-handed positive truffle knot. So the wrapping number two satellite. It's a wrapping number two satellite. So here is my doubled trap hole. And then, because I've chosen a diagram here that has non-zero rife, I need to put in a bunch of full twists to get zero framing. In this case, three full twists. Okay, so this is the part that comes from the knot. Comes from the knot. I could have also written this part here as minus three. So that's full twists. And then here at the bottom, I have the white hat clasp. And because I want to consider twisted white hats, I'm putting in just the number t, the integer of right-handed whole twists. All right. And so now let us think a bit about what values a slice toros invariant can take on this knot. So let's say we want to plot this. So I'll draw a graph, and here I'll put the value. Put the value of on this not depending on t and here on this axis I'll put t and okay so what what can we say so first of all um we can uh remark that all these knots here All these knots here are pretty close regarding cobordism distance. You see, the orientations here are like this. We can just cut off, I can cut here. And then this band, you know, it totally unknots. So after this cut, I can just twist as I wish and also make another knot as I wish, and then I can reattach. So that means that. So that means that the smooth cobaltism distance of any two twisted white doubles is at most one. And you can easily derive from these axioms that the difference of mu is a bound for the cobordism distance. So that means that So that means that all the values here will be in a horizontal strip of height one. That's the first thing we can say. We don't know yet where this strip is, but in a minute we'll know because let's look at the zero twisted positive white head of the anode. So that's just the anode. Not and if I put in one negative twist, I get the positive traffor. And so here nu takes the value zero, here nu takes the value one, so the values zero and one appear, and so this horizontal strip is in fact here. So my graph will live. So, my graph will live in this strip. It would go like tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck. All right. But actually, we see it will not be able to oscillate because we can also deduce from these axioms how new will behave under a crossing change. Namely, when I change a crossing, let's say from positive to negative. Positive to negative, then either the value of new stays the same or it goes down by one. That's all that can happen. That was, by the way, also remarked by Livingston. And when I increase the value of t, I can do that by negative crossing changes. And so that means my graph here is monotonically decreasing. Decreasing. And so, with this information, there's not so much anymore what can happen. So, what can happen? It could be constant one, it could be constant zero, or it could be one, and then at some point it jumps down to zero. Those are the only things that can happen. And finally, we can exclude that new is constant because of the following remark. If I take t small enough, then this knot will be strongly quasi-positive. So this is strongly quasi-positive for sufficiently small t. And you can see that as follows. You can see that as follows. You have a Zeifelt surface here of genus 1 for that knot, which consists of one small Hopband here plummed to a band that is twisted and knotted. But you can show that any knotted band with the knot fixed becomes strongly quasi-positive if you twist it enough in one direction. It becomes strongly quasi-negative. Direction, it becomes strongly quasi-negative if you twist it enough in the other direction. That's actually not so hard to show. And so if I make t small enough, this band here will be strongly quasi-positive. And then I plump it to another strongly quasi-positive band, resulting in a strongly quasi-positive knot. And from these axioms, I can deduce that ν will be equal to the genus for strongly quasi-positive knots. So that means So that means for sufficiently small t, the value here will be one. And for sufficiently large t, I have a plumbing of a strongly quasi-positive band here and a strongly quasi-negative band there. And this is something called a strongly quasi-homogeneous knot. That's a notion introduced by Andrew Peter. Introduced by Andrew, Peter, and me. It's a bit overcale, you don't really have to do it this way, but I thought it would be nice to shamelessly also self-advertise that a bit. So it's strongly quasi-homogeneous, which just means a union of something strongly quasi-positive and something strongly quasi-negative along a disk. Doesn't need to be a plumbing. It is here, but doesn't need to be. But doesn't need to be for large t and then for strongly quasi-homogeneous knots, we can also compute nu, it is zero, and so we have with that remark excluded the possibility that nu is constant. So now we know that there's only one piece of information we need, and that is where does it jump down. And actually, since we are working with a concrete example. Since we are working with a concrete example here, two, three, the bounds we get here in four are explicit, they are at one. So we know that here for t equal one, the value is one, and at six, at six, the value must be zero. All right, so now it's just So now it's just there are just five possibilities. Where does it jump down? And now I can answer Draw's question. So Hedden and Ording found that this jump point is different for tau and s. So tau jumps here as fast as it can. So tau is here it is one, here it is zero. This is a This is supposed to be a tau, but the Rasmus invariant jumps one step, one twist later. It jumps here. And so the answer here by Hedden and Ording just one year later is no. And you take k equal to the two twisted. The two twisted right a double of the two three torus knot. And now I'm not 100% sure, but I think this is also the smallest example in terms of crossing number. Not 100% sure, but. Ah, well, you can comp no, it should be less because if you make the two twisted white double, those two twisted. Whitehead double, those two twists actually cancel with two of those here. So you're like you have 12 crossings here, two from here, and two from here. So that's 16. So I think this is also the lowest crossing. Not really sure, but I think you can't go much lower if you are looking for a tau not equal to s. But I don't want to say that with certainty. More questions at this point? Whether it's probably talking about change here to penetrate or which not which not is the most quantum number? Ah, so the question is what are the coefficients on S? What what do you mean by coefficients? Yeah, I think are the properties with small ones. All right, so the question is what happens if I replace that S with S over F2? And that's exactly what I want to talk about now. Like my title was Rosmo's invariance. So there's an S there. So the plural comes from different coefficient fields. But to be honest, I haven't really given much thought to what is like the lowest example in terms of crossing number because I'm not sure it helps you so much. Like my message is rather that if you want to distinguish these invariants, you should look at twisted writer doubles. And then that's easier to do than to just, or at least at the time it was easier to do than just to go through the tables. All right. So a brief. So a brief digression about Rasmus invariance. So here's something I have already told several people in the audience. There is this version of universal corvanophomology, which I think I should attribute to get. To get Naud, a student of Glo, from his PhD thesis. And that's a version of Covano homology where to a knot K, you associate a graded chain complex over the polynomial ring in one variable over the In one variable over the integers. And I chose to call this variable G. This will haunt me forever because it's not a group. It's just a variable. There we are. Well-defined up to a multi-p equivalence. So, before I tell you why it's universal, let me give you an example. Why it's universal. Let me give you an example. So I want to denote this by bracket k. A bracket of the trefoil is homotopy equivalent to q squared z g zero q to the six z g here the differential is g q to the eight z g It's called universal because you get all other variations of Covano homology from it, at least those which you get by using a different TQFT. If all you do is taking a different TQFT, then it's determined by this version. That's what universal here means. That's what universal here means. For example, here is how to get just the original reduced Kubanov invariant. I just need to set g equal to zero. So k tensored over z g with z g mod g, that's just plain old reduced Kovanov homology. But I can also get the Rasmussen invariant from this universal theory. And I can get it in a nice way without ever muttering the dark words spectral sequences. You can completely do it without spectral sequences and without ever saying the word filtered. Saying the word filtered, namely, like this, you tensor with the field. So you tensor over that G with FG where F is a field of some characteristic, which I call C. And then when you've done that, you have a chain complex over. Over Fg, and Fg is a PID, which has the nice consequence that chain complexes over a PID are classified in a certain way. Namely, the indecomposable chain complexes are classified, just that follows from the finitely generated modules being classified. Um So let's see it what we have here if we replace that with with F, here we have one summand which is just three, it's just a chain complex of rank one. So that's something that always happens. We have a summant which is some shift of Zg and then And then we have a bunch of complexes of rank two where the differential is some power of g. So plus some shifted copies of Z G G to the I Q squared vert G. Yes, thank you, Fg. Everything is FG here. And well, for example, what I wrote here is also true over ZG for the traffic in this example, but it need not be true in general. We have examples where it isn't because ZG is the stuff of nightmares. That's a horrible ring. You have no classification of the modules over this, of the finite generated modules. You have no classification of the chain complexes. And you And yeah, very complicated stuff can and does happen, which is why we go over to a field. Unless we are called the Schutz, then we can also do something over the integers. All right, so over a field, I sneakily already defined you the Rasmus invariant. It's the shift of the free part. This is a viable definition of the Rasmus invariant of characteristic C, as it turns out. Characteristic C. As it turns out, it doesn't depend on the field, it just depends on the characteristic of the field. So, this is my favorite definition of the Rasmus invariant. Oh, sorry, what did you say? Here, the G to the I or R N, it doesn't matter. And this can vary, it can be. And this can vary. It can be like here, it's one, but for example, for the three photorus not, we have one copy weight g squared. Oh, thanks, yes, thanks. The grading on g is two, and there should be an i there. Yes, thank you. Yes. Further questions? Okay. So Rasmussen and O4 defined the original Rasmussen invariant. The original Rasmus invariant, which in this notation is S0. And then McKay Turner-Was one year later, defined sp for prime p, so all the other Rasmus invariants. And now, of course, the question is much in the spirit. Much in the spirit of the question tau versus s. The question is: are they different? Does the C actually matter? Okay, so how do we answer this question? Well, we look at twisted white doubles. And so this question was answered for p equal to 2 by Cotton Seed. So he wrote a computer program and the result is mentioned in the paper by Lipschitz and Zach. Is mentioned in the paper by Lipschitz and Zaka from 2012. So he showed that S2 is different from S0 using a 14 crossing knot, which I think has no special properties, but they might as well have used twisted white doubles because S0. So this S here is. So this S here is S0, this jumps here, but S2 jumps one later, S2 jumps here. That's not the original, not their use, but they could have. And then last year, Claudius and I. Claudius and I showed that S3 is different from S0. And that's a postcard. We wrote that on a postcard. Thanks to Liam. All right, and now it would be nice if it were there. Nice if it were there. But it isn't. What we used is we use the 3-4 torus knot with the advantage doubles of the 3-4 torus knot. And before I write that down, let me introduce a little more notation. So recall that we had. So, recall that we had argued that for every slice Torres invariant and every fixed knot, the values on the twisted whiter doubles of that fixed knot are just determined by this one jump point. So it makes sense to give a name to this jump point, which was done by Livingston and Nike in 05. In 05. So this is Livingston Nike 05. So they showed for all Leistorus invariants and for all nots, there exists an invariant. I'm going to call this theta of k an integer. An integer such that, well, there is this one jump point happening exactly at theta. So nu of w plus t of k minus nu of w plus t minus one of k. This is the jump. This is minus one if t is equal to that theta and it's zero otherwise. zero otherwise. So they didn't, some of the variable, the not invariant they introduced was like one off. So for example, here, what is theta tau of the truffle? Theta tau of the truffle is two. And for some reason, they would have said it's one. It's one, which maybe you think this is just convention, but I'll convince you that our convention is better. All right. So let's make a little table here of values of theta that we can read from this graph. So let's see, we have theta of tau, and then theta, and I'll abbreviate instead of writing. abbreviate instead of writing theta s c I'll just write theta c because I'm lazy so we have theta zero coming from the rational Rasmus invariant theta two coming from the F2 Rasmus invariant and we've computed that for the two three traffic so for tau it's two for S0 it's three and for S2 it's it's four It's for okay, and before we talk about S3, let's also quickly compute it for the ANOD. So I had it on the board here. What's the zero brand, the zero twisted positive white double of the ANOD is just the ANOD. But if I make one negative twist, it's the positive Trefoil. And Lystorus invariants for the positive Trefoil are one. For the Arnod, they are zero. So the jump also. Are zero, so the jump always happens at zero, so it's just always zero here. Okay, and now what Claudius and I found is that for T34, it's a first glance at the reason, but it's not the full reason yet. What we found is that, okay, so this is. Found is that okay, so this is zero again, and of course, we tried here, but it's just three. But if you go for the three photoros not six here, eight here, eight here, and here it's nine. So there you go. So I think this is by explicit computation, exactly. Computation exactly. So we know how to calculate with the computer the Rasmus invariant. So you just calculate the Rasmus invariant of this white double. And nowadays, that's something that can be done. That's right. How are there? There was a philosophical reason to put the calculations to come from the intersection of the curve. It's not completely randomized. I don't know. I'm just kind of. No, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't. But yeah, okay. Let me think. Yeah, okay. Let's for the moment, let's just say there was, I mean, we went wildly trying things. There was a reason we calculated these things for the 3-4 torus not. Okay. So, this is not really the point of my talk, that discovery. That was just for Claudius and me, this was like the motivation to look at these theta invariants. So, let's talk a bit about these theta C. And here comes the theorem, theorem one from this year, theta two is itself a concordance homomorphism. All right, so of course, we want it to be zero on the A-naught, but yeah, we don't want to shift it by one because then it clearly wouldn't be a homomorphism. But with this convention, theta two is itself a homomorphism from the smooth concordance group to Z, and it's independent from. And it's independent from all other homomorphisms that we know. So it seems to be something new. So, what we can show is independent from tau, S0, S2, and S3. These are linearly independent. Okay, so y theta 2 only theta 2 is a homomorphism. Only that was doing the homomorphism, the others were not. We conjecture that the others are two. In fact, why don't we just be bold and conjecture it not just for the Rasmus invariants, but let's just conjecture it for all five Toros invariants. So we conjecture that theta nu is also a homomorphism. We just can't prove it. No, so we can compute values, and if they are homomorphisms, then for example, theta 0 and theta 3 will also be linearly independent from the ones I have written here. I have written here if they are homomorphisms, but we can't show that they are homomorphisms. So this is the theorem, and that is conjecture. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I think there was, yes. The question was basically if it whether these Whether these homomorphisms will be linearly independent, and the answer is: if we can prove they are homomorphisms, then they will be linearly independent just using values we've computed. Okay, like the linear independence of these, you basically just get it from more or less from looking at this table already. So, all right. Theta tau. Yeah, yeah, that's the cool thing. So, theta tau. That's the cool thing. So, theta tau has already been computed by Hedden. Theta tau is just two tau. That's a paper from Hedden from 2006. Of course, he didn't write it like that, but in our language, that's his main theorem. So the conjecture is true for tau. It's just boring for tau because it's, I mean, sorry, of course, this is a great theorem, but the fact that it's a homomorphism, you know, that's boring because. You know, that's boring because it's just two times a homomorphism we already know. All right. More questions? No, it's not a slice thorosomomorphism, which you can already see from this table. Slice thorosomomorphism has prescribed Slice torus homomorphism has prescribed values on the torus knot. And it doesn't, even if you would like rescale, it would not have these values. So it's not a slice homomorphism, but of course we were wondering about that too. It's just a homomorphism. It's maybe a lower bound for the four genus. We have no good reason to assume it should be, but we don't have examples where it isn't either. Okay, so there's a second theorem. So trying to catch up with my title. So my title was and other satellites. So until here, we've only spoken about white doubles. And now we can actually say something about all patterns. Can actually say something about all patterns with wrapping number two and winding number zero. I want to consider any pattern with wrapping number two and winding number zero. So that means a pattern is a knot in a solid torus, and wrapping number two means I can. Wrapping number two means I can write it in such a way that there's a meridional disk that intersects it twice. So it basically goes around twice. Winding number zero means like algebraically it goes around zero times if I count with sine. So you see this is exactly what happens with the with the white double. But of course I can make all kinds of patterns. And now you can play the same game for other patterns that you did here. For other patterns that you did here, and you get somewhat similar results. Everything lives in a strip. Well, you don't know how high or low the strip is if you have a different pattern. And also, you don't know whether the graph will be constant. That's something that could happen. For example, if you could take a trivial pattern, then it would be constant. But But there is a way to restate this theorem of Livingston Eye and to state it differently. So what this says is for whiter doubles, you have the graph of the A-Not. So for the A-Not, we just have like one here and zero here. And if we plug in a different knot, the graph for Different knot, the graph for the different knot will just be the one for the unknot with a horizontal shift. And this horizontal shift is exactly theta. And stated that way, the theorem holds for all patterns with the same shift for all patterns. So the statement is that S2 of P of K is equal to S2 of P of. 2 of p of the unknot with added twists. So here I twist the pattern by exactly theta. And this is always the same theta too, no matter what the pattern is. It's the same theta for all patterns. And so this is something we do not know for tau. So let me explicitly Now, let me explicitly write down what this would say for tau. The conjecture for tau is that for all patterns as above, wrapping number two, winding number zero, and for all k, tau of the satellite with pattern p and companion k is equal to tau of the satellite with the same pattern. Satellite with the same pattern but with a twist by minus tau k and a companion u. So this is something you can state just using tau and we don't know if this is true. So it is true for p equal to the positive white double by work of Haddon and the negative white. And the negative one to double also by work of Haddon. And then there's a bunch of other patterns for which it's true by work of Adam from 2010. Some further patterns, but we don't have all. So that's Levine 2010. Okay. All right, so maybe let me. I have just a couple of minutes left, so let me maybe just say a bit something about the proof of these theorems. Proof of these theorems. So the fun thing is that the statements of the two theorems are something you can just make for all slice thorus invariants. You can just conjecture it for all sleistorous invariants. So maybe you would hope that there is a proof using just these three formal properties that I wrote down. No, being a concordance homomorphism, lower bound for the slice genus and sharp bound for the torus nodes. Maybe there is such a proof. If there is, then Maybe there is such a proof. If there is, then we haven't found it. So, the proof we do, it really works with Covano homology. So, it uses the immersed curves or multi-curves invariants by Kotelsky-Watson and Claudius Debrovius from 2019, which give a classification of chain complexes of banata. Complexes of Banatan chain complexes of four in the tangles. So we've already seen that over a PID, we have a classification of chain complexes. And now here's a category where we also have a classification of chain complexes, but it's much harder. It's, well, it's foreigned tangles. As you might know, we have a Cobano homology for foreign tangles defined by draw. And in this situation, we cut here. And then you see that we have. And then you see that we have one part, one four-in detangle, which depends just on the knot. And we have one four-ended tangle, which depends just on the pattern and on the twists. And then using this multi-curve classification, well, we look at the chain complexes of decay, which is very particular. Of dk, which is a very particular angle. And we can understand how the Rosmussen invariant behaves when we glue these two tangles together. And we work mod2 because these multi-curves are best developed over F2. But our expectation is that the theorems work over every characteristic basically with the same proof. Just the technology hasn't been developed far enough yet. But yeah. Uh, yeah, it should all work for all characteristics, so for all Rasmus invariants, but we have no clue whether it holds for all slice torus invariants or if it does, how to prove it. Linearity Yeah let's yeah let's let's not get into into too much detail. Okay, so I had some because I thought we need some because of a conference title we need some topological interpretations. I had one but I have no time sorry and also this invariant theta is somewhat mysterious to us so we have these theorems but aside from that we don't But aside from that, we can compute it fairly well. So we have some computational conjectures. We have a conjecture how it looks for torus knots, how it looks for alternating knots. Weirdly, it's divisible by four. We don't know why. So yeah, there's lots left to understand beyond these two theorems. Thanks. Okay, any questions? Just at the beginning, we said it's divisible with Just so at the end, when you say it's divisible by four, do you mean that in all computations it has been divisible by four, or you can prove it's divisible by four? I mean, this is just a computational observation. You see, here it's divisible by four, here it's divisible by four. We can have computed maybe for 100 knots. It's always divisible by four, but only in characteristic two. So that's up. I don't know. Thanks. Let me just very quickly mention that the Rasmus invariant is the. Quickly mention that the Rasmus invariant is divisible by two, but that has nothing to do with this invariant being divisible by four, like Rasmus invariant being divisible by two. That's just convention. Yeah. Would you say a moment or take a moment to say your topological interpretation? Oh, yeah. Yes. Thank you. I'm happy to do it. I won't write, I mean, that would be a bit cheating. I won't write the full proof. But here's a corollary. So this was a question asked by Matt Hedden and Joenita. Met Hedden and Juenita in San Calcedo last year, there exists a knot such that the positive white double of the knot and the negative white double of the knot generate a Z2 summant of the smooth concordance group. So that's something we can we can show. We can show using that theta tau is a homomorphism and theta two is a homomorphism. What's the knot? So the knot is the knot is two copies of T34, two connected sum of two copies and sorry, what did Sorry, what did I write here? Like this connected sum of two copies of the 3, 4 torus knot and five copies of the minus 2, 3 torus knot. That's the knot. And the point is you can see from this table that this has strictly positive tau but strictly negative theta 2. And that's enough to show this. You mentioned possibly a slice genus bound and also divisibility by four. So would this you conjecture slice genus bound might come by dividing these numbers by four or something? Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't conjecture that because I have, I mean, I don't really see any reason why this should be true. But for all examples that we have computed and also Examples that we have computed, and also that we could come up with using connected sums. Theta divided by 4 is a lower bound to the slice genus. But we don't really know why that should hold, so I wouldn't conjecture it. And yeah, exactly. So, I mean, that bound might not be an integer, for example, for An integer, for example, for theta zero here, but can still be in bound. A bound speaking of non-integer things, for slice torus invariants that don't necessarily take integer values, is there any sort of game you can play along these lines, potentially? Yeah, so that's a very interesting question I find. So you can modify the definition of slice torus invariance that I wrote on the board simply by also allowing homomorphisms from the smooth concordance group to the reals. The smooth concordance group to the reals or to the rationals, whatever. So that gives you a larger class. And that's also a somewhat natural class. For example, there are some invariants you get from SLN homologies that don't take integer values. Some do, some also take fractional values. So it's a class that really makes sense to consider. Makes sense to consider. But if you try to play the same game, you get a problem here because there could be multiple jumps. So all our argumentations work like you are in this horizontal strip, you are monotonically decreasing, but you know you can take more than two values, so you could have like something jumping several times by a jump of less than one. By a jump of less than one. And in fact, if you allow homomorphisms to R, you can just take convex linear combinations of slastorus invariants. You will again get a slice torus invariant. So, you know, by taking convex linear combinations of these three, you can actually realize having multiple jumps. So I think that's an interesting question, but it probably has a more complicated answer than what we did here. Thanks very much. Thanks very much. So I guess pattern needs to be wrapping number two and winding number zero. And it seems like this is sort of the proper generalization of whitehead double for some reason. I don't know. Or I guess it's because you really only want four ended tangle because that's where. Four-ended tangle because that's where you have some kind of classification. But is there a theorem? Is there some kind of like definition for a pattern with wrapping number blah, maybe probably still winding number zero that satisfies something else in which you could play this game with a different, you know, with something that's not just wrapping number two? Or do you think it really is something very special? Or is, or do you think it really is something very special about the tangle being four-ended? Yeah, that's a great question. Thanks. So, yes, as you guessed correctly, the reason we are considering wrapping number two is that this classification by Kutelsky-Watson-Cybrovius works for four in the tangles. So, if we want to use tangles to understand satellites, as we do here, we need wrapping number two. In fact, In fact, winding number zero is not that essential. We can show similar theorems for winding number plus minus two and wrapping number two. It's just, you know, the talk is only so long. And it's a bit different here. You know, it's not roughly constant as it is here with a jump, but it's roughly linear or affine. But you can play a very similar game. We get similar theorems which are. We get similar theorems which are though a bit more complicated, but yeah. So the reason for winding number zero is just I wanted to give a talk with only these theorems. Oh, that's awesome. And so higher wrapping number, I mean, it should be possible to do something, but I haven't thought that much about it, so I can just speculate. I mean. Speculate. I mean, probably you can do something similar, but maybe there will be more jump points, also on. But I mean, it should be possible to do something. But it doesn't seem likely from what I understand that the classification of the complexes for end detangles will easily generalize. So, if you want to really prove something and not just experiment for higher wrapping numbers. Just experiment for a higher wrapping number, then you might need other tools. But for example, for tau, for the tau invariant, you can, if I remember correctly, you can, if epsilon is equal to zero, then you can say that tau of p of k is just tau of tau of k, something like this. So, I mean, there are things you can do, but okay, that's a small class with that standard as a row. So, yeah, thanks. Awesome. Thank you. I was just trying to do a calculation in my head. I'm not sure if this is going anywhere. But what happens if you iterate this special type of pattern? Oh, so you want to take a pattern of a pattern, like iterate satellite? Yeah, so that's a cool question. So this is, for example, something that can often be done with Tau and Higger-Fleur homology. So, for example, these results by Hobb. Who actually determines tau of cables using epsilon, and that's something you can iterate. And here we just have no idea. So it would be interesting to know. We can't really experiment because when you take a satellite twice, it just becomes too big to calculate using a computer. And we thought a little bit about it, but we couldn't do anything conceptually. Conceptually, so that's an open question. Okay, thank you. Okay, one more question. I guess there's a actually, maybe I should ask you later. I was just wondering what happens if you do like links for. Links for some simple version of the S invariant for links. And then, if you do like, you know, Bing doubling or something, but you have to sort of not pair foreign tangles. You'd have to kind of really go into the bordered theory and glue a bunch of them together. Is there any, has there, have you done anything with that? Um, I don't think we've really done anything like that, but definitely does I now that. that but it definitely does i now that i think about it sounds extreme it's as long as you i mean links you have the rasmus invariant the links you should you should be able to do things about links here and like bing doubling or some other operations as long as you can understand it using foreign detangles then there's a good chance you can you can do something with these methods but but understanding how that invariant um is related to when you you glue the two tangles together as opposed to multiple ang tangles in sequence. Angle in sequence is a big difference, right? Well, I find that a bit hard to answer in such a generality. Okay, never. I'll think about that later. Yeah, yeah, maybe ask me later. That would be great.
