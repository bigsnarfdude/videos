Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. So yeah, so since this is a broad audience, I thought instead of talking about all the details of one thing, I thought I'd give multiple examples of how probability theory can help in hyperbolic geometry. It's supposed to be accessible, but I don't know exactly what everyone's background. But I don't know exactly what everyone's background is, so please don't hesitate to stop. And if I get to it, this is all about joint work with Toma Britzensky and Nicola Kurian. Another project that Maxime Forte, they're both in, so Toma is in Lyon and Nicola in Paris, Maxime Fautier Bourg of the University of Montreal, and Mikuniu in Luxembourg. Okay, so the reason I am, or one of the main reasons I am. Am, or one of the main reasons I am interested in probabilistic methods in hyperbolic geometry is extremal problems. So, my plan is to first tell you about some really simple-minded extremal problems in hyperbolic geometry, and then about where concrete comes in. So, the stuff I'm going to talk about basically are well-posed problems in any dimension. Very soon, I'll just restrict the surfaces. Be a talk about random. Surfaces. There'll be a talk about random three manifolds later, but I'll just restrict to surfaces. So, extremal problems, the question is just I pick some geometric invariant of interest and I ask how large or how small it can be if I put, say, the bound on the volume of the manifold. So I fix a hyperbolic, closed hyperbolic manifold X. Also, this, you can, I mean, this works. Most of these problems make sense in finite volume as well. And then, well, the examples of geometric invariance that I'm going to talk about are the system. So, that's something I'm going to try to draw in this picture: the shortest length of the shortest closed GDC on the surface. So, if they have our, sorry, on the manifold. So, if it looks like this, then the system is probably the length of that curve over there. You can also ask for the kissing number, which is just the number of curves that realize the system. Number of curves that realize this stuff. It doesn't need to be unique, short plus geodesic. This terminology, kissing number, comes from Euclidean geometry, from problems of packings in Rn. It's by analogies introduced by Schmutz, who thought a lot about these problems. Another simple-minded geometric invariant is the diameter, so the maximal distance between any pair of points on the manifold. Then there's the Cheeger constant, which is an isomper. Constant, which is an isoparametric constant, it essentially asks how hard it is to cut the surface in two. So, concretely, what you do is that you look at sub-manifolds like y over here that you might want to cut out, and then you measure how hard it is to cut it off, which means that you look at the ratio of the d minus one-dimensional volume of the boundary divided by the volume of the sub-manifold. And then, because when I cut out y, I also cut out its complement, you only look at Cut out its complement, you only look at sub-manifolds of at most half the whole. So, this is some measure, just like the diameter, some measure of connectivity of the surface, how connected the manifold is. And then other examples that I won't really talk about, but I wanted to mention anyway. This is my impression of a vibrating surface. And our other invariants are spectral invariants. You can look at the Laplacian on the hyperbolic manifold, it's a Riemannian manifold, so it comes with a Laplacian. Manifold, so it comes with a bluff minus divergence of the gradient. It acts on smooth functions. And if your manifold is closed, this operator has a discrete spectrum. It starts at zero, because the gradient already annihilates constant functions. That has multiplicity one, and then there's a next eigenvalue. And it's interesting to know, even if you only care about geometry, it's interesting to know how large it's. You can also see this as a measure of connectivity. For instance, related to the Tiger constant. Relates to the Jiger constant, it also relates to the speed of mixing the geodesic flow, for instance. So, if the spectral gap is very large, then the geodesic flow mixes very rapidly. So, this surface here, this would be one with a very small spectral gap, because it takes a while before the geodesic flow, if you start here, takes a while before it goes through the bottom back here. This would be a small spectral gap, a small Tiger constant, and because of hyperbolic geometry was a large spectral gap. Because of hyperbolic geometry, it's a large payout. So the natural extremal problems are: if I fix the volume, how large can I make the system, and how large can I make the number of GD6, realizing it, the kissing number? So with a bit of, in dimension two, with a bit of trigonometry, it's not so hard to see that the opposite problems are not interesting. So I can find a hyperbolic surface of genus two with arbitrarily small system, and just one GDC realizing it. I've called this hyperbolic packing and kissing number problems because they're really, I mean, they're hyperbolic analogues of lattice packing problems. So if you look at a packing in the Euclidean space by balls at the same radius, exercise. Actually, you've never seen this. So if I've a packing by balls of Reach by bowls of so packing means you have bowls of the same radius who whose interior is a disjoint. It's called a lattice packing if the centers form a lattice. So I'm trying to draw the packing associated to the Z2 lattice here. And you given a lattice, you have a natural packing associated to it. You just make the radius as large as you possibly can before the balls start intersecting each other. And the exercise is that. So, the natural question in this case is how dense can I vector? What is the maximal proportion of space that I can fill up with my disks? So, that you would measure like this. So, lambda is my lattice. I'd look at the following limit, I look at the volume of the balls in the packing. Of the balls in the packing intersected with some fixed, some ball of arc radius around the origin divided by the volume of that ball. And then I let the radius tensor infinite. That gives you a notion of density. That's the definition in the exercise is that associated to a lattice I have a flat torus. The lattice acts on the on Euclidean space by translations. This preserves the Euclidean metric. So the quotient is a torus with a flat metric on it. Quotient is a torus with a flat metric on it. It has a system, the length of the shortest close 2D sign on it. And exercise, this density is exactly, what is it, the volume of a bulb of radius 1 in Euclidean space divided by 2 to the power n times the system, so the sh length of the shortest class UV sigma is torus to the power n divided by the volume of the torus. divided by the volume of the choice. So this is the so I'm asking the hyperbolic version of this, which is really some version of the backing problem. Likewise, so why essentially why is this true? Because the geodesics that correspond to straight segments connecting at the lattice points, right? So the so the number, so that's why the system is essentially the shortest lattice vector. And the kissing number And the kissing number, what's the kissing number in the usual sense? It's the number of bowl tangent to any given one. So this one would have kissing number four, which is exactly the number of, this is actually not the one realizing the system, it's exactly the number of shortest life screens. So exactly the number of GD6 auditoriums realized on the system. That's where the terminology comes from. But I want to just talk about the hyperbolic context. Then, likewise, there's the covering problem. If I fix the lower bound in this time on the volume, how small can I make the diameter? Also, a very simple-minded question. And again, using a bit of hyperbolic tranomy, at least here in really dimensions, anything, it's not hard to see that you yeah, it's not at least in dimension two it's not hard to see that you can make the diameter arbitrarily large, uh uh fixing the genus. Fine genus two surfaces for arbitrarily large diameter. For a fairly large diameter. So, minimal diameter is a natural question. There's an analogous problem in platinum infometry, too. And likewise, you can ask: how connected can I make the surface? How large can I make this isoparametric constant? And likewise, how large can I make the spectral gap? And its multiplicity. So, the number of dimensions of the eigenspace corresponding to the altitude. Okay. So, okay. So, I don't have time to do a survey of all the history of these problems. Survey of all the history of the study's problems in hyperbolic geometry. Also, they have a long history, there's lots of previous works. I cited some, somewhat random selection of authors. So, the moral of this slide, I'm not going to ask you to retain much of this slide, but just the moral of this slide is we know very little. So, here's the, to the best of my knowledge, here's the full list of known maximizers. So, now I'm going to really restrict the surfaces. Restrict the surfaces. So, as you can see, it's very short, it says conjecture a lot of times as well. So, for the sysle, we know the answer in genus 2. The answer is that it's uniquely realized by what is called the Voltsa surface. I drew a picture of a fundamental domain on the right there. One way to define it is to say: so, if I take a closed hyperbolic surface of genus G, there's a universal upper bound on the size of its. Universal upper bound on the size of its isometry group. It's always a finite group and there's a universal upper bound on it. Maybe you've, I mean, you don't think about hyperbolic geometry often. This is the same as the Hurbert's bound on the number of conformal automorphisms of a Riemann surface. And the Bolted surface is the unique realizer of that. So it's the most symmetric. That's one way to define it. It's the unique surface of genus two that has forty eight orientation preservative quantities. Orientation preserved is quantities. That's one not very helpful way of finding it. You can also say you take a radio option in the hyperbolic plane, interior angles pi over 4, and then you glue opposite sides together. It gets your genus 2 surface with a hyperbolic metric on it. And that's the Boltza surface. The curves, the triangulation that you see of the fundamental domain, is actually given by the systems. So also, for instance, this. So, for instance, this curve here just glues up to a closed curve in the quotient, and it's one of the sixes. It happens to be one of the six. So, there's 12 distinct curves, and I've written 24 because it's common to count them with orientation just because that corresponds to what the Euclidean case is. Then for lambda one, so for the spectral questions, we don't for lambda one, we don't have a single example. Have a single example of a genus where we know what the maximizer is. They're very good bounds on lambda one and genus two and three, so you'd expect that come very close to numerics that we have for two of the best surfaces. So the Klein quartic, by the way, this is a fundamental domain for the Klein quartic. It's a 14-gone. The way you define the surface, so there's a symmetry definition as well that you can say I label the size 1 up to 14, I glue. Sides 1 up to 14. I glue side number 1 to side number 6. And then this thing has an order 7 rotational symmetry. And I want the gluing to be preserved under that, that defines it uniquely. You can also say it's the unique surface of genus 3 with 168 isometries, which is maximal. It's the first surface realizing the Herbitz valve. And these isometries, you can see the isometries in the picture. So there's a 7-gone here in the middle. Seven gone here in the middle, so this rotational symmetry of order seven that descends to the surface by definition of my gluing. And if you stare at this long enough, you see 24 seven gods, all of whose rotational symmetries descend to the surface, and 24 times 7 is 168. But that gives one quartic. Suppose V the best for lambda 1, then for the multiplicity, it's also a funny story. They're the only There, the only case that we know of, where we know to solve it, is genus 3. Somewhat embarrassingly, we don't know how to do genus 2. So, the proof in genus 3 goes by proving an upper bound and then figuring out what the multiplicity of the Klein quartic is and seeing that they match. And in genus 2, it's just the fact that the Boltza surface has multiplicity 3, as we can prove, and the best upper bound we have. We can prove that the best upper bound we have is six. And then in higher genus, there's so again in dimension two, if you fix the topology, you have a different space, so you can ask for local maximizers as well. And we know a whole bunch of them in higher genus. Global maximizers. All right, any questions about this? If not, then the plan was, so the plan for the rest of the talk is to talk about two of these extremal problems and how random methods help. And how random methods help. So, the first one is the system. Length of the shortest plus 2D sig. Here I put a reminder: the fact that the moduli space is 6G minus 6-dimensional overfold. So, just saying that to say that if I fix the genus, I have lots of hyperbolic surfaces. It's known that it admits a global maximum. It's not known that this is unique necessarily, but it's known that it admits a global maximum. And moreover, so this is a little bit of motivation for why you might care. For why you might care about this question is a topological Marx function on moduli spaces. That means that theoretically we could try to understand. So, the topology of moduli space is very complicated, so we could try to understand the critical points of the function and say something about the topology. You've seen from the table before that this is a very useless project, right? Because we can't even find the maximizers, let alone all the critical points. Anyway, um okay, so now okay, so now I actually want to prove something. So now, okay, so now I actually want to prove something. So I want to start with: so, what should you expect for this maximum? So, these random methods usually work well for asymptotics. So, you look at genus tending to infinity, for instance. And the first thing I wanted to explain is that the system of a hyperbolic service genus G is at most logarithmic. Okay, so that's the lemma. This is elementary. So, how do you? Elementary. So, how do you prove this? You take any point in the surface, the point here, and you grow a disc around it. And then, so in the beginning, this is isometric to a disc in the hyperbolic plane. At some point, it starts overlapping, like here in the back. And at that point, what you found is two radii that meet. So, you found the closed curve of length at most twice the radius. This is a competitor for the system. So, conclusion: if I go up the length at most system over 2, then the disk is still isometric to open disk is still isometric to the disk and diagnosed plane. So I can compute this area, which is given by this formula here. And the only thing, well, what can I say? I know that the area is most area of the surface, right? And the area of the surface by the Gas Bonnet formula. Surface by the Gauss-Bonnet formula. You can compute it. It's linear in the Euler, it's linear in the genus. And then, if you take arc hyperbolic cosines, you can just point it out here, but it's a nasty looking formula. And then as g tends to infinity, it's roughly 2 log g plus a constant additive error terminal. You'll see in a second why I'm making a point of that, plus something that tends to zero. Okay, so this is the reason I'm making a point of the additive error. The reason I'm making a point of the additive error term is that this is not entirely the state of the art. So, first of all, in the 90s, Bavar proved an improvement. He's also a claused formula. And you see, so what it comes down to is an additive improvement of 0.09 in the additive error term. And then more recently, Max and I worked very hard to shave off another 0.27 from the additive error term. But the bad news is. But the bad news is that we don't know that this is even somewhat expected that this two here is not optimal. So we're all working really hard to improve the additive error term. We don't even know that two here is optimal. Oh yeah, okay. And this I just wanted to show because it was done with a computer. So our bound, I won't really go into it. It's very heavily inspired by methods coming from Sphere Pack. Inspired by methods coming from sphere packing. It uses its linear programming based on the self-retrace formula. But in particular, it lends itself to numerical optimization. So the plot you see here, so in red you see Glavach bound, except in genus 2 where we know the maximizer, which is the previous best normal bound. In blue is us, which so it's our blue, it's numerics, but we certified it a posterior with interval arithmetic. And in green, they're the best. And in green, they're the best-known examples. They all come from triangle surfaces. Just like you saw the bolt surface in the Klein quartic, they come from these nice triangulations. And the best-known surfaces come from triangles. The point of the talk is, oh yeah, sorry, before I get to random, just to show you how sort of little we know, we don't even know this. So we know, I'll say this in a second, we know that there are surfaces with logarithmic system, but we don't even know. We don't even know whether this limit exists, whether the logarithmic growth rate of the system exists. What we do know is that the limit supremum is at least 4 thirds. This comes out of arithmetic constructions. You take principal congruence covers of a fixed arithmetic surface. These are very sparse. If you look at the sequence among the sequence of genera you get, these are very sparse. So you just get something on the limit supreme. Get something on the limit supreme. But Buzer and Sarnak, so this is by Brooks and Buzer and Sarnak. Buzer and Sarnak also proved a non-effective version of this, but they proved that the limit in femurum is strictly positive. So you have something of logarithmic system every genus. And recently this was made effective by Katz and Sagorbo, and they proved roughly a lower bound of one over six. So it's quite far apart, these two bounds. Mr. Plot. Okay. And so now. Yes. So with Minkun, we asked the question, well, how about random constructions? The idea is that this is very well known on the graph theory, for instance. The probabilistic method, if it's hard to construct explicit examples of something with extremal properties, you try to do it around. You define some model for your object, some probabilistic model. Probabilistic model, and you hope to prove that with positive probability it has the extremal property that you look for, and that gives you the existence of hyperbolic surfaces, in this case with extremal. That's the idea. So, first the bad news. The bad news is that there are plenty of models for hyperbolic surfaces out there. For instance, you can do something with random triangulations. You can also randomly pick a point in moduli space. There's a nice probability measure on it coming from the Web-Peterson volume form. The Willow Peterson volume form. You can also take a fixed base surface, and then you look at degree D covers. So if I fix a base surface, a compact base surface, and a degree D, there's finitely many covers. So I can pick one uniformly at random. And all these models are well studied, and we know in all of them that the system is asymptotically bound. So it's not even not growing logarithmically, it's not growing at all. It's not growing at all. So, the expected system tends to constantly not this model. So, if you want this, you need to set the model up for it. And this is what we did with Minkoon. We found some models heavily inspired by things that exist in graph theory of surfaces with a lot of technical. So, one of the before I get to describing them, I just want to say there's a deterministic consequence of this. We can improve, we can improve the improvement. We can improve Katz and Sabo-Ohs bound by a little bit. So, the limit in FEMUM of this limit that we don't know that exists is at least two over nine. They had one over six, roughly, so it's a small improvement. And so, the idea of proof is exactly, as I said, you build a surface at random, one for every genus, and then you show, I didn't want to get into what the model does, but then you show that it has a width-positive problem, actually, the problem is. With positive probability, actually, with probability tending to one, it has this lower bound, which gives you existence. And we give this statement on the limit of the what I should say is it's based on random triangulations combined with ideas from graph theory. So this is a model for random graphs due to Liniel and Simkin, which also saw one agree, that does a similar. So in graph theory, there's a parallel story. You fix You fix a degree in a number of vertices, and you ask, you look at the length of the system. In graph theory, it's called the curve, the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. You ask how large can this be? It will fix the degree in the number of vertices. And the state of the art is very comparable to the hyperbolic surface. We know surprisingly little about this. But there's a random model which Minkam and I adapted to the hyperbolic geometry. Okay, but what I want Okay, but what I wanted to talk about, I actually want to prove something, is another model again coming from covers. So I just said that a random cover doesn't have a large system, but a random cover is also not at all regular. So a random cover just corresponds to a random index n subgroup of your fundamental group of the surface. Typically, this is not a normal subgroup. There are very few normal subgroups on the surface. So the question is, what if we set them up to be regular? Do we set them up to be regular? So, what you do is you fix a base surface, some sequence of finite groups, and you try to build a regular covers with that group Gn. This is how do you do this? So, first, okay, first some notation. So, I pick, I mean, I identify my fundamental group with some Fouxian group acting on the hyperbolic plane. And what I really do is I look at is I look at the set of homomorphisms to this finite group from my fundamental group. Note this is a finite set because how do I describe a homomorphism? I just need to compute the images of the generators. Right? Then because everything is worded in the generators I can compute all the other images. So the set of homomorphisms is nothing else than the set of two G tuples of elements in my finite group that satisfy the relation coming from the circle. Coming from the surface. So I can pick an element uniformly at random, and I just take the kernel of the homomorphism. And that gives me a normal subgroup. If the homomorphism is surjective, which turns out to be typical for the groups we look at, then this is a regular cover with that group G. Any questions so far? I'm not used to giving slide talks, so I don't know whether I'm going way too fast or way too slow. And again, there's an analogous model in graph theory, which is random KD graphs. You take your sequence of finite groups, and you fix the degree you want for the KD graph, and then you just pick D. Graph, and then you just pick D over two elements in your group, and you can graph with that set of elements, which is connected if and only if the set of elements you picked is a generating set for your finite group. And this also turns out to be typical. Okay, so what I wanted to explain is that, so there are many sequences of groups you could look at. Maybe the most. I mean the easiest thing to control would be abelian groups, but you're never going to get system growth out of that. If I look at a map to an abelian group, then this factors through them onto the surface. X. Right, and so whatever this kernel is of this map, it's Is of this map, it contains the kernel of this map, which contains lots of closed curves that are going to put uniform upper bounds on the surface. So that doesn't work. But what turns out to work very well, which also works very well in the graph theory case, is you take finite groups of lead types. So you take, for instance, SL2 over a finite field. And you let the size of the field tend to influence. Then, so this again is a pretty sparse sequence of genera that you get, but what we do get Genera that you get, but what we do get is logarithmic growth with an explicit constant. So the goal the next hopefully 10 minutes is to explain away this nature. But before that, another very natural question, a sequence of groups to look at is symmetric groups or alternating groups, if you want. And typically, this is much harder for these kinds of questions. So, what we can show is that it's already non-trivial, but It's already non-trivial, but if I take, if I replace my sequence of groups with the sequence of symmetric groups, then the system does tend to infinity, but we don't get any good rates basically out of this. It'll be interesting to know how it works with intercommunications. Okay. All right. So then, okay, so let me try to sketch where this comes from. So then what's the big difference between my Difference between my finite groups of Li-Taik and symmetric groups is that you can use a little bit of algebraic geometry. The crucial thing is that this thing now is a collection of matrices that satisfy a certain polynomial equation. This equation here is polynomial in the coefficients of the matrix. So it's a nice, it's an algebraic variety, and you can use that. This is what's missing from the symmetric. Okay, so how do you do this? Okay, so how do you do this? So the idea is to bound the probability of the bad set. So I fix some r and I want to look at the probability that the system of my cover is at most r. So how do I do that? Well, the GUD6 of my cover, they come from their lifts of GUD6 below. So I can just perform a simple union bound. I can just say I sum over all the GD6 on a hyperbolic surface, corresponding one. On the hyperbolic surface, correspond one-to-one to contribute classes in the group. But some over all geodesics of length at most R, and just ask what's the probability that lifts, what's the probability that persists in the fundamental group of my cover. So this you can compute in terms of these sets of homomorphisms. What is this? This probability is just a set of number of homomorphisms. So it's the number of homomorphisms that map my preferred element in the quantity C class to the identity divided by that's the probability. And now, why is it good that this set is now an algebraic variety? Because that helps counting the number of elements. What's the rough idea? So here it gets a bit. Here it gets a bit vague, but there's a way to make this rigorous. But the idea is that if I have an algebraic variety which has dimension something, then the number of points you expect over a finite field of size p is roughly p to the power of the dimension. Think of a bad way to count the number of elements in SL2Z mod PZ. So this is a dimension three group, sorry, yeah, dimension three group, right? It's two by two matrices. I have four numbers, one condition, determinant equals to one. One condition determinant equals to one. So, how would I count this? I fill something in for the first coefficient, the second, and the third, and then I try to repair the determinant with the last one. So, and that's typically, I mean, determinants, quadratic equation, you don't have so many solutions to that. So, you'd expect roughly p cubed, so p to the power dimension elements across the way when you evaluate this on z1 p z. So, why is this good? Because Um because that means, so this uh okay, this is an algebraic variety, this is an algebraic sub-variety, right? Uh asking that my homomorphism evaluates the identity. This is a polynomial equation in my general approach, right? I'm just asking, so let me just do this. Okay, so my set of homomorphisms was just a set of two G tuples that satisfy. Just a set of two G tuples that satisfy this relation. And what am I asking? So suppose gamma is the conjugacy class of the word, I don't know, A1 and B1, then this subset here, this is just a set. Let me call this subset V gamma. No, just write it. So then, So then phi p in on gamma gp such that phi p of gamma is identity. This is just the set of phi p in home, or when you write it in terms of these matrices, so this is a set of A1 up to BG in SL in GP such that what is it, A1 Uh well, this is A1 times B1. Right, so this is some equation in the coefficients of the matrix, so that's some polynomial equation in these coefficients, so some sum. So in particular, if the number of elements is supposed to be roughly p to the power dimension, the nice thing about electrical properties is, so now there's a bit of things that come in, but this thing is irreducible under the conditions that we set. So that means it's a sub-variety, if you think of it, is automatically of lower dimension. If you cut out, if you're in Rn, you cut out something with a polynomial, that's of lower dimension. In particular, you'd expect this ratio to be roughly 1 over P. That's the right dimension, or at most 1 over P. Now, we also know the number of terms. Because the number of terms, again, I'm summing over the geodesics of the base surface. Over the geodesics of the base surface whose length is submerged r. This is very classical hyperbolic geometry that this corros exponentially by e to the power r over r. So the probability of the system is at most r is e to the power r over r times p. So as soon as r is less than log of p, this tends to zero. That's the end of the problem. And log, because log of p, again, the number of elements of SL2 is roughly p cubed, and the degree of the genus. And the degree of the cover genus multiplies roughly by the degree of the cover. So log of phi is one-third log of genus. Okay, so that's one way that probably can, even if unfortunate, what's a little too bad is that we don't get we don't improve so that again the here Here. It's already known that you can find sequences of surfaces of genomes whose system is four-thirds times time log of D, we just get one-third. We do get more of them, but unfortunately, we don't improve on the deterministic question. I have 10 more minutes, is correct? Okay. Okay, so if there are no questions about the system, then I wanted to talk about another extremal problem. Problem. If it lost track, then it should be roughly self-containing from now, which is the diameter problem. So this is a case where actually the system was joined with Mink Puy, now this is going to be joint with Nikola Kuria and Tomo Pitzensky. And this is a case where actually the probabilistic method does give you the optimal result. So first, I wasn't planning to improve this. So exercise, there's a similar Exercise, there's a similar. I proved this elementary lemma on the system, right? So, out of the growth of volumes of disks, I get a logarithmic upper bound on the system. I also get a logarithmic lower bound on the diameter. The idea is just that if I take a ball of radius diameter, it covers the whole surface. But maybe I'll make the proof as an exercise. And again, there's an improvement in the same paper by Bavar, who improves on the additive constant. Constant. And here, I mean, here's not so strange that the improvement is not, and the multiplicative constant, because it turns out that it's optimal. So, this really simple growth of area argument gives you optimal diameter, gives you, I mean, asymptotically, the optimal bound. So, this is what I want to spend the last 10 minutes on. So, it's again based on the random. Again, based on the random construction. So, the idea is just, I mean, we have a lower bound. So, to get an upper, to get to prove the limit, I mean, the lower, from this little lemma, we have that the limit is at least one. It exists. To prove that it equals one, you just need the sequence of surfaces with really small data. This is where the random instructions come in. So, here's the random instruction. Again, I should have maybe listed that as an open question. Listed that as an open question. Here, the usual models are also very good for the diameter question. They have very small diameter. For the random triangulations, it's known that it's off by a factor two. But for the other models, it seems pretty reasonable to conjecture that it's actually also if you've got to model rate. But this is open. It is known that diameter growth locally. So, to prove this, we use a different model. This we use a different model, also a simple combinatorial model. So, what's the idea? It's drawn on the slide. So, you take, so hyperbolic surfaces can build them out of pairs of paths. So, hyperbolic surfaces homeomorphic to a sphere with three disks removed with a total GDC metric on it. And hyperbolic trigonometry tells you that if actually, if I give you the lengths of the boundary components, that gives you the metric. That gives a unique metric. There's a unique metric on a pair of paths for any triple boundary components. And we're just going to set them all equal to some number A, some positive number A. That defines PA. And then we're going to build a random surface by randomly matching up the boundary components of these pairs of pads. And that gets you a surface. You have to say how you can, then they're the same length, so I can glue them, but I have to say how to glue them because there's a twisting parameter to fix. Parameters to fix. I'm just going to set all the twists equal to zero. So the randomness is just in the combinatorics of the volume. So what we really prove is this. So what we really prove is that these surfaces have really small diameter. So we fix A and let the genus tend to infinity. And then the diameter is at most 1 plus epsilon. The claim is that if you let A tend to infinity, If you let a tend to infinity, you can let epsilon tend to zero. So that proves that you can extract a sequence that realizes the math. Now, I was supposed to convince you that this is enough for the theorem. From here, I want to assume it's clear. Alright, so what's how do you do this? So here's a ah here's a here's a picture of an infinite volume hyperbolic surface. Of an infinite volume hyperbolic surface, what we call the tree of pants. So you just take countably many copies of this pair of pants PA, you glue them into the pattern of a simplicial tree all with degree 3, all with twists 0. So locally your surface looks like this. And so there's two things to prove: one probabilistic that I don't have the time to explain, but it says that. But it says that around most copies of PA, sorry, I pick a random copy of PA in this surface, then up to reasonable depth, so depth here I mean I just look at the other copies of this pair of pants, a distance of multiple mu g roughly, it looks like this. So why, for instance, why, so let me give you some intuition for why that might be true. The idea is just if I fix one pair of pants, so if I wanted to go wrong at the first generation. If I wanted to go wrong with the first generation of three, what do I need to do? I need to blue, for instance, this boundary to that boundary, right? I have, so this is one pair of pants, so there's roughly 3G minus 4 other guys left. No, sorry, 2G minus 3, whatever, linear in G left. So the probability that I glue this to this is 4 to 1 over 3. So it's pretty unlikely that I can be this. At least at the first step, it looks like a tree. And sort of this this simple combinatorial argument, it turns out this holds up to that roughly combined. To that roughly 100. Crucial that it does up to this depth. And then there's a geometric argument, a geometric thing to do. Namely, we need a counting result, which was known. So what can I do? I can pick a midpoint on my pair pants PA, which gives me countably many midpoints in this tree. And what I want to know is I want to know in the hyperbolic metric on this tree, how many points do I see a distance r from my See the distance r from my favorite one. This is the this this this is the geometric input so let me first how much time do I have? Four minutes let me say let me say how the plan so the plan for the next four minutes is to say how you get the geometric input and how you patch it together into the proof of the claim. So first let's look at this. Take a right-angled hyperbolic hexagon whose uh that has That has three non-consecutive sides of length a over 2. This is enough to determine the hexagon. And look at the reflection group and the sides. So if I let this, here's my hexagon. If I let this reflection group act, I get this tree of hexagons in the hyperbolic plane. And I can ask the counting question there. And there we know it. I can ask, I take the orbit of my favorite point, maybe in the hexagon, maybe not, doesn't matter. Hexagon, maybe not, doesn't matter. I let the group act and I intersect it with a ball of radius r, just ask how many points do I see. And this, the key word, is Patterson-Sullivan theory. You can figure out how this grows. It grows exponentially with a rate that depends on this parameter A, that was the boundary length. That's due to Patterson. And then McMullen proved that if I let A tend to infinity, If I let A tend to infinity, then this constant tends to 1, this delta A. Why should you expect this? This delta A here, what is this? So my tree defines some limit set on the circle, right? Which is some counter set. And if I let A tend to infinity, what happens is that my hexagon slowly converges to an ideal right angle, sorry, an ideal hyperbolic triangle. These two sides get shorter, and these three sides get shorter. These three sides get shorter and these three get longer. So it's sort of in some geometric sense converges to the fairy timing. It converges to shear zero or timing with hexagons. And that is generated by a lattice. The reflection group acting is a lattice. So in particular, the limit set fills up the whole circle, and it has a much flat, which is why you should expect this. Yes. Okay, but why does this help us? Because our tree of pants is just two copies of this tree glued together along algorithm identity. If I take one hexagon and I glue them along, so these three are length A over two, these three are some other length. If I glue them along these three, I get exactly my pair of plants PA. So if I, because my tree had twist zero everywhere, if I take two copies of this, then I get the tree, and I get the growth rate, which is. The tree, and I get the growth rate, which is the same. So the growth rate just comes out to this. Okay, and now, why does that help? So now let me, the last couple of seconds, let me say why is this good enough. So first of all, so what do I want to do? I want to show that the diameter of this random surface is small. So what do I want to do? I want to say that if I pick any two pairs of pants in this surface, Two pairs of pants in the surface, then I could connect them up with some short path. That's the goal. And I can might as well, instead of measuring the maximal distance, I might as well measure the distance between the midpoints. It gets me an additive error, but we're only interested in logarithmic growth. So what can I say? Well, with high, because of the probability thing that I've improved, with high probability, up to depth, roughly root of g, it looks like this. Roughly root of g, it looks like this tree. And in this tree, I know how many other pairs of pants I see at distance r. So I can backwards engineer this counting result into saying that the number of pairs of pants that I see in this subsurface that looks roughly like a tree is one over delta A times the log of that G, that root of G, which is one over two delta A. So in particular, So in particular, IS, okay? Okay, so this is the, I see root of G. Okay. I'll pretend not to hear that for 30 more seconds. I see root of G of them at this distance. And then there's another little combinatorial probability thing to prove. But roughly, if I take two pairs of pants, my favorite two, the probability that the share boundary component is roughly one over two. Right? And so the probability Right, and so the problem: if I take root of g times root of g, then I get also g, and because of that, roughly the probability that none of them match tends to zero at a rate that you can make cubically fast. Okay, so what happens is that of these two sub-trees around my favorite pair of pairs of plants, there are some, there's at least one pair that matches. So, in particular, I have a path of length twice this. I have a path of length twice this, which is one over delta A log g. And delta A sorry, delta A tends to one. Delta A tends to one, so this, as A tends to infinity, this tends to one log g. And then because the probability is small enough, I can sum over the, I have g squared pairs that I need to worry about. The probability is one over g cubed that it goes wrong, so it's still one over g after something. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I have a small question: the A N and B N in your G A N the I didn't have to try that. This is a, yeah, I didn't have to. So this is all that, so no, this is not very easy. There's a, in general, if I've, yeah, general, this is a very hard problem. Fix your favorite finitely generated group, some sequence of finite groups, and count the number of homomorphisms from your group into the sequence. This is really hard. But for surface groups, there's a really nice, it's not hard to prove, but too long for a question session, but there's a really For question session, but there's a really nice formula. I'll write it down due to, I think it's not so clear who it's due to, it's either Herbert's or Fabini's, so it's really all. But the number of homomorphisms from a surface group into a finite group, you can write this as sum over the irreducible representations of your finite group, one over the dimension of the representation. Of the representation to the power of 2G minus 2. So, this is a really, it's a nice, it's just what goes into this is just orthogonality relations of characters of representation and a group. So, if you want to sort of understand how many there are, you need to be able to count these things. There's lots of work on this. But we use this work by independently, somewhat, I think, by Mueller and Schweiger Gruft and by Kansch, they count these things. This goes into the Counter sticks, but this goes into the proof of it. So, is anything known about the dimensional variables? Like, for example, I mean, the thing you were talking about with the dynamics, is that something that you can make from alliance by the way? Yeah, so of course you can read sticking together. So, you yeah, so what I so okay, so there's lots to say. So, first of all, the fact that this So, first of all, the fact that this lemma here, this is certainly true. I mean, not with one, but with one over the growth rate of volume in hyperbolic n-space. It's also known in any dimension that you can achieve logarithmic growth using arithmetic methods. Take principal congruence covers of some arithmetic group, and this does this. Then, random models. So, there is one. There is one, so as I'm sure you know, you can do random Hygiene splittings, and there the diameter is linear, as opposed to logarithmic in terms of volume. One thing you can do, which is what Anna will talk about later today a little bit, is you can build random three manifolds of boundary. They do have logarithmic diameter, but it's not known yet what the multiplicative constant is. And if I'd have to conjecture something, I conjecture is all about. Have to conjecture something, and I conjecture this off by a factor four. It's off. So, this is no good model. Counting covers is also really hard. There's no pretty formulas like this in dimension 3. Even of the figure, say the figure 8 knock, which is a reasonably simple presentation, I think no one knows how to count the number of subcurves. But yeah, no, it's a question I like very much, but it's much harder. When you're picking the random covers, are you getting the same cover sometimes? Yeah, we have some results on this. So the answer is you get plenty of different ones. Let's see. Okay, so essentially, actually, for this particular model, we only have it if your base surface is non-arithmetic. Because the thing is that. thing is that so so what's what's the idea? If you have two subgroups that give you the same isoparametric surface, they're conjugate in P cell2r, in particular this element that conjugates them lies in the commensurator of the group of your base surface. So if it's non-arithmetic by Magulus' commensurator criterion, there's only so many options for it. And that gives you that you've roughly And that gives you that you've roughly actually the number of n non i pairwise non-isometric uh covers grows at roughly the same rate as the number of covers. But we don't, if for instance, if for the arithmetic case, we don't know how to do this. I'd expect the answer is the same. Do you need methods for working here on this stuff or concept? No, it's just from a probabilistic point of view, this is this is very simple, uh probability theory. We reconvened at 15 seconds.  I mean some methods are easy. I mean this country also. So we the answer is yes. In our paper we didn't put we did this. So what's easier is the counting. What's worse is that What's worse is that counting this is easier, but if you look at this sub-variety of things where the words is annihilated, the degree of the polynomial that describes that variety depends on the word length of the word, so that's worse for the service. The comparison between television and word length. And also the model. I think the model exists, and I mean the diameter is not the right question. No, it's a big question. Oh yeah, it's all the sort of there are some examples where it's not the case but it's usually very simple. It's even true over compact people. So you have to replace the song by harmony Some buy higher measure on the buttons.
