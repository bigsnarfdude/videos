How is the existence of the formula commission yamier's metric? Please, surely start. Okay, thanks. Thank Professor Lee for your introduction. And I also want to thank the organizer for giving me an opportunity to give a talk here. Today, I will talk about the existence of deformed Hamishi Yang. Of deformed famous young use metric. This is a joint work with Jing. He works in Lenmi University now. Okay, my talk today will be divided into three parts. First, I will introduce the definition of deformed permission Yam Yu's metric. And then I will give some existence result. Finally, I will introduce some Finally, I will introduce some parabolic equation about this deformed Hermitian-Yamut metric. And I also give some long-term existence and convergence result. Okay, first let's recall the definition of deformed Hermitian-Yamus metric. Let X be a compact kind of manifold. compact kind of manifold the dimension of is n and l be the holomorphic line bundle over x we assume the color form is omega now we give a Hermitian metric h on this holomorphic line bundle because this is a line bundle so this metric is just a function it's well known the chunk curvature of of this metric is just the second derivative of log H. That means F equals minus partial partial bar log H. And it's easy to see this channel change is an imaginary one one form on X. That means F bar equals minus F. And we are known the color form is a real one one form. form is a real one one form. So when we take the omega minus f, then these are just a complex one one form. And we take the top n form and over omega n, then this they just a complex function on the manifold. We assume the argument of this complex function is the same. This complex function is a set. Then we define a Hermitian metric H is called a deformed Hermitian-Yamus metric if and only if the argument of this complex function is constant in the sense of a modular 2Ï€. If the argument of this complex function is constant, then it should be. then it should be the argument of the average of this complex function on the manifold. That means if we take the average of this function set on the manifold, then this is a complex number and the argument is we take it sit hatch. If the constant, if the argument If the argument of this complex function is a constant C, then this constant should be C hat. And we can see this number is independent on the choice of the metric because the difference of the curvature of a true metric is just partial bar F. partial partial bar f and the integral of partial partial bar f is zero. So this constant is independent of the choice of the culture of the metric, just depend on the color class and the first class. Okay, this is a definition of a deformed Hermitian young muse metric. So in a trivial case means uh trivial case means uh if for n equals one then this just uh uh hermitian young mus metric so i think in this sense it's this metric it's called deformed homeshin-young-mus metric uh this equation is introduced by uh you and uh uh collins and jacoba so okay so um Okay, so there are three equivalent conditions about this equation. The first one just came from the definition of the argument because the tangent of the argument just is an imaginary part of this complex function over the real part of this complex function. And the third one also comes from the definition. Also, come from the definition. Now, let's see the third equation. If we choose a normal coordinates such that at one point, such that at this point, the current form is identity. And we also can diagnose the curvature at this time, at this point. That means if we assume If we assume the angle value of the culture is lambda one, lambda two lambda n. Then the culture, the matrix or culture, just this diagonal matrix. And in this sense, we can see this complex function just can be written as the product of this n complex. Of this n complex number. And each complex complex function, each complex function, the argument of each complex function is lambda i. So the argument of this complex function just the sum of the argument of this n complex argument. Then the equation. Then the equation is equivalent to the sum of arctangent lambda i equals z hat. Here, the lambda i just the angle value of the chunk curvature. So, this equation it holds in the sense of modula 2 pi. Okay, now this is. Okay, now this is an equation we want to study on the complex compact column manifold. And since this operator arctangent is increasing, so this operator is elliptic. And this equation is similar to the minimal Language submanifold. So if we take If we take the graph of the gradient of some function as the special Landing submanifold, then this function U satisfy the following equation. October in the lambda i, the sum of octane lambda i equals the constant. Here, the lambda i are the angle value of the Hessian. Value of the hash of the second derivative and this equation is in real case and is real. And in our case, our equation is complex. That's different. And this real equation is studied by many mathematicians. And Yuan Yu has many works on this equation. Many works on this equation. Okay, now I want to give some existence results. The first one is n equal to. I mean, in compact color surface, this result is given by Chakopa and Yaw. And they proved if there exists a default commission-muse metric, if and only if on this. And only if on this holomorphic line bundle, there exists a metric at zero, such that this class is positive. This class is defined by a cotangent situat omega plus F0. F0 is the curvature of this H0. And this class also is done depend on the choice of the Of the metric. And on color surface, this equation can be solved because this equation is equivalent to the Mondiar-MPR equation. So it is equivalent in the following equation. And we know by your proof of calabic conjecture, we know if this omega zero is positive, this class is positive. This class is positive, then this equation can be solved. So on color surface, there is a sufficient and necessary condition about the sample of this equation. Okay, in high dimension, in general, there's obstruction and the columns and yaw, they proved. And Yao, they proved if there exists a solution to this deformed Hamiltonian-Ya-Mius equation, then the integral of this n form on the manifold should be away from zero. And this of construction is non-trivial for high dimension. And they construct one county example on the manifold CP3 with one bond. P3 with one bond blow-up. So, in general, we must assume some condition in order to get the existence of this equation. Okay, there are many kinds of conditions. So, the first one is Collins, Jagoba Ya, and Pintali. They give some analytic stability condition. stability condition. So they give some, they give two different definitions of sub solution and they can prove if this equation have the sub so exist a sub solution, then they can get the solution of the deformed Hermitian Yamius metric equation. This is one kind of example. kind of existence result. Both they assume the existence of subsolution, but the definition of subsolution are different. Okay, another algebraic stability condition is given by Gorton and they assume Assume some the integral of some function on the sub-variety is positive, then they can prove the existence. The next result, okay, then Colin Suxia and Yao they proved the following number inequality. This equality involved the culture and the culture square and the culture three. And they assume if there exists a deformed Hermitian metric and this set hat is bigger than pi over two, then they can prove this ten number inequality. This turn-namber inequality. And they conjecture: if this turn-number inequality holds on the manifold, then there should be exist a deformed Hermitian young mouse metric. But now it's still open. And Jing and I proved the number inequality on the color manifold and for the dimension four. For the dimension four. And we also, this chain number inequality was conjectured by Collinson and Yaw. And they believe this chain number inequality is right if the seed hat is bigger than zero pi over two. But finally, we can prove this number inequality and the assumption c is bigger than pi. Ceta is bigger than pi. Okay, in high dimension, this kind of number in quote is very, I think it's very difficult. So it's still open. Okay. Previous work is about the elliptic equation, and you also introduce a parabolic equation. Hybolic equation about this default homogeneous metric. They give an initial metric H0 on this holomorphic line bundle. Then they consider a pass of matrix Ht. Ht equals A minus U T times H zero. The initial value of U is equal zero. So this part of this family of matches. Of this family of metrics is called a Lambundo mean quote flow if they satisfy the derivative of u equals it minus z hat. So we can see it's easy to see if this flow exists for a long time and converged to a limit, then limit should be, should satisfy CT equals C hat. So that's the deformed Hermitian. Deformed Hermione music magic. And they call the derivative of theta is this is a one form. They call this one form is the mean coaching one form. So okay, this is called the Lan Bundle mint flow on the on the Lanbundo. Okay, about first First, this parabolic equation or this flow is just a grading flow of the function of this function. This function is defined by the module of the integral of a module of such. So they can prove this Lamboundo miniq flow is just a grading flow of this. Just a grading flow of this functional. About this function, this parabolic equation, the first result is this. If the first derivative of the curvature is uniformly bounded, then we can prove the higher derivative of the curvature is also bounded. They can prove this by computation the evolution equation of the derivative of the curvature. Now, if the first derivative and the higher derivative of the culture is bounded, then we can get this flow have a subsequence such that this sub-sequence are converted to a smooth solution. To a smooth solution of deformed formation Yamius equation. Okay, this result is like the mingled flow. If the second fundamental form of the sub-manifold is bounded, then we can prove the high derivative of the second fine form is also bounded along the mean curvature flow. Then we can prove. Then we can prove the flow have a long-term existence. Okay, this is the first result. The next result about this parabolic flow is the assumption on this culture. If we assume this culture is lower bounded, is positive is lower bounded and have also above bounded, then About bounded, then the flow also exists for a long time and converges to magic. So, this condition, the partive, the curvature is potent, is part of means this octanging, the operator octanging is concave. Then we can apply Evans Croft estimate to get the C2-bit estimate of the metric. Then we can have the long- Then we can have the long-term existence and the convergence. This result is also due to Jacoba and Yaw. And they also give another condition in order to get the long-term existence. Here they assume the initial theta is bigger than N metric. bigger than n minus one pi over two. This condition means the eigenvalue of the curvature is positive. First, they can prove this condition can be preserved by the flow. Then along the flow, the angle value of the curvature is all partially. Then if the angle value is partially, then this operator is Then this operator is concave, then we also can get the higher estimate and to get the convergence. Okay. Finally, I will give our result. This is a result we've seen. And we consider the stability. We mean that means if the initial Means if the initial metric is close enough to the deformed Hermitian Yamius metric, then we can prove this flow exists for a long time and also converges to the deformed Hameshin Yang metric. Close to the deformed Hamishin Yang Musmatric means the circular means the second derivative of Eu ZO is small in the sense of L infinity. Then we can prove along the flow, this smallness can be preserved by the flow. Then we can get the third derivative of U. Of u, and then we can get the higher derivative estimate of u okay and so the converter exponentially is standard. I think the proof is standard. So, in our case, in our theorem, we don't need to assume the state satisfies. The theta satisfies some conditions. For example, say theta is bigger than n minus one pi over two, or theta is bigger than n minus two pi over two. And so compared to previous work, this is, I think our work is better here. And another thing, I mean the okay, so I the key point of our proof is we need to prove the smallness of the second derivative is preserved by along the Lanbando mean cognitive. Then other things I think is standard. I think it's standard. Okay, I think I will stop here. Thanks. So, thank you, Professor Hai Shaudi, for a very nice talk. There are some questions and comments, please. So, Shali, your assumption is the smallest of the Hessian of the UZ. This condition. Use either this condition is necessary or there are some can you hear me? Yeah, yes, yes. I mean, this condition is a is less real. Okay, so in previous work, in order to get the long-term existence, they must assume the state satisfied. The C to satisfy some condition. For example, C is bigger than N minus one pi over two. So in our case, I think we need to assume this condition. We just need to assume this smallness. We can prove this is preserved by this flow. Okay. This result is some kind of some stability, I think. Okay, okay, good, good. Some more questions and comments, please. So if a lot question, more questions, let us thank Professor Shao Li Han's talk. So next talk will begin about 9.30. The chair of the next section is Professor Han Chin. Professor Hanqing, I'm Professor Han Chi, I will transfer the chat to you. Thank you. I'm here. Okay.

Okay, now that let's start. Wei Ping. Okay. Okay, welcome to the second session of today's workshop. And first speaker is And the first speaker is Professor Weiping Zhang from Chen Institute, Nankai University. The title of his talk is Positive Scalar Curvature on Foliations. Please start, Weiping. Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. So also, I want to make an apology because when I receive invite. Because when I received invitation, I think that I was trying to do something involving the conformal deformation. So I thought I may try to finish something. But turns out that it is still a long way to go. So my talk will not involve this explicit conformal deformation. But anyway, I will try to say something about the positive scale curvature. The scalar curvature on for the agents. So to start with, start with, let me recall the basic concept of the scalar curvature. So let n be a be a let n be a sorry, let n be a Close smooth money for the end take a Riemannian metric for any for any for any point P we take a take a point take a radio take a ball of radius R of any positive number R and then you then you take the volume and then you divide You take the volume and then you divide it by the volume of the ball in the Euclidean space of the same radius. Then when R tend to zero, R to tend to zero, there will be a symptomatic expansion as in the right hand side, and then this coefficient k. then this coefficient k is called the scalar curvature, is called the scalar curvature at this point. This is the basic geometric definition. And the basic question is that when there exists given a manifold, when there exists a remaining match with positive scalar curvature, this question is meaningful because for every manifold of dimension larger. manifold of dimension larger equal to three, there always exists a metric with a negative curvature, negative scale curvature. And indeed, this question on the existence of metrics with positive scalar curvature is highly connected. And there are indeed topological obstructions to such existence. A classical theorem, besides the triple two-dimensional case, a class two-dimensional case a class theorem due to due to lichenoids around the uh 1963 says that if we have a compact compact spin manifold which carries a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature curvature then the Hertzbrucher E-Hat genus will equal to equal to zero where the E-hat genus is equal to the zero High genus is equal to this eight-hat class pairing with this manifold. And if you use the Chengwei theory to represent, then this RTM is the curvature, is the curvature, then you can express the integration over the manifold of this differential form, differential form. And here, the spin condition is essential. For example, on the two-dimensional complex project. Two-dimensional complex projective space space, there are always existing metric for the scalar curvature, but the a hygienist is non-zero. This is because this one is not spin. And for a complex manifold such as CP2, a manifold is spin if and only if the first class is even. So and so this becomes this is a theorem. this is a theorem due to this noise in the in the more than i think more than 60 around 60 years ago and the proof and the proof is a is the is a relies on the spin structure take the advantage that on a spin manifold there always exists a delac operate of course on Dirac operate, of course, on spin remaining manifold. On this spin manifold, one can define a Dirac operate acting on this boundary of spinners, such that the square, the D square, is the Buchanan La Plaza plus this scalar curvature. And this is the Lichroz formula. And this Buchanan Laplace. And this book also is always negative. So when the positive when the scalar curvature is positive, then the D would be positive. And then the index in general is equal to is defined by dimension kernels D plus minus dimension kernels D minus the kernel would all equal to zero or equal to zero. But by the Attire single index term, this index Single index theorem, this index is equal to this etagenus. This gets the vanishing of the etagenus. So the theorem is that, so the case is that here, here, here, the interesting of this theorem is that the condition is geometric and the consequence, the result, state result is a topological. Is a topological, but the proof used to use this analysis. So, in this talk, I will try to present a generalization of this classical theorem to the case of volations. So, before going on, let me simply mention two other classical results for manifold for the existence of the metric of positive scalar curvature. The first one is that The first one is that is due to a theorem of due to Stoge's theorem. It says that if M is thin close close and dimension M larger than equal to five and assume it's simply connected connect. Connected. And if for simplicity, we assume this manifold is of dimension 4k, because the digital vanishing theorem applies in this dimension with k bigger than one. Then there exists GTM with such that the scalar curvature Tm larger than zero if and only if and only if A hat M. If and only if a hat m equals zero. So for simply for higher dimension simply connected spin manifold, this this topological condition indeed gives a complete topological condition on this geometrical problem, the existence positive scalar curvature. So this is a Stowes-Stimer theorem for simply connected manifold. And for non-simplic manifold, the simpler case is connect manifold the simpler case is t n is the is the torus and then we have a theorem of xung yao which was first proved by xung yao for n less than equal to seven and also then generalized by grommov losson to arbitrary to arbitrary manifold is that that there exists no g t t n on torus such that n on torus such that such that this t g t t n is positive so that that means on torus there is no there is no metric of positive scalar curvature this is the famous theorem of Xung Yao and Gromov Lawson so we'll also try to generalize this theorem to the case of manifold to the case of politics so that for the So then for the case of volations, let's just start to record the basic definition. So by a fortieth on manifold, we mean that F is an integrable sub-bundle, integral sub-bundle of the tangent bundle, such that by integrability, we mean that for any two sections of this sub-bundle, the lead bracket of these two sections is still at this. these two sections is still at this still at belong to is a still section of this bundle then by the Fabinius integrity theorem with under this condition we see for any point x on the manifold there is a unique sub manifold we call the leaf passing through x and denoted by this care fx such that the restriction of this boundary to this to this submanifold is indeed the This sub-manifold is indeed the tangent bundle of this sub-manifold of the sub-manifold. So at each point, there's a leaf, then on each point, there's a leaf. So you get a volation structure of this one. So locally, it looks like a vibration. The simple case of the volation case is a vibration case locally. But in general, the space of leaves could be very Leaves could be very complicated. It could even be non-host of. So, if for vibrations, then the space of leaves is just a base space. But for in general foreation, the case, the course, the space of this could be very complicated. This makes the study of geometrical foreations somewhat, could be, in some cases, could be very difficult. difficult. Then the next we see that the based on basic many basic geometrical quantities concepts can be generalized to the case of volations. For example, let's generate the scalar curvature to the case of volations. So recall that F is a sub-bounder of the tangent boundary. We take any Euclidean metric of the boundary. Then on each leaf, Then on each leaf, on each leaf, it induces when this GF, because this F is equal to T F when restricted to FX. So then it gives on each leaf, it gives the Riemannian metric of on each leaf. Then on each leaf, you can, this Riemannian metric determines the scalar curvature, scalar curvature. So then we define on any point x on. Any point x on m, we define a function such that on this x, we there is a unique leaf passing through f, and there is a remaining metric on this leaf determined by the metric on the integral bundle. Then we restrict this one, then it determines a scalar curvature, determines a scalar curvature on this leaf. Then we restrict at this point, restrict at this point. So you get each point, you get a function. And this indeed. function and this indeed that means a restricted metric on each leaf there is a scalar curvature so we call this leafwise scalar curvature and of course when t is the total bundle then this is indeed a general indeed a usual scalar curvature so this generalize the concept of scalar curvature to the case of correlations that means on each leaf a Euclidean metric on this integral sub-bundle determines a scalar curvature Scalar curvature function each point using this levy metric levy scalar curvature and we call this the levy scalar curvature determined by this any Euclidean metric on the bundle then a natural question is that in the political still open is that if if the liver scale curvature associated with some metric is positive then whether there exists then whether there exists a metric on a total manifold such that the scalar cavity is positive is positive so for the easy case that for the vibration case so if we have m over b and and and z for example manifold and t v m the we take the vertical tangent boundary equal to equal to this integrable sub-bundle This integrable sub-bundle. Then, so the pi, the projection, then we take that dent has a has a decomposition of this. We take a splitting, take a splitting. This will be horizontal, horizontal lift, and this is vertical lift. So then we take a vertical bound of take a vertical bound, take a metric on it, then we take any metric on the. Then we take any metric on the base and lift it. Then we rescaled this metric by this episode square. And then we take epsilon 10 to 0. This process is usually called taking in the physics language, probably taking adiabatic limit. So when epsilon is small, we get this asymptotic formula. So now if this is positive, If this is positive, then when epsilon is small, this is still positive. So that means in the vibration case, in the vibration case, this question is easy to have a positive answer. But in general, it is not. So to get a feeling, we take that what is the basic concept in the polishing is that the concept of bot connection. So this integral bundle, so we take a manual, take any splitting of a total tenure bundle to the sub-bundle, plus this is a normal bundle. Then we take orthogonal, take a take any metric on this, this normal bundle, take an orthogonal splitting. Then this will be an orthogonal splitting. This plus minus would be equal to this orthogonal complement of this integral sub bundle. Then by bought connection, we mean that it's a connection on this orthogonal complement, which you identify with this quotient bundle. Such that the main definition, the key point is that for any section on the integral of the integral sub-bundle and for any A bundle and for any section of this Causion bundle, we first take a bracket, then the bracket would take a value outside this Causion bundle, but we project back, we project back to this one. And then in this case, any connection verify under normal boundary, verify this connection is called on the definition around the leave, around the leaves called the port connect. Leaves called the pot connect is the pot connection. And then for the pod connection, for any two sections and for any leaf, still X is a section of the integral boundaries, leave by section. Then you take this, you take this product, you take this derivative and minus this one. It defines a one-form value and the morphism omega. And the morphism omega. Omega. So if omega equals zero, this means that for any section in the integral sub sub-bounder, it's a spot connection, revise preserved metric, preserved metric on the normal bundle. And in this case, we call this metric, a metric verifies this condition, is called the Riemannian policy. Riemannian policy. But in general, in general, this omission. but in general in general this omega is non-zero in general this omega is is non-zero so there exists correlation such that omega is can cannot be uh cannot be zero for any metric on a normal bundle this means there are exist for relations without the remaining forelier structure but still we we still still we consider inspired by the fibrous Inspired by the vibration case, we rescale the metric. See, this is replaced this pullback metric in the vibration case. So we forget the vibration case, but still formally replace this. And then we take an orthonormal, locally orthonormal basis on leaf and also normal basis on the normal bundle. Then for each each element in the orthonormal Each element in the orthonormal base on the leaf one can define defined omega. Omega is determined in the last page by bot connection. We sum over sum over this one acting on the basis of non-bound, we sum over it. Then to calculate explicitly based on computations with Kerkun Liu and sorry. Herfung Liu and Yong Wang. We see that when epsilon tends to zero, so this is the three terms in the vibration case. But in the middle, there are many complete terms involving this omega f and so on. So when omega equal to zero, for example, in the Riemannian 48 case case or in the vibration case, all this equal to zero. But in general, it is very complicated. It is a very complicated term. It involves omega and also involves the derivative of this omega. This is the action on this inner product, in the product. It turns out that in general, if you naively take an adiabatic limit, you may end up with very complicated terms. Of course, as I mentioned, in the Lymanian case, if omega equal to zero. Limani case omega equal to zero, then all these all all these middle part just cancel and you get the original case. But the general case is much more complicated. Even in the code dimension one case, so even in the code dimension one case, that the quotient bundle is of rank one. Then up then besides these three terms, it still involves omega and the d derivatives of omega. The derivatives of omega. So it turns out a very complicated term. So, so you so the question is if you have positive, whether you get this positive is from the naive point of view is hard to see. It's hard to see. Tautologically, it could be a very hard problem. But inspired by this Stoge theorem and also. Theorem and also Literal theorem. We can even characterize whether there exists a metric of positive scale curvature on the total manifold of this one, but maybe we can study some weaker diversion. For example, whether the topological consequences of the existence of this one would hold. So, in this case, the first and trivial result The first non-tribute result is due to Alan Kong. Alan Kong proved in 1968 the following generalization of the Dishnow's theorem, the case of foliations. So let Mf be a foliation such that M is compact and oriented. So it's an oriented manifold that one can define each genus. We also feel that the integral of bundle is spin. It's spin. Is spin is spin. Then, if there exists a metric on the integral boundaries such that the division scalar curvature is positive, then you get this A hat genus equal to zero. A hat genus equal to zero. So if you take F equal to Tm, then this is the additional theorem. So F would be Tm being spin. Spin. But the point, key point is that. key point is that that since we only assume f is spin your tm if f direction f normal bundle so this need not need not spin so that means the total manifold need not spin and the a hat genus tautologically we if we think a hat genus of cb2 equal to one minus eight is tautologically not a priori integer of course under this condition positivity of the real Positivity of the real by scale capture is equal to zero as an integer. But in general, it's not a spinning manifold, and then there's no direct operating total manifold. So this is emphasized by Alan Kong's paper. And the proof is highly non-trivial, even for the code dimension one taste, because we see that you cannot naively apply the Applied the Licheno theorem to the adiabatic limit case case. So, even so, in the co-dimensional case, of course, the case of F spin and total manifold spin is equivalent, but even in this case, co-dimensional one case, it is also difficult, at least in view of Alan Kong's proof. Now, we still take the basic toy case that the toy model is at the The toy model is that vibration case. Then, in the vibration case, vibration case on each fiber, because if we spin, so on each fiber, there's a Dilac operate on each fiber. Then we can define a family of Dilac operates, define the index bundle. And the index bundle can take character. Then the Atia single families index, set families, these families. that families these families index states states that that the that the character of this index bundle equal to the integration around the fiber of this eight hat class of the vertical bundle then if you multiply the a hat class of the base manifold and then integration over b then you get this a hat m This A hat m but on the other hand, because the fiberwise delac operator, because on the fiberwise leadwise, there's positive scale curvature, so this index equal to zero, this index equal to zero, so this character bundle is equal to zero, so you get this equal to zero. So even in the vibration case, this theorem, construction, in the special case, is a consequence of the RTS families index, a testing families. which is more complicated than the index theorem on spin manifold itself. And Kong's proof wants to generalize this strategy to the case of Foliation. So then and uses essentially the non-commutative geometry techniques he developed. And in particular, that you use cyclical hormones developed and also the con Scandalis longitudinal index. Uh, longitudinal index theorem in the forelier case, and of course, of course, just like in the fab in the fibration case, it depends essentially on the spin stretch around the leaves, in the fibrillating case, around the fibers. It is an achievable even for Riemannian foliation case, because Tm need not be spin. So, we recall that in the Riemannian foreation case, we can rescale. Is we can rescale the metric to get a positive scale curvature, but even you have positive scale curvature, the total manifold is not spin. So there's no Dilaco operator. It does not guarantee that A hat equal to zero. Thinking about this A hat CP2 is zero. And this, so we have two different. we have two two difficulties here first of all is that the total manifold is not is not not spin and the second or the more difficult is that the fallation can need not be Riemannian foreation need not be Riemannian for and Kong introduce a final vibration which we call Kong vibration to overcome this difficulty and for geometers as as I recall Geometers, as I recall, Kung proved his theorem by using non-commutative geometry techniques. So, for geometers, a natural question is whether there exists a possible differential geometrical proof of this theorem. Indeed, when Kevin Liu was a student of Yao at Harvard, and Yao proposed this question to Kerbun Liu and suggests to use adiabatic limit to study conseer. And of course, as we have seen, Of course, as we have seen that even for the Riemannian foliage case, and the curb only we consider the simplest case, the Riemannian foliation case, which implies that if you have reverse positive scale curvature, then you get a metric of positive scale curvature on the total manifold by using adiabatic limit. But since the first difficulty we need to overcome. The first difficulty we need to overcome is that the tangent boundar need not be spin. So in the joint work, with Carefully, we overcome this kind of difficulty. We construct what we call sub-Dirac operate. That means just specifically a constructor for the case that is sub-bound F. F is spin is spin. Is spin so so more concretely that in the special case of the Riemannian polation, we assume the manifold and the rank of the sub-bundle all are even. Then we consider any twisted bundle of the normal bundle. Then we consider twisted Dirac up twisted sub-dilacle operate twisted with this sub-bundle. Is that we call sub-dilacer operate means that since we have only f this spin structure. Have only F this spin structure. So we consider the spin bundle associated with this spin structure. And on the normal bundle, we take as the exterior algebra bundle, exterior algebra bundle, carries with this signature splitting, defining the signature operate. Then in this case, we can calculate the Dilacca operate of this index. And usually, as usual, we consider the Dilaco of operation. We consider the diracle of operated by the character D plus. Then the index would give the A hat class of F pairing with instead of A head class of normal boundaries, this L hat class, another class described by Hertzbrook, defined by Hertzbrook, and then take the same character of the twisted bundle, twisted band bundle. And indeed, there are a finite linear combination of this, taking this twisted bundle and Taking this twisted bundle and the regional number such that it had genus can be expressed as a regional linear combination, finite regional linear combination of the index of this sub-diloc operators. Then we can compute the d square just as in the proof of Lichnow's theorem. Theorem that take the d square then when epsilon tends to zero. When epsilon tends to zero, because we here have a Riemannian volation and we have a scalar curvature, so the k epsilon tm equal to kf plus o epsilon square. So then, when epsilon small, you get this one. And the first two terms just is like in the what is like in the Lichens formula. So if this is positive, this is positive, then each is index or equal to zero. index would equal to zero index equal to zero and you just get a genus equal to zero that means in in this way by constructing sub dirac operate you can give a proof of a cone vanishing theorem uh theorem directly by using the index theorem without using any families index theorem or non-commutative geometry so then the next next question is how to do for non-liminary To do for non-remanual volation case, the non-management case would be more difficult, and then we would need to apply this adiabatic limit structure to a vibration called Kung vibration, which is in the in some sense is almost Riemanni, very close to the Riemannian folation structure, because almost the Riemannian fallation structure. Riemannian forelazation structure forelation structure. And recall that the grammar indeed also considers the question independently about how to apply adiabatic limit strategy to the Kong to study the Kong theorem. And in searching for such a more geometrical proof of the Kong theorem, indeed we come up with an Indeed, we come up with an alternative generalization to the volation of the Lichner theorem, which is trivial for Liemannian volation case. And we recall that Kohn's vanishing theorem is non-trivial, even for Liemannian volation case. But here we can prove an alternative theorem is that we still consider a closed compact manifold with polishing structure. Then we assume the manifold is spin. Tm is. the manifold is spin tm is spin instead of this the sub bundle sub bundle tm so spin spin instead we assume that tm is spin then under the same condition that there is a reverse uh positive scalar curvature metric then the e-cat genus equal to zero when f is f is a total bundle then it is still a least law theorem and since Theorem and since this is a total spin support manifold aging in under this condition, we can just take adiabatic limit to get positive scale curvature on the total manifold and then apply the Lee-North theorem. But in the general case, just like in the proof of Kohn's theorem, we need a configuration case. I don't, so maybe I am too slow. I don't think I have many times to. Have many times to explain, but basically, basically, the structure is here. Is that a cone vibration is a vibration of the manifold such that such at any point x x the fiber is all the Euclidean matrix on this normal boundary on this normal space. That means you can also call this in this normal space. So, the philosophy. space. So the philosophy is here is that there is no metric preserved under normal bundle preserved by the bot connection in the around the leaves, along the leaves in general. But if there is such a metric as Riemannian forest, but for non-Riemannian forest in general, there is no metric such that is provided. Is provided preserved long leaf by bot connection. The Kong's philosophy is that if such a metric does not exist, we still consider simultaneously all the metric, all the metric, all the metric. This is idea. And of course, on linear space, the space of all Euclidean metrics is a homogeneous space of non-positive curvature. non-positive curvature and this condition is plays an essential role in Kong's proof of his managing theorem. But the point is that the point is that under this one, then on the total vibration case, on the total vibration, there is a lifted vibration, a lifted integral sub-bundle from F, and there's a tautological vertical vibration and the normal bundle and the normal bundle and in and normal bundle and you can And normal bundle. And you can induce, induce nature metrics, nature metrics by definition on this tangent bundle, on this total tangent bundle. I will not give it in the detail because due to the time reason. So we have a cone vibration. We have a splitting of the metric of naturally induced metric. And then cone. So observation is at the holonomic group point. holonomic group point holonomic group point of this this volist x taking this one x naturally on the normal boundary this one equal to tn head quotient by this f get is almost humanity so infinitesimally it means it means that bot connection almost the preserved bot connection Almost preserved, but connecting along almost preserved metric on this normal bundle, on this normal bundle. So, this means on each splitting, on each of this sub-bundle, the bot connecting around the leaves, around the leaves, indeed preserved the metric, preserved the metric. And then you also have this condition that that means the bot connection, if you're acting on a normal bundle, or normal bundle, it is. Norman bundle, it is acting like this way. This way. This is zero, and this is one. And this one is this diagonal, has a Liemannian foraging case. Liamanian foraging structure. So on the total space is almost Liemannian. If we rescale the metric, then we can rescale this tend to epsilon square. So then when epsilon tends to zero, So that when epsilon tends to zero, in the limiting case, if you tautologically thinking, it would be remaining. It will be remaining. So, Zheng Kong introduced this beautiful geometrical idea to reduce things for non-Riemannian volition case structure to the case of almost Riemannian volition, take a limit, but of course a limit need not exist, but you can have an approximation. But you can have an approximation. But on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, this space is non-compact. So this is a homogeneous space of non-profit scalar curvature. This is non-compact. So if you want to apply index theorem, index theorem on the cone vibration, on the cone vibration, you need to apply this. This is a non-compact. This is non-compact. This is non-compact. You want to develop the index theory, index theory on this non-compact space. And indeed, you take any metric on the normal boundary, you can embed, embed, take embedded section, you take the manifold as an embedded section of this configuration from back configuration. Then on the total manifold, total manifold since almost remaining, we have a Almost remaining, we have three pieces that is that besides this normal says Epsom square reskating, uh, it's not enough. We need a new rescaling around the leaves because we have three pieces, so we rescale with two parameters. Then, after all, after all, we will get so here we emphasize again that this total manifold is nothing, and we will apply as a remote. And we will apply the Riemann-Roch property, Riemann-Roch property on this non-compact manifold. This will, I will not go into the detail, but anyway, anyway, there is a, there is a, so I don't have to many time. So, so we still can see we need to consider sub-Dilacar operates on the total cone vibration, and we need to deform, deform, deform this one, and deform this one. And deform this and the original manifold, this M, what embedded this M hat, M hat. Then, usually as some manifold, if you want to get the geometry information on some manifold, usually in geometry, you can see the small neighborhood of this manifold. But for Kong's idea is that we need to study total vibration, the very total. Vibration, very total vibration of the very large neighborhood of this one to get to this index theory. So I'm not going into the details. Then we can construct on the total vibration operator and taking the limit, we get the Boganana plushing and the scalar curvature. Scalar curvature. But since this one is under non-compact, so we also need some boundary conditions. We also need some boundary conditions that we finally will get an operate which is invertible on the submanifold neighborhood, big neighborhood of some manifold, and also invertible on the boundary. So we get a big manifold with boundary. Then we get this index. We can define the index equal to. defined as an index equal to a h at m and using similar this estimate you get the vanishing so this is this is this is of technical is only of technical but the basic idea is that that you need to apply apply this subdiracle operate dirac operate Drag operate plus adiabatic limit limit on the cone vibration but this way which is non-compact which is non-compact that you do some techniques you you solve you prove the theory you so you prove the theorem and also and and and this one gives the our theorem that we assume that the total tm is big but with easy modifications we can get a geometric proof of original cones vanishing theorem original cones vanishing but that's our original motivation that is to give a geometric proof of cone's vanishing theorem theorem and this index theoretical and this index theoretical can technique can also be applied to prove because the forelier is very closely related to the flat back bundle real flat back bundle so we can join with jen qing yi we can prove the following theorem by using the same technique is that instead of volations we consider a manifold a closed spin manifold and consider f a real oriented flat Oriented flat back bundle, flat back bundle of it. Then, then we can for real flat bundle, we talk about Euler class. So if this real flat bundle admits a metric preserving, a metric preserved that preserved by this flat fact bundle, then the Euler class is equal to zero by Gauss-Bonaton theorem. But in general, the Euler class Euler cost need not be zero. Even in the rank two, on the surface, there's a famous example of Muin showing that on the higher genus Riemann surface, there exists rank two flat bundles such that the Euler class is non-zero. But if we assume this manifold carries a positive scale curvature, then Then, spin manifold. Then we can see, we can get the eta class multiplied by this Euler class of the real flat bundle equal to zero. And take an example is that if we assume that rank F equal to dimension M, then you just see that EF M equal to zero if there exists. If there exists a positive scalar curvature on this M spin close manifold, close manifold. So then in this way, you get a certain restriction, obstruction on the existence of real flat boundaries manifold of positive scalar curvature. And this one needs also use the cone vibration to prove. The configuration to prove this one. So now we get a brief summary. Summary. Our theorem states that if a total manifold is spin and then there is a lever as positive scalar curvature, then the e-hygienus will equal to zero. Equal to zero. Then if this spin manifold is of dimension 4k with k larger greater than one and also simply connected, then simply connected then this condition combined with stowes theorem stored theorem says that there always in the simplicinet case there always exists a metric of positive scalar curvature so this is a special case in this special case we get we get a positive answer to this question open question that i mentioned earlier is that this is the guiding principle is that print guiding open question is that if guiding open question is that if you give a revise positive scalar curvature whether that exists metric on the total manifold with positive scalar curvature and with the help of combining with those theorem and and our theorem in the general case because we can get a positive answer to a simply connected case and also on the on the Foulation case and on the Taurus case on the Taurus case On the torus case, we can get as a curve of our technique, we can get immediately that on the torus, there is no torus, no metric, no forlation such that there is a revised positive scale curvature metric for any integral sub-bundle of TTN. There's no metric such that Levi-scale curvature is positive. And this generalized Shung Yao. And this generalizes Shungyao's result and the Gromov-Lawson's result of the case for Asians. And the general case is still open. So this is the guiding principle and the general case is still widely open. So it's interesting if one could find a more geometrical way to attack this question directly. From the index theoretical point of view, we The right point of view, we do this in an indirect way. So I will stop here. Thank you. Thanks. Waiting for the wonderful talk. Any questions and comments? In your film with Qian, Qing Yi, yes, the connection. Yes. The collision flat, flat is essential or is the collision flat essential? Yes, yes. The condition. Flat flat variable flat. Is it essential or? Of course, because there are many spin manifolds with Euler number not equal to zero, of course. And tangent boundary. So the fra bound is very essential. Any other questions, comments? So, waiting. Yeah, let's just want to say hello to you. And there is a recent work of Chadash and Chao Li on this KÏ€1 conjecture. How does it fit into your setting? Is there any connection? So you mean that as far as I know that they solved one very one typical case of a very famous conjecture says that if manifold M if manifold M is a M is aspirical. That means if this is contractable, yes, the universal covering is contractable, then there is no metric of positive skill curvature. Yes. But so far, they prove this by minimal surface. So far, I think for Dilak operators, there is no proof for. Prove no, cannot prove such this result yet. For the very special case, of course, if M if M is of the scale of sectional curvature is negative, then this is true. This is the Gromov Lawson's classical result. But for general case, this is an open question. And Charlie and his collaborators prove this in dimension M equals. This in dimension m equal to four and five. I think it gram of gram of proves dimension four case. The other dimension case I still open. They using they are using minimal surface techniques.
