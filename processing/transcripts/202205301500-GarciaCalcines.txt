Either here or for the diehards far away in breakout rooms. Our last speaker of the day is Jose Garcia Castimes, who will tell us about formal aspects of parameterized topological complexity and its pointed version. Thank you for the presentation. Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers of this. Thank the organizers of this workshop, Jesus, Dan, and Lucille, for inviting me to give this talk. And this way, I can share with you my ideas concerning topological complexity, and in particular, about parametrized topological complexity. So here are more or less the content of the talk. I will give the first a brief introduction on the Brief introduction on the topic. Then I will explain the setting in which will be immersed throughout all the topic, which is the one of firewise homotopy. After this, I will explain the notion of sectional category in this setting, the firewise sectional category, and we'll give some. And we'll give some properties which will be crucial for the next notion, which is the one of firewise topological complexity that intends to be an extension of the parametrized topological complexity in the sense of Cohen, Farber, and Weinberger. And after giving the main properties of this notion, Properties of this notion, then I will give some points about the Ghana characterization of firewise topological complexity. And the final section will be about the pointed case, the firewise pointed case. There is another notion, a pointed version of the firewise topological complexity. And I will give a comparison. And I will give a comparison between these two notions and give sufficient conditions on which these two notions, the point diversion and the non-pointer version, agree. So let us begin. So this is what I want to do. We want to extend the notion of parametrized topological complexity to any firewall. To any firewise space, not necessarily a vibration, some kind trying to answer the question of Ben Knudsen this morning. And in this talk, such generalization will be called a firewise topological complexity. And it is important to remark that here I'm not especially interested in calculation. Interested in calculations and computations, but rather in establishing the theoretical foundations of the theory. As I said, the setting will be the category of firewise spaces over a fixed topological space B, or in the end, the one of firewise point spaces over B. I will explain a little bit this. Little bit this in detail. Okay. So let me remind you what firewise space is. This is just a map, a continuous map from a topological space to a fixed topological space B. This map is usually called a projection and a firewise map. A firewise map over B is just a continuous map making commutative this triangle that is inspecting the projections. So the notions of firewise homeomorphism, retraction, firewise subs subspace, and so on come naturally. I will denote by top B. I will denote by top B the category of five white spaces of a B in category term. This is just the comma category under B over B, sorry. This is a category which is complete and co-complete. At least it has all limits and co-limits. The empty space being the initial object with the obvious projection. With the obvious projection, and B, the space B, being the final object with identity as the projection. We can talk for any given faraway space, its firewide cylinder. This is just the usual cylinder, but together with the canonical projection, which is the composite of the Composite of the projection onto the first factor followed by the projection coming from the firewise structure. So this gives rise to a function, a natural functor, and gives the notion of firewise homotopy, what will be denoted as shown in this slide, and of course, notion of firewise homotopy equivalence. Firewise homotopy equivalence. On the other hand, we also have the notion of firewise path space for any firewise space. This is the topological pullback of these two arrows. This is the map sending its point to the constant path at this point. And this map is just the precomposition with the projection. With the projection. So, taking this pullback, we have the firewise path space. This can be expressed as shown here, which is essentially these are paths in the space with line in a single fiber. So we also obtain a natural functor. From top P to itself, and in actual fact, we have an adjunction where the cylinder being the left adjoint to the path, the firewise path space cylinder. Now, another point which is interesting to note is that this category of This category of firewise spaces as a closed model category structure. This will be interesting in order to deal with some natural homotopy constructions. So we have the notion of firewise co-fibrations. This is just a firewise map satisfying the homotopy stension property. The homotopy stension property in the category of top P, where we use here the five-wheel cylinder. So this is as in the classical topological case, but we were throughout this diagram working in the category of top P. Firewise cofibrations are in particular cofibrations. Fibrications are in particular cofibrations. So, as we have fiberwise embedding, we can consider that we have firewise pairs in this case. We also have the firewise vibration. This is a firewise map satisfying the homotopy lifting property. Here, of course, we use the again the natural cylinder. And this is just as in the classical topological case. It is important to remark that any firewise map which is a vibration, it is also a firewise vibration. So these are particular cases of firewise vibration. firewise vibration, but the converse is not true. For instance, for any firewise space, I can consider the projection and this projection can be considered as a firewise map. Again, here considering the identity of the projection and this is always a firewise vibration, always. But of course the projection is not a vibration in general. In general, so we can take these three classes of firewise morphisms or firewise maps. We can take the firewise vibrations, closed firewise covibrations, and firewise homotopy equivalences. And then top B, with these together with these three classes, has a proper closed model category in the sense of quill. Of William. Okay. Now, this is, I want to display a central notion in this work, which is the one of firewise sectional category. This is a very natural notion coming in this setting. Consider any firewise map. Then we can define, we define the firewise sectional category of F. sectional category of f as the least non-negative integer n such that the space x admits a cover by n plus one open subsets on each of which there exists a firewise map to the open set to E satisfying that this triangle is a commutative app to firewise up to firewise homotopy. So here we have firewise homotopy commutative triangles in top P. If such n does not exist, then we can set as infinity the five-wise sectional category of f. In this case, as in the classical case, Case, this map is a local firewise homotopy section, and the domain, we say that this is a firewise sectional subset of X. Of course, if F is a firewise vibration, then we can equivalently take here a strictly commutative diagrams because of the homotopy lifting property. Lifting property of the vibration, of high-wise vibration. So we can take, in this case, commutative, strictly commutative triangles. As a particular case, we can do a comparison with the so-called Iguas Sakai LS category. We have to work with pointed five-way space. This is a firewise space in which there exists a section of the vibration. This is then this section can be considered as a firewise map again. And in this case, the firewise sectional category of the section. Category of the section is exactly the 5LS category of X in the sense of it wasn't Sakai. Okay, we start with some properties of the SECAT B. This is the very first one. If we have a homotopy commutative diagram in top P relating these two maps, F and G, then Then the far away sectional category of G is a lower bound of the corresponding one to F. And whenever we have that lambda is a firewise homotopy equivalence, we have the equality. So this is very simple to establish because for any firewise local homotopy section. Firewise local homotopy section of F, the composite with lambda, give us a local firewise homotopy section of G. This is immediate. So taking open covers, we obtain the result. If lambda is a homotopy equivalence in the five-wise sense, then we can reverse this diagram and do the same, so we have the other inequality. Okay, we also have to talk about pointed firewise maps. These are firewise maps between pointed firewise spaces where F is compatible with the section. We have here commutative timers. In this case, as a corollary of the previous proposition, Of the previous proposition, we have that in this case of pointed five-wise map, we have the five-wise sectional category of F is a lower bound of Iwase-Sagai category of X. And if A is firewise contractible, it has the firewise homotopy type of B, then we obtain the equality. This is just a direct consequence of the result above. Result above. Of course, we have this nice result in general that when we have in general a homotopy, a firewise homotopy commutative diagram connecting these two firewise maps through two firewise homotopy equivalences, then we can assert that the That the five-way sectional categories of f and f prime agree. This is not very difficult to check. This is just by considering similar techniques as the one given in the classical topological case. Now, I would like to compare the five-way sectional category. Five-way sectional category and the ordinary sectional category because this is very important. But before doing this, let me explain what a fibrant space is. If we have a freight wide space, then it is said to be fibrant if the projection is a vibration in topic. It's an ordinary vibration. So, this is the case. This will be called fibrant. So, the result is that whenever we have a firewise map between fibrant spaces or firewise fibrant spaces, then the firewise sectional category of F and the ordinary sectional category of F agree. These are the same. So This is not really difficult to check. This is the only inequality which is not trivial. In order to prove this, we consider first an ordinary factorization of F through an ordinary homotopy equivalence, followed by an ordinary vibration. And realize that this factorization also has sense in the firewise setting because here in this space, we can take this map, this composite, as the projection, which is the composite of vibrations, and therefore it's an ordinary vibration. So as this is a homotopy equivalent, Homotopy equivalence between fibrin spaces, then it is actually a firewise homotopy equivalence. And therefore, both the sectional category and the firewise sectional category of F agree with the ones of P. So it the problem reduces to to check this inequality for P. This inequality for P, for P being a vibration, a vibration, a Hurricane vibration. But this is very easy to check because as piece of vibration, we can take for any open subset with the strict local section, not just aptomotopy, but street, because we have affirmation. Necessarily, this is necessarily a This is necessarily a firewise map. So we have a section in the firewise setting. So it is also an open firewise sectional subset of X. And taking this argument for taking covers, we obtain the result. So this is very nice. As a consequence, if X is a point-defy random space of a B, Point the fibran space of a beat, we can say that the Iwasi-Sakai category is just the sectional category of the section, and in particular, we retrieved this result by Iwasi-Sakai, that the topological complexity, which is the sectional category of the diagonal map, is the wasakai category of the diagonal map. This space considered as a firewise map over X. This is important also because one can think that it is always the same, the fibristeral category and the sectional category, but this is not true. We have this, in general, this equality is not true. For instance, we have For instance, we have a counterexample. I don't know. Maybe I can write down here or here. I can take this space. This is a square with a vertical edge removed. So this is something like that. Okay. B is the closed unit interval, and this is the projection, which is the projection to the first factor. And we can take the firewise map F from B to X given as the inclusion into this part of the space. Of the space. So we can analyze this example. On the one hand, the five-wise action category of F is not zero. It is greater than or equal to one. Because if it were zero, this would imply that X would have the fibers homotopy type of B, implying that these fibers are homotopy equivalent. Fibers are homotopy equivalent to T for any T, but this is not true by connectivity reasons. So, for instance, here the fiber of this point is all this edge, which is connected. But if we take the fiber of this point, we have this two point which is not connected. So, this is not true. So, we have that. So we have that actually the farway sectional category of F is greater than or equal to one. And on the other hand, it is the ordinary sectional category of F is zero because the sectional category of S is a lower bound of the category of X, the base space of the map, which is contractive and therefore. Contractible and therefore is zero. Okay. So then you go back to what's the hypothesis for everything of the theorem? The hypothesis of the theorem that we have to work with vibrations everywhere. Fibrant spaces means fibrant space means that the Space means that we have vibrations. So, this is the counterexample. Now, we can apply these results to firewise topological complexity. So, consider any firewise map, firewise space, sorry, over B. Then we have defined this. Define this map, sending its path to the initial and final point. Here we have the natural firewise product. And this is always a firewise vibration. Always. Not an ordinary vibration, but a vibration in the firewise setting. And we can define the firewise topological. Define the firewise topological complexity as the firewise action category of this map. Not the ordinary sectional category, but the firewise action category of this map. So the first thing that I want to explain that I want to explain that this. I want to explain that this is actually an extension of the parametrized topological complexity of how. This is a proposition which tells us that if E is a vibrant freightwise space of a B, that is, we are in the setting of Cohen, Farber, and Weinberger. We have that the projection is a vibration. Then this map is an ordinary vibration. This is very Ratio. This is very simple to establish because we use for this to prove this fact the so-called colloqui theorem for vibration. Here we have an interior pullback, this square interior pullback. This is an exterior pullback where these three maps P, P, E, P, B, and the identity are vibrations, and also we need. Vibrations, and also we need another condition that we take the pullback of this map and this other map. There is an induced map from these two other maps. And this is very well known that this is an ordinary vibration. So we can apply this result that can be found in this book, for example. Example and on this case, we have the dotted arrow, which is exactly the de-evolution map. This is an ordinary vibration. So, as a consequence, is a vibrant, we have that firewise topological complexity is exactly the parameterized topological complexity in the sense of. In the sense of going further than Wayne Burger. The proof is that as we have that the map is a vibration, it is immediately checked that these are vibrant. So we apply the proposition above. And in this case, the five-wise sectional category is the sectional category of this map, which is the definition of the parametrized topological complexity of. Parametrized topological complexity of E. Okay. This is an alternative description of the freightwise topological complexity. We have, as in the classical case, we have here a strictly commutative diagram connecting the ovulation map with the diagonal map through this. Diagonal map through this firewise homotopy equivalence. So by the firewise homotopy invariance property, we have that the firewise topological complexity can also be defined as the firewise sectional category of the diagonal map. Here, of course, we don't have a strictly commutative track. A strictly commutative triangle, but we have commutativity up to five-wise homotopy. But it's another way to define. Of course, we have that firewise homotopy invariance of this firewise topological complexity. If these two firewise spaces are firewise homotopy. Paces are firewise homotopy equivalence, then the fivewise topological complexity is agreed. Just one have to consider this commutative diagram connecting the B-evaluation maps through these five-wise homotopy equivalences. So we apply the results above and we obtain results. As a consequence, if A is a pointed over B, then Of a B, then the firewise topological complexity is zero if only if it is firewise contractible. Another result is that in the case of pointed firewise phase of a B, we have this change of inequalities, that the first topological complexities between it was a chi category and of E and the Category of E and the waste Sakai category of the E product P. E. This inequality is already proved because the Wasi-Sakai category is an upper bound of the five-wise action category. But for this inequality, one just have to proceed similarly as in the classical case. So we can also We can also change the base space, and we can consider through the pullback construction this functor from top p to top p prime. And it is very natural to prove this inequality for any firewise map of a B. We have that the firewise sectional category. Sectional category of the image through the functor or the pullback construction of f with respect to b prime is a lower bound to the firewise sectional category of f with respect to b so in the firewise topological case we're telling the corresponding result we have that this inequality connecting the firewise topological The firewise topological complexity with respect to B prime and to B. In particular, if we take inclusions and the pre-image of this subset and the restitution map from E prime to B prime, we have that this inequality relating the topological firewise topological complexity of E prime and E. So this is. So, this is just to take into account that the pullback is essentially the pre-image of this map. So, this is more or less. And now, an interesting setting that the five wise topological complexity can be also characterized by without using open covers. Similarly, Similarly, as in the classical topological case. So in TOPP, we can work with the firewise homotopy pullbacks and homotopy pushouts, but it is a closed model category. So this is easy by taking factorization properties or using equivalently with the weak universal property of homotopy limits and co-limits. Motop limits and co-limits in the sense of boost, field, and can. So we can take for any firewise map with the same codomain the so-called firewise join. This is first we take the homotopy pullback and from new arrows we take the homotopy push out in the fiberwise sense. So we obtain this space, fiberwise space. Space, five-wise space, and the dotted arrow coming from the width universal property of homotopy push-out. This is the joint construction, the dotted arrow, the joint map associated to these two arrows. So we can define the five-way sectional pathways similarly as the Similarly, as in the classical case, this is the nth five-wise actional path wedge for n zero is just the map F. And if it is constructed in dimension n minus one, then the following is the joint construction of the product in top P of F with identity and the identity of X cross GA minus. Cross ga minus one. So we obtain this way the faraway sectional fat wedge of dimension n. Okay, this is a bit obscure. We don't know exactly or we don't have a description, but when we have closed firewise covibration, which is not very difficult because we can take a the The configuration that approximates the map, then this space can be explicitly described as this space of tuples x0, x1, xn belonging to this firewise product of x with itself such that one of these points belongs to it. point belong to E. In this case, we have that up to five-wise homotopy, Jn is the inclusion, the natural inclusion. Similarly, we can construct firewise Ghana maps. So this is just the joint construction of F with F with F with itself. With f with f with itself many times starting from f and then the pn minus one is already constructed that the following is given by the corresponding joint construction with f so these are related this uh ghana map and the and the white head the sectional uh whitehead map Whitehead map they are related through this firewise homotopy pullback. We take the homotopy pullback in the firewise setting of this map with the diagonal map of the nature on n minus one. We obtain this homotopy pullback where this induced map is the exactly up to five-wise homotopy, the n-dimensional Ghana map. In order to prove this, just one has to consider the firewise Q lemma. Essentially, this is the key point of the proof, which established that if we have a commutative cube at two firewise homotopy, where the sides of the cube are firewise homotopy pullbacks and the And the bottom phase is also 5w homotopy pushout, then the top phase is also a homotopy pushout. So we have that in this case, when f is any closed firewise cofiguration with x a normal space, that these three statements are equivalent. The firewise sectional category is less than or Is less than or equal to n. The diagonal map of dimension plus one can be factorized through the n-sectional fat wedge up to a firewise homotopy and the n fiberwise ganium map and meets a fiberwise homotopy section. These two conditions, condition two and condition three, are always fulfilled. Independently of whether this is a cloud waste cooperation or not, because of the pullback relating the two maps, JN and PN. But this condition for any close firewise cofaberation for this condition, we can relate this firewise sectional category, which is given. Fairy bisexual category, which is given in terms of open covers, with this axiomatic way of defining it. So as a result, we can do the same for the particular case of the diagonal map, which give us the notion of firewise sectional category. But I need first to define what a firewise locally keyconnect is. Watch a firewise locally connected spaces. These are firewise spaces in which the diagonal map is a close firewise cofibration. So this notion is not very restrictive. There are a wide class of firewise spaces where this condition is verified. So this is not very restrictive. And doing the Doing the passing or doing the translation into the language of topological complexity, we have that if it's a fias locally connected space where this space is normal, then we have the corresponding equivalency between the three conditions. So this condition of this space being normal is not very restrictive. Not very restrictive. For instance, when B is half-dorf and is mergable, it is immediate to check that this is normal. Now, just to finish my talk, I will explain a little bit about the pointed case. So we have another category, top of B. Top of B, which is the category of firewise pointed spaces, that is, firewise spaces with a section, together with firewise pointed maps, that is, firewise maps that are compatible with the sections. These are also called the category of X spaces in the literature. This is a pointed category where B is the zero object. And it is quite straightforward to define a firewise pointed homotopy, firewise homotopy equivalences, and so on. And we can also establish the second BB of F. So this is the notion of sectional category in the setting of the category of X spaces. Of X spaces by declaring that an open subset U of X that contains the section is said to be fivewise point sectional when we have a map of morphism in this category such that this triangle is commutative at two firewise pointed homotopy. Pointed homotopy. So this way we can define the pointed version of the five-way sectional category of F. And of course, we can translate this to the pointed firewise topological complexity of E as the pointed firewise sectional category of the B evaluation map. This is clearly an upper bound of the firewise sectional sorry, firewise topological complexity of E. We have the natural properties. I don't want to go into detail, but more or less it's the same, but instead of taking firewise maps, Firewise maps and firewise homotopy. We take the pointed version. So we have all these results. We can define as the, we can take the diagonal map. This is invariant under firewise pointed homotopy equivalences. This is zero if only if it is firewise homotopy equivalent in the pointed sense to P is between this Is between this category and this other category. This is the James Morris 5Y-LS category, which is essentially the same as the WASSA guy, but taking the working in the category of top B, the category of X spaces. And also for the change of the base, we have a similar result. So we have to work in order to explain the next result what a firewise well-pointed space is. This is a firewise pointed space in which the section is a close firewise cofigration. This is not very restrictive also. We have the notation for the category of well-pointed spaces. I was saying that this is not very restrictive because for firewise locally connected and pointed, these spaces are always firewise well-pointed. So this is not very restrictive. So in this case, work in this category of well-pointed firewise spaces, where F is a pointed map, the spaces. The spaces E and X are normal, or F is a closed firewise cofabration with X normal, then the pointed version of the fivewise sectional category is between the firewise sectional category and the sectional category, five sectional category plus one. So, this is not very difficult just using open covers and a usual algorithm. And usual argument similarly as down in the classical case. So, for topological complexity, we have to consider this condition, firewise locally connected, where this space is normal, in order to consider the diagonal map. And in this case, the pointed topological complexity between the non-pointed and the non-pointing plus one. Okay. And finally, And finally, I will give some sufficient conditions for which these two notions, pointed and non-pointed, agree. So by a fibrant space of firewise space, which is fibrin, I said that this is a firewise space in which the projection is a vibration, but we now have another notion, which is the firewise point. Is the fire away pointed space which is said to be covibrant when the section is a closed covibration? These are in the usual sense: an ordinary vibration, an ordinary closed covibration. So we have this result, which is a proof by using the whitehead Ganier characterization of the firewise sectional category, establishing that for this. Establishing that for this kind of maps, pointed between fibrin and cofibrant, and visa the CW complex that is fine for some k these two conditions concerning with the k some connectivity of the map and the knowledge of the dimension of b and the faraway sectional category of f, then in this case we have the two invariants, these two invariants are actually the same. Invariant are actually the same. In particular, when we have this case where E is a firewise locally connected and fibre, we have a B a C W complex satisfying these two corresponding results, the corresponding conditions connecting with the connecting. The connectivity of the diagonal map again and the dimension B of the topology wise topological complexity of E. In this case, we have these two invariants at the same. And simply, we apply the theoretical nabal to the diagonal map, observing that these two spaces are firewise well-pointed and therefore confinement. So, this is what I wanted to spend here. Thank you very much for your attention. Much for your attention. So, I'm going to ask a question that I think you were trying to avoid by saying that you weren't talking about packages. So, what version of Colemology do I need to use, and what version of zero divisor do I need to use? Yes, yes. I haven't thought about it very much. I haven't explored. About it very much. I haven't explored this, but there is a notion of firewise cohomology, which was, I think it was defined by James and Morris. There is a paper coming back from 1991, I think. In this paper, they work with the LS category in the firewise setting. They use a And they use a firewise notion of homology, and there they do calculation and computation. So I haven't thought about it, but there is a version of firewise chromology. And hopefully, I think we can follow in that direction to make some computations. Uh if you start with any map and you replace it by your vibration, uh how do they uh you take a vibration that replaces the and then I guess uh just does this fiber wise section a category changes in which case I didn't touch. Yeah, a map of over B. And then you change this map by a vibration. And you want to compare the two notions of sectional category in the usual sense or the fiberway sense. If we change it to fireway sense, we obtain the same number, we obtain the same firewise sectional category are the same of the firewise map. Same of the firewise map and the approaching the firewise vibration approach exactly because we have a firewise homotopy equivalence. But not in general. If we take instead of a firewise factorization, let's say that we take an ordinary factorization, then it is not true. Unless we are working with the vibrations all over the place. Hi, Jose. I have a question, if I could. Is there a notion of fiberwise ANR? A fiberwise ANR? Yes, I think so. Yes, there is a notion. I think so. Yes, there is a notion of highwise ANR. I can't tell you at the top of my head, I can't tell you exactly the definition, but there is a beautiful book by James, which is a firewise homotopy theory, where he defines there the notion of firewise absolute neighborhood retouch. Yeah. Okay, so you know what I'm gonna ask then. So, you know what I'm going to ask then. Can you replace the open set definition with arbitrary covers? Oh, that's a clever question. I don't know. I have to work out this, but I can't give you a straight answer to that question. Okay, thanks. But maybe, maybe. Okay, thanks. But maybe, maybe. Yes, it's probably. Thank you. Any further questions? I have another question. Can I ask a question? Okay, go on. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, yes. If I understood correctly, I mean, the statement that the fiberwise pointed sectional category always equals the fiberwise sectional category. Calls the fiberwise sectional category would be some sort of generalization of the Avase-Sakai conjecture. Is that true? So then the question would be, are there nice counterexamples to this generalization? So the comparison between the point diversion of the five-wise action category and the five-wise action category, you said. This is just This is just as much as the same as the it was a second conjecture. This is that okay. So, by generalizing the question, you don't produce any obvious counterexamples. No, no, no, no. This is just maybe a generalization of the conjecture. Let's say that. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So uh are we trying to keep track of using it? So I was wondering if you could do all of this in a suitable model category with agriculture topology. To do this in a suitable model category equipped with agriculture topology. Oof, I don't know. Sorry, I can't answer to that question, but there's a question I'll have to go more deep into. More deep into the points, and but I don't know honestly. Any more questions? All right, let's thank all of today's speakers.
