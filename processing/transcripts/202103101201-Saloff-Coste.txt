It's Lorenzo, of course, who really doesn't really need an introduction. So I'll skip that part, I'm afraid, and he'll talk about a personal selection of 36 views of the HIIT kernel. Thank you. Well, hi, everyone. Very nice to be with. To be with new people and old friends. And so, this is a leisurely walk in pleasant surroundings, which are familiar to many of you. I use the word ubiquitous heat kernels, which was proposed by By Serge Lang and Jay Jorgensen many years ago now. And they were surprised to find something that they called the gadget everywhere. And the gadget in question was the E kernel. I always thought that there was a mixed of I always felt that there was a mix of, of course, reverence for the e-kernel in the way they were speaking about it, because they were talking about its universal presence in mathematics, but also some sort of original disdain, the gadget. I think for all of us, the e-kernel is often more than a gadget. But certainly, we discover that we have many different ways to appreciate or to study it or to think about it. And that's what I want to celebrate with you today. And so I love Japan and Japanese art. And this is a view of the Monfuji by Okusai. Who said, I've drawn things since I was six. All that I made before the age of 65 is not worth counting. And okay, so I know there are people who think about retiring, and so I don't want to discourage them to retire. It's okay. In fact, since we are mathematicians, we can think of what we do as a community thing. As a community thinks, and I think the way to understand Okusai here is just to say what the young people are going to do is so much better than what we have done. So good luck to everyone. And let me start by the beginning. So what is the oh no, I forgot. I have a puzzle for you. So the puzzle is for people who know heat diffusion. Heat diffusion. What we are looking at here is a 3D body. So it has a boundary. And this body is made of a three-dimensional solid cone toward the top. This cone is, I want you to think of it as an infinite cone. This cone is attached to an infinite half-cylinder going down. Half-cylinder going down here. Here is a cone. And there is also attached to it a metallic plaque that's infinite in all direction and which has a kind of two-dimensional character, if you want, if you wish. So this is a manifold with boundary. Imagine all the, there is no corners. There is no corners. And not only is it a manifold, but it's a piece of metal, made of an homogeneous metal. And so we are going to eat a point in the middle of this piece here at time zero and eat it very hard. So it has essentially an infinite amount of heat at time zero concentrated. At time zero, concentrated at that point. And then we are going to watch the E diffuse in the manifold. And my puzzle for you is at time t, where is the hottest point? Okay, so you have a puzzle, and let's start to take off different views. Take of different views of the heat kernel. So let's start with the definition. There are many definitions possible of the kernel that are equivalent. In PDEs, the eat kernel is a fundamental solution of initial value problem. And so it's a function that's Function that satisfies our differential equation and is direct mass at time zero at the point where we have the origin. So in my puzzle, I was describing, trying to describe the temperature in this piece of metal at time t when we started with an infinite amount of temperature. Infinite amount of temperature at one point. So it corresponds to this notion of fundamental solution. This definition leads to the study of the property, the existence and property of this fundamental solution. But when it is done in PDE, it is often done through theorems that apply to all solutions of the heat equation. The heat equation. And so, somehow, the fundamental solution itself is not that fundamental. The fundamental comes from the fact that you can recover others' solution from it, of course, but it is not always treated so much as a fundamental object. Now, another way to define the kernel is to use functional analysis. Use functional analysis, and it will be often very important here. And so, to consider the ETH kernel as a proxy for the EAT semi-group, which is easier to define. It's exactly the same idea. The Eat semigroup solves the same equation with an initial condition. That's what we have here. And then, of course, if it exists, the heat kernel is a transition kernel in this sense of this it semi-group. Now, here I wrote the heat kernel as a measure because that's the most natural way at first to consider that object. Since we are not yet talking about probability. The fact that this transition kernel is probably a positive measure would come from analysis, maybe it's a maximum principle. Okay, so this subject can be defined in many different ways. So, for instance, this functionalizes approach. Functionalize this approach is really sandwiched between two views from PDH. So, the one I gave you here, which was really trying to construct an object that is a classical object. But there is another famous view in PDE, which would be to go distribution-wise and to consider everything as distributions that would have essentially a similar effect than the functional analysis approach to make trivial the existence of the. Trivial the existence of the fundamental solution. So you could capture the main idea of distribution theory, or the goal of distribution theory is to make trivial the existence of the fundamental solution. As an object which is well defined, even so there are many properties that you yet do not know about that object. So in some sense, the functionalized analysis approach or the each Analysis approach or the each semi-group approach is intermediate between these two. It's a little less far, the semi-group itself is a little better behaved than the distribution valued fundamental solution. And of course, here we have a picture of the Eat Semigo. Of the each omega of the solution at a certain time. And so my first step is to talk about other equations. So there are at least two very famous other equations. Very famous other equation associated, closely associated to the equation. The simpler elliptic problem where there is no time and we talk about harmonic function and the hyperbolic equation which corresponds to the modelization of waves. All these equations are associated to the same Laplacian operator. So, all these equations are related in various ways. We are all very familiar to the relation between the elliptic problem and the parabolic one through the definition of the green function as the integral in terms of integral in time of the heat kernel when that integral makes sense of course the this green kernel is itself the fundamental solution of the elliptic equation and so there is a point of view which would not relate that green function to the heat kernel but it is very important that It is possible to express everything about the green function, the elliptic problem, in terms of the heat equation. Of course, this is quite obvious since after all, the elliptic problem is just the parabolic problem minus the time. But it's remarkably But it's remarkably useful and it is often extremely useful to think of problems about the elliptic equations in term of problems for the parabolic equation. It's probably less understood that or known that there are very strong relations between the hyperbolic. Strong relation between the hyperbolic equation and the heat equation. After all, they seem to have very different properties. The main property of the wave equation is the finite speed propagation. And one of the main property of the heat equation is the infinite speed propagation. Nevertheless, there is. Nevertheless, there is a famous formula, so famous or so extraordinary that it's called a transmutation formula, which refers to the transformation of dirt into gold and which allows to express many things in terms of the wave equation. So the cosine s squared. So the cosine s square root of minus delta is the group associated to the wave equation, the group that solves the wave equation. And you can compute many other things in terms of that group. For instance, you can recover the heat kernel through that formula. You can see in this formula, perhaps maybe for the first time in this talk, that I am an analyst, so I refuse absolutely. Nanny, so I refused absolutely to divide the usual apparition by one half to define the heat equation. And I hope this formula is correct. Anyway, I didn't, yeah, I did write what the Fourier transform here is. There are very particular constants, and I hope they are correct. But if you want to use it, please check because. Because they might be wrong. Please interrupt if you have questions. Okay, so we have these different equations. They are all related to each other. And it's one way that we can take several views on the ETH equation, of course. Now, of course, many of you are familiar with probability theory better than me. Probability theory better than me. And the equation is related to one of the most famous stochastic processes, Bronin motion. So I wanted to take a slightly unusual path in describing this, saying that Bronyn motion is a stochastic process which has almost surely continuous paths and in And independent and equidistributed increment. And so if you study this process, you can try to compute its covariance matrix. It exists because the increments are equidistributed in some sense. That is, they do not depend, they depend only on the difference T minus S. The difference t minus s. And then, and again, if I got my constant correctly, in terms of the covariance matrix, this diffusion has a kernel distribution law, which is really the kernel and is written in this form. In these form. Of course, this is not the usual way people would describe the Bronian motion because there is only one Bronian motion in Rn, which is the one with covariance matrix sigma equal identity. And there is only one in the sense that indeed there are isometries. There are isometries between this object I just introduced and the one with the metric. And sorry, I should say there are isometries between any two of these objects in some sense. So transformations that will preserve everything of importance in front of us and turn one formula with one covariance. With one covariance to another one with a different covariance. Okay, that's my stilling the web for a picture of broin motion. Well, actually, it's a picture of random walk because most pictures of row in motion are picture of random walks with enough steps. Enough steps. And this allows us to talk for a minute about the many interesting aspects there are in the relation between discrete process such as Ronald Mock and limiting process, such as Brown in motion and their heat kernel. And the great importance of understanding. And the great importance of understanding how to pass between these two different worlds, where the kernel exists and is of great importance on both sides. From a probabilistic point of view, of course, each semi-group is expressed as an expectation of this process. Now, one reason I like Now, one reason I like to present this like this is because suppose we are interested in looking at Brownian motion on the torus. So before we were in flat space, Euclidean space Rn, and now we are on the torus, which is a quotient of Rn by the square lattice. And really, when you do that, there is something interesting that happened. There is something interesting that happened, which is on Rn, there is only really, as I explained a little bit before, and discussed at least before, only one Bronyin motion, which is the canonical Bronian motion. But as soon as you are on the toys, that's not true anymore. And there are a large collection of inequivalent Bruyne motion, all as canonical as each other. Canonical as each other on the torus. That's because on the torus we have less transformation, less freedom in changing, choosing the representation, the coordinates, and the representation of our space. There is a new rigidity. There is a new rigidity introduced by the lattice, the square lattice that you have to preserve. And of course, that means there are many different views of brain motion on the trust with different properties. Okay, so let's talk about why people, why are we interested in the ETH kernel? The heat kernel and the heat equation. Of course, one reason which doesn't appear on these slides is because we are interested in heat, but it appears only in my puzzle at the beginning. What is a temperature somewhere? But let's talk about mathematical reason why we are interested. So in my education, the first reason I encounter And I encounter something like the heat equation was actually in the following way. So, suppose you start with a function f on Rn, and we want to study some fine property of this function f. Well, one way to discover such property, to capture them, to say interesting things about them, is to extend this function. is to extend this function f to a function in upper half space. So we start with Rn here and we augment it and then now F is given here and we extend it to the space above the place where F exists originally. And there we get a new function which we call Get a new function which we call u. So, this is the harmonic extension of the function f, and many property of f are reflected in the property of this harmonic extension. This harmonic extension is given by very basic formula that use the gadget called The gadget called the Poisson kernel, which I've written here together with the constants that come with it. And I think when I was doing my first step into advanced mathematics, there are very few people who would have thought of using anything else than the harmonic extension in order to study. In order to study F. Even so, now most people would prefer to use the caloric extension of the function f to the upper half space. And for the semi group point of view, these two objects are essentially very similar because they are both obtained by the action of a semigroup in a very natural way. Of a semi-group in a very natural way. As I said, the function u is the harmonic extension, so it's an harmonic function. You can recognize the Laplacian in n plus one dimension here. Or equivalently, you can see it as a solution of a non-local problem involving the square root of minus the Laplacian. But it turns But it turned out that it's really more convenient and more easier technically to often to use the heat extension or caloric extension, as I say here. And this has to do with some property of the heat kernel and the fact that the heat kernel has much nicer integrability property. And so this extension extends to many more functions than the Poisson extension, which makes many. Poisson extension, which makes many problems easier to study or to start. Okay, so that's one way we can use the eat semigroup and the kernel. And why do we want to do that? So as I mentioned, we want to study properties of F. So here is an example which is close to my heart because I was doing this kind of thing when I was a student. Doing this kind of thing when I was young. And okay, you have the older space lambda alpha. So this older space, of course, is the space of function, let's say in Rn which are bounded and satisfy this equation, this uh condition. This condition. And this past of function can be equivalently defined using this caloric extension. And if you use a caloric extension, here is the quantity that replace this quantity. And there are many interesting things about that. This expresses property of the way the caloric function approximate the original function f. And so you can view this as a part of the theory of approximation. In fact, it is very important, it's the theory of approximation. Very important is the theory of approximation. And the other thing that's interesting is just not this property, but many other properties that can be defined in this way. Note also that on top here, we have a rather geometric definition that uses a notion of distance. Whereas here, this completely disappears, and we are able to get a description of the same object just using this Caloric extension. And again, the older alpha is just one example about so many of this idea. Okay, so another way the ETH kernel appears as a very important solution is to discuss the positive uniqueness of the heat equation. So here I'm asking Where our positive solution of the heat equation in the upper half space comes from? And it's a beautiful theorem that they come from Radon measure on Rn with a very basic integrability property. And I wrote it wrong. No, I wrote it. No, I was right. I was right. The measure ν is supposed to be able to integrate any exponential of the square of the distance. And those measure are exactly the initial solution of the equation. So, of course, this is much more than a uniqueness result. It's a description of where all Of where all solution comes from Okay, so let's make a big step now into our conference. Nobody talked about the e-kernel in RN because we are interesting in Because we are interested in generalization of this idea. So, Todd, you are here still, Todd. I'm here. Yeah, so the picture at the beginning of the talk is actually one of the 10 views of Montfuji that are not part of the 36 views of Montfuji of the book of Okusai. Of Okusai. The book was so successful that he immediately drawn 10 more. And the picture at the beginning of the talk is a 37 view of Monfuji indeed. It's the first of the 10 additional prints made by Yokusai after the publication of the 366 view. And I have to say, of course, there is more than Say, of course, there is more than 46 views of Mount Fuji, and there are more than 46 views of the Eat Kernel, right? And Okusai, a few years later, published 100 views of Mount Fuji. I decided to be modest and take you only through a few of the 36 first views. Okay, so January is. Okay, so generalization. So in finite dimension, there are two really fundamental, from my point of view, generalization of the heat equation. First is Riemannian manifold. And we have heard many talks about or many mention of that generalization. Generalization. We have a Laplace Beltrami operator, and with especially the help of this semi-group point of view, it's very quick and immediate to extend the notion of it kernel to this setting. But there is another one which is. But there is another one which is just exactly on the same footing, and maybe even should be considered more fundamental than the one for Riemannian manifold. Rn is a group and the Laplacian is an invariant operator on that group, a constant coefficient operator on that group. And so for any group G, Lie group, we can pick We can pick a bunch of vector fields, call them left invariant vector fields, set the notion of constant vector fields, if you want, on a group. And consider the Laplacian, which is just the sum of square of this vector field. For those on the know, of course, if the group is not unimodular, maybe this. Maybe this Laplacian is not really the object you want to consider, or maybe it is, depends. But if it's the group is unimodular, so for many familiar group, that's a very natural construction. Unimodular means that there is only one harm measure, left and right invariant. And what's interesting about this second Second generalization, of course, is the fact that the condition of this vector field on this vector field is a new, very rich and interesting twist. They don't need to generate linearly the Lie algebra. They just need to generate the Lie algebra as a Lie algebra. Of course, this is the famous Hormander condition. Or Mondler condition. And so this second generalization takes us into the world of sub-elliptic diffusions and sub-elliptic sub-Riemannian geometry. Now, we have seen in the previous talks that there are many more generalizations of these notions. Of this notion. And one of the very large family of them is the passage to metric measure space using Dirichlet forms. Of course, this is a question of making sense of the fundamental property of this object, the Dirich Leform. And this fundamental property turns out to be remarkably simple. The contraction property and the chain rule. I am not going to say exactly what I mean by the chain rule, but the fact that you can compute the gradient of the composition of functions, which is related to the fact that we deal with local operators. Operators. And this generalization is really a remarkable thing. It takes us to different worlds. So I make a short list. Rough spaces. Be careful. I'm not talking about rough paths here. Also, that's another view, but I'm talking about rough spaces such as complexes. I don't know how to draw complexes very well. Alexandrov spaces, which are limit of Riemannian manifolds that are not necessarily in the proper sense Riemannian. Fractals. Epstein, one of two people who are interested in fractals. Who are interested in fractals in the audience? The infinite-dimensional torus. I guess I'm the only person interested in the infinite dimensional torus, but that's okay. So there are many, many, many spaces that carry Jewish reform of interest. And anytime we are in this situation, we have all these. And we have all these different views of the it kernel that come to answer us and to ask to be developed in these settings. Now, you see here I said finite dimensions, so I was not meaning to talk about path space and loop space, which are coming now. So So, we can also go into higher dimension. And we do that by first going to finite dimension in a slightly different way, which maybe at first, if you are educated in the world of RN, seems a bit artificial, which is to consider this remarkable Dirich Le Form made out. Dirichlet form made of the usual gradient but integrated against a new measure, which is the Eat kernel. Now, there are many reasons why this subject is actually canonical and natural, even so naively, it's not. Naively, it's not necessarily completely obvious. And please observe that this object, which we just built using pieces that we already had before, the gradient, square, and the heat kernel. We can do that not only on Rn, but we can do it on manifold, we can do it on our sub-Riemannian geometry. Or sub-Riemannian geometries with sub-elliptic operators. We could do it on any of the many generalization we were mentioning before and get new questions of interest, some of which are very hard and some of which are more amenable. Of course, there is a process associated with the process. There is a process associated with this Jewish reform in RN, which is the famous Ornstein-Ullenbeck process. Sorry for the latter inversions. And of course, this construction generalized to Hilbert spaces, as Len taught to young people many years ago. And that And that gives us yet another world in which to explore the property of the heat kernel. Very relevant to many talks in the conference are all these infinite dimensional generalizations, and in particular, the it kernel on paths and loop spaces over manifold and groups. Fault and groups. One aspect of this infinite-dimensional analysis is the triangular Siegel-Berman isomorphism story. There are many other names that come with that story, so I sticked with the two classical ones that I learned from Len. And of course, And of course, there are better experts than me about this isomorphism, but I will try to give a very short picture of them. So, first of all, we have a triangle. And there are three points in this triangle. One is L2 of Rn with Gauss measure. I didn't give the I didn't give the exact definition of new, so I'm secure. Whatever I'm going to see is going to be true. You have to be careful about your constant here. Another point, so maybe this is this point. So now another point, and maybe I'll put it at top, this one, the holomorphic beautiful top of the triangle, which is holomorphic L2 function on the L2 function on the complex space Cn equipped with the Gauss measure μ. There should not be a T here, no T. The third length of the triangle is a Hilbert. Is a Hilbert space of Taylor coefficients. Well, if you want to describe it as the Hilbert space of Taylor coefficients, you better have a smooth function. So that means that description is coming from the correspondence with the top, which is a space of holomorphic function. And the beauty of this triangle is that it is a triangle. It is a triangle, so we have two sides, but there is a third side, and the third side, I think, if I am correct, can be described by using Hermit polynomial expansion of the function f in L2. So, in this triangle, the heat kernel is everywhere. It provides a definition. It provides a definition of the different Hilbert space, at least two of them. It provides also a description of the map. Here I just wrote the description, very simple description of the map from R2 equipped with Gauss measure into holomorphic L2 equipped with different Gauss measure. Equipped with different Gauss measures which come from the it kernel. How do you get an holomorphic function using the it kernel? Well, you use the fact that the it kernel has an extension to a complex variable. That's quite obvious and makes it quite explicit. Of course, if you are interested in this physical significance of this isomorphism between Hilbert spaces, you should ask Bruce Driver or Len Gross to explain to you why they are significant. Okay. Okay, so on diagonal and off-diagonal behavior and the relation to geometry. So it turns out that there are many interesting geometry questions that are captured by the e-kernel. And so this is a big shift. Suddenly, the e-kernel tells us a lot of things about geometry. Geometry, and of course, geometry tells a lot of things about the e-kernel. I'm going to go a little bit fast here, but electric contractivity is the theory of the control of how the heat semi-group send L1 into L infinity. And it's also a theory of the sup norm of the The sup norm of the it kernel. And it's related to a slow of functional inequalities, sublf, Nash, isoparimetric inequality. Here I wrote a form of Nash inequality, which uses the Dirichlet form to control some strange expression. Expression on the left. And so, such inequality is directly related to the problem of estimating the undiagonal behavior of the heat kernel. Concerning the off-diagonal behavior, I want to say a word to come back to the relation to the wave equation. I have a long line written here which explains why. Written here, which explains why the basic relation between the wave equation, which has finite speed propagation property, and the e-kernel, tell you why the off-diagonal behavior of the kernel is universally Gaussian. If you think about two functions phi1, phi2, well, it should. Phi1, Phi2, whose support is well separated, then you would see that the action of the each semigroup on these two functions here is controlled by this expression. The pre-factor here comes from the formula related. The formula related relating the heat equation to the wave equation. And the key point here is the fact that this integral starts only at R, which captures the distance between the support of the two functions. And the fact that this integral starts only at R is exactly the consequence of the finite speed propagation of the wave equation. Okay, I'm going to go a little fast because, in the last few minutes, I would like to reach the end of my talk. So, we just stepped into the world of geometry, and that takes us to curvature. Well, many things on this Many things on this slide have been discussed before during the previous talk and talks, and including the previous talk, the talk before me of Robert. Well, you heard about the Bochner relation, which is giving a link between Laplacian gradient and the Ricci curvature. It has many. It has many applications from Lichinarovich, which gave a lower bound for the spectral gap of a compact Riemannian manifold in terms of the positive curvature, to Yahoo and his collaborators who told us to control everything about the heat kernel using the Richie lower bound to the far-reaching extent. Extension of this idea by Backry and Emery and Backry, the curvature dimension inequality for Jewish less space and beyond, which is written here, and which is a simple reinterpretation of the Boekner formula in a much more general context. Context. And finally, Robert was talking about how the Richie curvature is controlled, is captured by the heat equation on power space. And more modestly, lower bound on the Ricci curvature are famously captured using the semi-group, the heat semi-group, through certain inequalities. Through certain inequalities. If you give me one more minute or two, I want to jump to the fact that there is very interesting reinterpretation of all this using transport inequality. So in this line, you have the Wasserstein distance. Between two measures, and these two measures are two equal measures at two different points. And this Vasselshine distance can be controlled using a curvature low and bond, and that's equivalent to having a curvature low and bond. In all these discussions, there is really two. Discussion: there is really two levels I would like to distinguish: the zero-order type thing where you talk mostly about the eat kernel itself, and the first order type, where you talk about grading estimates. And these two levels are quite different in nature. Here, in the description of the first-order term, you have the most basic. Term you have the most basic form of Lieutenant gradient in Arnach inequality for manifold with non-negative Richie curvature. And here is my final puzzle, which is related to joint work with Marsha Gordina and Nate Eldridge. So suppose you have a compact group G, for instance, SON. For instance, SON for a fixed n, and you looked at all the possible interesting Laplacians that exist on this group. There is only one bi-invariant Laplacian, essentially, but there are many, many left-invariant Riemannian metric. And so we look at all these Riemannian Laplacian. So the puzzle is. So, the puzzle is: is it true that the first-order heat kernel analysis holds uniformly for all metrics on this group in the same way? And you can ask it in a very simple way here. Does it exist a constant C of G that works for all the left invariant metrics so that you have the simplest possible Arnacht inequality on balls, the elliptic one. The elliptic one with the same constant. And then there is a first-order version of this same question where you ask for the validity of a Yao or Cheng-Yao type Arnac gradient inequality again for harmonic function on balls. And here the interest of the puzzle is in the uniform. of the puzzle is in the uniformity of the constant in through all the different metrics and this is very much related with the role of curvature in complex and interesting ways and i will say simply that masha gordina netelerage and i are conjecturing that the ancestors And I are conjecturing that the answer is yes for the first question. And we have some supporting evidence, but that we have no supporting evidence or personally no belief about the second one, which seems much more difficult. And thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions? Yeah, one. Yeah. So, what's the hottest point on that funnel? So do you have a gas lamp? No, but I was listening to everything that Laurent was saying from the point of view of trying to use. Point of view of trying to use that information to figure out what that hottest point was. Anyone has a guess? Yeah, I think it's the outer rim of the disk. There is no outer rim of the disk. It's infinite. Oh, I missed that point. Now I don't have a guess. The negative curvature points. The negative curvature point in the middle down so the artist region is here. What's happening on the boundary? So, as somebody said, the gray thing is not boundary, it's the material inside. Material inside, right, at the boundary, there is no loss of heat. Oh, okay. It's easier to draw an interesting picture of solid bodies than of a true manifold. Of course, there are manifolds like that, but we would have to be higher-dimensional creatures to be able. Higher dimensional creature to be able to look at them. So that's why I draw a body. So by the way, the saints
