So my mother's native language was Spanish and she could never pronounce my first name. So I am very used to it. First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting this together, inviting me. It's always a super pleasure and come to first. I've learned a lot this week. A lot of people doing very interesting, very complicated things. This will be reasonably simple. I know you're all tired. I'm tired. Okay, so I have. Okay, so I have first to make a confession. I don't work on tourist media. I worked on suspensions. But I would argue you look at this and you squint your eyes and you think, this all looks like porous media. And the difference between porous media and suspensions is that, well, in suspensions, the stuff that's in the fluid can't overact. It's not fixed in place. This has hydrodynamic consequences. This has hydrodynamic consequences, but really it's the interaction between a flow and a complicated geometry. In my case, often the complicated geometry of moving, and oftentimes in complex suspending fluid. I'm also interested in not just passive suspensions, but active suspensions, where the particles inside the fluid are generating motion on their own. So if I just let the fluid be, it will generate motion, have a very complicated pattern. Have very complicated patterns, you know, heterodynamic interactions between these bodies. So, this is an out-of-equilibrium system. And it can be a biological system like bacteria, something halfway in between, a jungle of molecular motors and mycotubules, or a purely synthetic system, polystyrene beads rolling around and interacting with each other. And the essential message is that you get very complicated emergent dynamics that emerge from many body interactions. Okay, so first I'll start. Okay, so first I'll start simply. When the fluids are Newtonian and there's no inertia, then things are linear. So everyone knows this movie. Stokes equations are linear, they're time independent, that leads to kinematic reversibility. So I can basically unwind anything that I do with a fluid, and the linearity gives you an enormous mathematical hammer with which to deal with these problems. So I'll talk very briefly about Newtonian suspensions, and then I'll say how. I'll say how all of that is out the window when it's not inclined. Okay, so a brief primer on suspension dynamics in SokSlow. Say I have a bunch of particles sitting in a flow, the flow is otherwise quiescent, then the governing equations for these particles are F equals zero. The particles have no inertia. So the hydrodynamic force plus any external force on the particle sums to zero because I've thrown away MA. So, hydrodynamic force plus external force equals zero. So, if I have many particles, I've just rolled up all the forces and torques on all these particles into one giant vector, so I don't have to write many equations, so I don't have to write 6n equations. Likewise, I'll say velocity of the particles, it could be one particle, but otherwise it's translational rotational velocities of all the particles pulled up into one long vector. And the connection between the velocities of the particles. The velocities of the particles and the forces on the particles is a linear one because this is Stokes flow, everything is linear. So the hydrodynamic forces on these particles is linear in the velocities of the particles. And the operator that relates to two is the probabilistics tensor. And well, this is totally everything is linear. So the velocity field everywhere here is linear in particle velocities. There's some operator that takes the velocities of the particles and gives you the velocity field. gives you the velocity field, call it G, and likewise there is some operator that takes the velocities of the particles and gives you the stress field. I will use these two operators later. Keep them in mind. And if I want to know the dynamics of the particles and I have the forces, I just invert this resistance, I get something called the mobility. The product of the mobility and the external forces gives me the velocities of the particles. Okay. If the particles are active, If the particles are active and in a background flow, slightly more complicated. The particle I'm saying is active, can deform. So now, velocity on the boundary of the particle is a rigid body motion, but also maybe an activity. And because it's in a background flow, the presence of the particle will also disturb the background flow, have a disturbance flow. So it turns out that calculating the hydrodynamic force in Stokes. Calculating the hydrodynamic force in Stokes Low on this particle can be simply done if I already know the hydrodynamic force on it if it's passive and quiescent to it. So I can take this operator T from the previous slide and I can reintegrate this. Rather than just with this, I can reintegrate it with the disturbance flow along the boundary and I get the hydrodynamic force for free on this active particle without having to solve for this complicated flow. Having to solve for this complicated flow field. So the hydrodynamic force on this now is a part due to rigid body motion, a part due to activity, and a part due to the background flow. And again, if I want the dynamics of this particle, I just invert the resistance, and then I have velocities of the particles, mobility, then the hydrodynamic force due to activity, the hydrodynamic force with the background, and any external force. And if I want to make this stochastic, rather. And if I want to make this stochastic, Roundian, then I know how to do that. I have the resistance. The resistance sets the magnitude of the Brownian force. The resistance is spatially varying, which usually isn't a suspension. You have to take care of this term. But the dynamics of active particles in a linear or in a linear fluid, this we can calculate, even if it's Brownian, because of linearity. It's a computational problem, this operator we need to find. We need to find, and so, for example, in Stoichian Dynamics, the trick is to project this particular projection onto spherical harmonics, truncate that projection, and then you grant four lap. Okay, so then you can do things very quickly in Newtonian fluids. There's thousands of particles active, all interacting hydrodynamically with both near-field and far-field interactions. So you can take this giant hammer from linear. From linear PDE theory and apply it to suspensions and Newtonian quids. The properties of Stokes flow also limit the dynamics when you have symmetry. These are questions I like to ask in my graduate course. I'm in Stokes flow, and I have a particle sedimenting pointy end down or blunt end down. Is there a velocity difference? No, forbidden by kinematic reversibility. So if I flip gravity, I get the same problem. I get the same problem. Can these particles get closer if they're sedimenting down together and so close? No, forbidden. By kinematic reversibility. If I'm sedimenting near a wall, can I get closer or further away from the wall? No, forbidden. If I'm in a pipe flow and I'm being affected by the flow, do I move closer or further away from the wall? No, forbidden. If I'm an active particle and I'm actuating in a way that's time-reversible, do I Way that's time reversible. Do I go anywhere on average? No, forbidden. By kinematic reversibility of the field equations. So if you have some symmetry and you have Stokes flow, lots of dynamics are forbidden. But this is a conference on non-Newtonian fluids. And all of that is out the window. So, okay, we all know where fluid complexity comes from. So, this will be, yeah, okay, fluids now nonlinear, time-dependent. And the question is: what effects does this have on particle dynamics? So, I'm just going to generically represent a non-Newtonian fluid with a stress tensor that has a Newtonian part, and then a non-Newtonian part. And you can put in your favorite evolution equation for that non-Newtonian part. I'll tell you what I do in a little bit. Okay, so it turns out that we can write in a closed form expression. In a closed-form expression, beautifully, the dynamics of a suspension of particles in a complex fluid, just by adding one single term here to my expression for a Newtonian fluid. So this is Newtonian. If it's non-Newtonian, I just add an extra force. So that extra force is, well, if my stress tensor is different, then clearly I have to integrate this extra bit on the surface of the particle. Of the particle. But the whole flow field is wrong. So I have to have another part due to the fact that I've used, for this stuff, a Newtonian flow field. So I have a body force from the divergence of this extra non-Newtonian stress that changes the entire flow field. And it turns out that if I want the effect of this on my non-Newtonian force, the direct integrated. Integrated function here. Very beginning from Rigibody motion. So you can get this in a number of ways. This is like projecting on an adjoint. Sometimes it's called virtual power principle, reciprocal theorem, many different names. This looks nice and easy. Of course, you have to actually solve the entire flow field to get what this non-Newtonian stress is. So just because I have an integral expression for what the force is, doesn't make it. Integral expression for what the force is doesn't make my life easy. But what I will do in this talk is I will assume that I am in the weakly nonlinear regime. So I will perturb away from a Newtonian solution. This entire thing will be given by the quadratic products that are in this non-Newtonian stress of the Newtonian solution. Okay, so I just have to solve the Newtonian flow solution. I will plug it into here. I will plug it into here, then I will get what the first fraction is due to complex fibrillogy. This is a theoretical difficulty. In Stokes law, I know what to do on the forces Brownian. When it's complex, this is an open question. If it's passive and it's just jiggling around due to thermal fluctuations, we can do something there. We can do something there. We basically do what we did in a Newtonian fluid, except make the viscosity complex. If it's active, really driving the system, then all bets are off. Okay, so now that I'm in a viscous acid fluid, something like this, we saw earlier in Vivette's talk, we'd have cross-stream migration. If I want to add inertia and elasticity, we see. We see this nice paper by the parents of the two children who have been joining us for lunch and dinner. You get spectacularly complex. These are the fixed points of a particle in a channel flow when I have both inertia and physical acid design. So a number of stable and unstable fixed points. Ratchet. So we go from not being able to move anywhere to a whore. Anywhere to a horror. And you can make it even more complicated by having some curvature in the channel. Okay, when things are active, complex fluids really change dynamics as well as for passive particles. So this is firm cell swimming through Newtonian fluid. This is visco acid fluid. It changes its actuation completely. This is E. coli trajectories in the water. This is in a polar. This is in a polymeric fluid, completely straight, horrifying. If I have something active in shear flow of this plastic fluid, we saw in Holger's talk, the dynamics of the active thing and shear flow of Newtonian fluid completely altered. I have complex many-body interactions, bacteria and water, versus in the liquid crystal, the dynamics are completely altered. I'll give you a I'll give you the simplest example of things being altered in a suspension. So, perhaps the most canonical result in suspensions is that if I have a very dilute suspension in spheres, this changes the apparent viscosity or the effective viscosity of the system. Flow cannot go through this particle. I have extra dissipation. And I'm trying to quantify what this correction is in the delivery limit. So I have 5 plus 5 pass volume fraction correction to the zero shear viscosity which is depending. Zero shear viscosity of the suspending fluid. What happens now if I have a shear-thinning fluid, for example? So a fluid that has a zero shear viscosity, but the viscosity varies with strain range. And then I put a particle into it. So now, putting the particle in, yeah, it increases the dissipation until you get an Einstein correction to the zero shear viscosity, but the increase in dissipation also increases the shear. In dissipation also increases the shear thinning, and so I'll have a second Einstein correction to the shear thinning. The same thing if I put the particle in a weakly visible elastic fluid, I have a correction for the zero shear viscosity, and then a volume fraction dependent correction to the Einstein viscosity that's proportional to the square of the Eisenberg. So Einstein's results in 1906, the first corrections due to shear thinning in this glass is to be 112 years later. To be 112 inches away. The particles in complex fluids can be hard to perform. Okay, so I'm going to focus on a couple of sort of simple results and try and understand some more complicated dynamics. Okay, so if I take a particle, spherical particle, and I oscillate it in a Newtonian fluid, this is what the streamlines look like, but the time average velocity field is exactly zero. Velocity field is exactly zero. So I'm just moving it back and forth. If I do an average, nothing happens. Because I'm just reversing, reinforcing, and then the flow field exactly replaces. If I put this in a viscoelastic fluid, now I have polymers being stretched. I have this extra stress of polymers along these curved streamlines. Something that is stretchy, a stretchy rubber random is going to go into a curve. I want to go into a curve, it wants to straighten out. And so I have this outward flow, and by conservation of mass, I have an inward flow. Okay, so this is viscolastic steady streaming flow due to an oscillating sphere in a viscolastic flow. I think initially calculated, how am I parenthesis, Volger? Boom. Okay, so I get a time average flow in a basic glass of fluid. Essentially, this is the mean of the quadrature. Fluid. Essentially, this is the mean of the quadratic terms. So if I have a Newtonian fluid and I'm oscillating it, the entire velocity field is proportional to that frequency. But if I'm in a viscoelastic fluid and it's weakly viscoelastic, then I have mean terms from the quadratic products and the non-minier terms. Okay, so that's a single particle, symmetric. What happens if I take an asymmetric particle and I oscillate that? That. So now the flow is not going to be symmetric up, down. This is going to generate a net flow. So if I take the simplest nonlinear microometer I can think of, is essentially any particle, shake it in a viscoelastic fluid. If it moves on average, the fluid is viscoelastic, some of the. As long as I'm not shaking it so vigorously. It so viscous vigorously that I excite inertia. So, in this particular case, this will move up. Purely due to viscelasticity, it will move nowhere if the fluid is Newtonian, nowhere if the fluid is linearly visculastic. It's the non-linear terms of the viscelasticity. Yeah, just two glued together. This is my making something asymmetric. I glue two spheres together. And likewise, if I have two spheres, And likewise, if I have two spheres and I have some magical piston that connects them, and they just go like this. And in a Newtonian fluid, this doesn't move, but in a viscolastic fluid, it does. So is this a statement which you make also for an arbitrary scholastic fluid? So, yeah, essentially an arbitrary fluid, not a linear viscology, has to have non-linearity in an arbitrary viscosity fluid. Viscules fluid. And well, essentially, any viscules of fluid in the weekly nonlinear limit will look something like a second-order fluid. We'll have these, unless you very care, and you can do this, and I'll talk about this in a bit, very carefully tune coefficients, this will move if it's asymmetric. So Holger talked also about this case yesterday. So if I put this in an ultra-B fluid, I make the amplitude of oscillation small. One can Oscillation small. One can calculate the mean motion of this if I let these things go. And this is essentially proportional to the first normal stress coefficient. The reason for this, again, if I have a particle that I oscillate it, I get a viscoelastic steady streaming flow. And if I put another particle in that viscoelastic, steady streaming flow, well, due to the no-slip condition, this particle doesn't want to remain stationary. There's a force on a particle moving it. And then if I make up the two-particle, Removing it, and then if I make up the two particles, and now both particles are oscillating, if I make them of different sizes, there'll be a net motion on the particles. Okay, this has been realized in different forms. So this is experiments from Plaza Ratio's group. They put this thing in a rotating magnetic field. It goes like this. To leading order, you can think of just the top sphere going like this. And then think about the steady streaming flow through that top sphere. Push this way. Push this way. This one just going like this. That flow will push this way, this whole thing will go down. And maybe the first instance of this, two spheres glued together, not necessarily right on top of each other, maybe have some little invisible rod I can separate them, but I rotate this object. This will move also due to a viscous steady streaming flow. That one will move towards the point at the end. Toward the pointy end, the smaller sphere. Okay, so this is what the steady streaming flow looks like for a rotating, the weakly nonlinear steady streaming flow leading to a rotating sphere. So a sphere rotates like this. You have these curved streamlines going across. They want to come in. So they come in. At this axis, conservation of mass pushes the fluid in. So clearly, this doesn't go anywhere because it's up, down, symmetric, but if I break that. Symmetric, but if I break that symmetry by putting another one of these there, then, well, at least to my first approximation, it looks like this is pushing more fluid this way than it is that way. Just because this one is smaller and I've shrunk this exact same image to make it this size. But this is what the fluid looks like in reality. So, more fluid going this way than this way. This thing goes up. So, I can use the same idea. So, I can use the same idea and break symmetry by having a wall. So, this rotates, pushes fluid down. I have a no-slip wall. Fluid can't go through the wall. This has to have an adject up. And I can use this to support a particle that is density mismatched with the fluid. And it's essentially the balance of the first normal stress difference and the density mismatch weight of the particle. Okay, so taking these ideas, Eric Chakfei's group thought: okay, rather than co-rotating spheres, why don't I make them counter-rotate? Then I don't have to have an external magnetic field rotating this thing. I can just put a little motor in here, have this thing rotate, and then due to the fact that I'm not imposing a torque, then the big circle will counter-rotate. So then the steady streaming flows of both. The steady streaming flow is of both, but now the small sphere is rotating much faster, and the big sphere is driving a viscoelastic flow this way that's bigger than this way, and so this thing will move that direction. So again, this thing moves strictly due to the nonlinear area of the fluid. This is a little micro-real. Okay, so in a talk, I think two years ago, he mentioned that if I replace If I replace this sphere with a cone, it goes much faster, it works much better. And then there was a discussion that we had: well, is that the case because a cone on its own would move? A sphere on its own doesn't? Then I thought, okay, well, if this thing is kind of like the two-sphere thing, surely the cone on its own would move this way. Ah. I said, ah, I can't be that. The cone would move this way. And I obsessed about this. And that evening, I sent him an email saying, I think I'm completely wrong. I think this doesn't go this way, but this way. So the last few minutes I'll try to unpack that question. Okay, so simple way to try and unpack it. I have a sphere, it's rotating. I have a sphere, it's rotating, generates this kind of flow. If I have half a sphere, I have something that looks like this. While this is driving fluid this way, surely it goes this way. This part is doing something. Look at it. Does it go that way? A flat plate rotating also generates flow. So maybe a sphere. So maybe a sphere is, I have a sphere in a flat plate. And this looks like driving more fluid this way than that way. So I think it goes that way. And that's what it does, but it's not super obvious. So a lot of fluid being driven this way, more being driven that way. This object goes this way. And it turns out. It turns out that any fraction of a sphere, if I take a sphere and I cut it anywhere, it always goes towards the cut side. It's generating more flow from the rounded edge. Okay, so check the whole parameter space for cutting spheres. Always goes this way. Okay, so back to the cone. Which way does it go? So initially I thought up, then I thought, oh, this is nonsense. So if I look at the streamlines, it's just pulling fluid in, pushing it this way. This is weaker down here, slowly goes down. This thing goes nowhere. This is the streamlines. So exactly the same amount of fluid being pushed that way as that way. That rotating column goes absolutely nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. It's completely balanced. Very much up-down asymmetric. But that particular geometry was nowhere. Is it special because of the angle? It is special because of the angle. So I picked this one. So if I make the angle a little bit shallower, it goes in the direction, goes towards the flat side. But if I make it But if I make it very narrow, it goes the other way. So if you think about if this was straight, like a rod, then there's no real preferential direction. So you just have flow coming in, and it's the same everywhere. And so if I make this really narrow, then this, so the flow generated by the flat part wins. And I can have it go the other direction. The geometry, the interaction of the geometry with the flat part. Of the geometry with the first normal stress difference matters. It's not trivial. I thought I could look at these shapes and immediately, with my intuition of what the sort of base flow looks like, how first normal stress differences are generated, intuit immediately which direction things can go. And it isn't trivial. So here are the different cases. This goes this way. This doesn't go anywhere. This doesn't go anywhere. This goes that way. It turns out, same with the spheroidal cap. I can have it go this way or that way, depending on how narrow it is. Okay, so because Rob is in the grab, what about second normal stress differences? Well, so I assumed that everything here, N2 is 0. So it's an old droid B expansion. But if I include even a small amount of n2, it can really fundamentally change some solutions. For example, the completely balanced solution, if n1 is completely balanced, it doesn't necessarily mean n2 is completely balanced. So even if I have large n1, much larger n1 than n2, it can affect the dynamics if I just happen to balance. If I just happened to balance N1. Granted, if it's really asymmetric, then a small amount of N2 probably doesn't make a difference. If I make the magnitude of N2, in some magical fluid, if I make the magnitude of N2 greater than N1, the results all flip. So N2 will generally drive motion in the opposite direction. We don't have really good intuition of scenarios in which N2 is big. Scenarios in which N2 is big and N1 is small, that's a problem. But things can be fundamentally different if I have some N2. And of course, then things can be really, really different if I have inertia, I have really strongly nonlinear effects, but even sort of weakly nonlinear. So my my moral is that fluid rheology can really completely change the dynamics of particles suspended within the fluid. Particle suspended within the fluid. And that even if I have weakly nonlinear fluids or weakly nonlinear deformations, weakly nonlinear expresses, fluid biology and particle shape interact in really non-trivial ways that are difficult to predict and difficult to know. And I don't have very good intuition, and I would argue that much of the community doesn't have very good intuition of what will happen, even in weakly nonlinear cases, if I have slightly weekly nonlinear cases, if I have slightly complicated geometry mixed flow types, what sort of the leading order effects of this elasticity will do and how they will change in Newtonian flow when it's non-Nucleonian. With that, PhD student postdoc and former PhD student, we did all the work and funding and I'm happy to take any questions. I have no idea when I started, but. Yeah, could you go back to slide 11 really quick? That's an interesting average that you basically have there. Let's see. That one. What is that GU? So GU is the operator that gives you the Newtonian flow field from the velocity of the particle. The velocity of the particle in a Newtonian fluid. So if I have, if I pull a particle with velocity u, gu would give me the Newtonian velocity field. And that happens to be precisely the right kernel against which, it's like the Green's function against which to integrate the body force due to a dynamic stress. So so that's not related to the, they're independent of each other. Yeah, yeah, so this is just the right kernel. This is just the right kernel, and you get this from a principle of virtual power. This is exact. This doesn't assume anything. But you have to have... So this is the body force term, the extra body force term that you have due to non-equal stress. Interesting because if you apply an averaging theorem to that for that divergence that's inside the integral, you basically get that term out as an extra term. Well, yeah, so you can plug. Yeah, so you can pull this out, but then you have a radiant thing. So, yeah, you can interpret it, and very often I pull this out. Great talk, thank you. I have a question about these shapes of the particles which you shade and when they move. Uh can you formulate some sort of a shape parameter which tells you uh goes up or down and it gives uh it gives you the velocity? Equips to the velocity? Okay? Yeah, so I mean, a way in which to generalize these ideas. So the basic idea is if I have asymmetry, then I should be driving, I have extra stress, and that extra stress doesn't necessarily have to be symmetric. The problem is that shape and that extra strength interact in not the most obvious way, where the extra Not the most obvious way where the extra stress can be completely balanced, even if I have something asymmetrical. So I said, I shake anything and it will move. And that's not quite true. Because what does the stress look like and what is the shape of the particle? And it might be that even though it's asymmetric, the extra stresses are perfectly balanced. So, yeah, I mean, we're at the very beginning of this journey and trying to generalize this in a way that isn't a little bit of this person goes in this direction. Well, this particular shape goes in this direction, this particular shape goes in that direction. Trying to formulate this is: okay, well, this has this structure which excites this kind of stress, and then the stress should be asymmetric for this reason. But we are certainly not there yet. Parallel of questions from Thanksgiving.
