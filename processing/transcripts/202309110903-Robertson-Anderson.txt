Be here. And yeah, I like being the first speaker because there's no bar that's been set yet. And also, I would encourage questions during my talk. So as they come up, I would like this to be a conversation. So please interrupt me with questions. So today I'm going to be talking to you about emergent micromechanics of active, well, emergent micromechanics. Oh, well, virgin micromechanics of cytoskeleton deposits. And so, this is work. And so, before I start and what I'm going to be mainly talking about, I'll just give you a little bit of an overview of what my lab focuses on. So, the main driving question is how we want to understand how living systems can create resilient, tunable, active materials. And there are three main systems that we look at. The first is cytoskeleton, which Which you know, I don't really need to explain to most of you in the room, and this is what my talk will be focusing on. We have you know rigid, rigid microtubules, semi-flexible lactic filaments, and then we have motors, myosin and kinesin that act on these filaments and crosshairs. And then also we look at DNA, and specifically I'm interested in when you have DNA at very high concentrations and under confinement, what their rheological properties are, and then. What their rheological properties are, and then how topology plays a role. So, we have these enzymes that can drive, that can take DMA from supercoiled to rings to linears and chop them up into little bits and back around. And when you do this in situ, how do those gene relevant problems? And then also, I'm interested, so we're looking at cyanobacteria, mainly the circadian proteins in the cyanobacteria that create 24-hour cycles, and how do we incorporate those? Our cycles, and how do we incorporate those into materials to create mechanical properties, autonomous mechanical properties? So, I'm going to be focusing on this, but I would love to chat about either of these two sometimes if you're interested. All right, and mainly with all of these, so my main interest is understanding what are the design rules and the physical principles that govern these emergent mechanics and structure that usually arise. And so, we hope to understand by studying these systems, we have to understand. By studying these systems, we're able to understand a little bit about cellular biophysics and also test theoretical predictions from polymer physics and potentially have applications in future engineering of materials. Okay, so we'll just get started. So most of my talk is going to be focusing on cytosolatin composites, composites of actin and microfubules, and how motors, myosin, and kinesin impact. Myosin and Kinesin impact the dynamics and the rheological properties. So, first, here we have an equimolar composite of actin and microtubules. So, the magenta here is the microtubules and the green is the actin. And we have myosin in here. And so, myosin is being activated by, we have lobosatin in there, and so we like deactivate the globosatin and give the motors to boot. You get the motors to move. So you see this nice kind of uniform contraction. This is just the myosin acting on the actin. And then just to show you, you know, this is maybe subtle, that when you have no myosin or you have no stimulation, the bluffostatin sways on, you get no motion. And now if you take the microtubules out, you get much more chaotic flow. Alright, so the microtubules are clearly helping. Are clearly helping to organize this motion. And then we wanted to try to quantify these dynamics and see how well. So remember, so the actin and microtubles here are not cross-linked at all. So these are just entangled, and the myosin is just acting on the actin. So we wanted to see how well the actin and microtupletal dynamics correlate with one another. So we use differential dynamic microscopy and what you need to know about differential dynamic microscopy. About differential analyticoscopy is basically so you make, so we take an image differences. We have a movie, we look at the difference between images, we take a Fourier transform, and then look at the autocorrelation of intensities of these image differences. And from these correlation functions, we get a decay time, and we can plot this decay time as a function of wave vector. All right, and so this is all you really. Alright, and so this is all you really need to care about: is this plot? So this is telling you the correlation, decay time as a function of wave vector, which is inverse microns. And the slope of this tells you something, it tells you about the dynamics. So if you have a slope of 2, sorry, negative 2 here, then you have diffusive behavior. And k would be your diffusion coefficient. If you have an exponent of 1, If you have an exponent of one, or if you have an exponent of one, then you have ballistic, ballistic motion, and k is your velocity. And of course, if it's greater than two, then you have sub diffusive dynamics. And if it's in between two and one, you have super diffusive. It's not quite holistic. Okay, so with that, now we have these composite images of actin and microtubules, and we split the channels and analyze the actin signal and the microtubules. Analyze the actin signal and the microtubal signal separately. And you see, and so this is a whole bunch of different trials. So the actin and microtubal channels both follow ballistic motion. So this is very much, you know, this is this directed motion, not diffusive at all. And you have speeds that are pretty much indistinguishable from one another. So the atomic people are really moving together. And also, the motion is very reproducible. All these trials are really kind of. All these trials are really kind of, you know, falling on top of each other. And now, if we take the microtubules out, you see much different behavior. So you still get the list of motion. So this is the actin in the video I showed you where it was just actin if we had taken the microtubules out. But there, you know, from region to region in the sample and from sample to sample, you get much more spread in the speeds and you get about a factor of seven higher speeds. Yeah. So you do this on the whole image or do you ever like subdivide? Whole image, or do you ever like subdivide an image in a few different regions? We have subdivided them. In this, for these cases, it's all pretty uniform. But later on, you'll see there's some like we get much more heterogeneous behavior and structure, and then you can split it up and kind of see how that affects it. So these are all performed on 50 microns. I guess they're pretty small. They're on like 50 micron by 50 micron ROIs. ROIs. And then we do that in a bunch of different regions throughout the sample and then on like multiple samples. And did you ever do like if there's like kind of local line of filaments or something like that, do you try to like relate that to these filaments? Yeah, and you can do that. And so again, in the system I'll talk about a little bit later, you can actually, using DDM, you can get an alignment factor. So basically you can correlate if the system's anisotropic or if it's aligned in a certain direction, and then how that. In a certain direction, and then how about. And then you can look at like the dynamics, look at the dynamics along the director, and then like, you know, opposite of that. So this is non-steady state, right? It's a super precipitating, basically down network? Or is it in a steady state where you have recycling or not? It's no, this is their fulloid stabilized. I see, so it clumps up, it face separates eventually. Yeah, well, the actin and microbial stay together. Yeah, but you get one big clump or a. Yeah, yeah, you basically end up if you wait long enough. But since it's blubber statin, we have blobostatin controlled, like so you're really, I mean, you have to, you have to wait, you'd have to, if you image for a very long time, then yes, it eventually just comes up, comes to us. So this is true for the initial stage when everything is moving as fast as possible. Right, exactly. Yeah. And since we only activate the myosin when we're recording it, and we're looking at when it's still in that kind of like steady state. And I'll show you more. We look at how. And I'll show you more. We look at how the dynamics vary over time when you get to that kind of like this, the region where you start getting kind of like rupturing. Okay, so now we wanted to ask, so what happens, you know, how can these dynamics be tuned by the concentration of the myosin and the relative fractions of actin and microtubules? So we vary, so what I'm going to show you. Vary so that what I'm going to show you next is we vary the myosin concentration. So, this is what you were looking at before, what I just showed you. And then, so we look at when the myosin concentration is a factor of two lower or a factor of two higher, and then we look at the actin fraction. So, we kept the overall concentration of total like actin plus microtubules fixed, and then just varied how much of each thing we had. So, here we have like 75% microtubules, 25% actin, and here you have more actin. Represent actin, and here you have more actin. And you can see just by the images. So, first of all, all of them, you see this sort of like you know, contractile motion, but clearly, you know, clearly it's different depending on the different concentrations. Are those units in micromolar or milligram per mill? Sorry, these are in micromolar, the myosin concentrations, and this is mass fraction, or this is molar fraction, sorry. So, the overall concentration. The overall concentration is 11.6 micromolar of actin or microtubules combined. So, like in the 50-50, we have 5.8 micromolar microtubules, 5.8 micromolar tubulent, 5.8 micromolar actin. And this is a muscle myosin reconstituted or non-muscomyosin? They're myosin 2 mini filipins. They're non-muscle. Non-muscle. Yeah. Hard to make this stuff. If we didn't make it, we buy it. Oh, okay. And ATP is a. Okay. An ATP saturating ATP with a regeneration system or something. We didn't need to use an ATP regeneration system here because, again, because of the globostatin. So yeah, we tried it with and without ATP regen and it didn't really make a difference. Yeah. So is the ch chamber and the chair magnets are spatially extended just a large uh hubby touching? Yeah. So there's no boundaries. So there's no boundaries. No, there's no confinement. And we passivate the surface, so there's no confinement. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so we passivate the surface. So there shouldn't be any binding of any reason or anything. Yeah, except sometimes at the edges, kind of sticks to the edges, and you might get some motion this way. And you'll see that later, but yeah. I don't know if you already mentioned it, but what is the length of the microtube and the distribution of the microtube? They're both the microtubules are around 8 microns long and the actins around 6 microns all. Okay, so they'll similar. There'll be a distribution. Yeah, yeah, distribution. Okay. Alright, so what we see, so again, these are this tau versus Q plots showing you the speed. And so I said if the slope is negative one, then that tells you that it's ballistic motion, but also the magnitude here. motion, but also the magnitude here, the higher up the curve is, the slower motion it is because the longer the tau versus q, the longer decay time you have. So you'll see that first of all, all of these are still very ballistic. Even at the very lowest myosin concentration and lowest actin concentration, you're still getting motion and it's still ballistic, but it's just a lot slower. And so we can get the speeds. The speeds, and if we plot the speeds as a function of, so each one of these little bars is a fixed actin fraction, and we're increasing the myosin concentration. And you can see that the molar fraction of actin has a pretty big effect, as does the myosin concentration. But you'll notice that this 50-50 mixture, the myosin concentration doesn't really have much of an effect. So it seems like. So it seems like it's the amount of activum in there that's playing more of a role. Then we also wanted to ask: so, how does this connect, you know, because we're changing the rigidity of the amount of rigid rods and filaments, then we're also changing the amount of substrate that the motors are acting on. How does this affect the mechanical properties? And so, in collaboration with Mohs Group, we did some simulations looking at Did some simulations looking at just a network of optimal microtubules that are, and we apply a small, and then we apply a stress from the myosin and measure from this, we can get shear modulus. And if we plot the shear modulus as the same function of myosin concentration and actin fraction, you see that as you increase actin in all of these, or sorry, as you increase myosin in all of these cases, the rigidity increases. The rigidity increases, you become more and more elastic. But you'll also notice that for each myosin concentration, you get less and less rigid as you increase the amount of actin that you have. So, seems that we have basically two contributions to the elasticity. You get really high elasticity from the high rigidity of the microtubules, but there you don't have a very active system. But there, you don't have a very active system, but it's rigid. And then you have the case where you have very high activity, like here, where you get a lot of coarsening and stiffening because of the motors. And then in between here, you have a system that has rigidity and contractility. And you can see, if we can, just so you can, you can plot these on top of each other, and you can see that in the high activity case, the speed core. That in the high activity case, the speed correlates with the rigidity or the elasticity, whereas in the high rigidity case, you have very low speed but very high rigidity. Here, very high speed, very high rigidity. And here, you get this nice region where you have sort of intermediate, you have some rigidity, so you have some resilience, but you can also, you also have active motion. Okay, so now we wanted to look at, so the question was: you know, are we in steady? So the question was, you know, are we in steady state? Is the system changing over time? So we wanted to ask, how is the speed changing as we look? So each of those, so the speeds I was showing you, those were like six minute videos. We were taking the average speed over those six minutes. And it wasn't really changing much, you know, if we looked at smaller regions. And now we look at over a course of 42 minutes. And you'll see, so here's where we have very high actin, and you get this. And you get this sort of acceleration. So the system now you're getting to the point where, so it's getting faster and faster. So you're kind of going, you're not in a steady state, you're not in a well-controlled system. Except this is a log scale. So this acceleration is pretty substantial. And now when you get when, so you get this acceleration, but now when you have this 50-50 mixture, you get much more stable. You get much more steady speed. It almost kind of slows down. So, again, the microtubles are helping to stabilize the motion in the contractility. Alright, so we kind of call this a sweet spot. And again, so when I'm talking about a sweet spot, I'm thinking about this in terms of like, you know, a resilient material, something that you can have activity, you can have autonomous motion and activity, but also you don't rip yourself apart. And so you can maintain this activity. So that's sort of what we were. So that's sort of what we were, that was sort of the design goal. All right, so now we wanted to ask: you know, we talked a little bit about the elastic stress, but how you know, can we look at the rheological properties? How does the myosin activity affect the rheological properties of these composites, and then how does that vary over time? So, let's say we start the activity, and then we measure the rheological properties, then two hours later we measure it again, and eight hours later we measure it again. Eight hours later, we measure it again. What's happening? How does the system evolve over time after it's been, you know, we turned the motors off, but they're still so how does it relax? And so we use optical tweezers, micro rheology here. So we trap a microsphere in our system and then basically just record the thermal fluctuations. And then using GSER, we can get the G prime and G double prime from the thermal fluctuations. Alright, so now let's look at our 50-50. Let's look at our 50-50 mixture. So, what we see, so first we record before, so and we're using the Levostat to control the activity. So, before, so in this is G prime, the solid is G prime, the openness G double prime. Before activity, we get this nice elastic plateau regime. You'll see throughout all of these, the curves look pretty similar. The frequency dependence is similar. But what happens is, so now we turn the activity on and we get this, but Activity on, and we get this jump up because now the system's coarsening because the motors are contracting system. Then we wait, then after four hours, it goes up, it even goes up more. So now that we've turned the motors off and it's still contracting, then after eight hours, it's dropped down. So it's starting to relax. So we found this pretty interesting and wanted to know what happens, you know, again, when you have less nic actin or more actin. Less actin or more actin. Alright, oh, optimize. Okay, so now you'll see if we have less actin, we get less of a jump up, but if we have more, if we have less mycodugals, we don't get the relaxation. All right, so the micajugals are what provide this initial stiffness. You'll see these G primes, you know, before motor activity, you don't really, there's, you know, the realogical properties are basically identical at this high, you know. High, you know, microtubule-rich versus a 50-50 system. But it's the actin that facilitates the large jump. So you'll see here you get just a very small jump in the SSD from the motor activity, whereas these jumps are pretty comparable. And now the more acting you have, so this continued increase is really coming from the microcubules. Coming from the microtubules, it appears. So you get more increase with the microtubles. This is because if you imagine the microtubules, the relaxation time scales of the microtubles are much slower, right? So like the actins, you know, the microtubles have stressed, sorry, the myosin has contracted the system, and then you've turned the microtubules, you turn the myosin off, but things are still moving. And so because the microtubules are slower to respond to the Are slower to respond to changes because they're longer relaxation time scales. This is what we think is causing it to continue to coarsen once you turn the motor activity off. And then the biggest difference is this relaxation. What's allowing the system? Because usually you have a system that coarsens and contracts to a big clump and then it's just stuck there, right? So we need some, what causes it to actually relax back. And so it seems having the microtubules. And so it seems having the microtubules in there actually provides that sort of buffer, that cushion to sort of puff the system back out. Yeah. Quickly to understand. So you're doing passive micrology, so you're looking at fluctuations. Right. We're doing passive microwology. Yeah, just changing. And the fluctuations decreased when the motors were on? Yes. Because the G goes up? Yes. And so again, so what. Counterintuitive. Yes, except so these time scales, so if you notice the slowest Notice the slowest frequency here is one radium per second. And if you notice, those speeds that I was showing you were like 10 nanometers per second. So, on the time, so here you can assume that everything's like in steady state. So, even though the motors are on, the rate of motor activity is slower than the time scales here. So, like this jump up, so but you're right, like if we just have action only, it's gonna, it's like gonna fluidize, and so you're It's like gonna fluidize, and so you're you expect G prime and Gl prime to go up. Fluidize, or at least you would see non-thermal activity, and that would give you an apparent G, but that apparent G would be lower. Right, but you don't have, so again, because these are we're looking at higher frequencies, then the rate at the myosin is changing the system, we've kind of like, we can assume it's steady state. So we're really just looking at like the steady state stream. really just looking at like the steady state structure due to the due to the activity. You could do active, but did you try active microology? Yes, yeah, we've done that too. I'll show you. Okay, so then so yeah, so we also wanted to look at what happens when we, so now what we do for the, so now we want to look in sort of the nonlinear regime where you're taking a microsphere and pulling it, you know, a far distance. Here we're pulling it, you know, 20 microns through the system, so that's larger than the length. Through the system, so that's larger than the length scales of the filaments. And then we hold the, so we pull it through, then we at a fixed speed, and that speed is faster than the speed of the myosin of the filament dynamics. And then we hold the bead fixed and then measure the relaxation of the force after we've stressed it. And so, what we see here, so here we have our 50-50 system in the black. System in the black, so we're doing it looking at before and then two hours later. So we didn't want to do this while the motors were acting because, again, we didn't want to have to decouple the active component and the thermal component. So we just wanted to look at what happens to the structure. Alright, so you'll see that after the motors have acted, you get much more elastic behavior. So the way you can read this, oh sorry, this is force. There's the axis. There's the axis. So, this becomes more elastic. You get more of an increased slope here. So, here it's more sort of softening, and here you get more elastic behavior. But you'll notice for all of these systems, again, the micotbioles are causing this initial stiffness, and it's the act that causes the increase. And so, we can also look at, so if you notice these curves, the curvature is changing. Curves, the curvature is changing. So, if you have something, so think of these curves, you can think of like for a purely viscous system, the force would jump up immediately and then just be plateau, like Stokes drag. If you have a purely elastic system, then you get just a constant linear slope and you know the slope or the constant linear line in the slope is your track, as your spring constant. And now, if you have a system that's stiffening, then you get something that looks like concave up. If you have something. Looks like concave up. If you have something that's softening, it would be concave down. And so we can look at the average spring constant, our stiffness. Yeah, five minutes. Okay. And you can see, so if we look at the average stiffness by just looking at the slope of this, when you have not much actin in here, you actually, the motors actually cause a decrease in the stiffness. So this is becoming softer. Whereas the actin, when you have Whereas the actin, when you have more actin, you actually get an increase in the stimuli. All right, and then also you'll see with the, and another thing to point out is you get a much larger jump when you have this 50. So again, this sweet spot. This is where you can get large resistive forces, large elasticity, and also big changes, you know, substantial changes in the dynamics. And again, if we look at the force relaxation over time, Force relaxation over time. You'll notice the 25 and 75 look fairly similar. You get this decay, but there's still some nested to be preserved, but then you get a much higher value, you get much less relaxation in the 50-50 system. Okay, so again, this 50-50 system is when you get the most restructuring and the most resilience to nonlinear definitions. Okay, and then you can see if we look structurally at this, so now what Look structurally at this, so now what we're so for these different systems looking at this over time, what you're seeing here are the microtubules. Okay, and remember, myosin is acting on the actin. We're looking at what's happening to the microtubules because we think it's the microtubules, you know, perfolating throughout the actin network that provides this resilience. So initially, they all look fairly similar. And then as time goes on, you'll notice, so again, this is high actin, this is low actin. Low actin. As time goes on, at very low actin, the system stays pretty percolated and connected, and there's not a ton of restructuring. And then here at very high actin fractions, the network's sort of like broken apart into little clumps, so you're not going to have a lot of resistance. Whereas here, you're in this kind of sweet spot where there's still connectivity, but you've gotten sufficient coarsening and clustering to provide that. Coursening and clustering to provide that resilience. Okay, so now we wanted to ask a question: what happens when we add in? So everything I was telling you before was just myosin. But now what happens if we add in kamesin into this system? So now kimesin is acting on the microtubules. So if we have two motor components, and then also we wanted to, there were no cross-singers in the previous studies. So what happens when we introduce cross-singers, static cross-centers? You know, here we use biotins or cabinet. By a denser cabinet to cross-link the actin or cross-link the microtubules. We don't cross-link them to each other. And what happens when you have motors driving both components of the system? So you'll see, just by looking at this, you get a much more diverse range of dynamics. And so these are just, I'm not categorizing these versus, you know, as function of crossing or anything like that. Just wanted to show you from the previous system when we just. From the previous system, when we just had myosin, all the motion was pretty, you know, just like contractile. And here we get, we really find kind of like three classes of dynamics. So we get this sort of slow restructuring, which is sort of like what we saw with the myosin. And then we get this really fast flow. And so, like, things are just moving in a unidirectional manner. And then there's also this multimodal multi-mode. Multimodal dynamics in which the network is sort of restructuring and also moving. All right, so what's causing all of this and how does this affect the dynamics? So we used GVM again, and we found through all of these that everything was ballistic, just like in our previous studies. Then we extracted that, we determined the speed, and then we looked at how the speed varied over time. And so if we have no cross-linkers. And so if we have no cross-lingers, and we just look at the actin and the microtubules, see if the speed increases at first. So you get this acceleration, and then to a maximum speed, and then you get this decrease. I'm just pointing out the initial and the final speeds. All right, so now what happens when we add an action crossing groups? You get very similar behavior. So you get this acceleration and then this deceleration, but the initial speed is higher and the final speed is lower. And the final speed is lower. And then, when you have microbles cross-linked, again, you get this acceleration and deceleration, but basically the cross-linking allows for more deceleration and it increases the rate of acceleration. So the speeds start out higher and higher. And if we look at the structure here, you get: so, when you don't have cross-linking, action micrometers can be pretty well intermixed. With each other. But now, when you have actin cross-linking, you basically get more co-localization. So you get a lot more bundling, but all the actin is getting absorbed in with the microtubules. Whereas when you have microtubule crossing, you basically get the opposite effect. You get like basically demixing of the actin and microtubules. But interestingly, both of these, here you have cliolocalization, here you have demixing, and you get pretty similar dynamics. So now, what happens when we add in What happens when we add in my anyone any guesses? Coherency? Maybe get faster in motion? Slower motion? Slower? Okay, slower and faster. Okay, so this was, I was surprised at this result. I just assumed we have more motors in there, things are going to move more. But actually, when we add myosin in, you get this very, you get a delay. Very, you get a delay, all right. So, so if you notice, the maximum speeds and the minimum speeds aren't too different in the two different cases, and you still get this sort of acceleration and deceleration, but the myosin basically gates the activity. So you get this much, you get a longer period where nothing's happening, and then you get this acceleration and deceleration. And you can see if you look at what's happening. So, what do you notice between these systems and these? These systems and these aren't to me, these look more well mixed. Like here, you get a lot more face separation, here you get where the system is staying a little like more mixed and uniform. And so we think, so actually you get this sort of motor antagonism. So you're getting, so you're not, so the mode, so if you imagine you have these actin and the microcubular cross, or not crossing, actin and microcubular Cross, or not crossing, the active microtubules are entangled with one another, and you have myosin pulling on the active filaments, and those are going to try to pull on the microtubules with them because they're entangled. But then at the same time, the microtubules are being pulled on by the kinesin. And so you have this competition between entanglements between the filaments. So the motor activities driving like filaments together, and the entanglements are driving unlike filaments together. And so you basically end up with this sort of oops, and tag. Of antagonism between the motors. And so you can basically use this to gate the time, gate the activity time, and basically prolong the resilience. So you don't end up, you can, by having both motors in there, you can really tune things and keep the system well mixed. And then I do, so I guess, I don't know, I guess I'm running low on a little bit on time, but I'll just show you a few things. So I won't talk about that. Things, so I won't talk about the hydrogels, but I'll just talk a little bit about. So, we did some force experiments, so these are some. So, again, I, well, we wanted to ask what happens now when we vary the kinesin concentration. How does that affect the force response? Okay, so we have our same system that we've been dealing with, but now we're looking at increasing concentrations of kinesin. And we don't have myosin in here anymore, because you know, we looked at the case where we used myosin, the case where we had both. Now, if we just had my. In case where we had both, now we just had myosin. We wanted to know what happens. So now we have a bead, so we want to look at the dynamics: how elastic-like, how viscous-like is this system, and how does it vary over time. So we travel bead, and now we're moving it back and forth. But this is, we're using large amplitudes, and this is like a sawtooth. So we're not doing like, we're not getting G prime and G double prime, like we're not doing small amplitudes. And you can see this video. You can see in the video. See in the video, you can see the V here moving through, and you can see how the network's getting pulled with it. All right, and so if you look at this, so this is what the force, so the stage position is in red, so you get the sawtooth pattern, and we have the black curve showing you a sample of the force, or of what the force looks like. And so, if we just take the peak force and average that over time and plot that, what you'll see. And plot that, what you'll see is that you get this non-monotonic dependence. So, when you have, so this is Kinesin. So, with no Kinesin, you have the lowest force. That makes sense. Then, as you start adding more motors, you get more and more resistive force because the motors are contracting the system and coarsening it. But then, as you get to higher motor concentrations, it drops. And then you can see. Okay, and then you can see this if we just look at the peak force over time for these different systems, you can see again you go from zero motor concentration to 40 to 80 to 160 and then it drops back in. When you're at the highest motor concentration of 640, it's almost identical to, or not almost identical, but it's very close to when you have no motors at all. And you also get this sort of stiffening. So if you look here, you have a maximum peak, and then it's. So, if you look here, you have a maximum peak, and then it's where it decays over time, which is sort of boring out. Yeah. I was curious also: did you do some analysis of the deformation field as well? Like, when you're doing this stuff. Yeah, and we don't, you know, I don't have time to, we did, basically what we did was break it up into little small regions and then form DPM on those to look at the anisotropy and the alignment. And that's something, it's they're massive data sets, so we're still like working. Data sets, so we're still like working through all them, but yeah, so that's something we want to do: is kind of couple the force response to the surrounding dynamics and then basically how that stress, how the how the stress propagates out. But you can see in the video that it's in OG, it's the assumption of a sphere with a lot of RDK, it's not holding anymore. Right, exactly. And so that's something, and that's something that we're looking at now. So like we have, but yes, and we've done this with like. But yes, and we've done this with DNA systems too, but yes, since it's heterogeneous, the stress propagation will look different depending on the different kinesium concentrations. And then so you'll also notice, so again, if you have this system that's, so you have this maximum peak, and then if you're sort of just like boring out a hole as you're moving through, you'd expect you'd get a peak here and then it would just decay over time as you're sort of like fluidizing the system. The system. But you'll notice that this intermediate kinesium concentration, you actually get an increase. So you're actually like building up stress as you're moving it through. So we can look at, so keeping these things in mind, if we just look at like a single, like one of the, one of the force, starting through that one here, if we just look at this initial force ramp and then look at each of these force ramps and kind of average them together, you can look at this as a function of stage position. This is a function of stage position, and you'll see that again the same trend, the same non-monopotic trend of increase in force. But you'll also notice that the curves look different, right? So here you get sort of softening, but at this intermediate concentration, you get like stiffening, right? So it's starting to soften and then it goes back up again. And so we can look at the slope of this. We can look at the slope in this later half regime. And again, you get this nice, you get this non-monocolic dependence. And then also, Dependence, and then also we can look at the curvature, you know, how much it's stiffening. And again, this non-monotonic dependence. And so, what is what we think is going on here is basically a balance when you get, when you're at this peak point, you have a balance of connectivity and stiffness. So, as the two contributions, so as the kinesins bringing together the system and causing, you know. And causing aggregation and clustering, that's rigidifying the system. So you're getting an increase in massive ski. But at some point, as it starts bringing them, as you have more and more motors in there and you get more contractillary and bundling, you're going to rip your network apart. So you're not going to be connected anymore. So to be able to get this strong force response, you need the system to stay fully connected and percolated, but you also need to have some stiffening from the motors. And so it's From the motors. And so it's at this intermediate concentration where you haven't broken percolation yet, but you've coerced the system enough. And we have, oops, I don't have the images here, but you can see this when you look at the images. It's at this point where you have sort of, where the network breaks apart. Okay, so I'm going to stop. I'm not going to talk about that. And I'd just like to thank all my wonderful collaborators and funding agencies. Funding agency. So, you know, I've been collaborating for many years with Mo and with Jenny, who's supposed to be here. And so, you know, we were funded through a Keck Research grant, and now we're working with Megan Valentine on an NSF DemRef grant all on working on this stuff. And then I will just close with this. You guys can check them out. So I'm finishing up my book on biopolymer. Book on biopolymer, on biopolymer network dynamics, and so I would love you guys to take five minutes during the coffee break to fill a little survey. Some of you in the room have already done that, thank you. And then you can visit us October 20th, Country of Soft Matter and Macrolibia Networks. You can send your students. Registration is free. You can get travel funds. Your students can get travel funds from APS DSoft. And then, always looking for good postdocs and postbax, send them my way. And postbacks, send them my way. So, thank you. Yeah, really cool. I was just thinking more about the originating symmetry from dragging back and forth. Have you considered dragging back and forth and then going in a orthogonal direction to see what it caused? We've tried that a little bit. Actually, we haven't tried where you do. Actually, we haven't tried where you do it and then switch it. Like, you know, we've done it in the X and in the Y to see if there's any sort of difference there. But that's a great idea. That would be really cool. We should try that. That's for trading. Right. Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea. Thank you. All right. Thanks, Ray. If there's more questions, we can talk about that. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I really appreciate all the questions during the talk. All right. Yeah. No, no, no. That is my preferred mode. I love it. That is my preferred mode. I love it.
