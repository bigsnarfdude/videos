Nice workshop. So today I talk about some classification of gap to phases in 2D systems and like the previous talk by Ogato-san. So this is based on joint work with nice collaborators, Bogen Shi and Isaac Kim and Victor Albert. So let me start from introduction. from introduction. So this is also a talk about classifying Japan phases. But in this talk, instead of SPT phases in the previous talk, this blue vision, we are now considering non-range entangled phases, like topologically ordered phases. So in this nice three diagram of capital phases of quantum matter, we are considering this topic. are considering this topic this talk focuses on this dead region so um so uh consider some gap to local hamiltonian and we are considering some arbitrarily large but still finite spin system so we can now define hamiltonian uh defined as a sum of local terms and it is scaled for any system size Any system size. Then the after quantum phases are defined as equivalence classes of ground states of this Hamiltonian. So suppose we have two Hamiltonians, H1 and H2, and their corresponding Grando state, then these two Glando states are in the same phase if these corresponding Hamiltonians are smoothly connected by a local gap path. This is a standard definition in. Definition in the case of Hamiltonian. Then, topologically ordered phases are defined as non-trivial gap to quantum phases in the previous equivalence relation. And these topologically ordered phases have very nice properties. For example, they don't have a local order parameter like the conventional symmetry breaking phases like the Breaking the phases, like the SPT phases. And also, they have a topology-dependent degeneracy of ground states, which means when you have changed the topology of the underlying scheme that is, then the ground state degeneracy changes. And also, their low energy excitations behaves like anions, which are pretty exotic particles. So, usually bosons or fermions are usually particles and they Usual particles, and they when we exchange them, then we get plus one or minus one phase factor. But in for any on that, we get more general phase factor or even non-avarian factors. And also in some type, some topologically ordered phases like functional quantum fall effect or those chiral topological ordered phases. When we consider open boundary instead of closed boundary, we have some topologically protected. We have some topologically protected gap with edge modes, and they are also an interesting topic. So, these characteristic properties of topologically ordered phases are now well explained by using topological quantum field theory. And classification of topologically ordered phases are done by using these theories. And basically, different topological orders are distinguished by algebraic theory of any ones, so excited. Like theory of anions. So, excited by looking at excitations, we can distinguish different phases. And the behavior of anions are mathematically described by modular tensor category theory. So, each topologically ordered phase can be labeled by some one specific modular tensor category. Roughly speaking, each Nion C consists of three components. Consists of three components: charges, fusion loads, and F and R matrices. First, charges, sometimes called superselection sectors, are elements of finite double set L. And each double, like A or B or C represents a type of quasi-particle arise in the topological order. It always contains. And it always contains one as a special level and one dependence of vacuum, so no particle. Then there's Fusion Luke. So Pushan Lu describes if we have two anions, A and B, then how these two particles behave as one particle. So it is somehow describes the possible product charge of two. Possible total charge of two small charges. This is another fusion of spin, total spin. Like, for example, if we have a two-spin half-particle, then the total spin of two particles are either zero or one, depending on the internal degrees of freedom. So, this is mathematically just another of this spinning feature. Then we have a Then we have F and R matrices, and these are just a set of matrices satisfying certain equations, consistency equations, which basically specify breading statistics of the anions. For example, one of the famous model of the 2D topological data phases is Tori. Data phases are toric code model described by this Hamiltonian. So each AB interaction term is acting on certain buttons and it is a product of power X acting on neighboring spins. So this circle is spin half particle. Then we have a VP interaction term defined on each placet and for each bracket Vp And for each bracket, VP acts as a product of Z, how D Z on neighboring adjusting spins. And these two interaction times commute. And the Grando state is fulfilled-free. So it is some tenement plus one eigen state of all interaction terms. In this set, we have a In this set, in this model, we have four types of anions, including vacuum. And the first one, first non-trivial one, E, can be created by applying some G swing operator. And the second one, M can be created by applying X swing operator. And the last extra is just combination of E and M. Combination of E and M. So there are four levels in this model. And their fusion loads can be also calculated easily. And this is their looks like this. And also they have some breeding statistics, but most of them are not interesting. So E and M are bosons and exons are fermions, but M and E have a non-trivial mutual status. Not really a mutual statistics because M and when we swap M and E, then we get minus one factor. Okay, so on one hand, we have some microscopic description of gap systems by quantum mechanics. So we have Hamiltonians and Guando states and spins of the parallels. And on the other hand, we have just pretty abstract any of theory introduced. The abstract Enion theory introduced before to classify topological order, which is mathematically described by category theory. So, a natural question is how these two are connected, or how this abstract theory emerges from well-known quantum mechanics. So, of course, these two relations are well-known in broad classes of specific models by case-by-case study, vectoric body model or quantum double. Or a quantum double model, Levinwell model, or function quantum polar effect, we can calculate low energy excitation behavior, and then we see that all these excitations actually behave like any of the followers category theory. So in those, then we can classify each models by using category theory. And this study is well, yeah. There are tons of models we did this kind of approach. But also, there are some general approaches. For example, in this paper, the authors introduced so-called MT or injective PEPs to represent ground state. And they show that if the ground state is described by this class of PEPs, then we can extract lots of topological data, I mean, NEO-30 behavior from Behavior from the ground state. There are also another approach based on operator algebra. For example, in Hag's work, he uses algebraic QFT approach to introduce superselection sector and study the operating behavior. But the setting is relativistic and continue. For infinite spin dataset systems, there is another. That is systems, there is another work by Naja Kinza Fidel, and they assume some certain properties called hard duality and splitting property. And then they derive some anionic behavior from starting from spin list. However, deriving this anyone theory from generic 2D diaphragm system is still open problem. So in this talk, we So, in this talk, we consider another, we introduce another approach based on entanglement. So, this talk is exactly about topology and entanglement, as the title of this workshop shows. So, what we do is we assume some property, entanglement property of ground state, and then from the entanglement property, we derive lots of unique property of the And unique property of the system. And the nice part of this approach is we don't need any symmetry or Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, we are still working on this F-1 matrix part, so I'll talk about these charges and fusion rules and another additional topological data. So before I go into detail, let me summarize about ADLO. Me summarize about ADRO, which is a property we require. So, as discussed in yesterday's talk by Anurag, capital Gurundo states are believed to obey an ADLO. So, usually ADLO is state by using intangible entropy, which is a function, fundamental entropy of reduced state of the absolute state. And then area states that this entanglement entropy. This entanglement entropy for region X is upper bounded by the order of the length of the boundary of the region. So this form of ADLO is proven for 1D gap to systems and also as in yesterday's talk, it's also partially proven for 2D systems by assuming local gap formation. However, by However, from observations for more well-studied models like Tori Code, those exactly solvable models or numeric studies suggest that we have a more strong form of area row for generic Japanese random state, which is entanglement entropy is proportional to the boundary term and minus some unit. And minus some universal constant, which is only depends on the number of boundaries, number of disconnected boundaries, plus and type of topological, of course, plus some collection terms which quickly disappears when the region X gets larger and larger. So we can expect instead of this form of variable, we can expect. Uh, this form of ADRO, we can expect this form of ADRO is also a generic property of the Yakto-Kurando state. Then, based on this area row, we established some so-called entanglement boost start program. So, I'll talk about it. So, first, let me explain some basic settings. So, we consider a finite dimension. Setting. So we consider a finite dimensional spin that is arbitrarily large that is still finite on a 2D closed manifold like this. Then we assume that there is a pure state on this spin lattice satisfying two entanglement conditions exponential data. And this state, which we call difference state, is expected to be a Grando state of some Japan local Hamiltonian, but we do not require that because we don't need any. Declare that because we don't need any Hamiltonian property. Oh, sorry, some classic stacks. Anyway, so law can be any state unless it satisfies two entanglement conditions. That's why we call this law as a definite state, not Purando state. Okay, so what's the two entanglement conditions? So we call those two conditions two axioms. So first axiom, axiom A0 is the following. So we consider spin lattice on 2D closure manifold. And for any region like this, so this is some region on this torus, which is basically spin lattice, in fact. And we are In fact, and we set some characteristic length scale mu, which is constant. And this mu for gap to ground state or commuting Hamiltonian, this mu is just range of Hamiltonian. And in more general case, this mu can be like the larger than pollution length or something like that. Then for this fixed mu, we consider this. We consider this region A and B. B is some ball-like region, and A is some discrete region within it. And we assume that for any region which is topologically equivalent to this, AB, the entanglement entropy satisfying this condition. The first term is just a substrate, so just a conditional entropy, so linear combination. Conditional entropy, so linear combination of entagment entropy. And the second condition is for any region which is topologically equivalent to this region, this V region, ABC, we require that this sum of conditional entropies is zero, exactly zero. So these two conditions are pretty Conditions are pretty non-intuitive, so it's kind of hard to understand what it means. But the first condition implies this region A and region B are uncorrelated. Actually, if we calculate the mutual information between region A and B, then it also exactly vanishes. So, deduced state on AD is just a product state. So, physically, this implies the state we are considering has exactly zero correlation names. So, if two sites are separated by just one site, then there is no correlation. The second condition is much harder to interpret, but it implies that the reduced state on ABD or ACD. ADD or ACD, so-called quantum Markov state, which I explain later. And these two conditions are independent, but actually fall from the area of some form of area with no correction time. And this type of area falls for most many of the normalization fixed point or exactly solvable. Point or exactly solvable models like quantum double models or Lebaneme models. And also, here we assume some certain characteristics, we introduce some certain characteristic lengths mu. Then we can show that if these two conditions hold for mu, then a similar condition holds for a larger region as well. As well. So, what's a quantum Markov state? So, I said axiom A1 implies certain reduced states are quantum Markov states. So, quantum Markov states are tripartite quantum states satisfying this condition. This IHEB is a function for the conditional nature information defined as a linear combination of entanglement entropies or fundamental entropy. My enter and these quantum map of states have a very nice property. So, this is shown by Patrick Heiding and other propagators in 2004, which is if rho is a quantum Markov state, then there exists a CPTP map which recovers the quantum Markov state from its reduced state. So, if we have a Markov state on ABC, Of state on ABC, oh, I know I have a question. Yeah, hi, Kosaro, quick question. So, uh, in the previous slide on the second condition, executive A1, uh, could you rephrase it in terms of conditional mutual information? Is it easy to do? Yes, we can, like, because low ABCD is pure, right, right, we can calculate the conditional matrix formation for ABD or ACD by using this. ABD or ACD by using this deviation, and we can show that conditional meteor information for these two states vanishes. I see, got it. Thanks. Thanks. But the point is: the converse does not hold. It is only one direction. So yeah, it is A1 is much stronger. So this next property of quantum Markov state is: we have a tripartite state and we lose one particle, for example, C. One part, for example, C, then we can always recover the original state by applying some map on B and C only. So, usually, for generic, so for general tripartite state, we have to into account A, but for a mark of state, we can only construct B. So, like this. And this CPT market is obtained in this form, but we don't use this specific structure, so I just skip now we can. Now we can start to consider about anions, but before to do so, I have to introduce a key concept to introduce anion CLD, which is called information convex set. So information convex set is defined for any region omega of lattice which can be thickened as omega plus like this. Omega plus like this. So omega plus is slightly second. This length is mu, characteristic length mu. And we first introduce some set of sigma tilde for this omega plus. This is a set of all states on omega plus, all possible quantum states on omega plus, such that the state cannot be distinguished. The state cannot be distinguished from the reference state for any various mu ball region. Like here, we cannot distinguish sigma over b low and here you cannot distinguish and here you cannot distinguish. So, this is set of states which locally indistinguishable from low. Then the information convex set for omega is defined as the set of reduced states. As a set of reduced state of sigma tilde on omega. So we just discuss this light gray part and then we get sigma omega. And this is a key concept. As the name suggests, this sigma omega is a complex set of states. And also the construction only depends on the differential state law. So it is completely homilitarian free. Hamiltonian free. But we can find similar ideas based on committing in committing the Hamiltonian systems in this John Wang Hao's paper in 2016. But it is more operator algebraic. Then we want to study the structure of this convex set. And this convex set has a pretty nice property which is stated. Which is stated by this cell ring. So, this self-remember, which we call isomer cell ring, says that if omega 0 and omega 1 are two regions which are connected by local deformations, what is local deformations? I will explain later. Then there is a bijection CPTP map from information convex on this region to information convex on this region. This region, which uh, so so this is bijective, so information convex on this set and this set are basically have exactly the same structure. Also, the nice thing is this isomorphic relation between two information convex set preserves the entropy difference. So, if sigma and omega is element of this information convex, This information convex, then the entropy difference between these two is preserved when we map these two states to this information complexity. Also, this isomorphism only holds when these two are connected by low-color deformations. So, for Android, for example, there is some cases. There is some cases which we cannot say they are isomorphic. For example, if one annulus is just rapping torus and the other annulus is not rapping, then these two are not connected by local deformation, so they are possibly different. But unless these two annulus are not post annulus are not lapping the torus, then we can always We can always find the isomorphism. So, to prove isomorphism 7, we have some key landmark called margin lemma. So, this is kind of a bit long scheduled, but what does it say? So, it says if we have a two compatible quantum Markov network, quantum Markov states. So, if we have a quantum Markov state, Have a mark of state low ABC and sigma B C D overlapping on B C and if this the reduced state of these two states are equal on B C then we can always merge these two overlapping Markov states to into larger Markov state tau and this tau if we trace out the D then we get low ABC and if we trace out A And if we trace out A, then we get sigma B C D. So this is a pretty nice property of quantum Markov states. To prove isomorphism theorem, we use the previous margin lemma. So first, consider two region omega and omega prime, and omega prime is just adding some small region d to omega. Then we can find the mark from Then we can find the mark from omega information convex on omega prime to information convex on omega by just taking partial trace over D. The compass is bit hard, so we want to find a bijection map map from map between these two. So we should have a the inverse map from omega to omega line. map from omega to omega prime. How to construct this inverse? So first we focus on this region around additional region D. So we focus on here and we partition the omega into in this way so that B is shielded by D from by C. Then for any element in original Element in original information convex, we touch this difference state, this user state of different state on this local region by using mazing remote so our axiom A1 justifies that these two are Markov states. So this low B C D is Markov state and sigma omega. state and sigma omega as a state on ABC is also a Markov state. So we have we have a two Markov state overlapping on CB. So we can merge these two to obtain large state on tau ABCD and we can show that this marginal state is an element of this larger information convex set and we can actually show this partial trace and this margin consists bijection between this. This bijection between these two information convex sets. So basically, any region connected by this taking partial trace on some region or adding small disk are isomorphic. This is what locally deformable means. So now, thanks to the isomorphism theorem, we know that sigma omega, structure of information convex set sigma omega, only depends. Convex set sigma omega only depends on the topology of omega and not details of them. And for disk, the same place of topology, Kim shows that this information convex set always contains only one element, which is reference state. This reference state should be an element of information convex by definition, because sigma omega is reduced to state of locally indistinguishable state from log. And this property. And this property somehow reminds us some topological quantum order condition. Oh, sorry, this time ended, so it's 10 minutes. Anyway, so but we do not assume TQO condition, it's just derived from the axioms and definition of information process. That is a term. So for a non-trivial topology like aniras or proposed like anulas or you know two holidisk or three holidis we have a more interesting structure and actually we can show that from anulas we can extract information of charges and from two holidays we can extract the information about fusion rules and from this many holes and then we can derive some axioms of METC and hopefully echo the algorithmic so let me introduce So first to construct a new series from entanglement, we first need to define charges in our system. So to do so, we study annulus, information convex set on annulus. And then we show that if omega is an annulus, then for any element in this information convex set, however, this direction. So here P A is some probability distribution on each block, and P omega A is some element extreme point of this convex set and which is independent of the choice of sigma. And the structure is invariant of topology. So this omega and this omega have the same structure. Just this details of this state changes. This details of this state changes, but block structure doesn't change. And intuitively, what does it mean? So, intuitively, each extreme point corresponds to the reduced state of one excited state with a fixed charge here. So, this rho omega a, so we have some ground state and then create some excitation of some specific enigma and a bar. A bar is antiparticle. Then low omega A corresponds to the reduced state of this excited state on omega. And actually, the interesting property of any is the existence of any here and here changes the state on omega, this landing region, surrounding region. Also, the differential state is always an element of information convex set, and it is also an extreme point. And we denote this extreme. And we denote this extreme point as a vacuum. So, this is our definition of vacuum of this system. Then we define the double of the extreme points, this 1A double, and it is always finite because we are constantly finite spin systems, and the charges. And this number of doubles is invariant and isomorphism. So, this is well-defined throughout the phase. Whether you find throughout the phase throughout the system, so I just skip the proof sketch because of time. But the idea is we can consider some smaller region and by using isomorphism theorem, we can show that each extreme point have a each two extreme points have a fidelity either zero or one. So zero means two extreme points are same, and one means two extreme points. points are same and one means two extreme points should be orthogonal. So we have our charges. So now we can define fusion rules. So to define fusion rules we consider two hole disk and if omega is two hole disk then we can always find a subset of information convex set which is also a convex set. We denote this by sigma ABC omega. ABC omega. So this subset includes every state which have a specific W ABC. And this means we introduce three annular region of annular sub region of two holidays, E1, E2, C. And then any sigma omega ABC has. has uh reduced state uh so extreme point of uh annual okay yeah if we consider reduced state of this state um b1 then it should be the extreme corresponding extreme point of the information convex of this anirus which doubled by some specific anion type so we repeat this for b one b two c Repeat this for B1, B2C. It physically means there is a specific fixed charge A and B in these two regions, and their total charge is also determined and fixed C. And sigma omega ABC is a set of such states. An important proper important thing is now sigma omega ABC depends on sigma omega, which means even if we fix means even if we fix double ABC, there is still a degree of freedom within this set. So this is not uniquely determined only by fixing ABC omega. In other words, sigma omega ABC can contain some quantum information. And actually we can show that this subset of information convex is Is isomorphic to a state space on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, which we denoted by V ABC. And this Hilbert space is finite dimensional, so we can define the fusion multiplicity of our model by just a dimension of this Hilbert space. In other words, dimension of this complex set. Now, then we can define this fusion rule. What happens if A and B fuse? Then we just study the structure of information convex, so a subset of information convex, and we just count the dimensions, and then we set the dimensions as fusion characteristic here. So now we have our charges and fusion loss, but in the any on C fusion. But in the any on CLD fusion multiplicities are not just a constant but must satisfy some specific rules listed in this way. Like for example, if we switch the position of A and B, the fusion multiplicity doesn't change. And also if A fused to vacuum, which means vacuum is nothing. So if A and vacuum fuse to C, Vacuum fuse to C, A and C should be equivalent. Also, if A and B fuse into vacuum, which means B should be an ant charge of A and so on. And our result is basically by using our axioms and previous introduced information convex set, we can prove that this Prove that this our definition of fusion multiplicity satisfies all the properties here. So now we can define charges and fusion rules, which is pretty consistent as a category 30. And then we can also, yeah, I will explain. Yeah, I will explain we can extract more topological data from similar entanglement approach. So first property is called topological entanglement entropy. So far we assume that the area is strong form of area row in this form. And here I said this gamma is some universal constant. And this gamma And this gamma is actually called topological entanglement entropy and pretty important to distinguish phases. And what's the value of gamma? And if we can consider, if we consider this kind of region or this kind of region and consider this long linear combination of end-to-end entropy and just insert this formula. Formula, then we show that this linear combination can extract gamma only or just two times gamma. And this by using this and quantum dimension, definition of quantum dimension for the BMW models or TTFT, they calculated this value of gamma by using the This value of gamma by using these tools, and it was shown that this gamma is given by logarithm of d and d is just a quantity, total quantum dimension. And this quantum dimension is just some kind of internal degree of anions. For example, spin half particles have a dimension too, but anions are so erotic, so quantum dimensions. Eritreotic, so quantum dimension can be square root two or then ratio, but they actually represent some asymptotic internal degrees of freedom. Anyway, so this the point is gamma, this constant gamma is connected to the underlying anyone models. So if anyone CD is specified, then quantum dimension is specified. So gamma is determined only. So, gamma is determined only by quantum dimension. And we here in our framework, we didn't assume that gamma should be this form, but rather actually we can prove that gamma should be this form from the definition. So, this is kind of consistent. So, this This is kind of consistent. So, this reproduces previous results in shown in DBMA models or TTF. We can also introduce, extract some another topological data, for example, topological asthmatics, which is defined some time like type world line of any A and E. So any A pair is created and A pair is created and P is created and they are braided and then they are fused. Then this SABC SAB is just matrix describing probability of happening this kind of process. And this S matrix is also important topological data and we can so we define SAB as define SAB as this quantity here though omega B is extraordinary point of information convex on annulus like so this corresponds to some deduced of state when there is any oar B and U L A and U R A is some unitary string operator which also can be derived in our Also, can be derived in our framework. And it basically physically, these two unitary operators create some any pair in this way, or you are creating any pair in this way. So by using these two unitary operators and just using element of information convex, we define esmatrix in this way. And the well-known property of this original topological esmatrix is so-called baring formula. is so-called the value in the formula. So this is fusion multiplicity and S-matrix has a nice property, has a nice relation with this fusion multiplicity in this way. And we actually recovers the, not we are one of us, Bob and C, he recovers the formula in our framework as well. So the last thing this is The last thing, this is an ongoing work is about chiral centralized chase. So in the beginning, I said some topological order phase have an interesting gapless edge mode. And this gapless edge mode have a characteristic quantity called chiral central charge, which is also required when we distinguish two chiral topologically ordered phases. So this to classify topological To classify topological order phases, we also have to know about this C. And usually, these gaps ages are topologically protected and described by, effectively described by CFD. And in CFD, there is some central charge. So you can, if model is given, you can calculate this CFD and estimate the center of the charge of the CFD. But in general case, it's kind of hard to do. In general, case it's kind of hard to do so. And this central charge has a nice property with edge energy current, and edge energy current satisfies this formula. So the question is how can we extract this information about the carbon center charge from information mobile entanglement? And it maybe, yes, because there is so-called the bulk edge correspondence, which Edge correspondence, which is a kind of conjecture, which says that the property information of edge bug is hidden in edge. And no, there's kind of one-to-one correspondence between information in edge and information in bug. So this information, so Kairos charge could be extracted from only bug. There are some various works. And there are some previous works, but it requires some degenerated ground states or no, so multiple ground states, or they can estimate C minus only up to modular some constant, like 24 or 8. Instead, we introduce another quantity, which is we call modular communicator. This is so first we consider region like this: this is in the bow, and we split. Bow and we split this disk into ABC. And we first consider this commutator of logarithm of the use of state. In sometimes, this low AB is called entanglement Hamiltonian. So this is commutate or modular Hamiltonian. So this is commutator of modular Hamiltonian on region AB and BC. So overlapping on B. Then we calculate just expectation value of this commutator and then take time. And then take time times imaginary number i. So, this is our definition of modular mutator. A nice property is this function of the district state is anti-symmetric under time reversal in spin systems. So, time reversal is described by this taking conjugation in a product basis. And if we reverse the time of this system, then we get one. System, then we get minus. So this actually can describe some certain chiral property of the system. So for non-chival systems, this function should be zero. And by using entanglement gluteswell program, namely, if we assume axioms a1, a0, then we can prove that this function j is a topologically invariant, which means when we default. Invariant, which means when we deform this shape of this region, it doesn't change the value. And we conjecture that for 2D gap to Grando state, we have this formula. So J is actually proportional to the chiral central charge. So this is conjecture, but there is some rough physical argument why this should be discorded. Basically, it depends based on this. Basically, it depends based on this relation between energy current and chiral center charge. Anyway, so this is just a conjecture, but nice part is we can extract the chiral center charge without ambiguity just from single release stating band. So the last one is just conjecture. So we tested numerically for this discretized mu co. Discretized mu co uh discretized the bosonic roughening state plotted on Sophia. So we consider Sophia, and this is some roughening state defined on these sites. And this state has known to have a chiral central charge one. So this have a non-trivial chiral proposed order. Then the J should be this body. So if the previous conjecture. So if the previous conjectured formulas hold, then this value is like 1.047. And we calculated this function j for this model, numerically calculated, and plot it here up to the n is up to like 28 or something, and then fit it by using power function or exponential function. And we find that exponential function fit well. And we extrapolate the information. And we extrapolate the infinite in some dynamic limit value by taking extra just considering extra position. And then, but oh yeah, 26. So by just using 26 sides, this method provides J is 1.054. So it is pretty close to the expected value. So we are now kind of confident our conjecture is actually true. Is actually true. Okay, let me summarize my talk and discuss about open problem. So, first of all open problem is we have only derived some charges and fission rules. So, the missing part is other and hematoid disease specifying any statistics. And there is some other some subtle Some subtle problem because we are considering some convex set of mix of state, it's kind of hard to see phase factors in there. But there's nice work by Cowaboy and Levin in 1990, and they introduced some like a way to extract F and other matrix from microscopic description. So we believe that. We believe that we can just follow the argument and we can again define around the F matrices in a nice way. Another open question is in general this ADL strong form of ADLO has a collection time which vanishes but still exists. Which vanishes but still exists. So then these two axioms only hold approximately. So the argument becomes much complicated, but we believe that we can still apply our arguments because most of our proof is based on the existence of Peter Vickabarimap connected to quantum Markov state. connected to quantum Bank of state. And there is a nice result for nice study for so-called approximate quantum Bank of state, which have approximately zero condition major information. And then there is analog of this recovery map, the approximate recovery map. So we can just replace exact by approximate and we can repeat our argument. Maybe some direct to some structure. Some direct to some structure becomes kind of non-trivial, but we believe that anyway, it will be okay, I guess. More serious question is a sobility problem. So, to claim that we actually derive a property of a phase, not a particular system, we should show that We should show that the property we derived is invariant and throughout the phase. So, however, these two axioms to do, so it is desirable to these two axioms holds for an entire phase, at least approximately. But unfortunately, this A1 is not true in some cases, even. Not true in some cases, even approximately. So, in some cases, we cannot apply our framework. And those some cases actually states with so-called spurious topological entanglement entropy. So, what is spurious topological entanglement entropy? It is originally found by Gravi in 2008. So, he discovered that there existed some Discovered that there exists some grand state which is just a trivial topological order but still have a non-trivial estoppole condition matrix information for a particular region like this. So previously we showed that estoppole is equivalent to two times log d but for this state with previous polarized entanglement entropy, this formula shouldn't hold. So this also So this also means our formalism cannot be applied. So this example found by Brabi is just 1D cluster state embedded in 2D lattice. So this star-like region, so star-like object is just 1D spin chain embedded in a 2D database. So it is kind of artificial, but But so and this 1D cluster state is a grand state in 1D D2 times D S P D phase, which is which causes some problem. So this is kind of unnatural example. So maybe we can believe that we can remove this kind of example by assuming, for example, translational invariance. But there in 2018, Dominique William and collaborators found that there exists some homogeneous, I mean, transformational invariant 2D model, which have a similar property. I mean, this formula doesn't work. Those are states having 2D subsystem SPT phase, and there is some more exotic phase. To solve this problem of scripture topological entanglement entropy, we first have to understand what is this origin of this topological entanglement entropy and the property. Anyway, so let me summarize. So we derive the Nion 3 from the ADLO, I mean a part of charges and fusion loads. And charges and fusion loads are derived via the And fusion rules are derived by studying the structure of so-called information convex set. And then we proved this concept satisfies our consistent with the modular cancer category theory, the original proposal. And we show that the sub-reading term of the area, also we can derive that sub-reading term of the area must be. Subreading term of the ideal mass of V in our framework. And also, we can extract the modular topology matrix and chiral central charge as well. And next step is defining other matrices in a consistent way and also solve some stability problem. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the talk. And let's And let's thank Otaro. And please, questions.
