So, thank you very much for the invitation to share some of the work we've been doing lately with this very distinguished audience. I want to talk about information processing in living cells and the connection between network dynamics and cell physiology. And I want to start by mentioning, let me see if I can get this thing to go forward. Yeah, last year, Paul Nurse published a little book intended for a general audience called What is General audience called What is Life? And I guess only a Nobel Prize winner can use such a title as that. The subtitle is Five Great Ideas in Biology. So there are five chapters. The first is on the cell as the building block of all living organisms, the gene as the purveyor of hereditary identity, evolution by natural selection as the engine driving biological diversity. Life is Life is chemistry. All cellular functions are carried out by genes, proteins, and metabolites. So far, that's pretty standard freshman biology. But the fifth chapter I was glad to see is entitled Life is Information. And it's all about how cells process information and how they make sense of the world around them. So that's what I want to stress today, the information processing capability. Information processing capabilities of cells. So, as we know, I think a cell is an information processing machine. It receives signals from the external medium where it's living and growing, and also signals of its internal state. It processes those signals and generates appropriate responses, chemotaxis, gene expression, cell differentiation, cell growth, and division. So, let's talk a little bit about. So let's talk a little bit about the mechanisms by which the information is processed. So this is a classic illustration of a typical mammalian cell, which has receptors on the cell surface that receive inputs from growth factors and anti-growth factors, cell cell adhesions and other signals. And that information is processed through this internal signaling network and leads to changes. And leads to changes in gene expression. So, for instance, growth or quiescence, and changes in the cell proliferation. So, the cells would drive them into DNA synthesis and mitosis and cell division. There are also receptors for differentiation signals like cytokines that also cause changes in gene expression. And there are either even sensors for abnormalities and death. Normalities and death factors where their appropriate response is programmed cell death or cell suicide. So I want to point out that cellular decision making from my point of view is accomplished in large part by biochemical toggle switches in the cytoplasm. And I'll just zero in on one of these little toggle switches. The part that's outlined in blue here are the Outlined in blue here are the interactions between cyclin E CDK2, which drives entry into the cell cycle, and its interactions with the retinoblastoma protein and E2F transcription factors. So the E2F transcription factors drive the production of cyclin E and drive the cell into the cell cycle. But in G1 phase, the E2F transcription factors are kept inactive by binding to the retinoblastoma protein. Retinoblastoma protein. If you can turn off the retinoblastoma protein and make cyclin E, then cyclin E can phosphorylate and inhibit the retinoblastoma protein. So this is a little bistable switch. It has two states, a state where the retinoblastoma protein is abundant and active, and E2F is off and cyclin E is off, and the other state where Rb is phosphorylated and inactive, the switch is turned on. The switch is turned on, cyclin E is produced, and the cell enters the cell cycle. This little bistable switch is controlled by external signals. So growth factors upregulate the production of cyclin D, and cyclin D can phosphorylate RB and flip the switch to the own position. There are also anti-growth factors which upregulate stoichiometric inhibitors. Stoichiometric inhibitors of the cyclins and keep the cyclin-dependent kinase activity low and keep the cell in G1 phase of the cell cyclin. And finally, there's the DNA damage sensor that upregulates p53 and p21 and also prevents further progression through the cell cycle. So you can see that these bistable switches play a very important role in progression through the cell cycle. In progression through the cell cycle, and for a mammalian cell to properly respond to external signals and also to internal damage sensors. So I want to focus on some of the modeling work we've done, in particular on the cell division cycle. So we'll start with this classic definition. The cell division cycle is the sequence of events by which a growing cell replicates all its components and divides them more or less equally. And divides them more or less evenly between two daughter stells, so that each daughter receives all the information and machinery necessary to repeat the process. Over the course of about 20 years, from 30 years from 1971, the isolation of the first CDC genes by Lee Hartwell to 2001, when the Nobel Prizes were awarded to Hartwell, Nurse, and Hunt. Nurse and Hunt, this picture of the molecular network regulating the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells came into focus. And this is a universal control mechanism centered on some characteristic cyclins. So cyclin E, I've already mentioned, it's the first cyclin-dependent kinase activity to be upregulated in G1. It turns on cyclin A, which drives DNA synthesis, and then ultimately. DNA synthesis, and then ultimately it turns on cyclin B, which drives the cell into mitosis. And as cells exit mitosis, a bunch of other proteins, CDC14, CDH1, CDC20, are activated to drive the cell out of mitosis, cause cell division, and bring the cell back into G1. Now, the challenge of molecular cell biology is to try to understand. Biology is to try to understand how these molecular mechanisms are sufficient to explain the complex physiology of living cells. And the classical way of doing this is basically by using your intuition. From the cell biology and the molecular biology, you propose a control network like on the left, and then you just kind of intuit how you think of the behavior of this mechanism. The behavior of this mechanism explains the observed physiology of growing and dividing cells, like fissiones cells. The problem with this intuitive approach is the curse of complexity, because the underlying control system for the eukaryotic cell cycle, as I illustrated in the previous slide, is so complex, and actually it's much more complex now than it was 20 years ago, that we can't really depend. Depend upon our intuition to understand how that mechanism accounts in detail for the observed physiology. Hence, the approach of computational cell biology, which is to convert the molecular mechanism into a set of kinetic equations, ordinary differential equations, using the laws of biochemical kinetics, and then put those equations, put those differential equations. Equations, put those differential equations on the computer and compute the solutions and compare those computed solutions to the physiology of cells. The problem with this approach is the curse of parameter space, because any model of reasonable complexity is going to have dozens or even 100 parameters, and most of those parameters are unknown from direct experiments. From direct experimentation. So, if you don't know the parameter values in your differential equations, you can't even begin to compute a numerical solution to compare back to the physiology. So, we need another way of making a connection between the molecular mechanism and cell physiology. And that's what I would like to present at the bottom of the slide. It's what we call the dynamic paradigm for molecular cell biology. For molecular cell biology. The physiology of cells is often represented experimentally by what you can call a signal response curve. And in a signal response curve, the experimentalist varies some part of the system that's under experimental control and observes how the cells respond to that. Do they divide? Do they die? Do they express a certain gene? That's the response. Certain gene. That's the response. Those signal response curves are similar to what a theoretician calls a one-parameter bifurcation diagram, where in the differential equations, in the computer, you vary one of the parameters in the differential equation and observe how the variables of the system respond to the changes in those parameters. So it's the same kind of a setup. And if you see a signal response curve like the red. The response curve, like the red one on the left, where as you increase the signal, you get an abrupt switch of the cell from a low state to a high state, it suggests a bistable switch in the underlying kinetic equations. So when you increase the parameter, you stay on the lower state of the bistable switch and then abruptly switch, jump to the upper state. And if that's true, then it suggests that you do the re- It suggests that you do the reverse experiment, start in the upper state, decrease the parameter, and it'll jump to the lower state at a different level. Now, it doesn't have to do this, but that's the prediction if it's a bistable switch. And often that's observed in the physiological responses of the cell to these signals. Okay, so that's the dynamical paradigm that we, Bela Novak and I, have been using for going on what, 30. What 35 years now, and I want to illustrate it in an old problem, in a new problem. So, the old problem are the model of budding yeast that we published some time ago. And in around 2000, this was what was known about the molecular control system, budding yeast. And we've already heard a lot about CLIN3 and WSCI-5. And Whiskey 5 and some of the other components of this control system. Now, what we did back in the early 2000s is to, oh, and the way I write these wiring diagrams, the solid arrows are chemical reactions. Protein synthesis, protein degradation, phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation are binding to stoichiometric inhibitors. And the dashed lines are catalytic activities of Activities of kinases and phosphatases and transcription factors, things like that. So you can take this wiring diagram and okay, so what's the signal response? The signal is growth in G1, as we heard about in the last lecture, and the response is whether the cells divide or not. When do they go into DNA synthesis, mitosis, and cell division? Okay, the model was built by Kathy J. So the model was built by Kathy Jin and working in collaboration with Bela Novak, who was at the Technical University of Budapest at the time, and Fred Kross at Rockefeller University, and the postdocs who worked diligently on this problem. I'll mention Attila Chikoshnodj, Deutschuran Bataktok, and Andrea Chilabto. So we convert the wiring diagram into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. One equation Differential equations. One equation for each variable, each component in the wiring diagram. And on the left-hand side, we have algebraic representations of rates of synthesis and degradation, of activation and inactivation, of binding and dissociation of complexes. So we'll get a big system of 30, 40 differential equations. As I say, we need to solve those differential equations numerically. Differential equations numerically on the computer, and that's difficult to do because we don't know what the rate constants are to begin with. Okay, so I'm going to jump over several years of work estimating the rate constants from biochemical and genetic experiments on budding yeast, and jump ahead to when we had a reasonable set of rate constants and could simulate progression through the cell cycle. Through the cell cycle in budding yeast. And what you see is at division, you get a newborn daughter cell smaller than the mother cell. The newborn daughter grows in size by more than a factor of two. It eventually enters DNA synthesis and mitosis and cell division. And we follow the next order. Early in the cell cycle, CDH1 is active, it degrades. H1 is active, it degrades any cyclins, the cyclin deventikinase inhibitors are active, stops any kinase activity. And then at the G1S transition, there's production of this cyclin CLIN2, and then later CLIB2 that drives the cell into mitosis. So this looks good. This looks like what we expect and what can be measured during progression through the cell cycle in budding yeast. But we want to look at this from a little bit different perspective. This is from a little bit different perspective. From a theoretical perspective, I want to plot a one-parameter bifurcation diagram that represents the dynamics of this system, where the parameter is cell size, and the response is the activity of CLIB2-dependent kinase, which is the cyclone-dependent kinase that drives cells into mitosis. So, when we do this, we fix the size of the cell at a constant value. Of the cell at a constant value, solve the remaining differential equations to find the asymptotic behavior of the dynamical systems. And what we find is that there's bistable in bistability in the steady states. Very small cells are in a steady state of low abundance of CLIB2 cyclin. And when the cells get large enough, they can. Cells get large enough, they can go to a steady state with high abundance of cyclin. And for intermediate cell sizes, there are two stable steady states separated by the satellite point. So that's a typical bistable situation. The unusual thing here is that the upper steady state is not a stable steady state. It undergoes a hop bifurcation, becomes unstable, and is surrounded by. Stable and it's surrounded by limit cycle oscillations. So, for instance, at a mass, a scaled cell size of 1.8, the CLIB2 dependent kinase activity will oscillate up and down between a maximum and a minimum value. And if we track these maximum and minimum values of the oscillations back to smaller masses, we find that the oscillations end not at the Hopf bifurcation, but at what. Hop bifurcation, but at what's called a saddle loop bifurcation. So there are large amplitude, stable limit cycle oscillations for large masses all the way down to this bifurcation point. Now, how is that related? How is this one parameter bifurcation diagram related to progression through the cell cycle? Well, I'm going to project the Project the compute, yeah. Question: Yeah, um, can you go, I think, one step back in your picture where you didn't have the hop bifurcation, where the hop bifurcation, yeah. So, I mean, out of the hop bifurcation, there should be a periodic orbit coming. And you're saying, Yeah, there is a periodic orbit. It's an unstable, it's an unstable periodic orbit. You never see it. The stable periodic orbit is a bit of a situation. It's a subcritical bifurcation. It's a subcritical half-bifurcation. All half-bifurcation, I'll stay forward. So, yeah, that's a good question. Okay, so now let's project the cell cycle trajectory onto the bifurcation diagram. Initially, cells are small. They're at this G1 steady state. They have very low abundance of FLIB2 until they pass the saddle node bifurcation where the G1 state disappears. One state disappears, and then the trajectory hops onto the stable limit cycle. So, CLIB2 activity increases dramatically to the maximum of the limit cycle. But of course, it doesn't stop there. Then it goes down because it's on a limit cycle. The cell comes out of mitosis, and when the CLIB2 activity drops sufficiently, the cell divides. Cell divides, the cell sizes decrease, and you come back to the domain of attraction of the stable G1 steady state. So we can understand how a budding E-cell progresses through the cell cycle by plotting this cell cycle trajectory on top of the one parameter bifurcation diagram. Okay, I hope you're with me if there's a question about clarification. Clarification, speak up? The only possible question would be time scales. Yeah. Yeah, there are fast and slow reactions. So take my word for it that the mass changes slowly compared to everything else because the cycle time is two or three hours and the synthesis and degradation is minutes. So yeah, good times. Yeah, good times, but the periodic orbit is so you the periodic orbit somehow should be slow compared to the cell division, right? Because you've got to get that no, actually, the periodic, the periodic limit cycle is faster than the cell cycle time. So let me explain that. So let me go back. The cell cycle time is always the mass doubling time. Well, if it divides exactly in half, if it divides exactly in half, then the cell cycle. Exactly, and happen the cell cycle time is the mass doubling because the cell just pokes along here in G1, however, fast the cell is growing, until the cell gets big enough to jump onto the limit cycle. But it never proceeds through the full limit cycle. It only goes up to the top and down, and then the cell divides, and the mass decreases by a factor of two. So the time it takes to go around the cell cycle trajectory. Around the cell cycle trajectory has to be identical to the mass doubling time. Okay, so the cell division then should be thought of as happening fast compared to the certainly does. Yeah, it certainly does. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. So let me just redraw the one parameter bifurcation diagram with the periodic orbits and the cell cycle trajectory. That's what the cell looks, a buddingy cell looks like when it's growing on glucose. Looks like when it's growing on glucose, and the average size of a cell at budding is about 60 femtiliters. Now, if we grow the cells on glycerol ethanol, the whole bifurcation diagram shifts to smaller sizes, but the cell still goes around the same trajectory, just on a different one-parameter bifurcation diagram. So in the poorer nutritional conditions. Conditions, everything is shifted to smaller sizes. In poor growth medium, cells are smaller, they grow more slowly, but they still go through the cycle with exactly the same sequence of events. And that average cell cycle time is still equal to the mass doubling time. Now, interrupt for a second. Sure. So what I think I understand most of what you've shown here. Most of what you've shown here, but when it's dropping, when the concentration is dropping, why do you show that it drops sort of two-thirds of the way, then comes back on that cycle and then comes around as opposed to just dropping back to its where you mean this drop or this drop? This part right there is what I don't understand. This drop is cell division. That's cell division. When the cell divides, it goes from a size of 70 to a size of 35 or a size of 80 to a size of 50. Of 35 or a size of 80 to a size of 40. Okay, that jump right there is cell division, and now the system is in the domain of attraction of lower steady state. So it's pulled down onto the G1 state. Okay? Thanks. Yeah. Okay. I assume, John, that it's absolutely impossible. The whole picture. John, I assume it's impossible to do Possible to do experiments that would be fine enough that you could see the difference between the periodic trajectory and then suddenly the linear stability trajectory. Is that what's the linear stability trajectory? Well, you're going from running on a periodic orbit to suddenly being in, you know, with different dynamics that's basically going down to a steady state, right? To a steady state, right? Right, because the cell divides, and it okay. I mean, maybe I skipped over some things, but um, that's what the last speaker talked about, how the cells know how big they are. And some things have to depend upon the actual, not concentration, but the actual size of the cells. And how we do that in our model is a little bit different, but it's there. So when the cell divides in half, then something dramatic happens. Dramatic happens to the underlying control system, and we're now in the domain of attraction of the stable steady state. Okay? And you see that in the simulations on the left, right? When the cell divides, then big major things happen. Okay. Now, everything is dependent upon nutritional conditions. Poorer nutritional conditions, the cells are smaller. Now I want to make Cells are smaller. Now I want to make another jump. I want to jump to the notion of a two-parameter bifurcation diagram. I want to ask how is the system depending upon both cell volume and nutritional conditions at the same time? What does the CLIB2 dependent kinase activity look like as a function of these two parameters? And in general, in a system like this, you tend to get this folded surface or a Folded surface or a bistable switch. And if you project that folded surface down onto the parameter plane, you see this cusp-shaped region where the system is bistable. And in glucose, we're living in good nutritional conditions on the front face of this diagram, and the cell cycle trajectory is running around the loop that I described. I described. But under poorer nutritional conditions and glycerol ethanol, we now move to poorer nutrients. We move back in this diagram. We're cutting the whole diagram at a different level, and we see a different cell cycle at smaller cell sizing. Okay, so I'm going from simulations to one-parameter bifurcation diagrams, and now I want to go to a two-parameter bifurcation diagram, project everything. Project everything down onto the two parameters, which are volume and nutrient conditions. And I can put a whole bunch of information here. When I project it onto these two conditions, here's the cus state region where I have bistability. Here's the locus of hop bifurcations, the locus of saddle loop bifurcations. Here's the cell cycle trajectory in glucose at large size. Here's the cell. Large size. Here's the cell cycle trajectory in glycerol ethanol at half the size. Okay. And what's going on here? Let's see. Wait a minute. Ah, yeah. Okay. With me so far? So I use the two parameter bifurcation diagram to show me something about the physiology on the horizontal axis and the nutritional conditions, external constraints on the vertical axis. Okay, that's all old news from a long time ago. Now I want to talk about a much newer problem that we investigated using this approach, and that is cell growth and division in the algal cell Plamidomonis. Chlamydomonis has an unusual mechanism for growing and dividing. Because it's a photosynthetic organism, it wants to spend all of its time doing photosynthesis and growth when the sun is shining. And growth when the sun is shining and put off other housekeeping issues until the sun goes down in the dark. So, in particular, the cells grow very large in the light photosynthetically, and then they divide in the dark. So, if they grow by a factor of two to the nth power in the light, then they'll divide n times in the dark to get back to the initial size, and then they'll. Initial size, and then they'll wait until the light comes on again. So they do this growth cycle and then multiple division cycles. Okay, so it's called multiple fission cycles. Now, what are the signal response characteristics of this curious physiology? On the left side, it's taken from a publication in 2016, plotting cell size as a function of time. And this is a logarithmic scale, so the size is increasing. Scale so the size is increasing exponentially as cells grow in the light, and then in the dark they divide two to the end times, and the daughter size goes back down again. They wait for the lights to turn back on. Okay, so in a typical experiment, the mass doubling time is four hours. So I'm measuring time in four hour increments, the time it takes for the mass to double. So the relative size. So, the relative size in the light period during 12 hours of light, the relative size increases from one to two to four to eight. Then the lights go off. And in the early night, the cell divides three times to get back to a relative size of one. And then they're just going to wait until the light comes back on again. Okay, so relative size and number of daughters. Now, Now, suppose we only leave the lights on for eight hours and then put them into the dark. They'll only grow by a factor of four, so they'll undergo two divisions in the night to get back to a size of one. If you only grow them for four hours and then put them into the dark, they don't divide at all. So the physiologist said there must be. Physiologists said there must be some kind of a commitment point at about two and a half or three hours when cells, some sense, commit themselves to divide. But then if that's true, they still have to know how many times to divide. So this notion of a commitment point is always seemed to me a little bit mysterious. So here's another way to picture what's happening in the typical experiment. You increase by eightfold in the light. Eightfold in the light, and then you divide three times. So there's going to be three cycles of S phase cyclin and M phase cyclin to drive rapid SM mitotic cycles. If you grow the cells in continuous light, then what you observe is that they increase by a factor of eight in size, and then in the light, they undergo three division. They undergo three divisions to get back to the initial size and then they repeat. So, in continuous light, there's a 12-hour cycle time, which is three mass doublings. So, they increase by three mass doublings, and they divide three times, and then they do it over again in constant light. Okay, so I want to call this the quote signal response curve. This is the physiology. This is what we're trying to understand. Trying to understand what's the underlying molecular biology, but more than that, what's the underlying dynamics? What's the underlying dynamics that drives these curious multiple fission cycles? Okay, we worked this out with Bayla Novak and Stefan Helt. It was published in Parent Biology in 2020, and it's based on this paper by Cross and Uman, and on a lot of input from Fred Cross. John? Crawls. John? So, yes. So, what was missing there, and maybe you're going to show it. Oh, yes, you are. Okay, the last curve where you have four hours on, four hours off, four hours on, four hours. Okay. Yeah, yeah, there's all, yeah, there's all kinds of things. I only describe some of them, right? Yeah. Okay, so the question is: what does the state space look like? What are the bifurcation diagrams look like? And can we make sense? Diagram look like? And can we make sense out of the complicated physiology from this dynamical systems point of view? So I want to draw a schematic two-parameter bifurcation diagram for clamydomonus based on what we know about budding use. Okay, so we have volume on the horizontal axis, light intensity, which is like nutritional conditions. Which is like nutritional conditions, right? So when it's dark, that's poor, okay? And when light intensity is high, the cells are going to be growing rapidly. And we presume that, oh, and we assume that they have the same kind of two-parameter bifurcation diagram, a region of three steady states and a saddle loop bifurcation that creates stable, large amplitudes. Stable large amplitude periodic solutions. And in this purple region, we have a stable G1 steady state. And in this orange region, flesh colored region, we have stable limit cycle oscillations. Now, let's start with a cell in the dark, in a resting In a resting state at a small volume, 1 fentiliters, and all of a sudden turn the lights on. When we turn the lights on, we come up here, and the one parameter bifurcation diagram is illustrated here. This is the bifurcation diagram when the lights turn on. Okay, and this is our starting point. So, what's going to happen is the cell is going to grow eightfold until it can get past the saddle nerve. Get past the saddle node bifurcation. And then it's going to jump onto the stable limit cycles. And as it divides, it stays on the stable limit cycles. It divides three times until it gets below the saddle loop bifurcation, and then it'll jump back down to the G1 steady state. So on the two-parameter bifurcation diagram, we're doing that. If we leave the lights on. If we leave the lights on, and now we'll go through cycles with a period of 12 hours, and you'll grow by a factor of eight and then divide three times, then grow by a factor of eight and divide three times. What about 12 hours light, 12 hours dark? So let's start with a cell in the dark and turn on the lights. It'll grow by a factor of eight and then jump onto the limit cycles. Onto the limit cycles, but when it goes, just when it jumps onto the limit cycles, the lights go off and the one parameter bifurcation diagram changes. The saddle node bifurcation is now pulled way back to small sizes. The cell divides three times until it gets below the saddle loop, and then it's attracted to the stable, steady state. And because the lights are off, it'll stay. Because the lights are off, it'll stay there until you turn the lights on again. So now, in the dark, we do the three divisions and come back to the starting state. Now, what happens if we just leave the lights on for a short period of time? For less than four hours, we never get into the region of, we always stay. region of we we always stay in the in the region of stable steady states and we don't get any okay so just uh let me just add a few remarks to end if i'm right about this then how many fundamentally different signal response curves are there which equates to how many one parameter bifurcation diagrams are possible for networks of bifurcation Diagrams are possible for networks of biochemical reactions. And what are the elementary bifurcations that can occur in systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations? Well, fortunately, we know the answer to these questions. There's only a handful of elementary, structurally stable bifurcations in nonlinear ODEs, and you've already seen most of them. Saddle node bifurcations, hop bifurcations, cyclic folds, homoclinic bifurcations. So there's a very limited repertoire. Very limited repertoire of bifurcations that we can use to construct all the crazy kinds of signal response curves that we see in cells, assuming that those signal response curves are based on underlying biochemistry, which has to obey the laws of biochemical evidence. And we can use two-parameter bifurcation diagrams to connect cell physiology to nutritional conditions, as I showed. Nutritional conditions, as I showed, or to expression levels of genes, different cuts through a two-parameter bifurcation diagram. So let me just say a few words about what mathematical methodologies we need to move the field forward. If one and two parameter bifurcation diagrams are so informative, what might three-parameter bifurcation diagrams reveal? I don't know the answer to that. Maybe some of the mathematicians. That maybe some of the mathematicians can help me. What do mathematicians know about three-parameter bifurcation diagrams? Should be interesting. Dynamic modeling with nonlinear ODEs is difficult, and we need flexible modeling tools. And I was going to spend some time talking about an approach that we use called standard component modeling, but I'm going to have to skip over this because of Because of lack of time. And what mathematical methodologies? Well, once we've used bifurcation theory to get into the right region of parameter space, then we still have to do parameter fitting to fit the mathematical model to experimental data. And we need efficient and effective ways to search through parameter space. To search through parameter space. And we've taken an approach to this lately based on the stiff and sloppy directions in the cost. So some of you know about this. If you plot the cost function as a function of parameters, say two parameters here, it's a ball-shaped function. And it has stiff directions and sloppy directions that can be determined from the eigenvalues and eigenvalues. Values and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix around the best-fitting parameter set. And you can use those stiff and sloppy directions to do perturbations of your parameter set, to find other parameter sets that do a reasonably good job of fitting the data, as long as your perturbations respect the stiff and sloppy directions. So you have to take small perturbations in the stiff. Small perturbations in the stiff directions so as not to increase the cost too much. And you can take very large perturbations in the sloppy directions. And this helps us to find thousands or tens of thousands of parameter sets that generally do a good job of fitting the data once through the right region of parameter space. Okay, that was my talk, and I'll stop there.
