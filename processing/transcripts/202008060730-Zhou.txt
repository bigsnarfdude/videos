Thank you very much for Professor Dinomia's introduction. And could you hear me? Could you hear me? Please speak louder. You are closer to the microphone. It's not clear, the voice. Okay, yeah, fine. And I also want to thank all the organizers for. The organizers for inviting me to give a talk. Today, I will talk something about the principle of agriculture. So, this is a joint work with Dr. Shang Liu, so from Lenming University of China, and Professor Yalu from Ohio State University, and Professor Ripong from Jiangsu Normal University. Today's topics is this second order. Second order parabolic operator. So here the abduction term B, so we fix it and it is a field. And we have also another three, tau, d, alpha, the other parameter. And tau means the time frequency, and d just means the diffusion coefficient, and alpha is the advection coefficient. Coefficient. Given the new boundary condition, and if we assume B and C are time periodic, then for this periodic problem, so we can always have a unique principle of the value, lambda. Of course, lambda is dependent on the three parameters on tau d alpha. Our interest is, so one of these three parameters, tau d alpha, one of these how the alpha one of them converges to converges to zero or infinity some limit at this time does the limit does the limit limit of other value lambda exist or not if it exists what is the limit um of course uh this kind of other value other value problem is uh very fundamental in uh Very fundamental in PD theory, but today, because of the limitation time, so I can only introduce one case that is when alpha converges to infinity. Usually requires a large reduction problem. About these topics, there are two important paper on it. One is by Brashticki. So, one is by Brashtiki, Armel, and Madi Loshvidi, and the other is by Sukuchen and Yellow. So, we consider this problem for this Newman boundary condition, and this B is just a vector field. And we investigated the lambda limit of the lambda alpha, when alpha goes to infinity. And usually, for general vector field, so if it is smooth enough. can be decomposed into two parts. One is potential flow, relative to M, the other is divergence free flow, V, which is also called uncompressible flow. And if we add one more condition that V satisfy the unabundant condition, such as decomposition is unique. Brasiki and his collaborators studied the case 1B is diversion-free. And Professor Chen and Lao studied the case 1B is a potential flow. They studied the same problem from two different aspects. The method are also different, and the results are also different. So for the So for the incompressible flow, so RST defines this function and for the authentic flow. Okay, thank you. So I will continue. Okay, sorry, sorry for that signal. Sorry for it. And so they consider two different aspects of each problem. So let's speak. Aspect of this problem. So, Brett Speaky for the incompressible flow and chain law for the potential flow. And both of them use the variation method, but the function they defined are different. And from this form, you can also see some difference on the result. In this form, the limit is dependent on the whole domain. And for the potential flow, so by this form, by this. flow so by this form by this weight it's exponential e to alpha m so you can see that when alpha goes to infinity only the maximum point of m will have influence on the limit and the results also show it so the limit is dependent only on the local maximum point of this m and this means it is a whole domain will uh will have influence this here it just means all This here just means only local maximum point, only special points are important. That's so from the view of vegetation method, so it's difficult to unite the result. This is some previous results on these topics. Today, I will follow Chen and Lo's idea and introduce their results first and our experience. First, and our extension about the result. Thirdly, so some recent result on the parabolic case. And because the statement of the theorems are very lengthy, so I will try to show the key points of our research by some typical examples. Firstly, this is Ken Anthel's result. This studied the non-degenerate They studied the non-degenerate M. This is equation and this is new boundary conditions. They assume M is non-degenerate. So, what does non-degenerate generation mean? It means that at the critical point of M. So, if n plumb is zero, then second order derivative cannot be zero. And this assumption, the critical point has to be finite. Has to be finite and they are either maximum points or minimum points. They use this capital M to represent the set of local maximum points of this M. And if we consider the value of C on this set, maximum point set, and take the minimum of them, that minimum is the limit. So from this graph, we can So, from this graph, we can understand the results. If m is like this way, so for this m, we have only five local maximum points, 0, x1, x2, x3, and one. And we consider the value of C on them, C of 0, C of x one, and uh C of x two, C of x three, and C of one. Cf3 and Cf1. Then we take the minimum of them, that is the limit of the principal eigenvalue, when alpha goes to infinity. This is their result. Then this is the result for the non-degenerate M. For degenerate M, it is different. So first up, for non-degenerate case, the critical points has to be finite. But for degenerate case, But for degenerate case, it could be infinite. And so for non-degenerate case, the critical points must be maximum points or minimum points. But for degenerate case, the critical points could be in the middle. Moreover, the most interesting part is we can allow interval, a flat interval, on which M is constant. is constant. We can see this example. On the interval, in the interval x1 to x2, m is constant. Such kind of flat interval cannot appear in the non-degenerate m. And so we can compare this figure two degenerate case to this figure three non-degenerate case. Shape are similar. Except here is the interval and here is the minimum point. For figure three, it is energy case by 10 endalls results, so we know that we only have two maximum points, 0 and 1. The limit is the minimum C of 0 and C of 0 C of 1. Then, so for this one, for this 90, for this egg case, we have one more element here. We have we have one more element here. This is we call it lambda db xy. Means the eigenvalue problem, the eigenvalue of this problem, it says this equation because on this interval, m is constant, m prime is zero, m prime is zero, thus this magnitude term will disappear. Only diffusion and this C5 will be left. This is the equation. And we need to add direct connected boundary condition on both sides. Here the DD means two direct boundary conditions on two sides. The influence of this flat interval is in this way. It is the principal eigenvalue of this. The value of this problem. Because this flat is in the bottom, thus we add a direct boundary condition here. If this flat interval is on the top, there should be Newman boundary condition. It means that this flattening interval will really have influence, give influence on the final limit, and not just a flat, but also its position. Just a flat, but also its position. In different positions, it will give a different kind of influence. And this is a result for degenerate M. Eva is for elliptic case. But parabolic case, for parabolic problems, so for preview results, breast stickies, chain loads, and on-end meats. So we all heavily rely on the Rely on the variational method. So we need to calculate the functional very well. However, for parabolic problem, such a variational structure doesn't exist. So we have to find some new method. Fortunately, so we construct, we found a way to construct a suitable reposition and sub-solutions to a progressive. To approximate the limit of the principal angle value. Moreover, we also found some new phenomena, so in temporary general case, which doesn't exist in elliptic problems. So we will see this show our results by some examples. The first example is this way. First example is this way. It is very similar to the here. So, two maximum points and one minimum point. And here, so we assume for any fixed time t, there is a line we call cassiety. This cassiety is the minimum point of m and 0 and 1 are two maximum points, very similar to that figure 3. So, for this time, any fixed time p, we have two maximum. Time t, we have two maximum points zero and one and one minimum cassette t. This time, what is the limit? The limit is we consider two maximum points zero and one. First, for x equals zero, we consider the integration cs0. So from zero to capital T and take the average. We do the same thing for x equals to one, and we take the minimum of the two. minimum of the two of these two average that is the limit in the spirit this this parabolic problem is a result is very similar to the elliptic problem and for some other kind of case for this case we have one maximum point in the middle and the minimum point minimum points in the on the left and on the right or we can also show On the right, or we can also show the limit exists. For some beginner case, it's okay. Even the set of maximum points and touch the boundary doesn't matter. All the above four cases has some common point. That is, that of maximum points is continuous with. This is a good case. This is also an easy case. An easy case, and because it is continuous. So, this property for this kind for this case is very similar to that of elliptic problem. However, so we know that parabolic problem on swap and cages, we can also construct some, also find some complex cases such that the set of the set of The set of maximum points are discontinuous. So, for this case, the property is different from elliptic problems. So, we can also show it by this example. So, assume mx equals to beta t. We substitute mx by beta t here. This is the problem now. And we assume beta. And we assume beta is zero on the first half, from zero to half capital T, and beta is positive for the latter half, from half capital G to capital T. This is the graph of beta. In the first half, it's zero, in the second half it is positive. And if you still consider this problem from the view of maximum points, in the first half, beta is zero. The vector term will be zero. The vector term will disappear. That's a degenerate case. And the whole rectangle, this red part, maximum point. For the left half, beta is positive, means m is increasing. x equals to 1 is the maximum point. And that's for the left half, the maximum point z. That's this interval. For the first half, it is a rectangle as a positive mirror. But for the latter half, the mirror is zero. half is the measure is zero so you can see the singularity here for this problem so we also we can also show the show that the limit exists is equals to this lambda star what is lambda star lambda star is the principal arg value of its following uh singular problem why we call it singular problem in the first half uh the first for the time i mean so first for the time i mean so it is a pd pd first so this term disappears for the latter half this problem uh it's the odd there's no option here od and we uh connect its pd and od uh in this way uh we can see this picture it is more clear for general smooth eigenfunction it's like this way Other function. It's like this way. It's like that we roll a paper to paste one side to the other side. It is smooth from the beginning and return to the beginning. But for this singular problem, it's different. This blue part, it is WE. This red part, it is OE. ODE means that it is a constant function with respect to x. We connect it here, just here, just in this. Connected here, just here, just in this point, it is continuous. For some other point, because here it is OD is constant, and here it is a PD, it may not be constant. Really, so except this point, it is not continuous for this eigenfunction, for this special singular eigenfunction. Actually, we utilize, we can utilize this singular eigenfunction to construct a sub-supersolution and sub-solution and show. Solution and show the limit really exists. That's the lambda star. This is for the temporary degenerative case, which doesn't exist in equity problems. And for some other cases, we can also show it. And finally, so I will want to talk something about future goals. Firstly, future goals firstly so we want to consider for more general more general b uh which um i'm sorry uh for more general b so under the variational method so you cannot unite the results of rest and the results of k and the law uh it's impossible because the functional are different however so now so from the view of uh super and subsolutions Super and subsolutions, we found a possibility to unite the result regenerative. So we may also can get can show the exist of the limit, show the exist of the limit of the principal unknown value. The second one is for the limit 1d conversion zero, which is really required some more diffusion. In elliptic problems, large adaption and small diffusion has very similar results. It's just similar, but not the same. However, when you study the parabolic problem, you can find that the essence of these two problems, large diffusion and large direction and small diffusion, totally different. Totally different. So that means sometimes parabolic problem can show more about the essence of the problem. Thirdly, so we want to study the direct boundary condition. Here, all the above results I mentioned are for Newman boundary condition. For direct advantage condition, it's different because for some b, you can always find some b and the limit for numerical advantaging condition. For New Mendician, it's always uniformly bounded, but for direct boundary conditions, the limit could converge to infinity, some special B. And this is another interesting problem. And I think I should stop here. And thanks for your listening. Thank you very much for a very nice talk. Are there any questions or comments? Or comments? I have a question? Yes, please. Thank you. Marlene, thank you for your nice talk. So, could you go back to your slide about your assumption of the K C T? It's a curve. Your assumption. Yeah, yeah, this one. Okay, so in your argument, if you have a two curve without any intersection point, then your argument still works, right? Right, yeah, yeah. Okay, so but if they are touched at some time or close, then there would be get have some you have some trouble? Uh, this is what we are we are doing now. We got some progress, uh, but not not very not finished. Okay, so you can overcome this okay, yeah, okay, thank you. Are there other questions, comments? Okay, so let's speak again. Thank you very much.
