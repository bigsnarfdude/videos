Thank you Alan for the introduction. And I would first like to thank Jason and Chelsea to make this work as well. It's a great I get a chance to come back again. I stayed here for many years, but I didn't get a chance to care this is my best time. So it's wonderful. Thanks. Uh in this afternoon I would like to talk about uh weighted Poisson algebra in dimension three. Um this is an ongoing project. We didn't have a Kai information yet. And this is joined with Shin, Tan Shinti and James and all my colleagues are here. So if you have a question, you can ask it for me. How I can answer? So let's uh in this talk I divide the uh four parts. So let me first uh talk about the motivation. Okay, before that I would like to talk about Shadow. In the morning's talk and also yesterday Xin's talk, they have to give the definition what is the Poisson algebra. But in my talk, I just try to give a quick review. Try to give a quick review. I don't know if people remember that, but just give a quick review. So, in this setup, my K, I always require the algebraic close and has a practical equal zero. So, here A is just we set as a weighted polynomial algebra, but X, Y, Z has a degree ABC. ABC is ABC. ABC is just the actual positive integer here. Of course, without the loss of generality, we can assume ABC has this order because X, Y, they are symmetric to each other. Again, for this work, here we set up our A considered as a Poisson algebra, which is a unimodular. A unimodular and then in this case, the other theorem to show that the Poisson bracket, which is determined by a homogeneous polynomial omega, as a degrade A plus B plus C. So in the modeling talk, if A, B, C are equal to each other, which is 1, so in our case, omega just the cubic polynomial, and the bracket is given by the dependent. Is given by the dependent of this matrix. So, this is the setup. Next, please allow me to recall some definition which you probably know in the morning's talk. So, here we say A is a connective greater Poisson algebra, and of course we get to the center in C. And then what is the GPGSPD, which is just a whackness space. Which is just a vector space, consists of all the greater semi-Poisson derivation of the grade 0 and religion of Poisson algebra, which is just a number. I mean, this is an invalid number divided by 1 minus the dimension of the workload space. So if this number is 0, and then we. zero and then we say a is a rigid. Another definition is called on do. Okay, so a percent derivation is called on do which means that phi just kill the center C. And if for A, every percent derivation every on two percent derivation is Hamiltonian, then we say A is on two. I mean Konyan here just means that it can write as the bracket of one element A. And the next definition, we say A is a H1, a pH one minimum, which means the first degree some homolog, which is just a secret group, secret module over the center C and this generator E is just a spectrum. And this generator is just a special derivation called order derivation. I think that's all the definition I want to give you. Maybe I have one more than many months at the previous store. So in the previous work, and then the keyword, of course, they have a lot of nice results, but here I just p to one. And in other cases, it's ABC. case is that ABC just equals 1, right? XYZ has a degree 1. And then they show that for this Poisson algebra, A is a HPH minimal, A is a HODU, and RGT, which the three conditions are equivalent to each other. And both of these can get A is a modula. Another really nice result is saying for any grade twist of A, For any greater twist of A here, the present algebra just isomorphic to A itself. And A is a unimodula here, which means has a useful. And also, in this paper, they also release a bunch of equivalent conditions on the hairborder states of PHIA. Here, I wanna go to the detail. I wanna go to the detail. But Go into the detail, but okay, so natural questions. Questions: In the work, they can see the ABC just equal one, right? So, and then we're asking how about the actual ABC. Can we still have those nice properties? Okay, so the second natural question is that it's possible to understand how many non-isomorphic unit modules. Isomorphic unit modular Poisson algebra class. And then if we know that, it's possible to understand the deformation quantization. As I mentioned, this is still ongoing project. So today, I would like to share some results for question one, but question two, question three, we are still working on. So next I would like to Next, I would like to share some results we get. Here, as we said, our A is always a unit module created for some algebra. But the XYZ has an equation up to ADC, not just that has to be growing. And then, and it turns out, it doesn't matter what how did you give the degree of x, y, z, you still can get the nice result at the one. Get the nice result as a one-on-one case. A is legit if only if the potential omega is irreducible. So, before I go to next result, I would like to mention our approach for this result. We actually did a case-by-case check, but if we want to do case-by-case check, then we have to classify all the different. Then we have to classify all the different cases. So the next result is as I mentioned, they also provide the equivalent condition at O2. But for this actual case, XYZ has actually degree cases, we cannot get the same result. We actually improve. We actually proved that if A is a unimodular greater than Person algebra HO2, for most it is used for omega except a few cases. Okay, and I will give you the detail which cases fail in the later tables. So this is the last definition I would like to. Last definition I would like to give this talk. Maybe have you know that if we say a weighted homogeneous polynomial omega in the polynomial algebra KXYZ as either linear singularity and orange uh which means that the portion A module those uh uh three elements uh is a finite market space. Uh it's a finite vector space. So which means you know we like finite dimension algebra since uh which means uh if omega has isomative isolated singularity case, we kind of think it's a good case. But uh the next result I would like to share is uh about the fraction Poisson field. As uh in yesterday's uh Yes, this uh Alan spoke uh uh Alice mentioned that L and the gems like numbers, like uh invalid numbers. So here we consider that Poisson field has a I mean we consider that Poisson field has a transcendental degree two. So in our case, again, we always assume A is a unimodula greater for some algebra. Greater put some out. But if omega has omega is irreducible, of course, here we only care about an irreducible case because only when omega is irreducible, the RGT is just a zero, which is a nice case. And the addition condition is that if omega does not have isolated singularities, we can prove that the We can prove that the quotient, the fraction of the quotient which is isomorphic to kxy, and the bracket has very nice property. Either the bracket of xy equal pxy or the bracket of xy just equal 1. Okay, then the natural question is what happened if Omega has I7. Okay, then that's the last thing though. Naster result. That's another result. So in this case, we can prove that all of the cases omega, I mean all of the cases omega has isomerated singularity. The quotient is just the isomorphism to this special quotient as a fraction, fraction field. production field. In more detail, we can write the generate relations between my UVW and the bracket of two elements between each other. Here, until now, I tell to if Omega has isolated the singularities, we can get this one. Case we can get this one. But then maybe you're asking the questions: which case, which omega, I mean, which kind of isolated useful omega has isolated using the right? So, so I will answer the questions a little bit later. And then, before so, now I would like to tell you how we are approaching those results. Our way is just try to classify all the potential omega. Right now, in the previous work, if ABC are just equal 1, they can list of the irreducible and reducible omega. At the beginning, when we try to consider the classification, we thought we maybe try to understand if A. To understand if A is 1, B is 2, say the 3, then we try to classify all the useful case. And also, probably try another case in A equal 1, B equals 1, C equals 2. After we get the method how to do the classification, and then we actually found that we can do We actually found that we can do all of the for actual ABC. We don't need to do the special ABC. We can do for any actual ABC. So, first we say omega is a homogeneous. Here, I would like to mention something about in my setup. In the first second slide, I set up my omega. A is always unique. A is always a modular greater percent algebra, right? So, why we can do this setup? The reason is that in the modules talk, and then we know that if the x, y, z has a degree ABC, after we take the sum of ABC, if the sum is not equal to, they always have a twist. So, twist the A as a unimodula for some out. Unimodula Poisson algebra. So which means it's just a surface to consider the unimodula Poisson algebra when we do the classification. Another reason is why we try to only focus on unimodulated Poisson algebra because the one teacher is that in this Poisson algebra, the bracket is determined by potential omega, which omega is just the homogeneous. just a homogeneous polynomial. So now I would first we would like to consider omega is just a polynomial in Kxy. That's possible, right? Because Kxy without Z. And then we actually show that omega is useful if only if omega has this form. And that here ABC is a base. And here A, B, C cannot equal each other, that is strictly different. And that has a C should be equal, uh has a relation with A B in this form. The next is if omega is not in the K X Y, omega is just uh actually poly is a polynomial in the A. So how about this case? Again, uh let uh please allow me remind you Please allow me to remind you our omega has the degree A plus B plus C. Basically, our idea is to try to consider four different cases. So A, say just equal, or because between A and B, B and say you only have two choices, right? A equal or smaller than. So we have four different cases. So use the four different cases, we actually classify. Actually, classify of the irreducible and the reducible omega. So we get a bunch of tables to put my omega, but I don't want annoying people in this topic. I put most of my table at the end in in case people are interested. So uh but uh so let me here I just wanna introduce some special case. Uh Some special case. For example, if ABC are equal to each other, like three numbers are equal to each other, we always can try to give a new degree, right? So we say ABC has a degree equal one. So it's okay. So basically, so ABC equals this is just this case which is given which is this card in the module and they also And they also classify all of the irreducible reusable case. Especially I would like to say for this irredusable case, this omega is that as isolated singularity, if lambda q will not equal lambda 1. And then another special case is here. In this table, you can say I put a bullet. I put a bullet and the circle and the star, right? And also, I put a color here. Please give me time. I would like to explain why I do that. So, for the circle, which means at the beginning we see we can understand all the Poisson fraction field, right? And the bracket of x, y is just a giving, it's just either px sign or just the one. So, so for Burrito, So for Burt, I mean this omega, the correspondent Poisson algebra, and in the fraction Poisson field, the bracket is x, y. Otherwise, I use, for another case, I use sigma, which means that in this case. Okay, what does star means? Star here means for this special in the news for omega, which has isolated singularity. has isolated singularity if omega is not equal negative positive two negative positive two so another special case in the x abc just equal one we'll get the we will get the same reason here but I would like to mention the color the color here one of our results we say for more we say for most intuitive omega the A is a H on to except a few cases right so now I can tell you which case so for the lamp one means A is not a H on do because we can find some we can find some we can find some percent derivation of each k of the standard but it's it's not actually on true. It's not an edge on tool. And for the blue cases, we tried many different methods, but I mean don't know yet. So because that's different cases, the method is different. Nast okay, last, almost here. So last, I would like to talk about isolated singularity. As our previous result As our previous result, we mentioned if the omega has isolated singularity case, then the Poisson fraction field, which are isomorphic to each other. The question is which omega we have isolities in the reaction. At the beginner, we saw that they probably have a lot of omega has isolated. But before we But before we do the classification, actually we prove this result. Of course, if we have a classification, we can check again check case by case. But before we do the classification, we have this result, which is say omega has isolated singularity is equivalent to this, that Lorentz series is actually the polynomial in Zt and in which 2, 4, 3. 2 4 3 A B C you don't have too many choice. They are just the 111, the scale of 111, scale of 112, and 1123. So that's why in my table I only listed the three cases. Because only the three cases provided the isolated singularity case. So here I would like to share a little story. So to prove this one, we actually use This one, we actually use something from the abstract algebra that every synchrotronial polynomial is irreducible. Why? I remember this one because in the spring I thought, I showed the proof in the class and I get started in the last five five minutes I didn't finish the proof and then I always remember oh synchronic polynomial is always irreducible. So here we actually use some technique together from two to three. Together for two six. Yeah, that's a very funny result because I feel finally I can connect them into my teaching and research. The last result is a nice. So I just want to remind myself. So and here this slice of the omega, we say the degree is equal A plus B plus C, but how about omega? But how about omega is the degree of omega is less than n plus plus c and then we actually show that this omega has isolated singularity case up to outer automorphism of A, we can prove that omega is belong one of the cases. Now which means So which which means all of the isomer degree singular is uh classified here if omega has a less than has a degree less than A plus B plus C. Uh last I'm gonna show my table. Uh okay it's not this is the agenda case. Okay, let's go back to the second. Are there any questions for Majit? So, in the case where everything's weighted one, right, when you have an isolated singularity, isn't the Poisson center just generated by this omega? Yes. Is that the same thing here? The the Poisson center is more complicated. Yeah. Actually I mean we don't have a conclusion yet, but I think it we I think it's not a true Isaiah's not a chew. On page 20 that way. Yeah, is it saying, for one, it's saying that no matter what omega is, or is it just saying there exists an omega of this weight? For these three equivalent conditions, we do require this condition. Be quite a bit of the degree of omega equal to A plus B plus C. Otherwise, I think if you only want to put from one to two, then yeah, it would always be the omega special competition. But it's equivalent no matter what omega you pick, as long as it's a second figure. I think, yeah, it doesn't matter what mega you pick, but you have to use this condition. So how about on mine? Japio, you had your hand up at one point. That's a clap. It's just a clap. I've read it, yeah. It's just a cup. Okay, well then let's think how do you get So, our next talk is in five minutes. You're recording? Oh, recording back.
