Okay. Okay, a graph G is determined by two sets, the set of vertices and the set of edges. And given a graph, we can encode information by means of matrices. In particular, we are going to use the adjacency matrix of a graph. This matrix has a 1 in the ij entry if the two vertices form an edge and 0 otherwise. Thus, we can define the characteristic polynomial of the graph in terms of its adjacency matrix. Terms of its adjacency matrix as follows. And regarding with this previous definition, sorry, there are two types of graphs that are relevant for us. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and a bipartite graph is a graph with no odd cycles. By definition, a tree is a bipartite graph, and the key property of a bipartite graph for us is the fact that we can retype its characteristic. Retype is characteristic polynomial as follows, where these numbers are all positive. Sorry. Another type of graph that are relevant for us are the molecular graph. A molecular graph represents the structure of a molecule. The vertices represent atoms and the edges represent chemical bonds. For this reason, these graphs are very often used to study. Are very often used to study properties of molecules. And under this line, I'm based on a close correspondence between the spectrum of the molecular graph and the eigen, the p, sorry, the pi electron energy levels in conjugated molecules, Goodman introduced the energy of a graph as follows, is the sum of the absolute values of its spectrum. Values of its spectrum. Note that here we are capturing certain information of the graph through this number. By the way, Goodman himself pointed out the power of the energy to predict some physical properties of molecules, such as boiling point, by analyzing their correlations. Now, on the other hand, sorry, more recently, based on not permitted. Base of non-commutative probability, Arismendi and Juarez Lomero introduced the energy of a vertex. And as his name suggests, this is a pointwise approximation because the definition assigns a vertex for each, sorry, a number for each vertex in the graph. And this number is the I entry of the diagonal of the absolute value of the adjacency matrix of the graph. Of the graph. Considering that we can recover the energy of the graph by adding up the energy of each vertex in the graph, we can understand the energy of a vertex as its contribution to the energy of the graph. And in this sense, this new definition represents a tool in order to deepen and obtain new insights regarding the relation structure and energy about molecules. Okay, now joining all the previous ideas, let me now introduce our main tool to deal with what comes next. The key property of a bipartisan graph motivates the definition of a quasi-order in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the graph, as follows. If this is true for all k, then we write this, and is at least one of these inequalities is a strict. One of these inequalities is a strict, we write this. The point is that, based on the Colson formula, which give us an alternative way of computing either the energy of a graph or the energy of a vertex in the graph, without using, which is important, without using the spectrum of the graph, just the characteristic polynomial. We have that, in general, the quasi-order, allow us to compute. Allow us to compute, compare either the energies of two graphs, bipartite graphs, or the energies of two vertices in the same bipartite graph or two different bipartite graphs. And with this clear, we are ready to pause the objective of this presentation. Given a tree, a vertex in the tree, a bipartite graph, and an isolated vertex in the bipartite graph, we will be able to verify the vertical In the bipartite graph, we want to analyze the effects on the energies of the three varieties after the fusion of the tree and the bipartite graph with respect to the two varieties. So the point is how the fusion works. And given the tree, the bipartite graph, and the two vertices, the fusion graph is formed from a copy of the tree and the bipartite graph by identifying the two vertices as one. The two vertices as one in the new graph. And this vertex is called the fusion vertex. The aim is to study the change that occur after the fusion operation regarding the energies of the three vertices. And the main result states that the change follows an alternating behavior with respect to the fusion vertex. That is, all the vertices at an even distance from the fusion vertex. Even distance from the fusion vertex increase their energies. While all the vertices are at odd distance from the fusion vertex decrease their energies. Here it's important the distance is the length of the unique path connecting the two vertices. And in other words, the main result somehow tell us that a vertex surrounded by increasing vertices is forced to decrease and vice versa, a kind of entanglement. A kind of entanglement. Moreover, we can prove that the tree, after removing the fusion vertex, is a bound regardless of P in the bipart diagraph that we merge. And as a consequence, offer us insights into how much the energy can increase or decrease after the operation. In particular, the bound leads us to work with consecutive fusions with respect to the same. With respect to the same vertex. That is, we start with a tree, and in each time we join a bipartite graph, we respect to the same vertex. And based on the main results, we have that for each vertex different from the fusion vertex, the sequence is convergent. So the natural question is, what is the limit? In particular, if in each time we join an edge with respect to the same. An edge with respect to the same vertex, that is, at sine n, we have the fusion of x star of sign and our original tree. We can prove that when n goes to infinity, the energies of the leaf tend to zero, the energy of the fusion vertex tends to infinity, and the energy of the remaining vertices tends to the energies in the tree after removing the fission vertex. So, in the long-run behavior, at least in this case, the fission vertex tends to disappear, and as a consequence, the previous bound, regardless of V, is attained. Okay, based on this main result, let me now hop to the maybe next natural question. What happens for any bipartigraph? Is the same behavior preserved? And here, distance is the smallest length of. Smallest length of the path connecting the two vertices, the fusion vertex and a vertex W. At first said, as a direct consequence of the tree behavior, so far we do know that the energy of the fusion vertex increases after the operation. Also, we do know that if there is a unique path connecting the fusion vertex and a vertex W, then the same behavior is preserved. That is, the distance ferried. That is, the distance perity govers the change. But note that this previous assumption regarding a unique path connecting the two varices just avoids the presence of cycles in order to apply the main result, the tree behavior. But at the end, the main difference between a bipartite graph and a tree is the possible presence of cycles. So if we want to prove the same behavior for any bipartite graph by using For any bipartite graph, by using the same strategy, the quasi-order approach, we have to deal with cycles. And in order to gain experience, the first step would be the case where there are just two paths connecting the two vertices of just one as in the tree case. That is, the graph G can be represented as here. And in particular, we are going to start dealing with event cycles, which Linked with event cycles, which falls into our first step. By using the same strategy, the quasi-order approach, we prove that the same behavior is preserved. That is, the distance perity governs the change. Even more, since in a cycle, all the vertices have the same energy before the operation, we also study how the energies are pre-ordered after the operation. And we obtain the following. And we obtain the following pattern, which, as a consequence, prevails that the greater the distance in the even case, the smaller the increase, and the smaller the distance in the case, the greater the decrease. Now, back to our first step, the case where there are just two paths connecting the fusion vertex and a vertex W. The most that we can say so far by using the same strategy, the quiz. Using the same strategy, the quiz-order approach is the following. If the distance from the fusion vertex to W is one, we can prove that the same behavior is preserved. In this case, the energy decreases after the operation. Moreover, when the distance from this vertex to this one and shared period, we can say we can prove that the same behavior is preserved again. Behavior is preserved again. The distance perity covers the change. In particular, taking m1 and m2 equals zero and focusing on the vertices on the top. As a direct consequence of the previous result, the most that we can say so far is the following. We do know the behavior of the future vertex and the vertex at distant one. When n is even, we also do know the behavior of all the vertices with an odd index and with Index and with n is odd, we do know the behavior of all the vertices with an even index. At this point, signs for trees. We know that a vertex surrounded, here, a vertex surrounded by decreasing vertices somehow is forced to increase and vice versa. Maybe this current information could be enough to prove the remaining ones. However, taking into account that the Taking into account that the quasi-order approach works for a unique path connecting the two vertices, including trees. And even cycles, we need to understand what is the issue for the remaining bipartite graph. And for example, if we take an even cycle in a pending edge, a slight difference compared with just a cycle, an even cycle, we obtain the following kind of problems. We cannot establish a general order in terms of the axial. Order in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients. However, so far we have not found any counterexample, and based on the successful examples, we still believe that the same behavior is preserved for any bipartite graph. This example just prompts us to explore a different way in order to either prove the conjecture behavior or comp a counterexample. And finally, I would like Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the same alternating behavior is very often observed in the chemistry framework. For instance, in this paper, pointed out that the melting points of these compounds are alternating low and high as we increase the number of carbon atoms. And the two curves collapse when n tends to infinity, and n is the number of carbon atoms. And since the energy of a graph is based on k is a curve, The energy of a graph is based on chemistry. Maybe under this frame, we could find some intuition regarding the behavior. Here are the preferences, and that is all from my side. Thank you so much for your time. The star as the graph, it's a graph star. The star is a tree. So it's encompassed in the case. Yes. Yes, the loftor is the other thing that you mentioned. Yes, it's also a tree, I'm pretty sure. Yes. Yes, they are encompassed in the first case. They are encompassed in the first case, the tree. We are now trying to cover the case where there are cycles, that is, plus paths. Thank you.
