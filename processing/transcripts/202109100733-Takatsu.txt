So, it's my great pleasure. But I'm really sorry, maybe because of Wi-Fi situation, I'd like to turn off my video. Sorry. So, today I talk about the spectral convergence of high-dimensional sphere to the Gaussian space. So, here, this one is the It's the probability measure on RK put density is given by the heat kernel at the time t equal to one half. That is given by this way. So the pair of RK and Pair of RK and the probability imager is called the Gaussian space. And from a geometric viewpoint, it is known that a new dimensional sphere of radius square root of n minus one, so its kappa char, so kappa char is identically equal to one and dimension is Dimension is, of course, equal to n. So, on the other hand, we can say that k-dimensional Gaussian space, its curvature is also equal to identically to one, and the dimension is not equal to k. So, we can say that. So, we can say that the dimension of the space is equal to infinity. So, in this sense, we expect that the sphere converts to the Gaussian species equals here both the rich kabata equal to one and dimension n divert to infinity. So, to discuss such a convergence, in my talk, in my main theorem, I talk to discuss the convergence of spectral structure on the sphere that is eigenvalued on the eigen space converged to zone the Gaussian measure. So, this is the idea. So, to explain the detail, let us That deal, let us begin with the simple observation. So, that is first I consider the one-dimensional sphere that is circle over square over radius square root of n minus one like this and here radius is It's square root of n minus one. Then it is easy to see that if n tends to infinity, then such a circle converts to the real line in suitable topology. So this is the first observation. Next, Next, let us consider any dimensional sphere over the same radius. Then maybe we can say that this space converges to R infinity, but R infinity does not have a good topology. Does not have a good topology, then so maybe there is some difficulty to discuss this convergence. So to avoid such a difficulty, so we regard the sphere as a subset in RN plus one. More specific, we consider RN plus one is a product of R. is the product of R k times R n minus k plus 1 and consider the projection to R killed Okay. So if here is the point X and Y, then it is projected to X and I denote Y Pro J enuque such projection. Again, it is easy to see that the image of the sphere by this projection converges to RK when n tends to infinity. Moreover, if we consider the push-fund measure of the uniform probability measure on the sphere, probability measure on the Sophia by projection by this project projection then such a profuado measure converge to the Gaussian so to be precise so we into by new n subject probability measure on Aruque then for any air in In RK, so this is probability measure on RK, then we can measure the size of A with respect to new M. And this is given by the ratio of the volume between the play image of the projection. Over the projection so double it if here is a then this part It is a parade. Is a pre-image of air by projection. And the probability image and UNA is given by the ratio of the volume, the play image, and over the sphere. So we consider such a probability measure. Then, Then, it is known that this probability measure converges to k-dimensional Gaussian measure in weak sense. So, such a phenomenon called Maxed distribution role. So, in this sense, so Sophia converges to the Gaussian measure, a Gaussian space. Moreover, on the Sophia and Gaussian space, we can define the repression and the equation. It is known that for non-negativint integer error so Erosa eigenbury on the Sophia is a given by Eru Thimus Eru times l plus n minus 1 over n minus 1. So on the other hand, education value of a Gaussian space is given by L. So here we take to Rapula suburban market. is given by the difference between usual repulsion and the inner product of position vector and the gradient of f so this satisfies the following integral bypass so that if one Process top rotation of gamma k F2 integral by gamma k is given by minus integral of inner product of gradient f1 and f3. So we define weighted repression so that the integral bypass goes. Part goes so then it is very easy to see that if n tends to infinity, it is eigenvalue on the sphere convert to education value of gamma k. However, if we compare the multiplicity of those eigenvalues, Eigen values. Then multiplicity are different. So, in this sense, it may be difficult to expect that the eigen space of the sphere converges to the Gaussian space. The Gaussian space. So, to solve such a problem, I consider the eigen space on the sphere, which is compatible to the projection, and I show that such a subspace of eigen space compat to the eigen space of gamma k. So, in the next slide, I'd like to state my main theorem. State my name theorem. So, before to move to the next slide, is there some question? Okay, even okay. Okay, thank you, Matthia. Then I'd like to go to the next slide. So, this is my main survey. So, I generalize a setting a little bit to do this. Take an Take a n as a positive numbers and assume that the a n over due to n minus one converts to some positive number and take L is a non-negative integer and I denote by E L Denoted by E L S N A N is the eigen space of Erus corresponding to Erus eigenvalue on the sphere. So of course this is energy main journal Sophia. This is n-dimensional sphere of radius A. And also take K and N. This is these natural numbers such that K is always smaller than L. And I consider the space of EKL SNAN, which is the subspace of the LSN. The subspace of polynomials on RK, so Q is always polynomial. Such that composition of Q and the projection is still expected to the sphere become the Erus eigen function. Educate eigen function on the sphere. So we consider such a space. Then I show that this space converges to the eigen space for eigen space on the Gaussian measure for else eigenvalues. So here convergence is strongly sorry, first and tends to infinity. So here, convergence means strongly in elt gamma k alpha solution on any On any compact set. So here, the ma k alpha is the pair of k dimensional Euclidean space and k dimensional Gaussian measure of variance alpha squared. That density is given by this form. So, this is my main theorem and let's talk about the proof. I give a sketch of the proof. Proof. So, first it is known that It is known that the erosion function in the sphere is given by the homogeneous harmonic polynomial on R n plus one here degree is L So Education function on the sphere. So phi is Education function on the sphere. If and only if phi is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial on Rn plus one and degree of L and its restriction is the eigenfunction. Using this fact, I showed In fact, I show that Q belongs to EKL SNN that is polynomial on RK such that it's Q and the composition of the projection is a Education function on the sphere. So Q becomes such an element if and only if. If undone only if Q is given by the linear combination of Q N K L So here first N zero K L this one this index is a Is a k triple of a non-negative integer such that each sum of each component is equal to L. And next, what is L? L is sorry, this is just some real number and next Q. Q N K L X is homogeneous polynomial on R k over degree L and given by this form. So this is cause symbol and minus one j So first there is a subject subject in good and it In gradient and this time operation on the Euclidean space so according to J times Ando I so polynomial over X edus polynomial over X yes sorry. Yes, sorry, homogeneous polynomial on RK over degree error. So this one, so we can show that so Q belongs to here if and only if Q is a linear combination of Q and K L. And if we see here this part, then this n over due to n over due to n minus 1 converges to alpha then this point converts to alpha squared divided by 2j point wise so this one under this so this means that to and okay Q n k L converts to Q K L X when N tends to infinity and this is given by this form. Direct calculation provides that QKL belong to E L gamma K alpha. That means it is eigen function on the Gaussian space. Moreover, we can show that. So if we consider Edu is an index, then QK Edu is QKL is linearly independent and spans the space of eigenfunction on the Gaussian nature. So, this is the proof. And finally, I show something. So, in my paper, I also discuss about the convergence of the heat flow and also convergence. The muscle convergence of giga energy. And I also show that the conversions of host delivery are yen put over them on the board in Sophia. Convert to half hyper no hyper half space sorry in Gaussian measure so to analyze the dirty eigenfunction we need so here the calculation is very simple but when we consider the eigenvalue protocol directly eigenvalue protocol Did the eigenvalue problem, we need more detailed analysis. So, then so if we consider the closed eigenvalue problem, then we can say all else eigenvalue, eigenvalue and eigenfunctions. But for the delicate eigenvalue problem, I can only show that first delicate eigen problem. So, I think now it's a time, so I stop here. Thank you for your. I stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Aska, for your nice talk. And hi again. We have time for questions. If there are some, just open the mic and ask the questions forward. I have one question. Okay. I asked. I ask how about the case the alpha equal to zero or infinity because first alpha equal to zero means direct measure so okay so maybe so because if we consider here is alpha this one then the portion of alpha is given by Alpha is given by this one minus here is alpha. So then usually we can't take alpha goes to zero because this diverge. And I think for dirac measure, it is impossible to define the repulsion. And if alpha tends to infinity, this is not atrocious measures at the Vega major, but as you know, the Vega measure is not the probability measure. So then, so here becomes zero, but so I think we can't say that yes, we so if alpha tends to infinity, then we can't say Burzema max distribution law. So first public. Distribution rule. So fast to power is a no potato.
