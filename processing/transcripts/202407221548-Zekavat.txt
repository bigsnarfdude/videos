I'm glad to be here with you all. I'll be talking about a topic that's kind of niche in this kind of set of individual visuals here in ophthalmology, but I promise it has connections to everything, to cardiovascular disease, to pulmonary disease, to renal, to neurological and also mental health related work as well. So this is connecting ocular and systemic health. Connecting ocular and systemic health. Exposures. So the purpose of our analyses was towards answering two questions in a large-scale, unbiased fashion. First is what information can retinal layers provide on future ocular and systemic disease risk? And then the second is what genes influence retinal layer thickness. And to do this in this work, we quantify In this work, we quantified nine retinal layer thicknesses across individuals in the UK biobank, which relates to 45,000 individuals in the UK biobank. And we replicated this in 6,000 individuals in the LIFE Adult study. And I want to mention this because there's very few cohorts around the world with both genetics and retinal imaging, specifically OCT imaging. So there's anything. So if there's anything collaboration-wise that anyone has available, please reach out. But using these two databases, we performed cross-phenotype association analyses looking at relationships between retinal layer thicknesses and incident conditions. We also did genome-wide association analyses. And then we did an analysis that compared the phenotypic and genotypic analyses to identify concordant relationships. Identify incorrect relationships. And so, first, we looked to identify expected findings, and indeed, we found that aging is associated with thinning across nearly all retinal layers, except the retinal layer that's associated with AMD and relates to jujuin development, which is the RPE plus Brooks membrane layer. And this layer typically increases in thickness at around age 60. And that's around the age where AND tends to be diagnosed. And tends to be diagnosed by individuals. Andy, for folks who don't know, it's age-related macular degeneration. It's the leading cause of blindness in individuals in the U.S. And now when we look at AMD and D, we see that a thinner photoreceptor segment and thicker arbitrary plus perix membrane layer are both associated with age-related macular degeneration. And then the next most common And then the next most common disease in the eye is glaucoma. And indeed, we find that all of the retinal inner layers, thinning of those inner layers, are associated with future glaucoma development. And then we looked across other eye diseases. When we look across eye diseases and across all the eye diseases in the fecots, you find these associations. And this is pretty much what I already talked about. And this is pretty much what I already talked about. I put the hazard ratios here for reference as well, and this is after adjusting for all the covariates here. And so, indeed, we see that every standard deviation thinner RNFL layer is associated with nearly 2.5-fold increased risk of future development of glaucoma. And then, similarly, for photoreceptors thinning, every one standard deviation thinning of the photoreceptors. Thinning of the photoreceptor thickness is associated with a 1.4-fold higher risk of A and D adjusted for all the covariance system. And so next we wanted to look at other diseases besides the eye. And so first we looked at mortality and we identified that a thinner ganglion cell layer, which is the layer on the top of the retina, is associated with infant mortality and so is a thinner photoreceptor segment. A thinner photoreceptor segment. And this is true across kind of the age groups listed here, where individuals with thinner photoreceptor and thinner GCC layer are both at a higher risk of mortality. And so now the question is: why? Why does the retina predict mortality? And so to do this, we looked across other systemic conditions. And now, just starting with retina. And now just starting with cardiovascular diseases. And indeed, we find that thinning of those inner layers and the photoreceptor thickness is associated with several incident cardiovascular diseases. And here's some representative hazard ratios just to give you a sense. For congestive heart failure, every one standard deviation thinning of the photoreceptor segment is associated with a 1.25-fold increased risk of congestive heart failure. Risk of congestive heart failure. And for aortic aneurysms, it's a 1.5-fold increased risk. And then for incident pulmonary diseases, such as COPD, every one standard deviation thinning of the photoreceptor segment is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of COPD, and similarly, a 1.2-fold increased risk of chronic kidney disease. And there's also associations with neurologic and psychologic conditions with every one standard deviation decrease in the top layer of the retina, the GCL, or the ganglion cell layer, being associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk of future MS and a 1.15-fold increased risk of alcoholism. And there's also associations with schizophrenia and tobacco. And tobacco use with photoreceptor cyclopheny. And so, next, we looked across the genome and identified 259 inherited loci associated with retinal layer thicknesses. And this is really hard to see, but each different color here is relates to the number of significant layers at that region. And each of the shapes refers to the layer itself. Refers to the layer itself. And so you can see that there's a lot of loci that are shared between different layers of the retina. And this is looking at genetic capability across the different retinal layers. And we were able to successfully replicate the toplosi among the life adult study, which was a population of 6,000 individuals with With OCT imaging data, and as you can see here, the betas from UK Bioting and those from the Life Adult study are pretty concordant across each of the layers. And next, we wanted to ask, can we identify which genes across each other loci are relevant? And so, to do that, we used the We used the POPS score, which some of you may be familiar with. It was published in Hillary Cooper-Kaine's group in 2023. And this is a method that combines information from gene expression, biological pathways, and protein interactions to predict which genes are most likely responsible at each GUA silphus. And this is an example of an output of that. Example of an output of that for each of the layers at chromosome 19. And you can see some of the significant genes include C3 or complement 3, LDL receptor, APOE, insulin receptor, TDF beta, atlas chromosome. And next we looked at grouping these genes across pathways and identified significant pathways. This is bulky Significant pathways. This is looking just at the photoreceptor thickness, and indeed the top pathway is with visual phototransduction, which makes a lot of sense given this is the photoreceptors. But then there's other pathways that come up too, including inflammatory pathways, so reactome signaling by interleukins and the compliment cascade, as well as signaling by Vajat for vascular endocellal growth factor. And you may know that individuals And you may know that individuals with very severe AMD are treated by intravitreal injections of anti-BAGAF. So this again correlates to its significance clinically as well. And then this is looking at rare disruptive variants across the different layers, which identified several genes significant, including this one here. Significant, including this one here for photoreceptor thickness. And then kind of looking across the kind of zooming in and trying to zooming out and trying to connect the phenotypic associations with the genetic associations. We did a comparison comparing the epidemiological and genetic associations to identify some possible causal links between retinal layers and disease. And this is showing some examples with ocular conditions. Indeed, we showed that a thinner photoreceptor layer, both epidemiologically and genetically, is associated with increased risk of AMD. And then a thinner RNFL layer, both epidemiologically and genetically, is associated with increased risk of glaucoma. But then when you zoom out and do this across all systemic traits, you find that there's a lot. Systemic traits, you find that there's a lot of systemic traits that are associated with retinol air thickness as well. And these include poor performance on pulmonary function tests and increased blood pressure listed here with RNFL layer thinning and photoreceptor layer thinning. And I'll go through some of these associations in the next plot. Splot. So, this is looking at pulmonary function tests. So, this is FEP1 or forced expiratory volume in one second, the cost of individuals who take biobank, epidemiologically, and its association with photoreceptor thickness, showing that lower performance on this pulmonary function test is associated with thinner photoreceptor, but also that that's true genetically as well, looking at the polygenic risk score. And then a higher cystopic. And then a higher systolic blood pressure is associated with thinner RNFL and ganglion cell layers, both epidemiologically and genetically. And so in conclusion, we reported the first comprehensive population-wide study across almost 550,000 individuals and OCT rectangular thicknesses and identified multiple ocular neurologic, pretty rascal. Partiovascular pulmonary renal condition associated with thinning of both the inner and the outer retinal layers. And then through common and rare analysis, we identified multiple regions of the genome linked to retinal layer thickness. And then lastly, comparative phenotypic and genotypic associations identified some putative links between retinal layers and both ocular and systemic conditions. And I want to thank all the individuals involved with this work. And this work was published in Science Translational Medicine back in February of this year. And it's also, we developed an ocular knowledge portal with the Byrd Institute. And the link for that is here if anyone wants to look it up. But this kind of goes through what that This kind of goes through what that portal looks like: how each of the retinal layer thicknesses and their both the phenome-wide associations for each retinal layer thickness and the genome-wide associations are also all listed there so that you can look up your favorite systemic or ocular phenotype or gene and look at its associations with the retina. With the retina. And that's it. Any questions? Yeah, no, fantastic. Just one clarification: you know, when you did the epidemiologic association, you seem to indicate that the retinal kickness is associated. And the retinal thickness is associated predicting future disease incidents, linear incidents. But when you do the genetic one, you did the other way. Yeah, I did. So I was wondering, I mean, which way the causal thinking is here. Yeah. Yeah, that's so. I did both incident and prevalent associations. I didn't show the prevalent associations here, but they're in the paper and on the link online too. But the thought is that the association is between these systemic phenotypes. These systemic phenotypes and retinal layer thinning. And then with the ocular phenotypes, the association is between the retinal layer thinning and the ocular phenotypes. And that's how the, like when I looked at the polygenic risk scores for all the different quantitative traits, that's how it's. I wonder if you can read it in a bidirectional Mendelian animalization as well. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that w that's totally uh that's a very interesting thing. Actually I did it for photoreceptor and A and D. Photoreceptor and A and D, and it does show significance bi-directionally, but it would be interesting to look at the other trees. It's a little bit difficult, though, to interpret how the other direction would work if it is indeed significant in the deanery. Like, if you find that photoreceptor thinning is associated with other not increased VMI and a causal wave deanization, that that's a little bit difficult to to understand, yeah. What was the age? What was the age of the people that had the measures that you can buy them? 40 to 70 years. And so the numbers you taught onset way before that. So the diseases you mentioned onset way before that. Like which diseases? Like multiple sclerosis. Oh, yes, yes, yes, for sure. The associations with multiple sclerosis were both present in incident and prevalent associations. So I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or AMD A scrub, drinking, ACO3. Um, how do we consider it a normal like very obvious like risk factor smoking? Yeah, smoking is a very obvious risk factor, and it's associated with, I think, the strongest association was with photoreceptor ethnic. I did do an adjustment of like the 25-factor smoking variable in the UK body. Smoking variable in the UK Body Bank. And the relationships between pulmonary disease and retinol air thickness persisted despite the 25-factor smoking variable, which suggests that still there might be kind of other things besides smoking, you know, individuals who are even non-smokers that are associated with retinal layer thinning. And it's actually, it's a really good point because for conditions, Good point because for conditions like AMD or for like general retinal health, we kind of have several associations from a clinical standpoint, both sleep apnea and smoking are the two things we ask patients for clinically. You know, do you have sleep apnea? Do you smoke? And if so, our kind of threshold for kind of monitoring is a little bit more tight. Is a little bit more tight in this picture. Thank you again.
