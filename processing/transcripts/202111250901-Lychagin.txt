Between algebraic and the variational invariance. So maybe on few algebraic problems, it seems not so visible, but spheric harmonics, it's very good candidate for this for two reasons. It's harmonics, they are polynomials. So with this algebra, and spherical means that they, in some sense. Um, in some sense, they call it the Garmonik, so it means that Laplace operator involved. Uh, it's more or less a standard piece of mathematics, and especially for people who work, say, in quantum mechanics or maybe in fluid mechanics, where you have to solve some Laplace equations, then they know about harmonic or spherical harmonics. My talk will be maybe more algebraic than usually do the people who work with such stuff, use such type of Garmonics. And if you check it exposition of spherical harmonics, you will find a lot of integrals. But because we're talking about invariance integrals, they are not so suitable. They are not so suitable. So, the first part of my talk will be just some substitution of integrals by more visible, at least for me, algebraic and differential constructions. So, the first, I just will remind you that spherical harmonics is polynomials of degree k that satisfy the Laplace equation. I will formulate this in a slightly different way. So, the first we will write. Different way. So the first we'll write earlier equation is the first one. And it's a smooth solution of this equation, if k positive. Then it's your polynomials of degree k, homogeneous polynomials of degree k and plus Laplace equation. So this is two differential equations that we take in the file. So what I will do, I will take these equations. Do I will take these equations and realize them with some manifolds in jet spaces? So, gy, it's gi, it's just i jets space of i jets or smooth functions on R3. So, anything could be on our favorite R3 space, but it can be removed without problems for any dimension. So, EI means the following. We take these two equations. This is earlier. These two equations, this is earlier and Laplace, and take the prolongation. So i equal one, uh, it means that it should be something in g1, so it's only Euler equation we have there. I equal two, it's second order, so in second order we have Laplace equation and prolongation of Euler equation. And then we start to prolong these equations up to the level K because it's we interested. We are interested in smooth solutions, and smooth solutions they are polynomials of degree k. So, consider k plus 1 g of polynomials of degree k. It's not so good idea. Okay. Oops, sorry. The group of rotation R3, it's obvious symmetry group of this equation. So it's because the silencer transformation is transform homogeneous. Transformation is transform homogeneous polynomials to homogeneous polynomials, and because it's preserved distance or metric, it's also preserves the Laplace equation. So under this, what we can say about this is relocations EIs. It's because just from this form of equations, we see that they are a fine manifolds in GI and I and group with a three X on this fine algebraic meaningful. So it's just a good sample of situations. We have simultaneous algebraic and differential picture. Well, something wrong? Okay, okay. So, HK, it will be a space of solutions or space of Garmonic polynomials of degree K. And it's obviously a space where we have a representation of group SR3, so it's SO3 module. And we will use two types of invariants. So, for this case, for this space HK. For this space HK, just simply invariant functions. If it's rational function invariant SSE, this will give us our algebraic metric invariant of spherical harmonic. And it will be field of some fields. So this notation for this field, AK, A is sign of algebraic, and K is just a level of KJ. It's all case, it's just simply. It's just simply degree of polynomials. Now, if you consider this defined manifold EI, this prolongation of our earlier Laplace equations, it's a fine manifold, so it's allowed to us to talk about rational functions there. And if you have a rational function on this space, and it's SO3 invariant. It's SO3 invariant functions. We will call this differential invariant of order i and this is notation for the frequency invariant. So it's also some field. Yeah. Now let's consider some algebraic structures that are related to this situation. Related to this situation. So, first of all, let's remind some properties of so-called wheel algebra. So, this is simply a setive algebra of linear differential operators on R3 with polynomial coefficients. In this algebra, we have, inside of this algebra, we have a Li algebra or Li approach. Algebra or Visit algebra SL2 and it's generated by these three operators. R square divided by R square is just square operators and H is some so delta is the diagonal vector field. So this operator of the first order delta plus three half and H minus this is Laplace divided by two. It's easy to change. divided by two it's easy to check that uh it's really the algebra for three and more this h plus h and h h x plus h and x minus they just uh give you so-called values in sl2 so we have this well-known commutation relations it's the first uh guy who will help us to work with our problem and uh the second Problem and the second, it's SO3 algebra. It's also algebra inside of this R3 and it's generated by three rotations of in physical terms its angular momentum operators. So this is two sub-algebras inside of A3. There is some very funny important relation between them. It's called who structure. Structure. So, this is two algebra that, first of all, they neutral commute. It's easy to check because simply this SL2 algebra is built from operators that commuted with rotation, the SO3 invariant. So, universal relative algebra of SL3, it's exactly the algebra of SO3 and invariant operators in ATRI. It's the first remark, and the second, it's if you take Casimir operator of SOCE, it's so-called orbital angular momentum operator, it's sum of squares of these rotations. And where you find an observation that is Casimir operator for SO3 coincides with Casimir operator for Li algebra SL2. They have just if you write, they have this form or this form, but it's the same operator. So, this is two Lie algebras, very well known to Lie algebras, and they have common Cadmi. It will be just main point in our game. Oops, sorry. And about this operator M? Operator M was Pasimir. So it's you can restrict it in commas, restrict operator on unit sphere and it will be coincide with the spherical Laplace operator. That's why it's so important. The second observation is the following exact sequence. So if you take polynomial, so polynomial pK is polynomial. polynomial so polynomial pk is polynomials homogeneous polynomials of degree k so laplace goes from pk to pk minus two it's easy to check that this is happy and k analysis by definition is harmonic polynomials of degree k so from this exact sequence you conclude that the dimension of harmonic polynomials is to p plus one oops yeah Yeah, uh, more more really, uh, we have the following splitting of this polynomials of space of polynomials of degree k. So, if you take any homogeneous polynomial degree k, then you can split, it's represented as a such sum where h is this Garbonic polynomials and this is degrees of this invariant R. It's more or less a standard result in theory of harmonic polynomials. I will not certainly not prove it. You can find it in your book, but it also can be proved from this whole structure on algebra, on the V algebra. So the second observation is the following. So if you take this Pasimir M. Take this as Pasimir M operator and apply it to a Garmonic of degree T, then you will get the same Garmonic with this. So, Garmonic, they are eigenvectors for Casimir operator with the following eigenvalues. And this is by the way, why they so important. Because as I said, so AM, it's if you restrict on units here. Unit sphere, then you will get any heuristic harmonic polynomials on units here. You will get eigenfunctions for spherical Laplacian, and this is their eigenvalues. And it's also common results that any continuous function on sphere can be just represented or approximated by linear combination of spherical harmonics. The second observation is also corresponds to this property of M that is act on harmonics simply by multiplication, that we have the projection of all polynomials of degree k on the harmonic polynomials of degree k minus 2i. So we can kill 2i degrees on this. Two i degrees on this projection and get it harmonic polynomials. So, for this case, we should take simply we should take polynomial that equals not equal zero at point lambda i, but equals zero in other points lambdas. At lambdas eigenvalues of our m and then it's And then it's easy to see that you will get exactly this formula for projection on in this splitting of all polynomials in terms of harmonic properties. And it's another, so the exact sequence that we considered use in different reactions. So now we can convert this and you'll get the following exact sequence. So we take polynomial of degree k minus common genus polynomial degree k minus. homogeneous polynomial degree k minus one multiply on r square you will get homogeneous polynomial of degree uh of degree k and this is you're just a kernel of this projection by the construction but uh existing on these projections give us some uh maybe uh non-expected structure on harmonic on seric harmonics Harmonic on spheric harmonics. So certainly HK is just vector spaces, it's clear, but they are solutions of Laplace equation. But luckily, this polynomials we can multiply and get Garmonics once more. It's just by using this projection. So we take two Garmonics, HK and HA. H L or H L yeah and multiply them as polynomials and now another just can take projections on Germanic polynomials K plus A. So this gives you some multiplication and what is the one involved this application? Yeah, this is projection. I just write this expression for projection in explicit form. So this is how the projection looks like. So it's one formula. So it's one formula, but it's involved only Casimirian and just some integer. Okay, so what it give us, so first of all, if you take sum of all this infinite sum of all harmonic polynomials, then they give you, you will get graded commutative algebra with respect to this new product. And this algebra of harmonic polynomials will be generated by simply linear, this coordinate functions x, y, z. And this function satisfies the following equation, relation, sorry. And if it just make a complication of this algebra h star, then in this algebra, it will be. in this algebra it will be simply algebra of regular functions over complex numbers over this is null x square plus x plus plus z square equals zero let's see so this is just some example uh if you take simply x multiply start some multiply y on x you'll get x square but minus this y if you multiply x and y simply a standard multiplication x squared so you can see easily that square so you can see easily that if you take x square y square and z square and take their sum you will get here on the right you will get zero okay now let's let's go to uh invariance so the space this is very harmonical so as we see as we saw this is just vector space dimension to k plus one so liberal plus or three is group SO3, it's give us algebraic acts in algebraic way upon this space. And also it's well-known result from representation theory that all irreducible representations of this group SO3 could be realized in this harmonic H case. Just simply, this harmonics is just simply a list of all reduced representations of SS3. representation of SSE. Now, if you take in account the Hilbert theorem, then polynomial invariance of this action, you will just find a generated commutative algebra. And if you take another theorem, it's a Rotenbeak theorem, then if you take rational invariance of this action, or rational invariance of this action, then you get some field and traffic. At some field, and transcendence degree of this field is just simply codimension of regular orbit. The difference between Hilbert theorem and Rosenick's theorem, that in Hilbert's theorem, you can say that it's finally generated, but to find all the generators and stuff, for me, it's too worrying problem. So, really, if you want to describe orbits, I mean regular. Orbits, I mean regular orbits of SO3 action, then it's better to use Rosenlich, where it simply says this transient invention, so degree. So it means that you can easily find necessary number of rational invariants and they give you just separate regular ones. By the way, regularity, everywhere, I will mean simply if you take, say, I will mean simply if you take, say, HK and factorize by action of a theta, so we take orbit space, then a regular orbit this just corresponds to smooth points on this affine manifold. And if you take this Rodenick theorem, it simply says that rational invariance could be served as local coordinates in neighborhoods of regular points. Regular points. Okay, now it's easy to see that regular orbits have this dimension. And if k 2k minus 2, when k 2 or more. And co-dimension 1, if k equals 1, because it's simply the action of SO3 on three-dimensional space. So yeah, it's clear that for dimension equals 1. So if you just take this Rosening theorem, you say that to separate or to define regular orbit, we need simply two k minus two algebraically independent rational invariants. And for k not more, just it should be more or equal and only one invariant will be. And only one invariant when can you go on that couple of okay now let's go to differential invariants so these equations this is submanifolds in hydros they find manifolds this it's by the way good exercise to find the dimension so dimensions will be 2i plus 4 and regular orbits once more we will Regular orbits, once more we will think that regular as three orbits on this define manifold. So once more, regular regularity means smooth point on this is quotient. And once more Gilbert theorem simply says that quotient is a fine manifold of dimension 2i plus 1. But rational invariance, it's once more it's due to Once more, it's due to Rosendie just can be considered as a local coordinates of this quotient. And the transcendent degree of this field of rational variance is will be to I plus one. Now, so this is two really fields that we will have. So, this field of differential invariance, and there is also a field. Invariance, and there is also a field of algebraic invariance. So, this you can compare this residence degrees of these two fields. So, if i equal k, it will be 2k plus 1 for differential invariance, and 2k minus 1, it's for algebraic invariance. Okay. Okay, now we just will change our mind and let's consider this problem of finding of invariant that will separate regular orbits from the another point. So take a regular Germanic H, this is a function on three, then we can take two jets of this function. This function is three-dimensional sub-manifold inside of E2. Dimension E2 is 8. So if you take this 2j and take SO3 orbits of this section, then you'll get some six-dimensional sub-manifold in eight-dimensional manifold. And it means that we need only two. It means that we need only two differential invariants of order two to describe the whole. And it doesn't depend on k2. So, yeah, k should be bigger than bigger than one. So it means that to find orbits of regular Garmonics, we can use either algebraic point of view or the differential point of view. But the differential point of view is. That view, but differential point of view simply says that we need only two rational invariants of order two. And if you take algebraic point of view, then number of invariants that you need to separate this orbit, it's much bigger. So this is 2k minus 2 minus 2. Okay. Okay, so now it's just a general remark about these two types of invariance. At least the last observation show us that maybe differential invariance more profitable for us because first of all, we need to know only second order invariance. It's no need to compute higher orders in variance. Invariants and also number of these invariants not so big as algebraic invariance. So now let's see how we can compute differential invariance. After I will explain how to get algebraic invariance from differential variants. So first of all, we take this two obvious invariants, R square divided by two, and this is Q, which should This is Q, which should be Q000 in jet notations. So we take horizontal or total differentials of these two functions. You get two differential forms, horizontal jets. So the first one is just a function on form on the R3, and the second is the form on one jets. To construct co-frame, we need one form more. So we take what I will call cross product. So take cross product of this form. So you can think because it's metric. So you can say about forms, so about vector fields, about simply vectors. And we take the standard cross product and this gives you the full and third element in our coffering. Our coframe. So, this is UB SO3 invariant co-frame. And this is first-order co-frame. We need only first jets to define this coframe. The dual, it will be invariant frame. So, the first it's our radial vector field. Of the second, it's you It's, you can say, gradient of Q, and this is what it's once more, it's their cross product. So, this three invariants, invariant derivations, we have in some sense for free here. Now, we can get first invariants from this construction. So, this is two invariants. Now, we can apply to the first one, to the second one, to G0. To the second one to g0, apply differential d2, you will get this square gradient, and apply to this seven operator d2 to g1, you will get this is the cubic invariant. And now it's second-order. But now I will just simply explain how to get all invariants also for free. So the first observation is the following. Of observations, the following: so, take this. We know the jets of a fine space, they just split it in the sum of symmetric powers. And formally, it means that we have this elements, these symmetric forms, theta i's, and really any chi jet or any jet. Any chi jet or any jet can be presented as a sum of these forms, and this is forms they are invariants of a fine transformation group of the fine transformations in R3. Now let's remember that we in metric situation, so we can take these forms and get from them operators. Oops, sorry, we can the following operators and so this is K order differential operators. The differential operators and they also SO3 invariance. This is affine invariance, and operators SO3. So using this invariance, invariant operators, we can get more invariant algebraic differential invariance. So, how to get it? So, we take this is coordinates x, y, z, take the different. Coordinates x, y, z, take the differentials and decompose them in terms of our invariant frame. So this t functions, t ij, they're rational functions on one genus. And now take our form theta i, and instead of dx, put these expressions for them in terms of our forming gas. And if we get the form representation. Oming us, and even we got the form representation for theta i's. But now, forms oming us, they're invariant, so this coefficient is also invariant. It will be a rational invariant of SO3. And rationality, you can see easily that this forms, this TIGs that use it in this substitution, they are simply rational functions on G1. So, this is functions that we will get. They also rational rationality on. Rationality only on the level of first jets. So they behave polynomial for higher jets, and only on the first level, it's some rational functions. And so the first valuable theorem is that this is invariance keys. They are just give you, in some sense, not biases, they give you generators. Not by the ziggy generators in rational assessment invariants. So all rational invariants, they just will be functions of these t's. And this is obvious because theta i's, they just represent jets. So any jets just fitted in some of these theta i's. So any jet can be presented with this jet. So any rational functions of this really just functions of these. Okay. Oops. Now Now, one funny operator, it's a really funny operator. It's if you take this operator's invariant, sorry, theta i and apply to our zero order invariance Q. So you'll get the following expression. And maybe this right-hand side here is simply a square of lengths of the. A square of lengths of the form theta i's respect the symmetric that we have on R3. And if you take, say, first steps, i equal one and two, then you theta i with head, it's just this operator, theta two with head is this operator, and then you apply to to u. So this give you just square. Give you just square lengths of gradient of your function q. I'm sorry for this movie, but the second, if you apply, oops, I'm sorry, it should be theta two here. If you take theta, theta, it's copy pass, theta two of u, you will get the next operator, and you easily recognize that it's simply a length or length or length square of length of Hessian function or Hessian matrix. So so this is some quadratic also invariant. And the theorem is more or less standard in invariant theory that we should find invariants and derivations that will generate your all other invariants. So Uh, other invariants. So, in our case, we should take this as two obvious invariants. The second, as I said, it's you can say that it's trace of a Hessian matrix, square of Hessian matrix, or lengths of this Hessian matrix. And derivations only this first one. So, using this you could get all other derivatives. So, you get generators and rational functions other than just give you all the independents. Than just give you all of the innovations. Okay, now how we can get some relations with so we know we know all really rational differential invariance, SSA invariance. Now the question, do we have some way to construct algebraic invariance? If people like it, algebraic, but not differential. So can we go back and construct some algebraic invariant? Go back and construct some algebraic index. So, the first remark is the following. So, invariance, we can consider we consider them as a functions on kgs on R3, but functions on kgs on R3, you can consider as a non-linear k-order differential operator that acts on the functions on the three. And actions are very simple. So, take your invariant and simply restrict on page rate of. And simply restrict on page rate of this function. So you get new function and dependence here is differential of order k. So, and okay, it's non-linear operators, but anyway, you can make their composition and you will get manoeuvre. And this manoeuvre, so this is all invariant. So, composition of such apparatus obviously will be SO3 invariant operators. So, it means that on the invariance, SO3 invariant. SO3 invariance, we have manoeuvre structure. And by the way, this zero-order invariance U, it's will be unit in this manoeuvre. So the field that we construct is a differential field or by the algebraic also, but differential field is also one of. So together with all properties that we know about these invariant derivations about simple algebra. About simple algebraic structure. It's also, there is some mono structure here. And now I will discuss some descent from the differential to algebraic invariance. So, first remark is that algebraic invariance really is a differential way because coefficients of polynomial. Polynomial, homogeneous polynomial, they just can be obtained simply by derivation of this polynomial, say, order, k degrees, and then you can take case order derivations, you will get all coefficients. So, any algebraic invariant, it's just also very special differential. Now, I will try to move back. So, for this reason, I will consider this point. This is Victor Field. This vector field. This is a diagonal vector field, and plus this extension field that we use to define Euler equation. And so V star, it will be just its int prolongation of this field. The second, we will introduce weight of, I will consider now only polynomial differential invariance because any rational invariance is ratio of two polynomial differential invariance. So if you take polynomial, So, if you take a polynomial differential invariant and we say that it has weight double E, if applying this vector field to this invariant, we will simply multiply our invariant by this double V. Non-formally, you can think that the following way. So, if you take homogeneous polynomial of degree k, this k, and compute value of your invariant on this. Value of your invariant on this polynomial, then you will get a polynomial of degree double. And now the center, I said, so algebraic they are just differential. Now let's go back. So let's I will be differential invariance of weight double V and take function harmonic polynomial of the grid. So The grid. So if you take value of our invariant on this polynomial H, you have a polynomial also will be homogeneous, but it will be polynomial of degree double V. So I take this polynomial and take this projection on harmonic part. So this projector, and we'll get Gramonic polynomial. A Grammonic polynomial of degree to double E minus length. So alias can be any here. And now we take square of length of these harmonic polynomials. It means that we should apply this operator that corresponds to our this favorite invariant W V double V G that I tell you said before and then you get simply some number so scalar it means that if you take this monoid composition of these three this invariant this is operator it's also invariant operator so you can apply it's linear some also then you will get algebraic invariant so it means that you not only find all differential invariant All differential invariants, but we can use them to construct algebraic invariants. Okay, so thank you. I finished. Do you have any questions for Valentin? Yes. So if you consider the break. If you consider algebraic invariance, right, then you can compute, well, do counting, compute the Hugo function of the one vertical or just say once more, I did not hear you. So if you can see that just algebraic invariants right, then you can count them and compute Hilbert polynomial one correct function. And you can do similar scoring with differential. Similar scoring is differential invariants. You mean not algebraic, you mean what do you mean? Algebra of invariance or what? Algebra, polynomial algebraics. Ah, you take all okay, you take polynomial algebra, algebra of polynomial invariance. Yes, compute how human function of one or a function. Yeah, and you can do similar story counting differential patterns. Differential variables. And on this slide, you draw some relation. Can you actually observe some relation between this county of functions? Okay, Boya, thanks for this question. Very, very, very smart question. I never thought in this direction. Sorry, I don't know the answer. May maybe later on I will answer this, but just now I don't know. I don't know. It seems that there should be some relation, but it's not so obvious. Can I ask Valentin? You've got a very nice, rich symmetry structure here, and the two types of symmetries commute. Everything works beautifully together, and you've got a lovely result. But do you think that there are other There are other types of group for which this is going to work. Have you had a look at this at all? If you just increase three and consider n-dimensional space, then it's true also. It was very popular paper of Hall on algebraic invariance. There are a lot of discussions there and examples. Uh discussion there in examples. So, but but I pick this whole structure to substitute this horrible integrals in the theory. Yeah, there are some, but it's better to simply to look at the whole paper and see when one obvious place to look is all the different separable coordinate systems. Coordinate systems with lots of relationship. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Go ahead, Robin. Yes, hi. I hope you can you hear me, Valentin? Oh, yeah, but it's problem for me. It's so far from me. Sorry, so I'll try to speak loudly. This is Robert Nelson. I have a question about the algebraic side of things. Side of things. So, did you ever think, for example, to ask questions like if you look at the field over the complexes generated by harmonic polynomials? So the rational field made up of X, Y, and Z is an extension, is a field extension. So did you ever think about whether it's a normal extension and like about the Galois group of that extension? Have you ever thought in that direction? Have you ever thought in that direction? No, I consider this as a customer. I noted this, but I didn't analyze this really, because it was not so much important for me. Yeah, actually, the question I'm really asking. Honestly, I will say that it simply pushed me to consider this type of problems. You know that there is only one quantum system that really can. Quantum systems that really can be described explicitly. This hidden here and atom. And what energy states or is they given by harmonic polynomials? And for me, it was this equation. So we have this energy levels for hit or hand. So, and we have this invariance. So, what really invariance tells us about this is Tell us about this state of hidden art. So, anyway, this is what pushed me in this direction. The rest is just simply, I would say, I'm sorry, this is really on the level of kindergarten. It's nice mathematics, but it's very simple, like mathematics. Okay, thank you. If there's no other question, let's thank Valentin one last time. Yeah, thank you too. Welcome.
