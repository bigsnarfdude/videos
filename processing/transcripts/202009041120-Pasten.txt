By Hector Paston, who's going to speak to us on a Chabouti Coleman bound for hyperbolic surfaces in abelian threefolds. Okay, well, thanks very much, Andrew, for the introduction. And thanks to the organizers for all the work, the effort they put into this virtual conference. It's hard for everyone to get used to this new system of having to meet online, but somehow... Having to meet online, but somehow you guys managed to make it work. So, thank you very much. All right, so let's see. So, let me get started with this. So, just back to the basics, you start with a curve C over Q, smooth, projective. Oh, by the way, I'm not sure if I already confirmed, but I'm okay if you want to record it. It's not a problem for me. Okay, good. I never okay. Good. Going back to this. So you start with this curve, smooth, projective, object at least two, and the Jacobian is going to be J. Well, with this notation, Mordor's conjecture from 22 was that the number of rational points is finite. For the sake of simplicity, my only number for is going to be Q. But of course, if you know this story, you know that things go farther. Now, Chaboti's theorem from 41 is that if the rank of Is that if the rank of the Jacobian is less than the genus of the curve, which by the way, the genus of the curve is the same as the dimension of the Jacobian? Okay, so if you have this inequality, then Mordor's conjecture holds for the curve. And finally, in 83, Faltin's proved Mordor's conjecture. All right. Now, Chavoti's proof is way simpler. Okay, and it's so simple that I can sketch it right here. So, first, you embed the curve into the Jacobian. First, you embed the curve into the Jacobian by choosing a rational point. If you don't have rational points, then you have nothing to prove. So you're just happy. So you assume you have some rational point and map the Jacobian, sorry, you and you map the curve to the Jacobian and choose some auxiliary prime. For this part of the discussion, it's not important what kind of prime. Just fix one prime number. And well, let gamma be the piadic closure of the rational points of the Jacobian. This is going to be a group. It's going to be, in fact, a piadic. Going to be in fact a P-adic Lie subgroup of the Piadic points of the Jacobian. And usually, Piadic Lie groups are not part of the undergrad curriculum, so are not part of the background of every mathematician. But somehow this theory is already classical. You can find it in Burwa Key. So it's a very classical, well-defined object, Piodic Lie groups. All right, and then, well, gamma is a periodic Lie group, but importantly, since it is the closure of something having rank of JQ generators, Rank of JQ generators, the dimension is going to be at most that one. Okay, so we know a priori that the rank condition implies that this piadic least subgroup is a proper piadic least subgroup in the Jacobian. The dimension is strictly smaller. Why is that important? Well, the pi-adic points of your curve cannot be completely contained in this pi-adic Lee-sap group because the curve generates the Jacobian. Okay, that's a classical thing. So it cannot be properly contained in a pi-adic Lee Sap group or any sort of Visa group or any sort of proper subgroup is going to generate everything. And well, from here, one views is that the intersection has to be finite. There is some topological argument, but I never say this is going to be a complete proof. This is just a sketch. And finally, you just note that the rational points of the curve are the same as periodic points of the curve that happen to be rational in the Jacobian. So it's equal to this intersection. But this intersection is, of course, contained in the periodic points of the curve. In the periodic points of the curve, intersected with the periodic Lie group of time by taking the closure of the rational points of the Jacobian. So, here's a picture of what just happened. So, this gamma, I imagine this as a plane because you can linearize your pi-adic Lie group obtained from the Jacobian locally. There is the theory of the pi-adic logarithm and exponential in abelian varieties or piadic Lie groups in general. So, you can linearize and you can just assume that the logarithm. You can just assume that locally looks like this, and then your periodic points of the curve are going to not be contained completely in this subgroup, so they meet somehow. And this is the picture of what just happened in the previous slide. Good. And Coleman had this brilliant idea of reinterpreting the intersection in a different way. So he thought about this intersection as zeros of a suitable p-adic analytic function on the curve. And this happens locally. And this happens locally. Okay, I'm not going into those technicalities yet. So, locally, you think about this intersection as series of some analytic functions, and these analytic functions are obtained by means of Coleman's theory of periodic integration. And at the end, you can actually count how many zeros can you possibly have for these periodic functions, and you get a bound, a concrete closed formula for an upper bound for the number of rational points. So, this is just a dream. So, this is just a dream. Rational points, we are so used to them to be so wild, and then suddenly you have a concrete formula for an upper bound for the number of them. But of course, this is not for free. There is this condition on the rank of the Jacobian. But it turns out that this condition is not too bad. This condition happens quite often. In fact, if you give me a random Jacobian, a random abelian variety of certain dimension, it's not so clear that you would expect high-rank a positive proportion. Expect high rank, a positive proportion of the time in any reasonable way. Okay, so probably rank zero and one happen quite often, maybe up to the dimension happens quite often, but then no reason to believe that's a common phenomenon. So in general, this rank condition when you have a practical problem involving a curve is often satisfied. So not too bad of a condition. Excellent. So Colliman's paper opened a new approach to rational points. A new approach to rational points on curves because it's not just the bound. Okay, the technique of proof for this bound gave a lot of tools for further advancing on the theory of curves, arithmetic of the curves. And one thing is explicit computations. You can actually now put your hands on a curve and compute all of the rational points. Not always, there are a couple of conditions involving the rank, for instance, and the prime has to be not so small. This is important. The prime has to be larger than something. You can improve on this. Stall, actually. improve on this, stall actually improve on this condition on largeness of P. But the run condition is important here. But still, in many cases, you can explicitly compute things. And well, there is progress towards the uniformity conjecture of Caporazo, Harris, and Maser under the Rank condition for the Jacobian. And how you do this? Well, in this formula, everything is uniform except the prime. So if somehow you can manage So, if somehow you can manage to drop this good reduction condition and this largeness condition, well, largeness is not too bad because the genus is going to be fixed in the uniformity conjecture. But if you can somehow drop the condition of good reduction, then you're in business for proving some sort of uniform bound. And that's exactly what they did. And well, there are non-abelian extensions of these ideas pioneered by Neehum Kim. And well, this non-abelian extension. Well, these non-abelian extensions were put in a very concrete and practical form by the people I mentioned here, especially in the case of quadratic Chaboti. So linear Chaboti will be mapping to the Jacobian, and then you have these fundamental groups that give you a non-abelian substitute for the Jacobian, and the quadratic version is somehow the first layer after the Jacobian. And that now is something you can approach by explicit method. It's something you can approach by explicit methods. Not in full generality, because this theory is never in full generality, but in the cases where it works, it works very well. And for instance, one of these spectacular applications you get is the curse curve that probably we all heard about this before, right? So that's really amazing that in this curve, everything goes wrong, but nonetheless, the non-abilentiality works. All right. And well, what about going to? Uh, well, what about going to higher dimensions? By which I mean not taking a curve times itself, the Cartesian product that would be a surface, that's too easy, right? I mean, uh, something that doesn't look like a curve put in the Jacobian, some higher dimensional sub-variety of an abelian variety that's not coming directly from taking curves, right? And well, if you understand what's going on with Chaboti's proof, you can quickly make a heuristic of what should be this rank condition in higher dimensions. Condition in higher dimensions. And well, the natural condition here, if you just write down what the heuristic should be, is that the rank of the abelian variety that you're using as an ambient space plus the dimension of the sub-variety should be at most the dimension of the abelian variety. In this case, you expect to have a chance to prove finiteness, okay? But it doesn't always work because, of course, your X could have, I don't know, some elliptic curve of positive rank sitting inside. Of positive rank sitting inside. So it doesn't all, you don't always expect finiteness here, but at least you have a chance to go through with the ideas. Right, and so far this has been explored in the case of the Jacobian of a curve. And then the sub-variety X is going to be the curve added to itself a couple of times, V times. And essentially, this is the symmetric d power of the curve. Okay, it's not exactly the same. Okay, it's not exactly the same. You have a map from the symmetric disk power to the Jacobian, the addition map, and this is exactly the image. And you can extend the Chavoty method to this setting. And well, if you have never heard about these things, looks like somehow just going a tiny little bit beyond curves. But no, actually, there is a lot of very interesting mathematics going on here. And if you heard Joshua's talk earlier today, you probably know. You probably know already that even amazing applications like modularity of elliptic curves can come out of applications of this Chabotin method for symmetric powers. So, this is really an amazing thing to look at. Okay, so as far as I know, the story started by Work of Classen in 93. He proved a finiteness on a piadic open set of the symmetric power. And then Samir, Six, in 2009, he worked on. 09 He worked over number fields. Okay, so here is important. I mean, here there are technicalities from Q to number field, but Samir, you know, very powerful approach, and he managed to make it work over number fields. And not only that, he gave a practical procedure, not just some finite abstract statement, practical. And if you read the paper, in the same paper, you can find examples where this practical method actually finds all the, I don't know, quadratic points of the curve, for instance, if you look at the symmetric square. Look at the symmetric square. And then Jennifer Park introduced a new idea in this business, which is to use tropical geometry to try to come up with a bound. Okay, so in Jennifer's work, the bound is not of colliment type, it's not explicit, sorry, it's something you can, in principle, compute, and she computed in one case. But unfortunately, this result, as far as I know, is conditional. So you need to assume that there are certain differentials that have some non-degeneracy. That have some non-degeneracy condition from the point of view of tropical geometry. So it's not really working in all cases. But still, this step forward in the direction of trying to get some close formula for an upper bound. All right. So this question is actually kind of tricky. It's not just straightforward to go from curves to higher dimension when it comes to trying to find a bound for the number of rational points. So now I'm going to explain this main result. Explain this main result that I want to mention today. And the situation involves finiteness. I want to give a bound for the number of points of a variety. So I better make sure that there are only finitely many points there. So let me explain a condition that ensures this. And well, a compact complex manifold, you can think about a projective smooth variety over the complex numbers, is going to be a hyperbolic or more precisely. To be a hyperbolic, or more precisely, broadly hyperbolic if every holomorphic map from the complex line into the manifold is constant. And here I really mean holomorphic in the general sense. It's not just algebraic functions. It's not a function for questioning. You are allowed to use transcendental functions here. For instance, elliptic curves are not hyperbolic because you have Biestras functions coming from the complex numbers into your elliptic curve. Numbers into your elliptic curve. In the case of curves, there is a theorem of Picard saying that hyperbolic curves are precisely those of genus at least two. Well, there is Lang's conjecture saying that if you have a hyperbolic variety of whatever dimension, then the number of rational points is going to be finite. And the conjecture actually has nothing to do with Q, it's about number fields and more generality. Okay, but I'm Generality, okay, but I'm sticking with Q just for the sake of simplicity, and this conjecture is proved in a case that's important for us, and it's proved by faultings in the case when X is contained in an abelian variety. If your variety X happens to be living inside an abelian variety, then you have this conjecture. Hyperbolicity implies more doulicity as Lang will. More doulicity, as Lang will say it. Okay, so here's the theorem. The theorem, I should say, this is joint work with Jerson Carlo. Jerson is a PhD student of mine. He's in second year, and this is not supposed to be his thesis. He wanted to learn about abelian varieties. We start to meet weekly to, you know, read about abelian varieties and discuss stuff. And eventually, we end up discovering what I'm going to tell you now. But he's more interested now in trying to work on modularity. To work on modularity stuff for his thesis. Okay, so that's Gier Son Caro. All right, and so here's the theorem. Let me tell you first the ingredients. First, we have an abelian variety of dimension 3 over Q, over Q, I should say, somewhere, okay, of rank 1 over Q. Then I have a smooth projective hyperbolic surface contained in A. Here you see why the rank 1 condition. Here you see why the rank one condition. Rank zero for finateness is you know a question that you should probably address in a different way because rank zero means torsion. And then the problem is how you compute the torsion points in a variety. And there is a lot of literature on that subject. Okay, so I'm not going into that discussion here. But then rank one fits the bill because surface has dimension two, and then the rank is one, and two plus one is three, which is the dimension of the ambient variety. So here the heuristic. Variety. So here the heuristic tells you that if you are attempting to use a p-adic method, rank one is what you should be looking at. And then I have this condition on the prime. The auxiliary prime has to be not too small. Before, in the Coleman bound, not too small means larger than twice the genus. Here it means larger than 15, the first churn number of your surface squared. Okay, I'm going to talk about the churn numbers in a moment, but for the moment, just read this as P. Read this as p is larger than some geometric invariant of the surface. Okay, you can just read it in this way and has to be a prime of good reduction. And there is this additional condition that you don't see in the case of curves, but here happens to occur, which is you want hyperbolic reduction, meaning this quotation marks is not something standard, okay? What you really mean here is that the surface, when you reduce it, mod P, does not contain elliptic curves geometrically. Curves geometrically. Does not contain elliptic curves geometrically. That's what you want to see to get. And it's kind of natural because you see that these Coleman and Chaboti approaches to findness, they reduce your variety mod P and gather information from the reduction mod P. So if your variety mod P looks like it has an elliptic curve, then it's not something I expect that you can gather, find that information from there. So mod P has to look like coming from. So mod P has to look like coming from something that's hyperbolic. This is my view on this condition, okay? But well, it's something that shows up in the proof. So if you have this condition, so the Billy Marietta, the surface, the hyperbolic surface, and the prime is not too small and it's good, then the number of rational points on your surface is at most the number of mod p points plus this additional term, which is Additional term, which is well, this parenthesis may look ugly, but it's just something of size p. And then there is this first churn number. And now I can tell you what the churn number is, in case you haven't seen this before. You take your surface, the first churn class is the divisor class of the canonical divisor, and the first churn number is taking the self-intersection of this. Okay, so for a curve, the first churn class is a canonical divisor, and the first churn number is the Devisor and the first churn number is the degree. And the degree, I'm going to, oh, I'm going to do that later, but the degree is 2g minus 2. And we already saw that number before. And it's going to show up later again. All right. So a corollary that gives you some examples is this one. If you have an abelian variety of dimension 3, an abelian threefold of rank 1, whose endomorphism ring, the geometric one, is Z, and I should say this is. Is Z, and I should say this is the generic scenario. So the generic scenario is that the endomorphism is just Z. And well, there is going to be this set of primes, primes where you have good and absolutely simple reduction, mod P. And for this set of primes, we have the following. For every smooth projective surface in A over Q, and I'm not requiring hyperbolic, just smooth. Not requiring hyperbolic, just smooth projective surface. I don't know, you can apply Bertini or something like that to get plenty of examples like this. And for every prime in here, which is not too small, then you have the bound I mentioned before, the Chavoti column and type of bound. So this set of primes has density one in the primes, and that's where this endomorphism condition comes into the picture. And the condition of hyperbolicity and hyperbolicity are automatically satisfied. You don't have to check. Pear automatically satisfied, you don't have to check them. So, you have plenty of examples here. Is after you have this situation, you don't need to worry anymore about hyperbolicity. And as I mentioned, there are plenty of examples. Why is that? Because, well, this endomorphism condition is generic on the moduli space. And the rank condition, you can expect this to happen a positive proportion of the time. Of course, we don't know that for sure. We know it in the case of elliptic curves, for instance, but it's a very reasonable. For instance, but it's a very reasonable conjecture. So, and you start looking for examples and you quickly find one. For instance, the Jacobian of this hyper-elliptic curve. This Jacobian meets the conditions I'm asking for here. And every surface, every smooth surface in this Jacobian is an example where you can apply this bound. Okay, just to tell you the theorem is non-empty. All right, and Coleman's bound for hyperbolic curves, hyperbolic. For hyperbolic curves, hyperbolic meaning genus at least two, has this form, and our bound has this form. So, what do we see here? The main term and main term in the sense of the Bayl conjectures, this one has size approximately p in general, I would expect from the Bay conjectures. And the error term here is the first churn number of the curve. It's just 2g minus 2, the degree of the canonical device. Well, here you have the number. The number of points of the surface, which again, by the Riemann hypothesis, in the case of varieties of or finite fields, can be expected to be of size p squared. And this error term is going to be of size p times the first churn number of your surface. So it looks very much very similar, but the technique of proof is very different. I'm going to tell you in the next five minutes I have, I'm going to tell you a bit about the technique of proof. And it's quite different. It's quite different. Right, and after you see this, well, one is tempted to make the conjecture. Maybe, in general, if at some point in life somebody manages to prove a very general Chavoti Koleman estimate, maybe it's going to look like this, like counting points mod p as a main term, and then some geometric contribution for the error term. So we have two data points to make a conjecture here. Okay, good. So the sketch of proof. So again, I'll take because. I'll take because of time probably, I'm not going to go through the whole details, but at least I want to give you some sense of what's going on here. So, you take gamma, the closure, the p-adic closure of your rational points in the abelian variety. And again, I need to worry about the periodic points, in this case, the surface meeting this gamma, okay, this V group. Now, the rank is one, so this is going to be a one-parameter subgroup in the sense of analytical. Sense of analytic approach to abedian varieties. And the reduction map gives me a way to cover with open sets, with piodic open sets, everything inside. And here's a picture. So you reduce mod P and a point mod P on the surface gives you a residue disk. And in the residue disk, I want to count how many intersection points I have with this one parameter subgroup and the periodic points of the surface. In this picture, you have three intersection points. In this picture, you have three intersection points on this residue disk. And by the end of the day, I want to add over all possible choices of X mod P. And when you add everything, then you have a global bound on how many points you have for the global intersection here. So you parametrize your analytic one-parameter subgroup, and it's going to give you some power series in terms of local parameters. And when you take a Parameters and when you take a local equation for your surface and you compose, now you see that the intersection, at least locally, is going to be bounded by the number of zeros of this composition. And this composition is some pi-adic power series, and working with the explicit description of the exponential map for your abelian variety, one can control the size of the coefficients of this power series. You have to work out a theory of one-parameter pi-adic subgroups. P-iadic subgroups. I mean, that's very classical over the complex numbers, but over the p-iadics, you just follow your nose and write down the theory, okay? So, p-adic analysis tells you that since you can control the size of the coefficient, you only need to show there's going to be some index n not to be for which the nth coefficient is not too small. So let me say large. And in fact, bigger than or equal to one will do it. But this is really, really hard. But this is really, really hard. And in fact, this is the whole point of the proof. Okay, this is where you actually have to work. And the method that exists, at least we tried, and they don't seem to tell you anything here to produce such a coefficient. And the idea is to use this omega integrality that I'm not going to read here because Natalia already explained this yesterday in her talk, but you can think about this as an algebraic approach to ODEs. So an algebraic version of ODEs. version of all the is and this is really useful for hypervolicity over the complex numbers as natalia mentioned yesterday and we're going to use this in positive characteristic for non-preduced schemes so analytic intuition over the complex numbers actually is not really helpful here it's dangerous but natalia in her thesis in 2015 worked out a purely algebraic very explicit theory of omega integrality and that's really useful for us okay so you take So, you take two differentials, and I know I'm kind of very soon running out of time, but let me just go quickly over this. So, you take two differentials independent, and you can choose them to kill your one-parameter subgroup, okay? Because dimension one for the one-parameter subgroup, dimension three for the ambient variety, so there are these two differentials, and you can somehow truncate your one-parameter subgroup, and the truncation. subgroup and the truncation gives you a closing version of this fat point okay this infinitesimal one parameter subgroup but this infinitesimal one parameter subgroup still killed by the differentials and you can reduce everything mod p because you were careful to truncate before getting to p in the degree you can reduce mod p all right so you have f your local equation and the key observation and happy i can mention this the key observation is that the composition will have piety That the composition will have piadically small coefficients. That means that when you reduce mob p, those coefficients actually are zero, so it means that the truncation composed with f vanishes. Okay, so you actually are landing into the surface mod P, not just the Belium variety mod P. Okay, so you restrict the differentials, these two differentials that kill the one parameter SAC group, and you have this property that you have two differentials on a surface and On a surface, and somehow they have a common solution, this one disclosed immersion. But that's over-determined, it's an over-determined ODE. You don't expect solutions for that. So, this should give you a bound on the order of the infinitesimal solution. And we work out a bound, an over-determined bound, depending on the geometry of this divisor, which, by the way, is not clear exists because it's not clear this wedge is non-zero. You need some sort of weak latches property and characteristic. Left chess property in characteristic p, which is hard to prove, but you prove it, okay? But you get a bound in terms of the geometry of this divisor, okay. And well, you put things together, and the number of points was bounded locally by the number of zeros, which periodic analysis tells you you can bound in terms of this order of an over-determined solution. All right, so we apply our methods, and uh, and well, the important part here is that since the bound, whatever it is, Part here is that since the bound, whatever it is, I didn't want to write it down because it's ugly, but the bound depends on the geometry of this divisor. And this divisor is a canonical divisor because it's the divisor of a wedge of two differentials on a surface. So you end up getting a bound in terms of the canonical divisor of your surface. Okay, so if your point happens to be on the support of the divisor, then the bound is as good as it could possibly be, and you get just one point in the residue disk. Point in the residue disk if it's not in the support of the device. But if it is in the support of the device, so life is really complicated. You need to use the Riemann hypothesis in the singular case, some intersection theory computation, you need to control singularities, more weak lectures type properties, and there is a lot of work to be done. But at the end of the day, you can apply this bound. And as I mentioned before, the bound depends at the end on the geometry of this canonical divisor. Geometry of this canonical divisor. And that's why, in the second case, you see a contribution of the first churn number. Okay. And at the end, you just put things together in this way. If you are away from the divisor, you get at most one intersection. And that contributes like a counting function. You just count points mod T. But in this lower dimensional part, the divisor D coming from the wedge of the two differentials, you can get more points in the intersection, but you can add globally and you get this. Globally, and you get this other contribution, which is actually the difficult part when you bound these things. But yes, so this is all I wanted to say. I hope at least I managed to transmit the idea of the proof. And before we go to questions, I just want to thank once again to the organizers. I'm the last speaker, so I guess it's my duty to thank all of them for this wonderful job organizing this virtual conference. So, thank you. Conference. So, thank you. Thank you. Wonderful talk, Hector. And you hit your timing on the nose. Well done. So we have time for questions. I have a couple of questions.
