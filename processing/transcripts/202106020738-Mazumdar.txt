Okay, so can you see my screen? Oh, yep, looks good. Thanks, thank you very much. Okay, so let me thank first of all all the organizers for organizing this wonderful workshop. And so yes, it's true that we are talking about certain foundations of field theory, gravity, and quantum mechanics. But deep inside my heart, something tells me that whatever our endeavor is today, will have to be a very important thing. Endeavor is today will have a huge impact for humanity in the future in various different ways in different applications. So, with this, I would like to emphasize that I would like to present the story that how would I witness graviton in a lab? And the question I'm asking is: Is graviton classical or quantum? And here we have got a cheshar cat, gravity is cheshar cat where this is this picture of a graviton, these are the two. Picture of a graviton. These are the two key papers. And the take-home message will be that you see that this is a string, which is an unknotted string. And this is a string, the same color, similar color strings, which is highly knotted. And the question is, how do I go interplay between one to the other? And what does this mean to us? Between unknotted versus knotted strings. So let me introduce you to my collaborator. So, let me introduce you to my collaborator, which I think Sogato already did, and Gavin also did. So, Gavin already spoke about it, and Sogato is one of my long-term collaborators with whom I have been discussing these ideas for almost 10 years now. And Ryan is one of our grad students, and Marco is a postdoc, and Jules is another master's student, and Ron is one of our key collaborators in this game from Israel, and as well, Gavin. Gavin. So it's kind of like an international effort, I would say. It talks about quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses. So, plan of my talk. So the question is very simple. Is graviton alive plus dead or not? What do I mean by graviton? Does it have a mass? How many degrees of freedom does it have? Can I test it in a laboratory? All these kinds of questions I'm asking. And then what is it? And then, what is the classical versus quantum divide? Because this question always hounds us: what do I mean by classical? When it becomes quantum, when does the system become classical? And then I think already Sugato already mentioned about the QGEM protocol. So I'll briefly mention it and some of the challenges ahead of us. So it's a huge endeavor, huge challenges we have, but the push should always be there from us to understand the nature of graph. The nature of gravity. So, the question is: We always ask who mediates the force. So, this is an old question way back from the days of Galileo from Newton. Actually, Newton, if you think about it, he assumed it. He did not prove it. Because Hook would try to attempt to address the problem by various different ways, by bringing in the concept of strings and also get on to an experiment. And if you think about it a little bit deeper. And if you think about it a little bit deeply, actually, it was Maxwell who initiated the program. He gave the concept of field for the first time. And Einstein framed it in the context of space-time. It took some time for Feynman also to come in and solve the problem. And it will take perhaps another 100 or 200 years to show exactly how it mediates in a laboratory because it's extremely, extremely weak interaction. So let's go from basic quantum mechanics to quantum field theory, something which we all understand. So let's be on the same page. So in quantum mechanics, we always talk about various different paths, going from point A to point B in space-time, sum over all possible paths, and then with help of Dirac's trick, we can express it in a very neat way in terms of Lagrangian density. So these things we have seen it already many, many times in our textbook. From quantum mechanics to fields, also we have. Mechanics to fields, also, we understand it very well. There are, you are talking not just quantizing one harmonic oscillator, the infinitely many harmonic oscillator. One of the quantities which is very important is to vacuum to vacuum transition. And here the field could be anything. It could be spin zero, spin half, spin one, you know, spin three, half, spin two, whatever spin you want to discuss, you can discuss in this framework. One of the things which is very important. One of the things which is very important for us is that we talk about in field theories the transition in presence of conserved currents. So, when I say conserved, I mean satisfying Noider's conserved currents. So, imagine for the time being that I have got Alice on one hand, Bob got on another hand. They're separated by a distance. Alice, everything is conserved. She's talking about conserved currents. Similarly, Bob is talking about conserved currents. Whatever the current is. Currents, whatever the current is, it could be interaction due to electromagnetism, interaction due to spin to or higher spin, doesn't really matter. The framework remains the same. And if you want to understand this transition from one vacuum to another vacuum or excited vacuum or excited state, let's say, then I can talk about in a path integrator for Malism. So I have got Alice on one hand, Bob got another hand, and this is nothing but my propagator. My propagator. So, what are the properties of a propagator? So, a propagator is a time-ordered causal Feynman propagator. This is the propagator which I'm dealing with here. Some of the properties that is embedded within the light cone structure. We are not talking anything which goes beyond the light cone. So that's one essential aspect. The second essential aspect is not instantaneous. It's not instantaneous action at a distance, and it does not satisfy the classical. Satisfy the classical equations of motion. This propagator does not have to satisfy the classical equations of motion. And it is well within my uncertainty-time relation, energy-uncertainty-time relationship. So, the question, let's go back before even we touch upon gravity. We ask the question, what are the degrees of freedom even photon has? So, photon is a spin one, spin-zero system. So, any vector, so mu, So any vector, so A mu can be recast in terms of transverse degree of freedom as well as longitudinal degree of freedom. So both the degrees you can think about. Transverse degree essentially has three spin one degree of freedom. You can convert that into spin one and spin zero, spin two degrees of freedom, essentially. These are the propagating degrees of freedom you can think about. And the longitudinal component is essentially a spin zero degree of freedom. Now, if I don't have a so Now, if I don't have a source, if I'm talking about just the propagation of a plane wave on shell photons without any source term, when I solve, essentially I have two degrees of freedom because actually what is propagating is a transverse photon, but there is one gauge condition which can be seen very easily in a Coulomb gauge, and that reduces to effectively two degrees of freedom. And these two degrees of freedom are nothing but two helicity states of photon. But whenever the source comes into the game, because we are always dealing with the source, in the case of Q V D, it will be electron, positron, charged particles, or similarly W or Z boson electroweak interaction, or in the case of gravity, I'll come back, come to the point in the next slide. So in the presence of a source, so what is important is that is the scattering diagram or the scattering matrix when you compute any diagram, what Of any diagram, what enters is your conserved current? So imagine you have got Alice here, you have got Bob here, Alice has a conserved current, Bob has a conserved current in between is your propagator, and this propagator, you can show that it has more degrees of freedom than your on-shell propagating degrees of freedom. It has the transverse component, which is the spin one, which is three degrees of freedom. Okay, now this very Now, in this very similar way, you can talk about gravity. So, what is graviton in some sense? So, graviton is, of course, a hypothetical particle. We have never seen it in any laboratory. We believe that it should exist. It has massless, fairly massless. It can also have mass as well. And depending on massless, being massless or massive, it can have different degrees of freedom, different propagating degrees of freedom. So, any tensor component, Hmu, so this is a tiny perturbation over my milk. Is a tiny perturbation over my Minkowski space-time, and this tiny perturbation in principle I can quantize. And this is what we want to quantize at the end of the day. It can be decomposed into transverse phraseless component, vector component, and scalar component. And this is the most generic decomposition you can think about in any space-time background. Let it be Minkowski, Desiter, Anti-Desiter, or any space-time background where you can have a support of a Fourier transform. Support of a Fourier transformation, you can do the calculation, do the maths. And even if you don't have Fourier decomposition, then there are subtleties which I think goes into slightly beyond the talk, but maybe one can discuss later. Anyway, so as I said, that any tensor can be decomposed into transverse traces component. So these are the transverse straces component, which we have seen it in many, many different places. And this is essentially gives rise. And this is essentially gives rise to the plane waves of gravitational waves, which we have seen it already in LIGO, Virgo, and in future we'll see it in many different contexts. And so out of the 10 degrees of freedom, you can show that they take away four and another four degrees of freedom are taken away by your diffeomorphism invariance. That leaves only two polarization states, which are H plus and H cross polarization states of your gravitational waves. So you can take two masses, couple Take two masses coupled with a spring. If you allow it to vibrate, it will emit gravitational waves because what you need is a quadruple moment, time-dependent quadruple moment. But the same graviton, when you talk in terms of a, in presence of a source, in presence of two sources, and you want to understand how they are interacting between each other, you have to talk about slightly different degrees of freedom. Because here, what I'm interested in, again, is a quantity which is a sandwich between two cones. Con sandwich between two conserved currents in the context of gravity and the two-energy momentum tensor, which are conserved, both satisfy your Nerders current. So conservation of energy momentum tensor holds here and here, and in between this is a saturated or sandwiched propagator. Sometimes in field theory, it's called sandwiched propagator. And this, if you look into it, it has essentially the spin two degree of freedom plus spin zero degree of freedom propagates in between these two. Propagates in between these two space-time points. So, total five plus one, six degrees of freedom. And this is nothing but your essentially, you can construct a S matrix. It's nothing but an amplitude diagram, Feynman diagram. You can compute the amplitude. You can compute the covariant transition amplitude. And in terms of Mandarstam variable, you can express this in terms of ST and U variables. And if you take the non-relativistic limit, And if you take the non-relativistic limit, you can derive a potential which is at the leading order is gm m1 m2 divided by r. And so what is the graviton in this context? The graviton in this context is your the transverse traceless component and the spin zero component, which enters here in the propagator. And not only that, I mean, we have a machinery, people have derived higher-order contributions. High-order contributions, one of the best reviews, one of the best works done in this context by Donaghiu and many of his colleagues. And it is a huge industry, people compute it in various different ways from amplitude methods, from various different ways. Now it has been computed by various different groups in the world. So the leading order for a static source, you get this gm over R, then you get GM square, and then you see that H bar correction comes in. But keep in mind that when comes in, but keep in mind that when you get the H bar correction, you also get a suppression one over R2. I know that many of our colleagues in this community, they end up trying to, well, they force themselves to get a H bar effect much earlier here, but essentially those papers are not quite right. Because whatever you do at the level of quantum field theory, you can take that non-relativistic limit and you should be able to get exactly the same similar. You know, similar terms, what you had derived in your quantum field theory, and take the non-relativistic limit correctly. So, these are the terms, and these are very well-known terms. And beyond these terms, also you can compute, and people have computed, these are post-Newtonian corrections, and it has been computed now to even higher levels, six post-Newtonian corrections. Not only for static, you can do it for rotating source as well. And very similar structure remains except that you have the G0I component and the angular momentum, the spin. And the angle, the angular momentum, the spin comes in, and this is the H-bar correction again comes in. But in the case of rotating part, the suppression is even more in terms of distance. One over R5. And as I said, that not only when I'm talking about these degrees of freedom, not only massless graviton, you can even test massive graviton, you can test even various forms of gravity. I mean, because I think Rob has been asking this question, which is a wonderful question. Been asking this question, which is a wonderful question. To be honest, we don't know below micrometer distances. There's no test of classical gravity, man. So, you open up the entire door for yourself, for any experiment which we want to do. So, you can test even wild gravity, you can test F of R theory of gravity, non-local gravity, all sorts of gravity you can test it in this form. I will not, I mean, if you can discuss that later after my talk, but I'm not delving too much into that. I'm not delving too much into that right now, just as an advertisement essay. Now, let me come to the second part of my talk, which is what is a classical versus quantum divide? Now, in a lab, you can take a photon, you can isolate it, a photon in an electromagnet chamber, you can do that. So, you have one photon versus many, many photons. So, as soon as you go from this NP number of photons to be much, much larger, it becomes very hard. It becomes very hard to extract the quantum behavior. If one photon fluctuates, you can immediately see its effect. But if you had billions and billions of photons in a cavity, it's very hard to extract its quantum property. In the same way as H bar going to zero makes our life extremely hard. It's not that the system is not quantum. System is quantum, but it is very hard to extract any quantum property. So what should be the divide? So in terms of number, you can say the divide is. terms of number you can say the divide is roughly this order one or order you know roughly order order one in the case of photon the question you can ask can you divide such a divide for the graviton so yes it is possible because you know the interaction this is the universal interaction between matter and graviton h v nu t mu and you can look go back to the non-relativistic limit you go to the fermi normal coordinate system and you treat matter and graviton And you treat matter and gravity on a par. Both. I mean, we are doing the linearized quantum gravity, nothing beyond that. We are not talking about really non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity or anything like that. Just within relative, I mean, linearized formulation of quantum gravity, you can do this exercise. You know the interaction from your Lagrangian. And if you trace out, so this is your system. You have got matter in your graviton. If you trace out all the matter degrees of freedom, it's the equivalence principle. It's the equivalence principle which highlights that this is the interaction. It comes with x squared. In the limit when x goes to zero, this interaction also goes to zero. Now, if you trace out this matter, the matter lives in this essentially this x square part. So, and you're treating both x as well as your graviton, both at a quantum level. What you find is that the graviton states get displaced. So, it becomes like a displaced coherent state. And we know the And we know the properties of displaced coherent state. The number, we know. The number is roughly given by gm square. And the fluctuation is one over square root of ng. So in the limit when ng is much, much bigger than one, the fluctuations are very, very tiny. Surprisingly, this quantity gm squared is also nothing but given by area over g, the famous Bekenstein's formula, which derived way back in 1983. And essentially, this connects the number of gravitons to the Bekenstein's entropy. But I mean, in a way, it has a completely different story. You can talk about the classicalization of a black hole, which many people have been talking about, including Giaduvali and many others are talking about. But I will not go into that. And if anyone is interested, I will be happy to tell later. But for the timing, the divide comes in from here. If M is roughly of the order of M Planck, this number of gravitons is roughly one. This number of gravitons is roughly one. But of course, you cannot trap the graviton. What traps the graviton self-gravitating system is its own Schwarzschild radius. So, in the limit when M is much bigger than M Planck, like Schwarzschild, I mean astrophysical black holes, the number of gravitons is way too large in such a system. But the divide is roughly comes in when I'm dealing with a system which is 10 raised to minus 5 grams. And if I'm dealing with a system which is less than 10 raised to minus 5 grams, those are even more interesting systems. Those are even more interesting systems because the number of gravitons becomes so small that effectively those space-times in this region becomes highly quantum. So creating this quantum device with such mass is perhaps the way to understand some aspects of quantum gravity, not maybe the fully fledged non-perturbative quantum gravity. And we don't know whether the non-perturbative formulation is correct or not. We still don't know because there's no experiment, but at least this kind of system. At least this kind of systems which I'm dealing with can give me some insight about some quantum nature of gravity. So let's go back one more further, one step backward and ask, how did we discover Higgs at LHC? So it's the same principle. We took two proton beams, imagine that one side is Alice, the other side is Bob. We have brought them together, we have collided them. And in the process of collision, what happened is that we excited the Higgs. Higgs was the intermediate. The Higgs Higgs was an intermittent state, exactly like your sandwich between two conserved currents. It's your propagator, and when the Higgs effectively decays into photons, this is one of the channels, by the way. There is another channel which is decayed, the four lepton decays. So the Atlas and CMS have seen both these events. So this is as your witness. Sorry? Just five minutes. Okay. Thanks. So in a very similar way, So, in a very similar way, we are also dealing with gravity. So, graviton is your propagator and you are constructing your S matrix. Okay. And the question is, what's going to be the witness? The witness will be the spin, the helicity states. So, the helicity states, which I'm embedding, which Saurgata already talked about, is embedding the spin in your macroscopic system. And if I count the helicity states in your S matrix, I can find out. I can find out how the system is behaving. So, this is what is the core of this entire perception: that how the dynamics leads from untangled to a tangled state. And that gives rise to an entanglement witness. And this is something which Savata had already shown. So, you take a diamond kind of system, diamond, because the density is very high. You can replace with a diamond by silica or some other material. Or some other material, you embed a spin, and you then bring the two systems exactly at your proton-proton beam within your light cone and try to collide them. And in the process of this collision, you are exchanging the graviton, and this is what you are entangling. So entanglement in states due to the states are essentially the spin states, the helicity states. And this, you can compute it. This is S matrix diagram. You can compute the S matrix. Compute the S-matrix elements or the amplitudes. And since there are two spin states, so you can create all possibilities: up, up, down, down, up, down, as well as down-up possibilities. So, these are the two, all four possibilities. And you can compute them. So, this is something which is a very simple scattering diagram. You can compute it. And you can compute in the relativistic limit, in the non-relativistic limit, you can compute something called concurrence. And in information theory, concurrency. And in information theory, concurrency is a very important way to understand entanglement. So, Savata talked about entangled witness. You can also look into concurrence and you can figure out whether the system is entangled or not. Since in my calculations so far, I've been treating it exactly like a quantum field theory treatment. I was giving the graviton as similar to my Higgs boson. I find that the system in the process of scattering is really entangled. But this is theory. How do I test it? This is theory. How do I test it? And this is the place where this testing comes in, as Saugato was telling us a few minutes ago: that you take a diamond-like system, you embed a spin inside, there's a nitrogen vacancy, something which Gavin pointed out. You know the full Hamiltonian for the system. The spin will behave in external magnetic field. It will respond to that. And the process, it will create a Stern Galach apparatus. Schrodinger cat state. And recently, with our coach. And recently, with our colleagues from Israel, with Ron Fondan's group, they have created, they are the experimentalists, they have created a one full loop of this interferometer, even creating that itself with a mass which is 10 raised to minus 20 gram, nowhere close to what Savatu was talking about, 10 raised to minus 14. So, way too less, but nevertheless, these are the first kind of experiments we need to do in order to really push the To do in order to really push the technology frontier. So, Saogada talked about this entanglement witness. And in this particular witness, you can actually show again whether if this witness is less than zero, trace of W times rho, the density matrix, then you can show that these two states, Alice and Bob's, are entangled. And if it's entangled, this is the way you verify this graviton which you have exchanged is quantum in nature or not. And he talked about LOQC, so I will not talk about it. About LOQC, so I will not talk about it. He spoke about a little bit about the Casimir, and I think Rob had asked this question, which is very beautiful because even Casimir, so this is your Casimir interaction, dipole-dipole electromagnetic interaction, which is the leading order interaction in our case. Because every system you pick up, diamonds, silica, whatever, aluminum, doesn't matter. It always has some dielectric properties. Dielectric property means you are dealing with the dipole system. They are exchanged with photons. And this diagram, this is a And this diagram, this is a Feynman diagram between Casimi's old calculation, which Casimi did way back in the 1930s. You can compute this diagram via Feynman's approach. And this actually turns out to be one of our biggest enemy. So if you want that the gravity-induced phase or the entanglement phase dominates over the Casimir Portland phase, these are the requirements which Saugato already pointed out: roughly around 200 micron separation, 100 micron superposition. Separation 100 micron superposition and with a mass roughly 10 raised to minus 11 gram. It's indeed a very daunting task. It's no way it's easy to create such heavy superposition states in a laboratory. As Sogato pointed out, there are many sources of decoherences. Even a photon can decohere, emission, absorption, everything can decohere the system and will collapse the system, this system to effectively behaving like a classical system. system i i'm i i i i i'm not talking about the graviton uh decoherence someone can ask me later on but it's uh not so interesting because lifetime for such a system is extremely extremely long just from graviton decoherence so let me come to a few of the points which so gatho did not cover is that there is a way to even mirror the casimir if you insert a conducting plate because electromagnetic interactions can be streamed Because electromagnetic interactions can be screened, but the gravity cannot be screened. So you're still entangling system one and two due to gravity, but you can screen the electromagnetic interactions. So some of the computations have been done, but there are many, many challenges. The diamond can have surface defects, can have patch potentials, and many issues. So it has to be dealt step by step. And as Sogato pointed out towards the end, one of the for any gravity experiment. The for any gravity experiment, if you want to do, even for LIGO, gravity itself is your enemy. If a butterfly passes by me, that will induce the phase, classical phase. If the lake Geneva changes its depth, it will affect my gravitational phase. These are the cow phase, the Kohla over Hauser Werner phase, essentially. And everything, so including jerk, car, plane, motion, continuous motion, seismic noise, snakes rattling through your, you know. Snakes rattling through your, you know, in next to your experiment, all these things will disturb your experiment. So you need to preserve this. You need to get rid of it, essentially. But the point is you cannot get rid of the random noise. So the best way we think is to you need to go to underground because seismic noise is low. And mind it, even LIGO does the same. It goes underground to perform the experiment. You need to have a chamber. Muno at the end of the day, maybe this design will change. Knows at the end of the day, maybe this design will change. You require maybe the Russian doll kind of setup that you have a capsule, and inside the capsule, and inside the capsule, you try to isolate the real experiment. So these experiments are going to be extremely, extremely daunting. Creating large macroscopic superposition itself is very daunting, very difficult task. But recently, we have coming to an end. To coming to an end, so these are the challenges, and um, so let me come to the point that yes, this is an interesting protocol which can detect many things. So far, I have talked about gravity, but you can talk about fifth force, axion, hidden sector, foundations aspects, foundation of quantum field theory, quantum mechanics. And as I said, that we will need a big facility. We need an international effort. One person's lab, two people's lab cannot do this job. Two people's lab cannot do this job. You need a big facility, we need big effort, we need to build a consortium to bring like-minded people with us. So, with this, let me thank all of you for your kind attention. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you, Anirbaum. Maybe we have time. We're about five minutes behind, so maybe we can have one quick question and then go to the break, or maybe two if there's a really pressing one. Do you see any hands? And of course, we can come back to these questions in the discussion session. Back to these questions in the discussion sessions, there'll be plenty of time to address them. Maybe I can just ask one thing that really excited me in your talk was that you can rule out f of our gravity along the way here. Like, so I always imagine doing this in cosmological settings, but you can actually maybe on the Earth or something. That's not that we can rule out f of our gravity, but we can put a type of constraint. We can put some constraints on the nature, on the action which you can write in. The nature on the action which you can write in, you can put constraints because I think the Rob was pressing this question. It's a very beautiful question because roughly at the micron scale, we have no, even classical gravity, we have no direct test. Indirectly, you do have tests from LSC. And they put a constraint on because the fact that you have not seen large extra dimensions and Kaluza client gravitons, they put the scale of roughly one-tenth or one hundredth of a proton size, which is roughly 10 to minus 17 centimeters. But it's an indirect test. But it's an indirect test. Directly, we still don't have any tests. So it's very important that how the short nature of gravity works. If there is a massive gravity, if there are new degrees of freedom, how can you test these things? So it really does the morphology of a graviton, essentially. Yeah, you know, it's exciting. It's exciting. Okay, so maybe we can save the rest of the questions for the discussion session. And we'll, I think, Flaminia just posted the link to Gather Town, so we can go there and we'll resume at 10 after the, well, that's three minutes. 10 after the well, that's three minutes. Did you want to? Did you want to do five more minutes?
