Thank you very much for this kind invitation. It should be even nicer if I could have been in person in Hangshu, a wonderful place. So the first slide, please. So this talk is about gas dynamics. And here you see the equations that you know. Equations that you know very well. Mind that throughout this talk, the domain will always be the entire space RD. Things can be done in bounded domains, but they are more technical and less interesting. Here, the mass density is rho, the fluid velocity u, sigma is the stress tensor, and Tensor and epsilon is the specific internal energy, and Q is the heat flux. Of course, the basic estimates are that the total mass is preserved, and at least for admissible solutions, the total mechanical energy is bounded by the energy at initial time. That is not very much important if we consider. Much important. If we consider, for instance, solutions that have been presented by Edward yesterday, instead of considering the initial total energy E0, we could just take an upper bound of mechanical energy, an upper bound with respect to time. Next slide. Please. So the context is that the Context is that the flows are in the whole domain Rd. The initial data are denoted with subscripts zero, and the total mass and total energy are finite. Now, the stress tensor is always a symmetric tensor, and this comes from the invariance under the orthogonal group. And this symmetry is equivalent to the conservation. To the conservation of angular momentum. So, in the case of Euler equation, the stress tensor is just the opposite of the pressure times the identity matrix, where the pressure is a non-negative quantity. And for the Nabi-Stokes equation, we must also take in account the symmetric part of the Jacobian velocity. Next slide, please. The theory that I shall present applies also to kinetic models, such as the Boltzmann equation, in which you have in the left side of the equation a pure transport operator and in the right side the interaction term. I am not much interested in the details of the Boltzmann equation. What is important here is that it implies. Is that it implies, at least formally, the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. For instance, if you consider the zero-order moment rho and the first-order moment M with respect to the kinetic variable Xi, then they satisfy the conservation of mass dt rho plus divergence m equals zero, from which we derive again the conservation of the total mass capital M. The theory applies also to Vlasov's time equations, in which now instead of the interaction term, you have a force applying to the particles, which is modeled by this capital F dot gradient X C, where capital F is a self-induced force for the field. Next slide, please. So the goal of this. So, the goal of this talk is to present new natural estimates, what means new and what means natural estimates. So, natural means that they will involve only the total mass and energy, and possibly also the moment of inertia. Mind that this is not a conserved quantity. And these estimates are new in the sense that they look like New in the sense that they look like Stricard's inequalities, that is, integrals in both space and time variables. And these inequalities express some gain of integrability. And for instance, the first inequality I got is the following one: that the space integral of this strange quantity, the pressure times the The pressure times the d root of the density, mass density, is bounded in terms of the total mass and total energy. Recall that this diff root refers to the space dimension D. And of course, this inequality is valid up to a universal constant. By universal, I mean that it depends only upon the space dimension. And this universal constant is not that big. You may think about 10, for instance. Next slide, please. So to do so, I shall exploit the symmetric structure of the mass-momentum conservation laws. Here, I do not use directly the conservation or the decay of energy, but only the conservation. But only the conservation of mass and momentum. For instance, when you write dtœÅ plus divergence rho u equals zero, it is the same as saying that the field with components rho and rho u is divergence free in space and time. And likewise, the conservation of momentum is written in divergence form. Divergence form. So you may recast the conservation laws of mass and momentum as the divergence of some tensor equals zero. So this tensor A is divergence free. And what is amazing at first sight is that this tensor is symmetric. For instance, you have rho u in the top left, top right, and rho u in the right left. Top right and row U in the bottom left, and the block at the bottom right is symmetric too. Well, this is a differential information and usually we use differential information, for instance, in order to get regularity results. But regularity results derive from elliptic properties. Derive from elliptic properties of the differential operator. And here that is not the case. The divergence operator is not an elliptic differential operator. Its characteristic cone is made of these symmetric matrices whose determinant equals zero. And therefore, this characteristic cone is non-trivial. This is why, of course, these continuities may occur in Euler system. Euler system since A does not need to be regular, it does not need to be continuous, for instance. A slightly better situation occurs if we assume that the tensor is positive semi-definite. And this is because the characteristic cone of the differential operator does not intersect the interior of the cone of positive. Positive semi-definite matrices. So, these continuities still occur, but you cannot get regularity result, but what you can get is an improved integrability. So, improved integrability could happen, and this is why this theory is called compensated integrability. Next slide, please. So, what is this theory? This is an abstract slide. So, in this slide, we have an open domain in some domain Rn, in some space Rn. Later on, I shall set n equals one plus D, one for the time variable and D for the space variable. And X will represent the And x will represent both variables. So, a symmetric tensor in the domain capital U is an n by n symmetric matrix whose entries are distributions over this domain. And the divergence is computed row wise. And therefore, the divergence of L is a vector field. Now, a naive remark, which is well known, is that if Which is well known, is that if the tensor is positive somehow indefinite, then the entries must be Radon measures. It is exactly like saying that a non-negative distribution is a Radon measure. So this gives rise to the second definition that the tensor is divergence BV if each entry is a finite measure. Is a finite measure as well as each coordinate of the divergence of A. Next slide, please. Now, if we have a divergent B V tensor over some domain U whose boundary is Lipschitz, then we may define, of course, a normal. We may define, of course, a normal trace. This is as usual through the green formula. So, here is the duality, the duality formula. And you get a trace which is some distribution, some vector-value distribution on the boundary. And this distribution is of order minus one at worst. Of course, A is of order zero. Is of order zero because the entries are rado measures, but the normal trace can be of order minus one at worst. The important remark is that the extension by zero of this tensor, so now the extension is defined on the whole space Rn, this extension is still This extension is still div B V if and only if not only A is B V, but also its normal trace is a finite measure over the boundary. And then the total mass of the divergence of the extension is just the sum of total mass of the divergence of A and the total mass of its normal trace. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. So let me give you two examples of divergence-free tensors. Of course, divergence free means divergence A equals zero. They are illuminating and therefore they help to explain what is going on in the theory. So the first one is rather trivial. You consider a diagonal tensor in which the diagonal The diagonal entry is a function fj, and the tensor is d free if and only if fj does not depend on xj of on the jth space variable. Because when you take the divergence of a, you just take the jth derivative of fj. And then we shall see that compensated integrability is reminiscent to the well-known Gallier. Reminiscent to the well-known Galiardo inequality, which tells you that when you make the product of all these functions fj, so mind that fj depends only on n minus one space variable, but f now depends on the whole n space variables. Then on the n-dimensional domain U, F is. F is L1, provided that each Fj is Ln minus 1 on the projections UJ of the domain. Next slide, please. So the other example is given by the class of so-called special tensors, which are constructed that way. You start from a function on the domain U. On the domain U, I call it a potential, the potential of a special tensor. You form the Hessian matrix of theta, and then you take the cofactor matrix. And then it is a consequence of Peula identity that this tensor is divergence-free. If, in addition, theta is a convex function, then A will be positive semi-definite. Definite. Remark that in two space dimensions, every divergence free tensor is special, but this fact is deadly false in higher space dimension. And an important point also is the formula, which has nothing to do with PDEs. Of course, it is purely algebraic that the determinant That the determinant of the cofactor matrix is the n minus one power of the determinant of the matrix. So I shall use that later on. Next slide, please. Before entering the theory of compensated integrability, I want to convince you that such symmetric divergence-free or divergence B V tensors are ubiquitous. Are ubiquitous in mathematical physics, and therefore it is important to study them. So, the second example is given by relativistic gas dynamics. So, here it is special relativity. Mind that, contrary to the classical gas dynamics, the first equation taken in account is not the conservation of mass, it is the conservation of energy. Conservation of energy, but the rest is the conservation of momentum. Of course, these equations do okay look a bit ugly, but when you write them as a divergence-free tensor, you observe easily that the tensor is symmetric. Next slide, please. And that this tensor is positive semi-definite. And the third example is. And the third example is given by the Maxwell system of electromagnetism in the vacuum. The electromagnetic field is represented by a closed, by a differential form of degree two, which is closed. So the electric field and the magnetic field are given by the coordinates of these two forms. Of these two forms. The closedness expresses the gaussfarade law, dtb plus kernel E equals zero and divergence b equals zero. And besides B and E, there are two other fields which are called the electric induction D and the magnetic induction H. And they are given in terms of a Lagrangian density L, which is a function. Which is a function of the electromagnetic field. So D is the dual quantity to E, and H is minus the dual quantity to B. Next slide, please. And with all these fields, we find that there is a divergence-free energy-momentum tensor, which means that there is a conservation of There is a conservation of electromagnetic energy, which is known as the pointing identity. And there is a conservation of electromagnetic momentum. And when you write them, you obtain a divergence-free tensor, which is presented here, which is not obviously symmetric, but it turns out to be exactly because the Lagrangian density. The Lagrangian density is Lorentz invariant. That is, it depends only on two scalar quantities that are the scalar product between A and B and B square minus C square. Here I have assumed that the light speed equals one. And the fact that the divergence A is zero. A is zero follows from an application of Nutter's theorem using the fact that all the system is Lorentz invariant. Next slide, please. So let us come back to the theory of compensated integrability. So we are interested in tensors, capital A, which belong to a space which I Which I denote BV Div, that is the space of Div B V tensors. So these tensors are symmetric. The entries are radomas with finite mass and the same for the coordinates of the divergence of the tensor. So this space mimics the B V space, of course, except that. Except that instead of functions, I have tensors, and instead of a gradient operator, I have a raw wise divergence. Now, for the B V space, we know of an injection, the Galliardo-Nironbert Sobolev embedding, that BV embeds into L. Embeds into L a Lebesgue space of exponent n over n minus one. And there is a corresponding inequality between the respective norms. But of course, we may not hope such a strong result here because our differential operator div is not elliptic. However, in the spirit of compensated compactness, In compensated compactness, you get some regularity for exceptional quantities. Here, we do not know whether we can get some regularity, but we can get some enhanced integrability for some exceptional quantities. And now I want to explain what is this exceptional quantity D of A. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. To understand which quantity is interesting here, we shall examine the case of a special tensor in which the tensor A is the cofactor matrix of the Atian of some potential. So, when I here I work in the periodic setting for the sake of simplicity, so the barred integral. So, the barred integral is just the mean value of the fundamental domain. So, A is periodic. Mind that theta is not periodic in general, but it is periodic up to a quadratic function. So, when I take the mean value of the determinant of A to the power 1 over n minus 1, remember that this Remember that this power of the determinant is just the determinant of the Hessian of the potential. And now the determinant of Hessian is a null Lagrangian in John Ball terminology. And therefore, you have an identity and you find that this equals to the n minus one root of the determinant of the mean value of n. Of A. So you see that the mean value of some nonlinear quantity equals in this special case to the nonlinear quantity of the mean value. There is a commutation between the two operations. And this calculation suggests, and the Galiardo inequality should too, that the nice quantity to consider is the n minus one foot of the determinant. I point out I point out that this root of the determinant is superlinear because it is a function of homogeneous of the degree n over n minus one. And in particular, it may not be concave. And this is opposite to the case of determinant to the one over n. It is known that the determinant to the one over n is a concave function over the cone of positive. The cone of positive symmetric matrices. Actually, in the analysis in the proof, we use the concavity of determinant to the one over n, and we use this function to study determinant to the one over n minus one. Next slide, please. Thanks. So here is the main result and to this. Is the main result, and to describe it, I want to first observe that since A is positive semi-definite, the nth root of its determinant is the geometrical mean of its eigenvalues, and therefore it is bounded by above by the arithmetic mean, which here is just one over n times the Is just one over n times the trace of a tensor. And since the trace is a rado measure, we deduce that the nth root of the determinant is a well-defined measure. Of course, a non-negative one because the eigenvalues are positive. Well, here is the theorem. So we have a positive tensor, it is assumed to be dvbv over the whole space Rn. whole space are l then this well-defined measure the n fruit of the determinant is actually a lebescun of exponent n over n minus one it is not a singular measure it is a lebes function and its total mass which here becomes the integral of the determinant of a to the one over determinant of a to the one over n minus one that is the n over n minus one power of the determinant to the one over n this is bounded by some universal constant times the appropriate power of the total mass of the divergence of a the proof of this theorem is not very complicated it it it it is obtained by duality starting from uh brunier's theorem From Brunier's theorem about the second boundary value problem for the Montgomery-Per equation. And Brunier's theorem comes from optimal transport theory. Next slide, please. So in the functional inequality displayed in the theorem, the constant Cn is explicit and it is sharp. That is, it is I know what is the best one. I know what is the best one, and I know it because the equality happens whenever the tensor is the identity matrix times the characteristic function of the ball. And for general domain, if I take the same tensor, but with a characteristic function of omega, then the functional inequality reduces to the isoperimetric inequality. So, somehow compensated integrability extends isoperimetric inequality. And if I still consider a tensor proportional to the identity matrix, but now with an arbitrary function f, then one recovers Sobole F embedding, Gagliardo, Nirenberg, Sobolef. Next slide, please. Niranberg Soviet. Next slide, please. There is also a theorem in the periodic framework. So now A has to be divergence free, not only divergence B V, but divergence free. So it is periodic according to some lattice. And then we find the inequality where, if you recall the example of a special tensor. Of the special tensor, we had the equality. So you can observe that again, this inequality is sharp, of course, and the equality case is the special class. You might think that this inequality is nothing but the Jensen's inequality, but this is wrong, because it would be Jensen's inequality if the Inequality: if the function under consideration was concave, but as I told you, it is not because it is superlinear. But if you write it with the power one over n, then it is Jensen's inequality. So the proof is similar to that of theorem one, except that now we have to start from an existence theorem for the period. An existence theorem for the periodic Monson per equation, and this theorem is due to Yan-Yan Li. You might view the functional inequality here as expressing a divergence quasi-concavity. Here, I borrow the terminology from Francisco M√ºller and the Philippines for the quantity determinant to the one over n minus one. Determinant to the one over n minus one. Next slide, please. And therefore, this divergence quasi-concavity can be used to establish a weak star upper semi-continuity result. So here you have in this theorem, which was established in collaboration with Luigi de Rosa and Ricardo Tion, we have a sequence of positive divisions. Positive divide tensors. And we assume that this sequence not only converges weakly in some LP, but also that the sequence of divergences is bounded in the space of measures. And the L P under consideration is smaller than L to the n over n minus one. So P is large. n minus one. So p is larger than n over n minus one. And then under these assumptions, then the weak star limit of the determinant to the one over l minus one is less than or equal to the determinant to the one over l minus one of the weak star limit. There was a recently, very recently, a sound improvement of The improvement of this theorem by my collaborators. They studied the limit case p equals n over n minus 1, where there is a very interesting concentration phenomenon. Next slide, please. In this talk, I shall use also variations on the on theorem one. On theorem one on compensated integrability. So, here I present the first one in which I first consider the so-called multilinear determinant or mixed determinant. So let me call Dn the mixed determinant. Here I consider only symmetric matrices, of course. So Dn is the n-linear form. And linear form over the space of symmetric matrices, which on the diagonal coincides with the determinant. So let me give a simple example. If n equals 2, you have 2 by 2 matrices. So the mixed determinant of the matrices A and B is just this expression, this bilinear expression in the entries of. In the entries of A and B. Let me recall that the determinant, which is a polynomial, of course, over the matrices and in particular over the symmetric matrices, the determinant is a hyperbolic polynomial. So hyperbolic polynomials have been defined by Garding in the 50s when he studied. When he studied hyperbolic differential operators, so they correspond to two symbols of hyperbolic differential operators. And a hyperbolic polynomial has a forward cone, which indicates the directions of future. And for the determinant, the forward cone is the cone of positive. cone is the cone of positive symmetric matrices. And this is a theorem of guarding that the multilinear, the n linear form associated to a hyperbolic polynomial is still positive over this colon. So in our case, the mixed determinant takes positive values whenever all the arguments are positive symmetric matrices. Positive symmetric matrices. And in particular, if you develop, for instance, the determinant of a sum of positive matrices, then you may discard many, many positive quantities and obtain an inequality that the inequality that the mixed determinant of n matrices is less than or equal to one over factorial n. Factorial n determinant of the sum of these matrices. Next slide, please. So, with this in hand and applying compensated integrability to the sum of tensors and then using a rescaling argument, we obtained the following theorem: that if all the arguments are DFPV tensors, positive DFPV tensors, Positive dividend source, then the next determinant to the one over n is not only a Radon measure, but it is actually a Lebesgue function of exponent n over n minus one, and we have a functional inequality. So I shall use this functional inequality in applications. Next slide, please. Let me give you an example, an application of the last theorem. It has been known that if f is a B V function over the whole space Rn, and if you take its convolution with the kernel one over R, R being the norm of X, then the Of x, then the convolution is a continuous bounded continuous function, and we have a functional inequality. Tartar found an elegant proof of that, of that point, by using the fact that B V not only embeds into L n over n minus one, but actually in the Lorentz space L n over n minus one, one. minus one comma one while the the kernel one over r belongs to the to the Lorentz space L n, infinity, and both spaces are in duality. Here I shall give an improvement of this result by applying compensated integrability to the following choice. So in this choice, I have n tensors, and the first one is basically the tensor, a special tensor, x tensor x divided by r to the n plus one. So it is a tensor of which is homogeneous of order one minus n multiplied by an arbitrary function. Homogeneous of degree zero. And then there is a truncation term, but in the proof, I shall let the truncation parameter go to infinity, and therefore you may ignore this truncation term. So g is an arbitrary function. It will be an arbitrary function if L1, for instance. And for A2 up to And for A2 up to A n, I choose the same tensor, which is just this function f, the B V function, times the identity matrix. And then applying next slide, please. Applying compensated integrability, we obtain the following estimate that if I define a kind of Radon-Like transform of a function, so I Of the function. So I integrate along lines which pass through a point Z and which go in the direction omega. Omega is a unit vector. It is not exactly a Radon transform because there is this weight R to the n minus 2. Then the function satisfies the following that if I fix the If I fix the point Z and I take the Lebesgue norm of order n minus one over n minus two with respect to the variable in the unit sphere, then this norm is bounded as z varies and it is bounded by the total variation of f and this is slightly better than the Slightly better than the previous estimate because the previous estimate considered only the L1 norm with respect to omega instead of the Ln minus one and minus over n minus two norm. Next slide, please. Now the other variant which is important for application to gas dynamics and to evolution problems. And to evolution problem now assumes that n splits as 1 plus d, and the variable x splits as a time variable and t and space variables y. And we split A blockwise accordingly. And this defines the so-called sure complement of called sure complement of rho so this sure complement is sigma and the determinant of a is just the product of the first entry rho the first diagonal entry times the determinant of sigma and the positiveness of a amounts to that of both rho and sigma now let me denote capital m Let me denote capital M, the integral of rho, which is preserved with time. We may think of rho as a mass density, of capital M as a total mass. And then compensated integrability using a scaling argument gives the following estimate, abstract estimate, that the space-time integral of the d root, so d The d root, so d is n minus one, of course. So this is the n minus one root. So the d root of rho determinant sigma is bounded in terms of the total mass and the norm as measures of the so-called momentum, little n, okay, at initial time and final time. So you see that here the space-time integral. The space-time integral is on a bounded interval of time. Next slide, please. So now we enter in the application part. Compensated integrability will apply to models that involve a positive divergence B V symmetric tensor, and often the tensor will be D free. The important, okay. I have shown you that symmetric DBV or D-free tensors are ubiquitous in mathematical physics, but the question is whether they are positive or not. Because if they are not, compensate integrability might not apply. So they are certainly positive in the following list of examples. So the compressible Eurover equation, because the pressure is a non- Because the pressure is a non-negative quantity. And this is true both in classical and relativistic contexts. This is okay also in kinetic equations like Boltzmann or particle dynamics in mean fields models. Particle dynamics, discrete particle dynamics also, it is okay whenever the Whenever the interactive force, pairwise interaction, is described by a radial repulsive interaction force. And repulsive, more or less, is the criterion which ensures that the tensor is positive. It applies also to hard spheres dynamics. Dynamics and last, it applies to multi-D scalar conservation laws. And here we have a paper in collaboration with Luis Silvester, but this topic is outside of the topic of this talk. Next slide, please. On the contrary, compensated integrability does not apply when the frequencor is indefinite or if Is indefinite, or if it can be so, of course, depending on the solution, on the flow. So, for instance, it does not apply to Navier-Stokes system, because in Navier-Stokes system, the stress tensor involves the symmetric part of the Jacobian velocity, and we are not able to say anything about the sign of this contribution. Likewise, it does not apply to incompressible Euler equations. To incompressible Euler equation, because the pressure in the incompressible case may be of may have an arbitrary sign. It never applies to the Maxwell's equation because, in this case, we do know that the tensor is indefinite and it does not apply to attractive particle dynamics. Next slide, please. So let me start with the Euler system of gas dynamics, classical case. I remind you the differ tensor, which splits as the sum of two simplest tensors. The first one involves the velocity field, and it is rank one, and the second depends only on the pressure. So the depth, the actually the Actually, the pressure times the identity is the sure complement of the density here. And therefore, the determinant of the tensor is just rho times p to the d remember that the compensated integrability result for evolution problems involve the total mass of the momentum at initial. Total mass of the momentum at initial and final time. So, say the L1 norm of a momentum. So, this can be bounded in terms of the total mass of energy thanks to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. And therefore, compensated integrability immediately gives that the space-time integral of the diff root, which here is the diff root of the mass density times the Mass density times the pressure. This is bounded in terms of mass and total energy. Of course, the compensated integrability theorem for evolution problem was stated only on a finite time interval, zero capital T. But since the estimate, the obtained estimate The obtained estimate does not depend at all on the length of the time interval. It is valid forever, provided, of course, that the flow is globally defined. Next slide, please. Actually, there is a nice trick which uses the action of a projective group over divergence-free tensors or divergence-building tensors. Divergence-built source, which yields an improved dispersion. And the nicest result is obtained for a monoatomic gas, because for a monoatomic gas, the Euler equations are invariant under the action of a projective group. So let me just give you the result in this case. This means that you have a perfect gas flow. A perfect gas law with an adiabatic constant gamma equals to one plus two over the space dimension. So for full gas dynamics, this means that P is two over D times rho epsilon. And if and for an isentropic flow, this means that P is rho to the one plus two over D. And then you get the following. You get the following space-time estimate, which resembles much the previous one, except that you have an extra factor, an extra time factor in the time integral. And therefore, this estimate is better than the previous one for large times. Of course, now the bound in the right-hand side may not involve. Hand side may not involve the energy, it must involve the inertial momentum at initial time. Find that the technique is always more flexible when n equals 2. When n equals 2, we actually may involve compensated compactness instead of compensated integrability. Integrability and therefore a mix of the two techniques give rise to Bezoff regularity. But of course, n equals two means that d equals one. So this result is in one space dimension. It was obtained by Francois Gauls 15 years ago. And for instance, for the monoatomic gas, which in one space dimension means gamma equals three, you have a Besorph. You have a besoff regularity of the density and velocity with the exponents one-fourth for an infinity. But other results occur when gamma is different from this value. But this is valid only in one space dimension. Next slide, please. Now, the previous estimates can be slightly The previous estimates can be slightly improved by remarking that the space-time integrals under consideration do not depend upon the choice of a Galilean frame. Though the right-hand sides do, for instance, you have the mechanical energy, and in the mechanical energy there is a velocity field, and the velocity field depends upon the choice of a of a frame. Upon the choice of a frame. So, what you can do is to write the estimate in every Galilean frame and optimize by choosing the best one, the one which minimizes the right-hand side. And this lets us replace the product of the mass and energy, for instance, by the following quantity in which the product of the mass and kinetic energy has been reported. On kinetic energy has been replaced by the double integral with respect to two copies of the space variable z and y. And likewise, the product of the mass and the momentum of inertia is replaced by the double integral, another double integral. Next slide, please. So, mind that So, mind that the first estimate, the basic one, assumes neither an equation of state. We use only the fact that the pressure is a non-negative quantity, nor an entropy condition. It involves only the decay of the mechanical energy. Actually, even if the solutions are not admissible in Are not admissible in the sense of Eduard, for instance. We can establish this estimate by replacing E0 by the supremum of the total mechanical energy over the time. And the second estimate, strangely enough, does not depend at all upon the initial velocity field. So you express Express some power, you express the space-time integral of some power of mass density independently of the data of the velocity. Now, let me discuss a little bit what means the basic estimate, for instance, in the case of a barotropic. instance in the case of a barotropic gas so here p is rho to the gamma for some gamma constant gamma larger than one then when you when you write that the total mass is conserved somehow you say that rho belongs to the l infinity space in time with values in the l1 space in the space variable when you write the conservation of energy you get Conservation of energy, you get a bound of internal energy, which tells you that rho is L infinity in time with values in L gamma in space. And when you write the compensated integrability estimate, you obtain that rho is in the L gamma plus one over D space in both space and time variable. Variable things. And you see that all these three estimates are independent of each other. It seems that such trickers-like inequality estimates are new for the Euler system. For instance, let me give you an example of previous dispersive estimates which was obtained by Schumann, which was a decay. Here it is for a moment. Decay, here it is for a monoatomic gas, for instance. The decay of the integral of a pressure decays as t to the minus two, but it involves only a space integral. Next slide, please. So, a further estimate uses the multilinear extension of compensated integrability. Integrability, and I take the same first tensor, the product of an arbitrary function homogeneous of degree zero, times the special tensor. Oh, by the way, this special tensor is obtained by taking the potential theta equals to the radius, so norm of x. And the other tensors A2 up to a n equals 2 up to a n equals the mass momentum tensor associated to the flow with the flow. And remarking that the mass momentum tensor dominates the short part, the one which depends only on the pressure. We obtain an estimate for a Radon-Lieuk transform of the pressure. Of the pressure. So again, we integrate the pressure along lines. Of course, it is lines of space and time. For instance, you have, okay, tau is a time variable, Z is a space variable, and omega is a unit vector, as usual. So you have this Radon-Light transform with again a weight which is Again, a weight which is r to the d minus one, that is n minus two, as before. And then I multiply by some homogeneous function of degree minus one, if I am correct, an homogeneous function of the vector omega. Next slide, please. And we obtained that this Radon-Lag transform belongs uniformly with respect to tau and z to the space and time variable. It belongs to the Lebesgue space of exponent d over d minus one over the sphere as S D. And its norm is bounded in terms of the total energy. Well, it is not very easy to understand the nature of this result, but The nature of this result, but if you use the fact that this Lebesgue space embeds into L1, because ST is a banded domain, then this estimate implies the perhaps more readable next estimate that the soup in space and time variable Tz of the space-time integral. The space-time integral of this space-time integral. So, this is a kind of convolution, actually. It is a convolution in space and time with a strange kernel, but this kernel in the singular integral, it has degree minus one. So, this convolution of the pressure is bounded uniformly just. Just in terms of initial energy. Next slide, please. And the newest estimate concerns the velocity, because so far we have estimated the space-time integrals of quantities which depend only on the pressure and the mass density. And we have ignored so far the velocity. Have ignored so far the velocity field. It was estimated only through the kinetic energy, of course. And the question is whether there is a strickert slight estimate also, but now involving the velocity field. And this can be achieved by applying the multilinear compensated integrability. And now still, we have to choose. Still, we have to choose n tensors, a1 up to a n. But the tensors will be shifts of the original tensors. So I choose an arbitrary vector HJ in Rd, and I shift the tensor A by this vector, and this defines the tensor AJ. And noticing that A dominates. That A dominates the kinetic part, which is a rank one tensor, and applying the multilinear compensated integrability, we obtain this new estimate. Still a space-time integral, still a supremum. Now the supremum is with respect to all the shifts. So we have n shifts. N shifts and the quantity under the integral sign is the def root of on the one hand the product of all the densities, shifted densities, and on the other hand the square of the volume of the simplex in Rd spanned by the d plus one vector. By the d plus one vectors u zero up to u d. So this volume, for instance, is zero if these vectors are co-planar. Okay. So let me comment about this estimate. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. Ah, okay, thank you. Ah, okay, thank you. So, this expression, which we integrate, is still quadratic in the velocity. So, at first sight, it seems that there is no improvement with respect to the kinetic estimate. But the improvement is that the factor, the density factor, is homogeneous of degree one plus. Of degree one plus one over D instead of one. And this is an improvement with respect to the kinetic energy. So it is exactly the same factor as the one we had in the basic estimate, for instance, when we compare with the estimate of the pressure given by the internal energy. Okay, next slide, please. And I think that my time is over. Is it correct? Thank you for your attention.
