So, thanks a lot to the organizers for inviting me to this workshop. I was a little bit embarrassed to give a talk because I felt like a fish out of water, but maybe now I can justify my presence here. The title that I sent. The title that I sent was an overview of my dearest differences. I don't know why I decided that I think that it shows weakness, this title. I like to say based from my diary of differences, like I'm going to stop my research and then I have to change my mind because. To change my mind because Giuseppe on the airplane said to me, But did you have a look to the paper of Gabrielle La Cristian about the harmonious chromatic number of Lady Graph? It is bread for your teeth, assuming that you understand in Italy. You say you understand. And indeed, I announced this morning that I saw. I solved one of the first problem proposed by Christian. I have to thank him a lot because now I feel part of the community. Anyway, about differences, let me say that my most heated difference at this moment is the time difference. I cannot have all this energy. No, it is midnight. Midnight, it is after midnight anyway. Anyway, I will tie considering that you presented me in that way. Anyway, my talk wants to be a sort of advertisement for differences. How it works? Just not so much. So, my talk is finished. So, from my diary of differences, I don't know why, but in some way, differences companioned me for all my life. When I was a baby, I liked this sort of puzzles. Find the 12 differences, it is easy that one banana. One banana pier mirror. It is not the which was which were my first differences in the academy. I started studying a little bit Kelegraphs. You know Kelegraph. Here is the definition. The definition we have the Kelegraph. A graph for a group G, an added group G with connection set omega is defined in this way. A set of vertices is G, is the group G. And the rules according to which xy is or not an edge of the graph is if and only if the difference between x and y is enomial. For instance, every hypercube can be seen as a clear graph on the elemental. I mean, an elementary albedo group. Overdark here, for instance, we have, you know, I'm saying trivial things. Maybe you're wondering why I studied Keynes Grace, because I'm not so famous about people from Kelegraph. I'm a design theorist. Actually, I feel ashamed to say what I did with Keyle Grace because. Because my papers were a little bit naive. I remember, I cannot say the name, but one big professor one time laughed at me saying, but you are discovering well-known things about buildings. And indeed, now since then, I have a strong allergy against buildings. Anyway, I gave, for instance, a characterization of a hyper. A characterization of hypercubes in terms of tolerance, and so I mean it is appropriate for this conference. But I don't tell you, it is not so important. After a while, I changed my topic. I thought that I completely changed my topic and I started to study designs. Here, there is the classic definition of T D K lambda design. Actually, here Here, I want to consider only two vehicles under design. The final plane is a 2731 design. For this morning, someone spoke about Steiner to design, which are the designs whose lambda is exactly equal to one, and indeed they are my favorite designs. I thought that I completely changed the topic. I completely changed the topic, but actually, after a while, I discovered that there is a kinship between this new topic and the old topic. Because my favorite designs are those having an automotive group acting sharply transitively on the points, so you can understand why there is some change. So let me advertise some objects in which differences are important. There are a lot. Just some examples. I told you, just an advertisement. Because there are differences, relative difference sets, partial difference sets, difference families, strong difference families, really a lot of objects. One of the most important is one of the most important notions is One of the most important notions is that of a different set. A B K lambda difference set in an additive group G, additive but not necessarily a B, is a K subset of G such that the list of differences of B covers all non-zero elements of G exactly lambda times. So here we have, for instance, an example of An example of the 13 for one difference set. We are in the in Z13. This is the group. Here we have the difference table of B. We take all possible differences. Of course, I never considered the difference of an element with itself. And you can check that you find all non-zero elements of Z13 exactly once. Once. One, two, three, four, five, and so on. So this is a 13 for one different set. Why different sets are important in design here? There is a huge literature about different sets. Whenever you have a different set in a group G, a set of all the translates of this set gives a symmetric 2 V calamda design. Symmetric means that the number Design symmetric means that the number of blocks is equal to the number of points. So if you take here all the translates of B, modulo 13, the 13 translates of B, you get a 213 for one symmetric design, which is actually the projected plane of a midfield of order 3 up to isomorphism. Different sets can be generalized to the notion of different sets can be generalized to that of a difference family. Actually, I'm an expert in difference families, not in different sets. A different set can be considered as a difference family with only one block. But the study of different sets and difference families are not so similar. So similar. I mean, people studying different sets are not exactly, of course, there is some connection, but the tools are a little bit different. So, what is a DK-Lambda difference family? And it is very similar to what I said before. We are in an entity group G, we have a set of families because it could be a collection. Family because it could be a collection. We may have repeated blocks. We have a family of k-subsets of G such that the list of differences, I mean delta B1, delta B2, and so on, is lambda times all the non-zero elements of G. So this is a pK lambda difference family. Here we have an example of a 13,3,1 difference family in Difference family in Z13. The two blocks, usually speaks of base blocks of the difference family, FR0110 and 028. Here we have the difference table of the first block, the difference table of the second one, and you can see that each non-zero element of Z15 appears exactly once. One, two, three, four, five. Two, three, four, five, and so on. So, difference families also give rise to interesting two designs because now, similarly as above, if I take all the translates, the first box and all the translates of the second one, I get a 21331 design. 3-1 design. The difference is that with different sets, I get symmetric design. The number of blocks is equal to the number of points. With different spellies, I still get designs with a sharply point transitive automorphism group. But of course, the number of points is not equal to points is not equal to the number of blocks, because here we have 13 points. We have 13 points at the elements of G. The blocks are 26. All the translates of the first block and all the translates of the second one. Maybe in this context it is not so important to speak about difference multi-circle and strong difference values. These are notions that I introduced in the 90s, but actually they were in the literature. They were in the literature since a long time, but implicitly. I gave the first formal definition in a paper of mine, Journal of Communitarian Design in the 90s, and they are very useful. Difference multi-set, you can guess what is. This time, I don't have a subset of G, but a key multi-subset of G, so I have a repeated element. Element. Here, for instance, we have a 642 difference multi-set. You see that zero is repeated two times. It makes sense again to consider the list of differences of B. And if every element of G, zero included, appears lambda times in this list of differences, then let's say that this is a six for two difference uh multi-set, you see. Difference multi-set, you see 0011 to 223, and so on. Different multi-set don't give immediately a true design, but they are very useful to construct the skeleton of some designs. It is difficult to explain, just to give you an idea. Strong difference family is the definition is here. I have a collection of key multi-subsets of negative group G. If all elements of G are repeated a constant number lambda times, then I have a strong difference value. I used this adjective strong to say strong because in the list of differences I also have zero. And they are extremely useful. I wanted to They are extremely useful. I wanted to advertise also the work of some collaborators of mine, of some PhD, former students of mine, but I don't have time. I just tell you that I used to say, give me a strong difference, family, and I will move the world. Because really, it is possible to get a lot of results with a naive With a naive, apparently naive notion. For instance, recently I got a result, in a joint work with D.W. We found, I think, quite interesting results about linear species. Anyway, so strong difference. What I'm doing. So one of the most famous if I have One of the most famous, if I have to advertise the differences, one of the most famous designs obtainable via differences is the 21331 design, but not classic design, 21331 design over Z2. What does it mean? That the points are those of the two-dimensional projective space over Z2. Z2 and the blocks are two-dimensional subspaces of this projected space. And it is a classic design with this parameter, so maybe someone attended my lecture in Bled in 2019. And well, it was a sort of coming out. I was obsessed by this design because it is magical. It is a really magic. It is magic, it is really magic, it is unbelievable. And I noted that this is 90 square plus 90 plus one, so I confess to the audience that I believe in the projected plane of order 90. And I read my I was getting crazy, and I affected some people about this. So just in reading the fear of mentee that I published in the book. That I publish in the bulletin of the Institute of Communatorics and its application. It is a joke, but it is also the truth. I told you this morning, the bulletin of the Institute of Communatorics and its applications, I have to advertise, and don't tell me that I'm off topic, please. It was shown this page two times this morning. Not with the right colours, these are the right colours of the lap. These are the right colours of the Latz. My favorite Italian team, soccer team. According to Schimaldo, we are in the rank as a Q2 journal. It is really successful because we are a homemade journal and we just started in 2016 when we were not in Scopus. Please. Please submit it to the DFCA. Anyway, this oh no, this is just a joke. This was the right title. This was the right title that I discovered, that I used a lot of time, but I forgot. In a certain sense, it was Joseph who told me, but in a certain why that title. You have to advertise differences. Differences, mystics. Differences. Differences may still make the difference. Look, in Istanbul, in where I were here, at Minshu, in China, and a lot of time. Differences may still make the difference. And even here, thank you, Christian, differences still make the difference because with differences we can solve your first and second problem. Problem. So, this money Christian spoke about the Levy graph of the projecting plate, but more generally of the design. So, you know, the vertices are points and blocks of the designs, and the edges are essentially the flex of the design. So, which is the harmonious chromatic number of the Levigraph of design D? And for projection. And the four projective planes, four projective planes, what happens? So this is my god, it is not visible, the edges. Anyway, it should be the legigraph of the Fano plane I show in harmonious seven coloring. Seven coloring of the Levy graph of the final plane. Of course, the harmonious chromatic number of the projective plane of order Q cannot be smaller of Q squared plus Q plus one. So I think this is the final advertisement. So here is Here is the proof. I told you if you accept me in your group, maybe I can give you the details. But here it is the proof. It is quite easy. The fact is that probably you didn't realize that every projective plane is generated by a different set. So if you have the projected plane on border Q, you can see this projective plane as a design was. Has designed whose points are the element of the secret group of order q squared plus q plus one and whose blocks are all the translate of a suitable different set with these parameters. So the blocks are all the translates of B. How to get an harmonious leveling? Well, it's a construct it is very constructive. It is the the the the the colors are The colors are the points. The colors are the points. How to color the lines? The important thing is to choose the right color for the first line, for the first block B. How to choose the color? It is important that the color X of the first block doesn't belong to this set. This is the forbidden set. Considering that Q squared plus Q plus 1, minus. q square plus q plus 1 minus the size of f is positive, I can find this x. And then all the other lines, I get the colors of the other lines by translation. So let's find differences and play more with these things. Let's try to solve the other problems proposed. Solve the other problems proposed by Christian. Thank you.
