Okay, so our next talk was by this Daramia winter. I'm afraid I don't know. He's gonna tell us about what we're gonna do today when they are. Yeah, I haven't started recording, it's okay. Okay, yeah, okay. Well, thank you very much to the organizers for the opportunity to speak here. Yeah, so this is part of this program to compute the A1 animated geometry classical counts. So I will recall and the presentation screen, and then I'll go directly into material environments. So Invitement. So, um, it can be filled and we want perfect of characteristic. Not two for now, other two more hypotheses when we need it. Then the curtain did fig print of the field that was introduced in the last term. These are non-degenerate Porium forms, up to asymmetry. Abstract isometry, and this is the case. This has a presentation given by one part. So we have a set of generators. This is this one part from the field. The field, some x to a squared. K is a square. Small k is the same as little k? So try to add some k is just oh, sorry, yes. Yeah, subject to the forward relation. So a squared is n. This is the because we consider up to isometry, so we can always factor b here. Then we get a plus b is the same. is the same A plus B plus AB A plus B. So this is our relation of linear algebra. We just need to characteristic is not true. And then A times B and this A. So for this correlation, this actually implies that A plus minus A is the same as 1 plus 1. plus 1 plus minus 1 this is diagonal form and this is for every unit okay so the two examples that are we carry in the chart so the first one is the growth in the B group C or any algebraically closed field right this is this set and then this is an isomorphism given by the right. An isomorphism given by the rank. Okay, we have only one generator, and then all relations are trivial. And the vertebral V group of R. This is squared, set times one, set minus one. And then here we have up our alpha, we can send into the rank of alpha plus the signature alpha divided by. Alpha divided by two times one plus the rank of alpha minus the signature of alpha divided by two times one. These are two examples. Then for this group we have the trace. So if we have a field extension K to L we have that the We have that the Lebranic trace induces anisomorphism at the level of traces. So we have the trace from L to K, from the Gradient P group of L to the Graduate P group of K that sends from alpha to decomposition of the algebraic trace with L to K times alpha. So I will carry this example. So what do we have? What is the We have quantity trace now from C to R. So we've got the width of the C j. This is going to be determined by the image of 1. So 1 is going to be same squared. So 1 integrative integers of C, this is just The WA trace is the sum of all the Galoch lookings. So here, it is going to send trace when C to R of 1. This is going to go from now C, but I'm going to look at R2, R. And then this is just going to send set to is just going to send z2 z squared. So this is alpha plus multiplied by trace, so the conjugate. So this doesn't have an maximum mark and then we can see that if this write as a divided by square 2 plus b divided by squared i, this is going to be a square root which is one plus One twice okay. So this is our invariance argument. So in this setting we want to define multi-declinity invariants. So these are current company invariants for let's say X. So for today we're going to take X mode dark pets on surface. And then we want to define probability invariance, so Kirk counter invariance for this, doing an analog of what we know for the complex in the real case. For that, we need to fix a class or data set, yes. But then this fixing itself. But then this fixing such a class, this will define a polygon which is dual to the fun, so this is integer polynomial delta, which is dual to the fun that defines the torque. That defines the toric structure of X, and then which size is determined by the size bit. So examples of these, I call delta D, the integer polynomial with vertices 0, 0, B 0, 0, V. So we have that title variety. The total variety associated to dot B this is P2 and then the class associated with the size beta. This is just d time the class also of life. So a second example delta A B this is the in The integer only going by the vertices 0, 0, A0, 0B, and A. But here, the star variety corresponding to delta AB, this is P1 corresponding. And the associated class is the class of curves of commodity class. Of commodity class H times the horizontal line, but B time the vertical. Just put them into count the number of curves. We want to count the numbers first that classes you that live in our third varieties. We do that in the following way, the beginning by n delta. This is the number of rational curves as there you know. Okay, passing through configuration of points given by this is the number of integer points in the lambda of delta minus one. So this is right so this ensemble. Sample, you can count the number of integer points here are d plus d plus d, so this is 3 minus 1, which corresponds to the class k. This corresponds to what we saw yesterday as the from a hidden invariant of P two in plus P times. times alright. So we know this is an invariant. This does not depend on the configuration points. This is from the classical theorem. And we want to define w of delta the number of real rational curves of class your time. The time, right, passing through the same number in real problems. Next. So really this, as we saw yesterday, this is the naive count is not anywhere. It depends on the configuration of points. So we need to count it its signs. We need to count it in size. So we should are designed with the message. So for multiple planner curves, Curves and a configuration that is generic, we're going to have that C model, and then the real nodes are going to have complex labors, right? So you want to have two branches, two real branches that intersect a point, or two complex communicated branches. Local equation, x squared minus y squared. minus y squared and x squared minus y squared. So the sign for the founder is called r of the curve this quantifiers minus one to the number of distributed nodes. So let me rephrase this as the product As the product over all the nodes of the curve of the corresponding sign. So to this, we're going to have to say plus one and then to three, we're going to have to say minus one. Right. This sign Right, so it's a theoretical mentioned that this count, design count, design variable does not point. So let me just write a small example. So we can all NB or N dot D, same thing as W. So we have that N1 is the number of lines that plus two points, and N2 are the number of comics plus two five points. This does not depend on the field. So the first nothing that the motion invariant is 12. This is the number of rational This is the number of rational colleagues that pass a straight point. So now for W1, the first two trivial, but then for W3, we may have that discount depends on configuration. So we have either 10 real curves that has a node of what sums your plan. real plus plus two real curves with an isolated node so this is like this and this is like this or we can have nine real curves of this type and one real curve of this type or eight real curves so one and then zero curves. So this is So this is at least an example of your question. So now what happened here? Here there are 12 all the curves that we consider the complex case are real. Here there's only 10 real curves and here there's only 8. So here we're still going to have one pair of complete connected points, of complete connected curves. So curves that are not defined or real. So curves are not defined on the real, so complex constant pair that passes through these points. When I consider the counting problem as a complex problem, only here we're going to have a real pair and then two pairs of complex. Therefore, it's plain. Me? Done before this conference like this. So when I send this definition down to order type of here, I have n real points, but I can also consider real configuration of points. Instead of taking all Instead of taking all real points, I want the whole configuration to be real, but not real. Right, so if we divide n as t plus 2s, and now we consider, let's say, a configuration of three real points, so this one still, so these are real points, and then one and And then my one conjugated one else, y is conjugated. And then P and Q makes more sense. Q is Q squared. And these then are S squares complex on the points. From the point, then we can define W delta S as well, the same is the number of real rational curves of plus beta that passes through such configuration. And you can pass in script this continuation point. So here they have two, one pair of complex convective points. I consider the lines that passes through this point. This is a real line. This two are s equal ones, but now down the tree of s, this is equal to t. In the case when all the points are real, I have pair real points. And now if I have one pair of complete conjugate points, I have six real points. So this is all, let's say, classical, the world's very complex and real. We restrict them in the conditions for arbitrary false. So now is defined a delta A1. So naively, I want this to be the number of rational curves plus beta and then pass into a configuration of n and now I want k fresh confidence. So here, right so of course this like this is not gonna work in Period so we need countable designs. Then, well, the proposed realization for this side is the following. So, we're going to call this film A1 and the full-up definition curve. So, this is going to be the product over the nodes of RC, some nodes. Of the sign. Then, well, what we're going to say is minus the terminal application. But this is not enough, so we need also to consider all the nodes of the curve. So here, there's one type of node that we were not considering before. And these are nodes that are not real. Nodes that are not real. So if the curve is real, we're going to have nodes that come in COVID conjugation. So this comes in pairs. So to this we're going to associate the normal or the field of definition of the node to the field of definition of the curve of this final determinant. Of this final determinant application. So if we see here, the norm of C over K, now this is the product of all the Galois conjugates. So this is going to be whatever final determinant of the Haitian is, times its conjugate. This is a real square. So if we consider this as two squares, then to such pair, we're going to as you say As you say, pos function. But where does this leave? This is going to leave in the rotting V group of the field of the earth. And we need an invariant of our race, DLK. So for that, we're going to choose demos. So just comment on why this is decorated with A. Why is this decorated with A1? I mean, it would be natural just to decorate it with K, like, what's your base field? Why is it called? Oh, okay, because, but the remark that I just made, then I can say that, right, for the reals, and the version of A1 here, this is the quarter of R given by the version A of R. So it just distinguishes this is not a number, but a query form. This is why the correction is fine. I know I guess that looks like it's still not. I mean, it's a choice. Yeah, I mean, I think it's a natural choice that that way you mark that it's required for a number. A number. It's not a homotropic invariant. Oh, you add some number? I mean, it's not a homoterician invariant of the space, right? We're only on heads of sequences in this, right? Now we can, of course, call it a GW version of GW. What about the A1 homotopy invariant or the configuration? LJ invariant doesn't depend. It's in one real convention. It's in one real command. But that's why it's a human right. You guys the error. Well, this point is an embark. Those are very basically invariant of the. So we think about the points is what we're concerned about. Invariant of the configuration. Yeah, I mean, that's the whole division here of why we have different numbers. Why we have to continue the numbers. I mean, it's very specific. So, right, so this is for definition. So, we want our invariant now. We want this to be the sum over all the curves that contains this configuration point of the trace from the field of definition of the curve to the base field of this. Field of this A1 multiplicity of the third and the well since theorem has the meaning is He's an Human compressed. So their theorem is a one-general statement. So for Microsoft, we will only use two instances of this. But if you want more details, On more details and examples, you can come to take Suck. So, for the definition, you haven't used anything about the toric structure, right? I mean, at least the definition could have been set for non-toric surface as well. And is that true for any tiny surface? Or is there a what's a general idea that there are? Yeah, like delta sounds. Sorry? It'll be true for delta since two. That's a salad. It is going to be true for me. Yeah, it's an invariant A1 classic configuration, not different A1 connected conformity configuration. It depends on the surface. Sometimes the surface, you look at the configuration space. Of P, of this P is something in surface thing. There are cubic surfaces that are not A1 connected. It's the torque of petals, I guess, they're always here. I assume that they're all they're all kicked on, right? Yeah, okay, so what is we don't take. We don't take only k points, but first, first, I want to remark to teams. Very natural, but pretty good of this emergency the same as it would pass to the altar vertical. So this is equal to the complex boundary. And of well, just of the A. Um and then as we remarked before, here if the curve is real and we have before as you said it should delta me, right, but now if we have a real problem, so a real configuration, and the tool definition of the theory is the confidence of it. Here is the complex number, then, well, the trace turns into R of what is going to be the version of C. R is just 1. This is 1 plus minus 1. That if we take the signature of n delta R So this is for the case of only k rational point. So now it's close here, alright. Right. So before, if n is equal to t s to s, let us consider sigma. Sigma definition of a configuration point. We have T A points, so big points, and we have now A s pairs of conjugated points that look for product extension. So this conjugate k of square of C1 minus K square of C2 times K And scan spurt of dispersed computer points. So then we can consider L delta 1 k of sigma, the number of so let's take the same definition. We take the sum over the curves to pass through the Sum over the curves that pass through this confusion points of the algebraic traits to the confusion of C of C. Oh, right, okay. Where is P is a configuration of points comprised by um Price by K points and we have S pairs points right now each computation. This is a fair performance. And K is played with C I So what this is a configuration field of definition it's like well algebra of definition is C1. Definition of Sigma. So this is also integrated in the statement. So A d C1 is also an invariant to P. It only depends on the flow of the conditions. Well, over R. Well, over R, we have not that much choice for the polaric extensions. So over R, non-polaric extension is C. So I can add this point here. The signature of being one well R, this is going to be double S. Okay. So this urine. To this urine, this environment, an existence or whatever. We prove the environments. So an example of the computer, many examples. So for these minus of the two things, the first two trivials. And then the first one that is non-trivial is the number of cubics at 22% of configuration. So they computed for general configuration points. So this is going to be the sum of the trace of the field of definition of the points. Definition of the point. Okay. So we can see that the rank of this, well, this is for king. The rank of this environment is 12. This is 2, so we have 4 here. And then the length, the sum of the lengths of this point is going to be 8. And, well, we will talk. Uh well, we also have um now real points. So for this case, this is going to be QH plus, let's say, the number of real points P then we've got the trace of R, so this is the identity of one, and then we have an article one twice, the trace. 1 to S will trace from C to R this is an algorithm force whose signature is 0. So from this we have the signature of m3 k1. This is that we have placed we cover the complex real count. So now the question is So now the question is: well, how can we compute this? So, for the classical Roma-Beaton invariance and Benson invariance, let's see, an important tool of computation is the use of topical geometry. That's why I restrain myself to topic case. So, in the definitions here, can one also pretend? Sorry? Can one also contend? Sorry? Can I also put tangency conditions? Like let's say a rational person with maximum tangents. Let's say artificially yes, but this is a algebraic, tropically yes, but then the algebraic counterpart of this is interesting. So the classical statement is a correspondent theory in Kalgin that tells that in delta, this can be computed as the sum of tropical curves that passes through a configuration of points in R2. Coupled with a complex multiplicity gamma and W delta is can be given probably the same set of summations, so it's the same number of tropical curves, but we modify the metabolicity for C. Then we're keeping Then we're here for summing up rational tropical pairs of PP delta. That means that the rays of infinity coincide with infinity, as we said yesterday. And we'll secure the fresh current of terminology. So it's maybe not important because. Um here. Um here no I mean this is very this is very classical. This is yeah this is why I go first philosophy Because okay so our goal is to extend this theorem for the A1 invariance and then we need this n delta A1 to be part and to be delta is one of the hypotheses of uh We have the following theory of Paulin, myself, where we have that the multiplicity of a tropical derivative gamma, so now we're not a product. Now, we're going to call it A1 multiplicity. So, if we sum over the algebraic curves that tropicalize gamma, tropicalization of C gamma. Always keep the crash course in propaganda, but this just means that I can put the curve C in a family that degenerates. Of the angles multiplicity of C, this is going to be equal to the complex multiplicity of the curve plus the real multiplicity of the curve divided by 2 times 1 plus times. And you can't make physically so for the case on the k point we have so k doesn't k. This is for the case where we have only k points. Yes. So the local contributions are not going to be once or minus one, but there's cancellation happening. And then for the case of only k-point, this is our thing. You have, okay, so this is multiple PCA where So, this is multiplicity A1 and GM, that's the definition. No, no, no, no, no. This is the theorem. What's the theorem? This is the definition. That's the definition. That's what I mean. Yeah, this is the definition. This is the number of sum over the curves that topicalize of the modific complexity. And then this is equal to this is the state. So then the color is that this is This is m delta plus w delta derivative at z times one plus m delta minus w delta delta and then this leaves and the well with the trace. I think there's a trace. This one with the trace. The current field definition of curves, k of the L k of C. So what about the case when we have now? So maybe I have to ask the same question as Mark before. So in the historic case, So in the historic cases you only get ones and minus ones as values of this like the grid group is much bigger, but somehow here you can put a field that is not even finally generated. But if you're only counting curve that passes through k points, then the final result is going to be a lot of cancellation, it's going to be once again. So, I mean, yeah, then the question is all these that can happen. So, well, what about now if we consider the character of the problem for coefficients of points that are not only two points? So, what is the simplest thing that we can think of? Covariance engine, one point of covariance. But then consider the following. Assume that we have two k-points. These are k-points. And we modify our configuration in such a way that now these k-points construct a family, sets quite equal to t, a way that these now are one pair of conjugated points that leave connected. Points that leave can acquire distinction from the fixed point. So this will have a moment in which these two points collide, and then they disappear, and then we can study what happened to these enumerative counts in this deformation of this research. What happened to the point? Where's the point configuration in this theory? Um here, right? I mean I consider oh okay, so this is for okay for gamma a rational tropical curve of class of degree. Of class of degree delta that contains the same configuration function. So now I want to study characters that passes through this point and I want to study the travel point. And I want to study the what happens when like crosses for the drawing I guess. You have two points. I can have a curve that goes like this. Then these two points collide. So I have a curve like this. And then, well, these points disappear. And then, well, these points disappear, and I have a pair of conjugated points. This is one case, or I can have another case, which is something like this, or like this, where I have two points, and when they collide, I find myself in a situation where now I have a double point, and the node of the curve corresponds to. Corresponds to these and follow them. I conjure them. So over there the right extension, so they'll overdo the right closure, there is no source difference. So a pair of k points like your extension, the fit is on the right closure, then there is no difference. So the rank should be the same, right? The same, right? True. Right. For the signature, now we consider this phenomena over the reals. So this rank should be the same in the same cases. So let's call this case. A1 sigma do the same thing and once i is real, then such a relation exists, and then this is adherent convention. would tell us that Ws delta minus Ws plus one delta. This is two times W the half of S where delta half is a toric blow up W So this auto blow up So this story blow up because yes, I have this part of the polygon. So we have the simulation, but here comes the environment. Now here we have it: sigma is equal to sigma zero times k times k, and sigma prime is sigma zero times k the square root of c and we have a big difference from the a1 invariance of c. the A1 invariance delta sigma minus the A1 invariance delta sigma prime. This is equal to the difference of traces. So this is the trace from k to k from k to k of 1 minus the trace from the priority extension of the k of 1 and then times And then times the A1 environment of delta hat of sigma t. This is delta breakcat. So it's like a long cross. It's like, yeah. So I have a configuration that has two gig points, and then after colliding. After colliding and going to a station, then I have that the difference of these three variants are related. So we look at this form, delta, we have that the rank of delta is zero, and the signature of delta for the real case is signature. Which means that order has direct closure, there is not the There is not different, and then on the real realization, we gotta re-recover the logic paper. First trace of what is just two. Yeah, this is two, and then this is two plus two secret. So, an example of this, and then we say this is answered. So, this will allow us to compute other invariants. So, as an example, this is an example for the P4. Here we assume that sigma is k times. Sigma is k times k square root of c1 k square root of c five. So I have so for rational curves before I have 11 points. So what I'm saying is I have one k point at least and then I'm gonna group two and three like four and five and so on until So until until 11. So there are mounted to be k points, in which case it's an alpha c as a square. And then, well, we have the following. If this is delta 4, then I can blow up. So this is 2.4, then I can blow up this point. And fourth, then I can plot this point and I have curves of a degree to two, and then I blot this point, and then I record across. So now I can do an iteration. And then after using this formula many times, we recover the following. So N for sigma d1, this is equal to 198. To 198 plus 8 times the sum time and then beta here. This is the phrase from the tool of definition of the pair. Okay, one if I have one pair of extension or as That's two trace from kinesk. Know one. Which is this two times one. I'm not sure I understand the toric blow up here. So what happened when I blew up the second time? Where did you get the proper transformer? Okay, so basically what I'm saying is I want to recover all the possible All the possible invariants for quadrant curves in P2. So, what I'm saying is when I use this rotation many times, so in order to understand this invariant, I need to understand this one to put a blow-up, right? I know, I just don't understand what this blow-up is. The second blow-up. So, here, I blow on this point, and then I cut on this. I think. Yeah, so that one I get. Yeah, so that one I get, you get F1. Here? Yeah, exactly. I get this one. What is that? The proper transforms. That looks like a P1 cross P1 somehow. It does, yeah. So the blow-up of a blow-up. This is by rationality. Yeah. No, no, no, no. But it's easy to define the end, it looks like you got back P P two at the end of this side, I guess. Yeah, P2 a bunch of times. Collow up P2 a bunch of times and I get P2. Okay, I mean it's not Yeah, the total destructor, the new recovery is going to be equal to P so the thing here is the H2, basically. Basically, I'm not claiming that this is going to be isomorphic. The curves in this linear system can be controlled by this story buffer. So, here, okay, so it's here, I don't know, it's maybe colors. So, here's an SH on the browser, and then here And then here I have the first digital divisor and then the torre boundary is different. Where's the proper transform of this value curve, the second picture, the rightmost undercurve? Well, that bottom right corner doesn't cut it off at the square, it cuts about halfway between. The square cuts about halfway between, and then you have to blow down the diagonal. So you're blowing down that curve, I guess. Yeah, you're blowing around the diagonal. If you get something with a square with like a corner cut off, then you can blow down. So if that's indeed what you're doing, and you're going to have to blow down two more things, this whole guy right here is a chromato transformation. I basically put three intersections with the torture boundaries, and then you blew down the proper transfer. Blew down the proper transfer to the other guy, and that's just the one motor transformation. That's not so. But if, again, maybe I will draw this picture. So here there's only one curve, P1, and then this curve corresponds to the following. So this is a quartic curve in P2. Yeah. What did you start off with? Start around with before you move up, or something you can start out. This is the only curve that survives, let's say, what we start off. I mean, we start counting like vertexes that now, so here there's a lot of quartics that I don't consider. I erased one picture. Error is one picture to you. So I have two situations, basically. I have these two points, then they collide, and this is the double point that they need to go up. So when I have this situation, these are going to zero. There's no change here. The only change happened when I have something like this. So basically, if I want to understand the difference between one environment and the other, I need to count these curves. These are the ones that give me actually the difference between these. The curves that behave like this, they are the same. They count the same in most curves. That's why here, after this tree, there's only one curve, right? Only one curve, right? And then this curve, it's dot curve. So the size of each of those edges is now one, or are they two? Two. Two. So basically here, the class beta is four times L. And now here is four times L minus two times one. SHR divisor is four times L minus two times one minus two times two. And then here is this four times. And then here is this four times L minus two times you want these type of college. There's only one class, but there's only dollars. I think slowing down the exception of it. Well, the reason I think, I'm not just nitpicking, but classically, Pondara Pandey and Putcha in that paper proved that just over C, those invariants, for say P2, are invariant in the Komona transformation. Two are invariant and the Comona transformations, which does something kind of non-trivial to invariance where it changes all the degrees. And it's this same set of birational moves. So if we, I wonder, maybe, I'm having a hard time following exactly what you're doing here, but maybe these refining variants, there should be a statement about, you know, how do they behave under cremona that would recover or oversee that she just came invariant under cremona. And that's actually a pretty powerful. Powerful tool. Like, if you look in their big table of numbers, the times anyway. Okay, no, but that is what I want to. All right, so two more minutes, one minute for the score, and then a minute for the colour. So if I use this trick to confuse this, let's say, universal invariant with respect to sin, then I have this invariance with this type of j. Variance with this ij and so on. I get the power root of beta i equal to j theta l. So now I have these coefficients and then I wanted to claim that these coefficients are actually quirational in both. So if we have another delta that is That is how I should. I mean, this only depends on the number of interior points. So, here there are only three interior points. So, if you will have to now, instead of considering this, I will consider a curve with degree to four. I still have only three. So, I'm going to have a constant term plus the same number here, there appears. So, this is as with the Lobkitch polynomial. The plot Getsche polynomials, this is, let's say, something that based on the Getsche conjecture, it should be able to be expressed on the characteristic classes of the service. And then a second comment is that there is correspondence here, so I've got to write it down without the details. Is that delta is four? Draw these k points and pairs of extensions, variety extensions, and queer theorem, quick mathematic, Quinn Holly, myself. Myself. Okay. But I've done a various correspondent theories. This environment for two can be computed as the sum of tropical curves that has its third configuration point. But here, we need to. The only process that we need is that this configuration point is vertically stretched. So I move the points in R2 and then I just need them to I just need to have Y coordinate very large purpose of a multiplicity that is very technical. And this is what I wanted. Thank you for your attention. Questions? So you mentioned, so here you're refining complex field counts in the models. Or cut your multiplicity also. They're like a very clean relationship. Not yet. Yeah, I guess this is one of the goals of this program, but so far we have a relationship. Also, like magically happens to be the same, but locally it looks very easy to different everything frequences out, so I think it seems very good. Two specializations. The two specializations, rank and signature, don't somehow correspond to Q plus one in IS. So there's no Q with a GW. There's nothing between that. Final theorem is assumed as a data extensionist? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can write it down. Yeah, see, this, as we can see, now this type will have coefficients, like a lot of coefficients, they're not one minus one. And actually, if we develop these, it gets very complicated. And for here, This, so if I have now a configuration point that is vertically stretched, my trivial curves are actually simplified in this curves like this. So what happens now we I have several points. Say these are a few points. Say these are a few points. Now we start pulling them together, colliding them together. So we're going to have four different types of phenomena. So we're going to have something that we're calling twin crease. So things that may look this would then stabilize. So a certain number. A certain number of them. Then we're going to have now trivial vertexes that are marked in the middle. So at the k point, all the points were, let's say, generic position, but this is not merged. So this let's call this I. This is going to have some weight, so this is depending on the weight at the station. We're going to have now crossings, so Have now crossings, so where before we have two k points that now have collided ones. And then regular olive tribal vertices, and then the multiplicity. This curve, this is going to be the product of this multiplicity. So let's say the multiplicity is for the trees, so it's different. Then times this multiplicity for this gamma time, then for the beta i, this is just a trace from the polar extension. The quadratic extension 2k.1 and then for the simple parallel vertices, this is as before. This is just the complex and the real divided by 2 times 1 plus the complex minus the real divided by 2 times minus 1. And then what is true? Four line so for the treat this is going to be the product of the weights that appear on them squared times Say the A1 version has called this A1 complexity of projects. N times the stand shoulder appear sometimes. So this is 2CI of 2CJ plus 2CK plus 1. This is because of the tree. So we should probably. Okay, this okay, let me finish this photo. This one line. This m i c i this is m i alpha h is m i is even for 1 plus m i minus 1 alpha
