Thank Grad, Paul and Sonia, for this wonderful opportunity of all being here. And I think I've learned, maybe more than learned, I should say, learned of the existence of a lot of things I didn't know this week and which were fantastic. And I think this gives me a lot of ideas and also work to go forward. Work to understand, which is good. So I'm going to talk about multi-green ideas with an support and all the results that are new are. That are new are work with Aldo Fonka and Manuela de Neger. So, in my talk, there's not much randomness, so there's no hand-onness in the results, but there's a hand-onness in the form of genericity in the tools that I use, and I will try to highlight that. So, the other button, thank you. So, I work in a multi-graded situation, so in a polynomial. Situation. So, in a polynomial ring, so I also realize there's a lot of different backgrounds. So, please feel free to ask if I'm not being clear if I assume that you know stuff that you know, etc. So, we're in a multi-graded polynomial ring. That means that instead of being the grading being over z, it is over z to the n. And I take a standard multi-grading in which the degree of each variable is a standard basis vector. So it's a vector with all zeros and one, exactly one and two, equal to one. Equal to one. And I call EI the vector that has the one in the position i. Okay? So a multi-grade, if you want, is a way of keeping the variables separate in blocks. So there's a block of variables of degree one, a group of variables of degree two, etc. And wrong button. So in the same way as you can write the polynomial ring as a direct sum of C-graded pieces, you can Z-graded pieces, you can do over Z to the N, you can look at the vector space of monomials whose multi-degree is a certain vector D. And this gives you a fine-dimensional vector space, and then you S the polynomial Hinge is the direct sum of all these graded pieces. And again, just as in the standard graded situation, you can say that an idea is multi-graded or homogeneous if it's direct sum of its graded pieces. Of his graded pieces. Okay, and one tool that I will need is the Hilbert series. So again, if you know the Z situation, you should be able to kind of follow by analogy, right? So the Hilbert series of S modulo I, so all my ideals now will be multigraded. So I is multi-graded. Then it makes sense to look at the degree D component of S modulo I, which has this dimension as a vector space. And we can Vector space. And we can collect all this information in a formal power series where I multiply this number by z to the d. Here, z to the d is really a placeholder for this monomial, which is the monomial in the variable z with exponent vector d. And this rational fact, sorry, this formal power series, just as in the z-graded case, turns out to be a rational function, which has as nominator, denominator. As nominator, denominator I denote by k, it's often called the k polynomial. And the denominator is a product of 1 minus z to the number of variables of degree ei. So zi appears as power the number of variables of the degree of the first one. Okay. And now the broad question that I want to discuss in this talk is In this talk, is when is an ideal radical? So I'm kind of fascinated by this type of question because it's a very easy to state and very general question, but like it can get pretty sophisticated pretty soon, pretty hard pretty soon. And I will give two answers to this question. One in terms of Hilbert series. I didn't mean to do that, I'm sorry. One in terms of Hilbert series, and one in terms of degrees of generality. And one in terms of degrees of generators. So my main tool for the study is Gerner basis. So let me recap quickly. So for Gerner basis, I need to fix an order on the monomials of the polynomial in. And then once I fix the order and I take a polynomial, I can pick among the monomials that appear the largest one. So that's called the leading term. And then, if I, for an ideal i, I can take the monomial ideal, which is generated by all the leading terms of its elements. And this is called the initial ideal of I. And, okay, clearly it depends on the order, because the leading term depends on the order. And it's a monomial ideal, so it's generated by a finite number of monomials. And these monomials are leading terms of some elements of i. In terms of some elements of i, which I call a Gerner basis, with respect to the order that I've chosen. So the Gerner basis, a Gerner basis of an idea is not necessarily a minimal system of generators. So if I start from a minimal system of generators, I may need to add polynomials to it to make the Grammar basis with respect to the order that I have chosen. But now, even when I have found maybe a German basis with respect to my order, if I change the order, this may no longer be a German basis. The order this may no longer be a grammar basis because the leading terms change. So, another concept which is interesting, and it was actually the initial motivation that we had to study this sort of idea and develop this theory is universal Gerne basis. So, a universal Gerner basis is a Gerne basis in every order. So, it's a set of polynomials, typically large, that has the property that for whatever order you choose, when you choose to choose a choice. Choose when you take the leading terms with respect to a certain order, then they give you the initial ideas, they generate the initial ideal. So it's not clear that there is a finite set of polynomials in an ideal that is a universal grammar basis, but it's true. It needs a proof, so it's not clear. And the two reasons why that brings this into play in what I'm going to discuss today. What I'm going to discuss today is that I'm going to look at ideals that have the same Hilbert series. And so it's very natural to look in this situation at initial ideals because an ideal and all of its initial ideals have the same Hilbert series. So if I have an ideal that has a certain Hilbert series and I want to study the family of all other ideals that have the same Hilbert series, the first natural thing to look at is its initial ideals. And the other thing is that The other thing is that I want to decide the radicality and instead of looking at I, I may choose to look at an initial ideal of I. So it is not true in general that if I is radical, then the initial ideal is radical. So a radical ideal may have no radical initial ideals. It may have one or a few radical initial ideals. But the other implication is true: that is, if the initial ideal is radical, then I is radical. If the initial ideal is radical, then I is radical. So in an attempt to prove that I is radical, I may look at its initial ideals and hope to find one which is radical, for example. So if there's questions, please ask, okay? Great. So let me make an example of Gernovas. So one example that I love and that was also kind of the motivating example that led us to this circle of ideas is ideas. Circle of ideas is ideas of minors, and in particular of maximum minors. So we take a matrix of variables whose entries are distinct variables, and then we can take the ideal of T minors of it for some T. And Ben Suf has proved that the T minors are a diagonal German basis. So this means that a diagonal German basis means that they are a German basis basis. means that they are a guerrilla basis with respect to an order that fixes as leading term the product of the elements on the diagonal of the mine. In general, these are not a universal Grounded basis, but they are if you take maximum minors. So maximum minors are universal grounded basis and this is not a simple result. So this was proved by in a series of two papers, one by Stunfens and Salewinsky. Jonfens and Salewinsky, which reduced this statement that the maximum minors are universal granted basis to a commitment. And this could be a picture was proved in a follow-up paper by Berstein and Southeast. And this tells us, and I kind of try to hint now at the connection, where I'm going and what the connection among all these ideas is. Now we have Now we have, we know that these minors are universal gradient basis. Now, if I look at the minor, it is a determinant, so it is a sum of square free monomials. And so if I know that, you know, independently of the order, when I pick a leading term, this will be square free. And so the initial ideal will always be square free. And so this tells us that, and then if the initial idea is square free, then the idea is square free. In fact, in this case, the idea is square free. Square free. In fact, in this case, the idea is prime, and this was known even before the Kern basis discussion. But in this case, and this is a rare example of an ideal that is such that all its initial ideas are square free. So they're radical. Square free are radical is the same. I may use the word interchangeably for more. Okay, so this is the main tool that I will use, and this is where the generic And this is where the genericity comes into play. So, the polynomial ring, once I put a multi-graded structure, I kind of hinted at the fact that it's like separating variables in blocks. And geometrically, you can think about it as this corresponds to a product of projective spaces, where the coordinates of the first projective space are the variables of degree E1 and the E1 and the ones of the second, the one of degree two, etc. And now you have a natural action of a product of general linear groups on this corner ring, which is just changes of coordinates, right? So each GLN acts on the corresponding factor by changes of coordinates. And then if you take the product, you have the changes of coordinates of this product of projective space that preserve the structure of the space. The structure of the space. And now you can chat. It's easy to see that if you take an ideal and you do a change of coordinates and then you take the initial ideal, the initial ideal may change. So it may depend on the coordinate set that you are in. It does in general depend on the coordinate set that you are in. So how However, there is a dense open set of coordinate changes, and here we need, for dense open set, we need the field to be infinite, such that this initial ideal does not depend on the change of coordinates. And then such initial ideal we call the generic initial ideal of I. So initial ideals depend, even if you fix an order, the initial ideal will depend on the coordinates that you're in. The coordinates that you're in, but there is a way to make it coordinate independent, which is you look in this autumn center. So you have an object which is now coordinate independent. So the generic initial ideal of I will be the same as the generic initial ideal of any GI. Does this work for the print type for the order? Yes, for any order. But the open set may change. Yeah, the open set depends on the order. Okay, so. So yeah, so it's called the genetic initial ideal and it's with respect to a certain order. So the genetic initial ideal will depend on your choice of order. But not on coordinates anymore. And this genetic initial ideal, in a sense, is nice, not only because it's now coordinate independent, but also because it has some special properties. In particular, it is Bohel fixed. So it's fixed by the action of the Bohel subgroup, which is The Bohel subgroup, which is in this multi-graded situation, so if you just look at one factor, the Bohel subgroup is the subgroup of upper triangular invertible matrices in here. So I guess you've ordered the coordinates by the term order. I order, yeah, I tend to always assume without saying that x1 is the first variable, then x2, then x3. Also when I write the genetic initial ideas. Also, when I had the genetic initial ideals, etc. Yeah, so this is the Bohel subgroup. Well, I know there's not only one Bohel subgroup, but like this is the one, the only one that plays a role for us. And then we take the products and we have a group that acts, a group of coordinate changes, and now this group fixes this ideal. And this is a strong property that is very false in general, and it just kind of comes together and is very tied to the generic initial ideal. Tied to the generic initial ideal. Are there questions at this point? I guess if there's a book scheme of all ideal, then every group logs have fixed points. Yes, this identifies one for this particular problem. And we'll come to that soon. Yeah, yeah, no, that's a great remark. So let's do an example first before we get to more sophisticated. More sophisticated things. So if I take this ideal, just I have a very simple-handed example where I take a 3x3 matrix of variable, I take its determinant, and I also take this variable here. Then if I take the standard grading, the genetic initial ideal is this. I have a linear form, I have a cubic, and it's a simple exercise to show that you do a random change of coordinates and you got this genetic initial ideal. So one variable and the cube of the next variable. Independently of the order for every order in this case. I'm not putting the order because in this case it's a very simple idea. So in this case for every order you get always the same thing. And if I do always make the assumption that the variables are order one-wise because Are order 11 is bigger than 12, bigger than 13. If I am in a matrix, I order them like this. I would say that's without loss of duality. So if I now grade, make a finer Z3 grading, I could say that the variables in the first row have degree 100, the ones in the second row have degree 010, and the one in the third row have degree 001. That this ideal is still. Then this ideal is still multi-graded, and we have one variable of degree 100 and one polynomial of degree 111 in it. And the generic initial ideal now turns out to be this. So again, I think it's very plausible. So you have the linear form. Once you do a general change of coordinates, sorry, I'm here. Once you do a general change of coordinate, this will become a linear form of degree 1, 0. form of degree 100, random. And here you will have something happen to this cubic, but it will still be in fact a polynomial of degree 111 because my changes of coordinate preserve the multi-grading. And this is what it turns out to be. So these are like the first, yeah. And so this is a matrix shear variety. It is, yeah. There's a theorem back there that may say it is where she wants. Say later if you want. Okay, so this example means to highlight the fact that I'm coming to in the next slide. So I'm aiming at understanding radicality. So if the genetic initial idea is radical, that's nice for us. And I'm going to call these ideas cataract surfers. So these ideas are the ideals that have a genetic initial idea, which That they have H and a kinetic idea, which is radical. And this notice that this depends heavily on the multi-grading that I choose, because, like in the next slide, in the previous slide, if I choose the Z grading, this is not radical, but if I choose a finer grading, the Z3 grading, this becomes radical. So if I separate the variables more, that's the intuition, it becomes radical. And so there's like an optimum, a game of optimality there to be played in the sense that. Played in the sense that if you have an ideal that you're interested in studying, you want to make the multigrading finer so that there's more chance that the genetic initial idea is radical, but you still want to keep it homogeneous. So there's only so much that you can refine the multigrading and keep the idea homogeneous. So, okay, but I will not discuss this. I just wanted to point it out. So for us, the multigrading is fixed, and so things are either radical or they're not radical. So things are either radical or they're not radical in that multi-grade. And now this is our main technical theorem. And it says that if you have two well-fixed multi-graded ideals, they have the same Hilbert series. If one of them is radical, then they coincide. So notice that I'm not asking for an inclusion. I'm just saying if one is radical, If one is radical, then they are the same, and they have to be bored fixed. Okay? So, again, this is CDG means concave and high-definition. So, this means like the Borel fixed point, the Borel fixed point, as opposed to the Borel fixed sub-variety. Yes. And so, in particular, if I were to look at the multi-graded Hilbert scheme of all the ideals that are multi-graded and have that Hilbert series, Series, I would have that this had a co-Bohel fixed point is the generic initial idea of all of those, right? Because the generic initial idea of I is Bohel-fixed. If there is a Hadiko-Bohel-fixed idea that has the Hilbert series, then that's it. It's the J. Okay? And this is what makes everything work somehow. Okay? Or everything I'm gonna say works because of this if you want sim simple observation, huh? Simple observation. So now, just to summarize a little bit, so if I have some ideal with some, so I fix some multi-grade Hilbert series, I look at this Hilbert scheme of all ideals that have that Hilbert series. If there is a radical Borel fixed point in there, that's the only Borel fixed point. So every other ideal will have that as its genetic initial ideal. In particular, it will have this property that we call Cartier Synthesis because it will. Called be in Cartex sensors because it will have a radical genetic initial ideal. In particular, notice that the genetic initial ideal does not depend on the order because there's only one goal fixed point in this Hilbert scheme. So for every order, that will be the gene. And in particular, the thing that interested us when we started looking at that is that this gene would be the gene at the same time of the ideal and of. The same time of the ideal and of all its initial ideals, because all its initial ideals are on the same inverse scheme because they have the same inverse shapes. Okay, in particular for concerning the radicality, which is what I'm trying to discuss today, and if the gene is radical, then I is radical, because it has an initial ideal which is radical up to a change of coordinates, which does not affect the property of being radical. Of being radical, and also all its initial ideas are radical. So, if an idea has a radical gen, all its initial ideas are radical. And itself, it is also radical. And the reason why we started studying this was that we were interested in universal verdabasis. And this gene helped us the fact that there was this object, which that is the gene, which at the same time was the gene of the idea. At the same time, was the gene of the idea, and all of its initial ideas helped us to control by looking at a single object, we could control all the initial ideas at the same time. And this was our main tool that allowed us to say things about universal Gerne basis. For example, I would like to know in which degree are the elements of a universal German basis. So that would be one of the main questions that interested us. Is there a universal German basis? Is there a universal grand basis, for example, in the degrees of the minimal generators? And if I control the degree of the generators of the gen, I can tell something about the degrees of the generator of I, but also about its initial ideals. And that's what tells me where in which degrees I find a universal grain of basis. Yes? Do you have any idea how likely it is that I sit? Yeah, it's unlikely, and I will come to that. Yeah, it's unlikely. It's very strong. It's a very strong condition. You see that you got a very, this is a very rigidity, it's a very, it's a strong rigidity, so it doesn't happen so often. But there's also a good balance there in the choosing the, so let's say I'm interested in, I will come to an example in a moment, but let's say that I'm interested in looking at ideas of marketers. So I need to choose them suitable. So I need to choose a suitable multigrading, which I hope will make that the gene is radical. And of course, there may be none. So often there is none, but in some cases there is one. And then there's this balancing act of finding it. Yes. There's one big class actually for toric ideals. If your matrix A that makes the toric ideal is unimodular, it's a big class of total unimodular. All of them have this property. Property. Well, it's a big class, but I think a class of all. No, no, no, I understand. Interesting about interesting is for quality. Yeah, I will come to it. So we have tried to find families, right? But this works more as a technique than like as a, oh, often it will be true. So you have a family that interests you, and if this works, then you can get a lot out of it, but often it will not work. But this is what was already fun. Yeah, that's a big cut. Well, it's not a big cut, but it's a fun cut. Well, it's not a big class, but it's a fun class, you know. It's a relevant one. It also appears. It also appears. So, in fact, I didn't know that, so I will ask you maybe about it. Yeah, I will ask you later about it. Okay, so I will ask you about it. Okay, so you can, you should, actually. So, so, in particular, this answer my for the first question that I put up there. So, in for a fixed silver series. For a fixed Hilbert series. So if I take a multi-graded Hilbert series, it is the same saying that every multi-graded idea with a Hilbert series is radical. There is a radical and border-fixed ideal which has that Hilbert series. And there exists a Cartesian surface ideal which has the Hilbert series. So this is what I mean when I say the result is not generic. The result is actually for everything, but the tool is generic. But the tool is genetic. So you prove something genetically and then you are able to extend it to everything. So in my statement, there's no genetic ever, but the tools are very generic. Well, maybe for me. I don't know, probably so. To me, that's as random as it gets. Okay. So that, in a sense, answers the first question, which is when does the Hilbert series tell us that an idea is that the series tell us that an ideal is radical. So this implicitly characterizes whichever series have the property that all the ideals that Hilbert series are hadical. It's not easy to then say that Hilbert series has it or not. Or in fact for a concrete one maybe it's not that hard because you could try to construct the gene and if it works it works and if it doesn't then you know. If you got the gene which is not handical then it doesn't. Yeah. So maybe if It doesn't. So maybe for a certain Hilbert series, you can decide, but it's not easy to say, oh, there's this numerical criterion on the Hilbert series that tells me it has the property yes or no, so that I wouldn't know how to black. So do you have questions? So I keep going. So with my honey example, sugar, the first sugar, it's a meal variety, the simplest one. So here the genetic One so here the genetic initial ideal in the Z3 grading was this one, and so this ideal is Carteret's surface, it has a radical genetic initial ideal. And in fact, this allows you to say that the minimal generators, these two minimal generators are universal Garnet bases. And I'm taking this one is just the determinant module x11 when I set x11 equal to 0. And it's just for... What's the induction? And it's just for picking the lead term to work, right? Otherwise, I don't always get the right leading term when I extract the lead term, depending on the order. And so this tells me, as I said, that every initial ideal is radical. And in this case, even a complete intersection, height, because the gene is a complete intersection. So a complete intersection means it's height 2, so it corresponds to a scheme of coding. So it corresponds to a scheme of codimension two and is defined by two equations, exactly. Yeah? So every initial ideal here, this shows that every initial ideal of this is a complete assumption. Okay, it's a very simple example. Okay, and so proving that an ideal scatter surface can be hard. In some cases, you can control the gene and you can kind of argue that the gene is a certain thing and then you. That the gene is a certain thing, and then you can check if it's radical or not. But in general, it's hard. And so, one thing that we tried to do beyond just looking for families where this was true was to find results in the direction of if we have this Cartesian surface ideal, then we can now produce all these other ones. So there are these operations that preserve the property. And so the first comes from a theorem of Bréon. So this is a, I was saying to someone in the break. I was saying to someone in the break, so this is an example of a theorem which was proved. Well, this puts two theorems together, but like the heavy lifting is done by a theorem of Brill, which was proved in characteristic zero. And then this year it was proved by Camina Lewis and Conca with completely different tools, more algebraic, for any field. So not even an infinite field, like even for a finite field. All this works for her. Finite field, all this works for everything that I say works for every field. You can finite fields, everything. And together with something that we proved in our papers, so we have a series of papers about these ideas, shows that if you have an idea which is cartridge surface and you extract an associated prime, then this is also cartridge. And these theorems to me are interesting because you completely lose control over what the hypersides is. The hypocrisies, but you still know that the property is there. You completely lose track of what is the gene, but you know it stays radical. And these are other operations that preserve radicality of the gene. So you take a linear form in this multi-graded setting. A linear form is a form which is homogeneous of degree EI and you go modulo that or you That or you go modulo that and then you restrict to that. So, this corresponds to taking a hyperplane section or taking a hyperplane section and then looking in that hyperplane. You can do the complement. You can look at the if you think of the scheme, you can think of the complement of the scheme, so the scheme which is outside of the local sign equals zero. You can do a projection, so take a subset of the coordinates and A subset of the coordinates and contract your ideal to that subring, these all preserve the property. Yes? This is for all L? Yes, this is for all L. And this is... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you can pick anything. And this is the beauty of it. It just has to be multi-graded. So it just has to preserve the multi-graded structure. But it can be very badly zero divisor. Very badly zero divisor. And this is actually what helps us a lot to prove that certain things are pattern sulfurs. You prove it in the modulic situation and then you go modulo and you substitute each variable with any linear form that you want. But in the end you can still infer the original idea was radical by going through that. Yes, yes. Let me do an example. So I would maybe I want to look at this. I want to look at maximum, minus. This. I want to look at maximum minus of a matrix of variables. And maybe for this one, I can prove that it's calculated. I mean, I can. And now, but that's the easier case because that's independent variables as entries. And the case that I really is, which is dear to my heart, is when you have linear forms in the matrix. But that, ground and basically become immediately very hard if you put linear forms inside of variables. And now with this technique, we can prove, oops, we can prove. Oops, we can prove so that this is Cartensurfius, and now we can put linear forms in the matrix instead of variables, and this ideal maximum minors is still Cartensurfius. So we have no control over what happens to the Heber series. No control a priori over what happens to the genetic initial ideal, although in this case afterwards we're able to describe it communatorily. But a priori we have no control over what happens to the genetic initial ideal, but we know that particular But we know that radicality is preserved. And so I can take a matrix and I can put in it linear forms with the property that the linear forms in the ith row only involve the variables of degree EI, but beyond that, which is strong, which is strong, but beyond that, I can do anything I want. I can put a lot of zeros, I can have an idea of a low height, I can put a lot of repetitions, or I can put forms that are linearly independent from each other. Forms that are linearly independent from each other. I can do anything. The co-dimensions can vary greatly. The geometric properties can vary greatly, but the properties sit true. So this allowed us to prove that for this idea of constructing this way maximum minors of a matrix of linear forms with this multi-graded structure, there is a universal graded basis which consists of. Basis which consists of linear combinations of the minors, so which is in the same degree as the minors, and we do that by controlling the degrees of the generators of the J. And in fact, in the case that we have fewer rows than columns, we get that the minors are universal granular bases themselves. I don't know if I should go into detail why that makes a difference. Makes a difference, maybe just to hint at why displays a hole. When you do maximum migration, you have less holes than columns. Do I have less holes than columns? No, do I have, I have, yeah, I was thinking this doesn't work. So I have less columns than rows, okay? When I do maximum minors and each maximum minors, if I have less columns, each maximum minors uses all the columns and a choice of rows. So each maximum. Of rows. So each maximal minor is in a different multi-degree. While if I'm in the other situation, all the maximal minors are in the same multi-degree, which corresponds to I always choose the same rows and then a different set of columns. And this is what makes the difference between there is a universal granted basis in the degree of the generator and there is a universal granted basis which actually is a minimal system of generators. So in fact what we prove here is more. We prove that any multi-graded minimal system of generators Multi-grading, meaning of systemological hesitors, easy universal gradient basis. Okay. Yes? So, but one question, because I'm still passing this example. The groups of variables are just rows or columns? Rows. And you have more rows, you have more rows than columns. So exactly. This is the reason why I need to fix rows and columns is because then I want to say if I have more rows, if I have more columns. So if I have more holes than columns, when I take When I take maximum minors, I'm making a choice of rows. And so each minor will be in a different degree. That's what plays a role here. And universal means for every term order, but with this multi-grade. No, there's no multi-grade in the term order. I'm not asking degree compatible. Any multi-grade. Any term order. So this is also the beauty, right? So this is also the beauty, right? We started with the idea that we wanted to study this Granny basis or universal German basis of ideals of maximum minors on the matrix of linear forms in the Z grading. And we can take any order. And so the multi-grading affects your reasoning through the gene and it affects you in the sense that. And it affects you in the sense that it gives the structure of the matrix. But then you can forget about it. It's like when you have an idea which is Z homogeneous and you do a Gernon basis or maybe the ideal is not homogeneous, it makes no difference in a sense for the term order. And here is the same. The homogeneity does not make a difference for the term order. A difference for the term order at all. But the way that we use the multi-homogeneity is that we find like this delicate point of balance which makes, if possible at all, the gene radical. So the gradient structure affects the gene because the Bohel subgroup changes and the group that acts changes with the motor game. I hope to have clarified a bit. I mean, I know it's a bit. Yeah. I mean, we've been thinking about this for like 10 years, so I have been very clear. Elisa, is it part of the idea that the fact that the footboard algorithm is sort of friendly with respect to whatever grading have all sorts of gradings? Sorry? This is because if you start with things that are graded, If you start with things that are that are graded in some sense, then then the then the bookwork album respects that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it does know. It goes together with that. Yes, exactly, exactly. Yes, yes. Okay, so now let me switch gear and come to the heading support, which is the thing that I promised to talk about in the episode. Maybe I took a little too much time, but okay. So again, this is my hunting examples. I have this idea which is generally. I have this ideal which is generated by the determinant and this entry, and the gene is this. And now I know this ideal is catarasurphalus. This is a complete intersection. Every initial ideal of this is a complete intersection. I have the whole. And now I want to look at just any ideal generating in those same degrees. So I'm going to take a linear form of degree 100 and a polynomial of homogeneous always, and multigraded of degree 111. And I take the idea that the One-on-one, and I take the idea that they channel hate. And now, the history here is the following: so, if, and I take them in any way possible, okay, including them being zero or being very special choices. So, if one of them is zero or if L divides F, this idea is principle. So, okay, it's very easy to treat. So, let's look at the other case. In the other case, I have a regular sequence in certain degrees. So, it will have the same Hilbert series as this gene. So it will have the same Hilbert series as this gene. So this gene will be its gene. And so this idea is cartridge, so it's radical, and all its initial ideas are radical, etc., etc. So in this specific example, which is very, very easy, I can just look at the degrees of the generators and say any ideal which is generated in those degrees, even by a non-minimal system of generators, like arbitrary generators in those degrees, will be radical. And that's our question. So, after we observe this, we ask ourselves: can we tell that the idea is radical just by looking at the generators? Or maybe better said, are there collections of degrees of generators which have the property that every ideal generating those degrees is always? So, let's say we start with principal ideals. So, for a principal ideal, I'm asking myself. Principal idea: I'm asking myself: Is a polynomial square free? So, and this, if you think about it just a minute, you'll see a polynomial is square free if and only if it has a degree which is bounded from above. Sorry, not the polynomial. If I fix a multi-degree, every polynomial of that multi-degree is square-free if and only if the multi-degree is bounded from above by the O1 vector. And you see that in particular hymnomics is very clear for hemon. Hemonomials is very clear for a monomial. I can always look at this monomial, this is square free if and only if the degree is bounded from above by the O1 act. Okay? And now I can, so I'm only gonna look at degrees which are below this bound. And I, in order to write down sets of degrees, I will write. Our height. So each vector corresponds to the set of positions where we have the one. So each vector, which is below the all one vector, has entries one and zero only. And so it will correspond to the set of position where we have the ones. And now, if I have a collection of degrees, I can think of that as a collection of sets. And I want this to be a multi-set because then I may want... That because then I may want to take two generators of that degree, so I may want to have two times the same degree in my list. So this is how I write the degrees. And I ask myself, do I, can I, when is it that a support has the property that every ideal generated in those degrees is radical? Does the question make sense? Does the question make sense? Yeah? Okay, so, and in the previous slide we didn't quite prove, but we kind of saw the idea of why this is radical. Why every ideal generated in degree one and then all zeros or one one one is radical. Always radical. And in fact, always got tests of those resentment. I'm sure we can get somehow the definition of radical support if I could see. Radical support, if I could see, I don't want to have to worry about the polynomial hinge. So I want to say I choose the degrees and then I can work in any polynomial hinge that I want, which means any field that I want and any number of variables of each multi-degree that I want. So these MIs are the, they tell you how many variables you have. So in multi-degree, So in multi-degree E1, you have M1 plus 1 variables. So this tells me how many variables I have in that degree, and the K is the ground field. And I don't want to have to care about that. So I want to say a support is radical if, whenever I put myself in any polynomial ring, any field, any number of variables, if I choose arbitrarily polynomials of those degrees, Of those degrees, I get a radical ideal. Tells you how the degree sequence arises from the radical support, if I understand. Yes, the radical support characterizes the degree sequences which have the properties, characterizes the degree sequences, which have the property that every ideal generated in those degrees is radical. And what we saw in the first example, oops, I'm sorry, I Oops, I'm sorry, I going down the hatch. What we saw here was that if I take any polynomial in degree 100 and any other in degree 111, the ideal that they generate is radical. So this is the idea I'm trying to generalize. I choose degrees and then I want to say every ideal generated in those degrees is radical. For any choice of L and F, even they have special choices. Okay, and now I could do the same for Cartier surface. The ideal before was also Cartier surface, so I could ask myself the same question for Cartes surface. I could say, I look for collections of degrees that have the property that whenever I take polynomials in those degrees, they generate an idea which is quartos. So an idea that has a radical gene. And of course, why? And of course, why do I do this? Because I understand these ideals, to a certain extent at least. And because these ideas are radical. So if an idea is catastrophic, then it's radical. So a catastrophic support is a radical support. Okay. And now I think this is maybe the last thing that I want to explain. If we have a regular sequence, Sequence that has a certain support and it generates a Cartesian surface ideal, then every ideal generated in those degrees will be Cartesophus. And this is the reason. The reason is this. This is easy to see in an example. So you have, I take a regular sequence, which is also patterned surface. This I claim, I am not proving it, but I claim it is the case. So you have this. I'm now calling my variables y. This. I'm now calling my variables y because I want them to be new variables. So this is something in degree 1, 1, 0, and then this is something in degree 101. For example, if I'm over Z3. And now I take two polynomials of the same multi-degrees, and I look at this ideal here. First, at this. So this ideal here is a complete intersection because if I choose Because if I choose a suitable order that makes F1 and F2 the leading terms, the leading terms are a complete intersection. Right? So this idea is a complete intersection and its Cartesian surface, because it has the same Hilbert series as this, as its initial ideal, this is its initial ideal. Sorry, this is its initial ideal. And so now I go modular things, which I, again, I don't know being non-serviced. Again, I don't know being non-zero divisor, and in fact, in this case, they are zero divisors, but I don't care, just go modulo, and I get G1G2. G1G2 may be very far from being a Hyper sequence. I mean, in this case, I only have two, but you know, if you have many polynomials, this may be very far from being a Hyper sequence. It can be anything, example, as long as it's in the high degrees. Okay, I'm hopping up. Now I'm trying to hop up, but I wanna say one more thing. But I want to say one more thing because for this we have so for the Hilbert series I said we don't I don't have a numerical characterization for which Hilbert series are Hilbert series of Carter-Sufus things or generic initial ideals so what fixed the radical ideals but for these we have a combinatorial characterization is the following so for a multi-set I write a graph which has a vertex A graph which has as vertices the elements of the set of the multi-set, and two vertices are joined by an edge if they have an element in common. And I put a label on the edge which is which element they have in common. So here, for example, this is one, two, this vertex corresponds to this set, this vertex corresponds to that set, and they have two in common. So I put the two here. So I write this graph. Graph. Now, if I take a collection of, for example, if I take a collection of multi-degrees which have no intersection, so no ones in corresponding positions, and then this graph has no edges, it just has the vertices. And it's easy to see that an ideal, that this is radical support. That this is radical support. An idea which has the support is always radical. Maybe I, in the interest of time, I just keep going. Okay, so I have an example of one which is and one which is not. And here I have a cycle. I wrote down something which will have a cycle as its graph. And maybe I can make the picture. So we have the set 1, 2, 2, 3, and they are joined by the edge. 2-3 and they are joined by the edge 2, and then we have 3-4 and they are joined by the edge 3, etc. And I just like keep going. And here I have 1 where this vertex is 1, 2 and this vertex is 1n. So I have a cycle which has edge labels all the numbers. And in this case, this is. And in this case, this is not a hadical support, and the easiest way to see it is to exhibit an idea which is not hadical and is supporting those degrees. And the intuition is that the cycle is the one that allows you to write down the element that proves that the idea is not hadical. And so this is our theorem. Our theorem says that if you take a multi-set, so a collection of degrees, then, and this is the graph, then the following are equivalent. The following are equivalent. So, this is a radical support that means every ideal generated in those multi-degrees is radical in any polynomial hinge of your choice. This is a Cartesulphus support, so every ideal generating those degrees is Cartesulphus. There is a suitable polynomial hang where Where you find a regular sequence in those degrees, and the ideal that they generate is scattering some false. So, this is for a suitable polynomial because to have a regular sequence, you need to have enough variables, essentially. And the cycle, sorry, the graph has no cycles with non-constant edge labels. So, this is our commit. So this is our combinatorial characterization of these properties. And so this answers the question of what are the collection of degrees that have the property that every ideology in those multi-degrees are handled. And so I think my time's over, so I feel I finished that you can ask your question. Oh that guy. Could you remind me one of where the edge tables? I'm sorry?
