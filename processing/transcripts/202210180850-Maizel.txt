Thanks, Verenika. It's a great pleasure to be here. Looking forward, I mean, it has been a birthday, so it'll be exciting, looking forward to the coming one. So, I apologize for the very generic title, but actually, I was not sure until yesterday exactly to talk about. Now that I know the audience, I could forget it. So, I'm going to talk about that very root formation, and that's the model we're using in the lab. So, to study. Using in the lab, so to study microgenesis. I'll spare you the details of why later roots are important for the planet, just jumping into the process itself. So, everything starts with lateral root founder cells, that are a group of cells regularly spaced, located into the pericycle. They prime early when the cells leave the neuristom. They elongate, have all the physical and visual attributes of differentiated cells, but and Differentiate itself, but don't do much for a while. But later on, in a process called imitation, they reacquire the competency to divide and proliferate. They form a so-called premortum, this little dome here, which is pushing and making its way out of the primary root in a process for emergence. As it does so, it organizes itself in a new, so it establishes a new stem cell niche and reconstitutes the And we constitute the tissue organization you have set up in the established primary move doing a real genesis. So it's a very nice system because we can trigger it. It's happening all the time. It starts with a were you guys not able to hear me since the beginning? It should go through the L. Yes, that's what I should. So we're all going to. Yes, I see as I can. There we go. I see as I can click on the two. Yes, well, let's move on. Oxin is playing a role at every single step of this process from the priming to the reentry and perforation and the emergence process. So we're studying also. If we zoom in and look at what's happening in the very early phases of a rotinitiation, everything starts with Everything starts with a pair of xylenopol pericycl cells that accumulate high level of oxygen. They radially swell, the nuclei migrate, you see that a little movie down, and they divide asymmetrically. There is an accident of symmetry into this process that is centered on the shared wall between the Abbott and Founders. Later on, and this is for what Later on, and this is for what we call the stage one material pimonia. Later on, the cells regularly switch and diffusate their plane of division to generate so-called stage two, stage three, and so on. And the process is going on, and the primordium emerges by transversing, actually going through literally the endodermis. And when it reaches the cortex and the epidermis by separating the cells above and pushing them up. We studied this process for quite some time. This process for quite some time now, and what we were particularly interested in is how is the regularity into tissue organization properly? And what we know is that the first stages are essentially determined instinctive. In particular, the execution of the first asymmetric cell division is absolutely essential to put the whole developmental program on the right track. Whereas the remaining phases of homogeneous and tissue organization can be described as essentially self-organized. I mean, it's pretty generic in development, but that's what we see. In development, but that's what we see happening here. So, as I said, execution of the first asymmetric division is essential, and very importantly, this ability or the fact that the founder cells originally expand before the first intelligence is also important. And this is the aspect we're particularly interested in at the moment. So, oxyn plays an essential role in this, but the role of oxygen here is quite complex. So, you have to keep in mind here that what's happening is you have a group. That's what's happening is you have a group of cells that decide to grow within an area where nobody else is growing nor dividing. And I think it's a very interesting system because most likely mechanics and coordination of behavior between cells gene is playing an essential role. And one way to illustrate this is to see, to look at the role of oxygen. So we have ways, experimenting, going brushing over the details about the hull here, we have ways to switch off tissue specifically oxygen. Switch off tissue-specifically oxygen signaling. And if we switch off inducing, so if we switch off oxygen signaling in the founder cells, we prevent lateral formation happening. The swelling does not happen, the division does not happen, it stops there. Interestingly, if we do the same, but inhibiting oxygen signaling in the endoderis, which is the layer right above, we achieve the same phenotype. So we prevent the pericycle to expand and initiate. And that tells us that the prostope. That tells us that the crosstope between the underlying pericycle is absolutely essential to license the cells in red here, the funder cells, to swell and undergo division. So what could be the nature of this communication? So what we know is that the funder cells accumulate high level of oxygen, that's depicted in blue in this schematic. They accumulate it by directing flow from going downward from the shoot to the root. They also actively. They also actively get oxygen from the endotherms via PIM3, and they actually have a high level of OX1 and other transport influx carrier. So they try to maximize oxygen input. And it has been shown that if you make clones of cells that have high oxygen level, DKIN, this is a sufficient switch to trigger lateral routine CHC. What then happens is that the fungus cells gradually expand, the flow of oxine is directed towards Of oxy is directed toward the endodermis, which starts to accumulate oxygen, and this unleashes its response. It can start to lose volume actively and make place for the pre-module to grow. So, what we would like to understand is what can be the mechanisms that allow this cells to re-enter the vision. So, one of the first things we did a couple of years ago was to look into the transcriptional response of lateral. Transportation response of lateral reformation, whether there was anything related to cell wall remodeling. As the cell is swelling, we can make the assumption that maybe cell wall composition will be added. So we pitched one gene called expensive A1, which it's all published. I'm just going to do the graphical abstract of these things, that is expressed exclusively, I mean, very specifically into the fungus cell when they are about to stop swelling and when they first up to the point of the first division. If we have terrorists, If we have turn, so it could make mutants of this expensina1, we curture the ability of these cells to expel. So, telling us that maybe this enzyme is indeed essential or important for this change in geology. The second thing that intrigued us is how to make a cell expand more on one hand here, where the two cells abut, versus not so much in the opposite end, because this radial expansion is asymmetric. Radar expansion is asymmetric. So, we obviously look at microtubules. We also look at the actin networks, wanting to know how the whole cellular machinery is reorganized so that you get an asymmetric celebration. So, quickly about actin. In an oxygen-dependent manner, the actin network reorganizes itself and the nuclei migrate toward this command cell wall. And this migration is almost simultaneous on both ends. So, this coordination is quite intuitive. On the microtubural network, On the microtubule network, what we see is that microtubule rotate while being kind of editable along parallel to the long axis of the cell, 2.90 degree kind of, and their organization is more heterogeneous toward the center, so-called the central domain, than it is at the periphery, where they are quite tidy and perpendicular to the long axis. What we know is that these mechanisms of microtubular reorientation So, microtubular reorientation amplifies the difference in growth. They're not actively driving them. I mean, we don't think they are, it's not microtubules switch, so they go polo and then swelling can occur. They probably help to amplify this process. So, given the role of oxygen into hypogenetics, oxyn is, I think, seen as someone called once, oxyn is the cell. Called or rot once oxygen is the cell wall disruptor, and that's the intrinsic function of oxygen would be to actually disrupt cell wall properties. It might be its original function. So, oxyne leads into this feedback or biomechanical feedback that many people work on, where oxym alters pin expression that alter the pattern of oxine, but also by changing the several properties can modify the mechanical properties of tissue, which piggyback onto. Of tissue, which piggyback onto the fluoroxid because the pin transporter has been shown to have their localization influenced by the pattern of stress in cells. So given this, we were wondering whether we could model this reinitiation of growth using the pattern of oxine and its effects on the cell. So, this is work that we did in collaboration with the Alim Lab at the With the Alim Lab at the TU Munich, and that's work of Joao. So, I will quickly go over the details. So, Joao has set up a modeling framework in which he has a mechanical vertex model, and he combines it with an oxym transport model. And the two stub models are basically linked by two parameters. The fact that the stress, the intensity of stress coupling will influence the polarization and the localization of the field transporter. Localization of the pin transporter and pin transporter, and we compute the oxygen transport in return. We modify the cell wall loosening, this A parameter here, so this R is the parameter here, that will influence the mechanisms. So the model works as follows: You modify, you compute the equilibrium of the mechanical model, stabilize, compute the effect of oxygen, you put the mechanical You put the mechanical model all of equilibrium and you go back. And then this model was actually implemented into realistic cellular template derived from actual measurements of these real ratios. And what the model has predicted, I'm just going straight to the conclusion, is that the shared base in the two farms here, has a higher extensibility than any other wall into the side. Extensibility than any other wall into this harder surface. Not it's quite intuitive. This higher extensibility leads that when radial expansion just starts, the clean relocalize from this interface to the periclinal wall and help to drive oxygen toward the endodermis. The standards, the response in the endodermis, and what a parameter that we feel extremely important. Extremely important to the model is not so much the thickness of the endogermus but the bending modulus of the inner wall to that. So if this bending modulus is lower, this is sufficient to trigger the swell and amplify the swell. So we are in the process of validating some of these predictions made. And I would like just to talk about the last point here, because in collaboration with Joe Bermer, we were looking in quite detailed into the organization of the In quite detailed into the organization of the microtubules in the endodermis. And what we realize is that in the endodermis, the microtubules have a different organization whether they're facing the premodal or they're facing the cortex. And they're much more tidy when they face the xylene pole, so the xynum and the pericycle than on the other side. And when the primordial is initiating, they quickly reorganize on that phase. Where we realize it could interfere with the dynamics, and we realize that this reorganization is essential for. Reorganization is essential for the swelling to happen and the output. And we actually identified one map, one map 70-5, which, once mutated, prevents the endothermist to alter the change. So it remains targeted for much longer. It's not complete block, it's real accommodating, but this leads to a tremendous delay to the outblock. And this also, by the way, changed the tissue organization of the model. So, what we think is happening is that microtubules and MAP17 on the pericycle side of the endovirines are actively contributing into sensing, maybe also lowering this banding modulus. Oh, it remains to be investigated and help to canalize the outgrowth of the commodity. So, what are my expectations for this workshop? I think I and maybe others will need tools to investigate several properties. Investigate several properties and several and mechanical properties in tissues, ideally non-invasive and cheap and accurate. We need, I think, tools for targeted and cell-specific cell modifications, more better characterized than the one we some organs are currently using. I'm slightly frustrated and share that. And globally, any input that the physicists and the biologists here have around the table about how we could tackle this. About how we could tackle this basic equation of what to make the few steps with initiate group in an otherwise rigid issue. Thank you very much. Those are the people that did the work and the two main collaborators on three main collaborators I mentioned along the way. Thank you. Okay. Yes. Daniel? Very nice talk. What's the role of the cells that are surrounding? The cells that are surrounding these founder cells. So, if you go back one slide. Certainly. So, your red cells, I forget what you call them. The founder cells. But they're surrounded by other cells. And in order for them to swell, the other cells have to give, kind of like the guard cell subsidiary cell system we heard today. So, do you know anything about that? Do they have a role? Because if they don't have a role, then all the mechanics. Then all the mechanics has to do with what's going on with these cells that are packed in a tissue? It's a very good question. So, first off, the scales on this diagram, not any of these cells actually much longer than they are. So, as far as we can tell, like in terms of marketing organizations, things like this, they really, where most of us use this cell as control for, so they don't seem to do much, contribute much. They don't swell at all. Really, the swelling starts with. swelling starts with so this within this cell the others don't don't alter don't see an alternative and in terms of um gene expression program uh we see that these cells are get reprogrammed and they lose they turn on some marker lose other markers but these ones don't so they seem to be not responsible and and do you have any direct data on the modulus of the wall or or any other mechanical properties of the wall or is just inferred Mechanical properties of all, or is just inferred from you? I know, no, okay. Not us, and I don't think this exists. You are a Vietnamese cortex, another Derenes. Yeah, it's quite standard. We put a lot of hope in Boi-Man spectroscopy, but it's not paying off at the moment. So, sorry, first, Enrico, please. Hi, hi, thank you very much for that nice talk, Alexi. I want to comment on there's an interesting, first of all, there's an interesting description. There's an interesting first of all. There's an interesting discrepancy with your cartoon and your, and I don't mean this in a bad way. If we look at your cartoon of growth, what you see is, if you go back a few slides, of the emergence of the lateral meristem there. So you see that the left boundary of your lateral root is straight, okay, vertical. Do you understand what I'm saying? Three? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So it's it goes vertically, your left boundary, but actually, what's going on is it's swelling in both directions. All right, so if we look at the actual data when we when we go further down and you show actually a lateral route forming, I mean, let me play the movie, yes? Not this one. I think you've got further down, you've got a picture of the lateral root forming. Maybe here. There, you go. And you'll see it's not straight, it bends in both directions. Okay, I agree. And so that's interesting in terms of the concepts. People think of growth happening in one direction, but actually it's in both. But the easiest way to generate that, to my naive way of thinking, is that you weaken the cross walls. It's the horizontal walls you need to weaken, because they're like struts that are holding this thing together, right? And if you weaken those struts, then the thing would bulge out. At least that's one way of thinking. Bulge out, at least that's one way of thinking about it. So, is there any evidence that those cross walls, do you see what I'm saying? It's like the ladder walls. If you weaken the ladder walls, then the thing would do that. Is there any evidence for that? I mean, as related to previous points, we have not measured the properties. And that's type of experiments exactly what I would like to be able to do is to target several modifications to these anticliner walls to see whether this is sufficient. To see whether this is sufficient to drive expansion, you spot it very well with the, and I apologize for simplifying my schematic, but here on the left, in green, you have the control condition, and in magenta, you have the mutant for MAP7T. And it is straighter in the wild type than it is in the Newton. And this is a phenotype we see over and over when we had other mutants in which we alter the ability of the endodermist to accommodate. Of the androidair needs to accommodate, and what we see is that the pre-module grows, I will not say growth inwards, that it's compressed on the xyland side. I have read, I don't know what the evidence pretends for this, that the steel is more rigid than the rest. This is actually one of the assumptions we put in the model. But yeah, you're right. And this is what we love to do: weaken this anti-climate wall and see whether it's a situation. Is this situation? Tony, yeah, just quickly. Um, it seems like the endothermal cells need to also maybe become depressurized to some degree, right? And the trigger pressure in the primordium cells has to increase. So in addition to all of your wish lists, I think having ways of measuring trigger pressure in all of these cells simultaneously would be helpful, right? Yes, definitely. What Avin mentioned is that in the model that you are building, he claims a trigger question. And he says his conclusion. And he said his conclusion where you don't need a drop in trigger pressure in the endothermis to trigger this swelling. Actually, the most influencing parameter was these bending modules. The thing with struggle pressure is that if you lower or modify trigger pressure between cells at this level, the pre-module is not yet symplasmically isolated. So my naive view is that if you increase or decrease, then water will flow and then it will. Water will flow and then it will probably accelerate somehow. So, I don't, I mean, we need to discuss it.
