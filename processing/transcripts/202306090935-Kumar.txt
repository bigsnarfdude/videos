Stop sharing. All right. I think I'm unsure. Can you confirm? Yes, yes. And you can share. Yes, just a second. I'm trying to share from my iPad. Ah, it's not showing up. So let's uh begin with our item of the workflow. Give that another talk. We talked about information recovery from Blackboards and what we're trying to start that talk. Okay, thank you very much. Can you hear me, everyone? Yes, yes. Okay. So first of all, I should obviously thank the organizers for putting together such an interesting meeting. And like the previous speaker and other online speakers, I profusely apologize. I profusely apologize for not being able to make it in person. Unavoidable circumstances. But I think, you know, position, my position as the last speaker, I view it as a very special position. So I think I would like to take this opportunity to ask everybody to give a round of thanks to the organizers for putting this meeting up. So I will talk. We'll talk about some work with my collaborators, which includes Tim Hollywood at Swansea and some graduate students, Zolt, Neil Talwar, and Andrea, who's now a postdoc at Torino. And a lot of what I'm going to talk about is based on a series of papers, but most of what I'm going to focus on will be on this preprint, which appeared. Preprint, which appeared late last year. And it's on the topic of information recovery from black holes. So here's the outline of my talk. So I'll first review. I'm sure a lot of the people, everybody in the audience is probably familiar with the idea of the page curve, which has been discussed quite a bit in recent years, particularly in the context of the recent developments having to do. Departments having to do with the generalized entropy and the associated island mechanism, which points towards a resolution of the information puzzle. I will then go on to talk about how the prescription for the generalized entropy calculations can be recast in a kind of nice visual language and allows you to bypass this step, the complicated technique. The step, the complicated technical steps of actually extremizing the generalized entropy to find how the prescription works. And so, this prescription is something that we developed in a previous work with our collaborators, and we call it the islands in the stream. Then, within this framework, which will always be in the back of my mind, I won't actually explicitly mention it, but all the explicit calculations, some of which All the explicit calculations, some of which I will just mask and I will try to give the overall picture, are done in the context of the reduced two-dimensional effective model, which is quite popular nowadays. But there's a very good reason why this two-dimensional effective model, which we call JT gravity, is relevant for this particular problem. And this particular is probably the most useful way to think about or most economical way to think about the questions that we are interested in. Then I will talk a little bit about diaries that have finite width. Diaries that have finite width. So, diaries are basically things that carry information that we chuck into black holes. And the terminology is, I think, borrowed from Hayden and Preskill's original work on information recovery from black holes. Okay, so we all know and we've all heard quite a lot that black holes are information processors, and that's because if you have matter prepared in an initial state, which is a, you can imagine. State, which is a you can imagine matter prepared in an initial state which is uh which is pure, and this collapsing matter, when it eventually collapses to form a black hole, we know from Hawking's famous calculation that it produces radiation that looks, for all practical purposes, looks thermal, which means that there are no short-range correlations within the radiation. And if you compute the entropy of this radiation, the entropy of a thermal gas of power. Thermal gas of massless particles, photons, or anything else will grow just monotonically with time as you gather more and more radiation. And that's, of course, clashes with our idea of unitarity, because we start from an initial state which is pure. And then if the black hole keeps on radiating thermal radiation until all of it has evaporated away, we've managed to basically turn a pure state into a mixed state, which would be a real problem. And so we have to. Be a real problem. And so we have to think about how to resolve this apparent paradox. And the resolution or the proposed resolution or the proposed idea for how this information should actually be in some sense conserved or information of the initial state is actually returned back to us intact, and that unitality is not violated. This idea finds very precise. It finds very precise enunciation in the proposal of Page based on these papers in 1993 and 2003, where the observation was made based on very simple qubit model-like systems that the von Neumann entropy, if you compute instead of just the thermodynamic, if you think about the entropy of the radiation as von Neumann entropy, which means the entropy of entanglement of the radiation, which measures the entanglement. Radiation, which measures the entanglement of the radiation with a black hole, then the fundamental entropy of the radiation is the minimum of two possible values. It takes the minimum of two possible values. One of these values is simply the thermodynamic entropy of the radiation, which I'll call S-rad. And the other possible value is the thermodynamic entropy of the black hole. And the basic idea is simple: we've got a system in a pure state, it's being partitioned into two. Your state, it's been partitioned into two, and the two subsystems, the radiation and the black hole, are entangled with each other. The von Neumann entropy of the radiation should be equal to the von Neumann entropy of the black hole at all times because the total system is pure. However, if you want to ask the von Neumann, however, if you want to compute the von-Neumann entropy of either of the two subsystems, when the system is macroscopic, the von-Neumann entropy is essentially sanctified. The von Neumann entropy is essentially saturated by the thermodynamic entropy of the smaller of the two systems. And that's what leads to this kind of behavior where the system looks like it has, the radiation system looks like it has thermal entropy for a certain period of time. And when this thermal entropy exceeds the entropy of the black hole or the thermodynamic entropy of the black hole, which is also macroscopic, you've got an exchange. And so this leads to the so-called page curve. So-called page curve. I'll make a couple of remarks about the page curve before I show the picture for the page curve. The way one gets the one has to think about the page curve and the evaporation problem for black holes is one is thinking about looking at the massless wave equation in the black hole background. And if you exploit spherical symmetry of the system, then you can, you have an effective wave equation, which in Regi-Wheeler coordinates, it's a radial wave equation. Coordinates, it's a radial wave equation with a potential barrier, and in that potential barrier, essentially all harmonics they have of the massless modes, they have a transmission coefficient. And the ones that are most effectively transmitted are the lowest harmonics, the L equals zero harmonics. They have the highest transmission coefficient in some sense. So it suffices in order to understand the evaporation problem to focus on the S-wave. Problem to focus on the S-wave sector of the radiation. And so that's the first important point. The second important point is that the evaporation process itself is intrinsically slow. So one can make an adiabatic approximation where you think about local thermodynamic equilibrium, system being in local thermodynamic equilibrium at all times, so that you can define the notion of an effective temperature at every time, even though the system is actually out of equilibrium. So if you focus attention So, if you focus attention on this S-wave sector, then the problem becomes effectively a one-plus one-dimensional problem. And then the thermodynamic entropy of the radiation, well, it's the usual entropy formula for a one-dimensional gas of, say, bosons in this case. And if the temperature were constant, it would be proportional linearly to temperature. And it would rise linearly with time if the temperature was constant. But if the temperature is slowly varying as it is for an evaporating black hole, then you'll have to. Is for an evaporating black hole, then you'll have to compute this integral, and it's the most natural thing. So that would be the radiation entropy. Similarly, because the rate there is a radiation flux, the mass of the black hole would decrease, and the rate at which the mass of the black hole decreases, you just use, that has to be equal to the flux of the radiation coming out. And that then is proportional to the temperature squared at any given instant of time. There's an overall constant tau, right? Sorry, eta here, which is sort of related. Which is sort of related to the transmission coefficients in the problem. At the end of the day, you can relate the rate of change of the mass of the black hole to the rate of change of the entropy of the black hole. And you can also relate the rate of change of the entropy of the radiation to the rate of change of the entropy of the black hole as the black hole evaporates. And this coefficient C that appears is what we call is related to the transmission coefficient. Is related to the transmission coefficient. And the case where c equals 2 is the case of perfect transmission, where basically the waves that make out make it out to asymptotic infinity are transmitted without any reflection. And x equals 1 is the exact, is the perfectly reversible, is a situation where this evaporation process is a reversible process. So in general, can take any generic value and we can put in Generic value, and we can put in different values equals two to study the perfect transmission case equals one when it's reversible. Okay, so what's the form of the predicted page curves from these simple-minded arguments, which are not first principles calculations? So, you can do this, all these calculations. And for the Schwarzschild black hole, here's the page curve. The von Norman entropy of the radiation grows at early times. Then, at some macroscopic time scale, which is called the page time, the Which is called the page time, the von-Norman entropy of the radiation switches from the thermal entropy of the radiation to the thermal entropy of the black hole because of that exchange. Okay, and so that's the page time. And the same thing happens, for example, for a near extremal black hole. You get a different kind of page curve, but there is again the same the same idea. In all cases, the transition time is determined by this equation, where the black hole at the page time, the black hole entropy at the page. Page time, the black hole entropy at the page time is some fraction of its initial entropy. So, the page time is actually a macroscopic time scale. And so, the process which would tell us how this transition between this growth and decrease phase for the von-Neumann entropy occurs, we should imagine that this phase should come out of some kind of semi-classical analysis. There's a first thing. The second important point is that the page curve tells us that the early rate. Curve tells us that the early radiation and the late radiation are correlated. So at early times, you don't see the correlation because the correlation, there are no short-range correlations. But once you collect enough of the radiation, the correlations show up and the page curve is a sign that late and early modes are correlated. That's the whole point of this. Okay, so page curve from first principles has been therefore after Page's proposal, the Holy Grail. And so recently, or perhaps now. So, recently, or perhaps now not anymore recently, in 2019, there were these two nice papers which effectively showed how to compute the page curve by actually computing the von Neumann entropy of radiation from first principles, which means the idea is to implement the replica trick for gravity coupled to a bath, to a radiation bath. And because you have gravity and because gravity is dynamical, when you do the replica trick, you get contributions. Replica trick, you get contributions from geometries which look like wormhole geometries, which connect the different sheets in the replicated manifold. And it's these replica wormholes that look like new saddles in the semi-classical gravity path integral. And so you have a trivial saddle where you don't have these kinds of replica wormhole contributions, but then at some late time, which is precisely the page time, the replica wormhole. Each time the replica wormhole saddles contribute, and then you get this transition which gives rise to the page curve. Okay, so the key output of this whole analysis from all these people, and also it was anticipated in previous papers, and also from the point of view of philography, is that a key role played by the vonomic is the key role played by this quantity called the generalized entropy. So the generalized entropy is in capital. Entropy encapsulates in some sense the microscopic or fine-grained entropy of the system. And the recipe that comes out, which is the generalized entropy or the island formula, is essentially the following that every time we want to compute the von Neumann entropy of some radiation or some subsystem which is in the asymptotic infinity of this black hole. Infinity of this black hole. So, R is the radiation. We consider, in addition to the possibility that the entropy is simply given by the thermal entropy or the QFT result, we consider the possibility that we have to append regions which are actually lying mostly inside the horizon of the black hole and pretend that these regions are actually part of the Hilbert space of the radiation. And so, you have to append these regions to the radiation, compute the Compute the QFT entropy for the radiation union of these interior regions, which we call islands. Then add to it a contribution which comes from the area of the boundary of these regions. The boundaries of these island regions are what we call the quantum extremal surfaces. And so this, of course, is like the area of term for the black hole entropy, except that you're evaluating it at the locations of these quantum extremal surfaces. And then you extremize this. And then you extremize this over all possible island configurations to find what is the true quantum extremal surface. Once you've done that, you get the right entropy. And so the right von Neumann entropy is actually the extremum of this generalized entropy. And it can be a situation where there are no islands. It can be a situation where you have islands. And then you have to take all these different saddle points and make them compete with each other to find what's the right answer. Other to find what's the right answer. So, what's the basic idea behind the Allen mechanism pictorially is just this. If we view the Hawking radiation as an UNRU effect, which means that you have the radiation modes outside the horizon and the purifiers of the radiation modes inside the horizon, and these are maximally entangled. That's what we mean by purifiers. Then, as the radiation gets collected by an observer at asymptotic infinity, so that's At asymptotic infinity, so that's like this capital R denotes the radiation being collected, or that interval signifies the interval of radiation that an observer at scry plus is collecting. The Voneman entropy grows linearly, but at some point, the island mechanism tells us that we need to consider the fact that regions, this the purifiers or the which are the degrees of freedom behind the horizon, they eventually Behind the horizon, they eventually get returned back to the observer outside. And the way the island mechanism does the bookkeeping for that is says that there is this region which we call the island, which is defined or demarcated by the quantum extremal surface. And we need to append that island or think of it as being as part of the Hilbert space of the radiation. And so once you do that, well, what happens is that the purifiers are being collected in the island and therefore. In the island. And therefore, if the island is part of the radiation, then the von Hermann entropy is going to start coming down because you're going to compute the effect of both the Hawking modes and their purifiers, which you're gathering in the island. And the Vonhamman entropy automatically starts coming down. So this is the essential idea behind the island mechanism that it's an accounting or a bookkeeping device, which is what all saddle point calculations do. It does not necessarily tell us exactly what. Tell us exactly what is the microscopics of what's going on behind the horizon, but it is an accounting or bookkeeping device that tells us how the information is recovered. Okay, so right, so I probably don't have that much time, so I'll kind of try and speed up. So this whole prescription for computing the generalized entropy. The generalized entropy and doing the extremization process is quite cumbersome, even in the simplified models, which are these one-plus-one-dimensional effective models, the GT gravity models. But it turns out that if you look at situations where the evaporation is adiabatic, and if you're considering intervals that are sufficiently large that a thermodynamic limit applies, then you get a rather simplified description of this whole. Description of this whole island picture. And in fact, you can take the whole island picture and translate it into something that just lives on the outside, basically within the stream of the Hawking radiation. And this prescription is what we call the islands in the stream prescription. It's an on-shell recipe. In other words, it's a result of extremization, or this recipe already gives you the saddle points. So one doesn't have to do any extremization. And the idea is. Extremization. And the idea is that the islands, which are the regions behind the horizon, you can understand or you can, they, well, they basically identify purifiers of the radiation in the bath, whose entanglement or von Neumann entropy you're trying to compute. So, the prescription for island in the streams is to actually take the image of the island in the stream of the Hawking radiation, which is outside. And so, this process can. Side and so this process can be done. It's basically a reflection in some coordinates across the horizon. And there is a prescription to identify exactly what these islands in the stream, the I tilde, are. It's a very simple prescription. And then all one has to do is once one knows what the prescription is, one just computes the black hole entropy or the Bekenstein-Hawking formula evaluated at the end points of these. Endpoints of these islands in the stream, and then computes the QFT entropy, not just for the radiation, but for the symmetric difference of the radiation and the island in the stream. So the symmetric difference is defined as, I have defined it here, but sometimes it helps to write things out. So the symmetric difference of these two is our union minus that. And this has the effect of precisely. And this has the effect of precisely canceling out the contributions from those modes whose purifiers have already been emitted. So that's the basic idea that certain modes are being purified in the course of the evaporation process. And once these modes have been emitted, you have to basically subtract out their contribution from the QFT entanglement entropy. So that's basically what this prescription does. Okay, so you can use this prescription to do. So, you can use this prescription to do all sorts of interesting things. So, one of the problems we studied was basically this idea of throwing in a diary, diary D, into the black hole. So what is a diary? A diary basically is a small excitation, a pulse, or it could be a shockwave that carries some entropy, which I call S of D. And as is typical, we think about the diary actually as being a part of an EPA. Being a part of an EPR pair. So you've got the D and the D bar, which are maximally entangled pulses or maximally entangled shock waves. These you can generate in CFT by doing a local quench. So what happens when you throw the diary is that as you throw the diary into the black hole, well, obviously the black hole is going to get heated up. So its apparent horizon moves outwards. But as But as the diary gets absorbed by the black hole and equilibrates with the black hole, the black hole temperature as it goes up, the black hole evaporates more. And at some point, the diary, the information in the diary is released, but now in a horrendously scrambled way. And the question is, how do we recover this information or when is this information actually recovered for this diary? So the scenario is an already evaporating. An already evaporating black hole into which we throw a tiny bit of information, the diary, and then ask when is this information actually returned. And so to understand this, we basically look at the diary and its purified D-bar, which is, so it's gathered at some time T naught. The diary is thrown into the black hole at some time T naught. And the radiation which is collected, collected at scry plus, the light cone coordinates at scry plus are correlated. cone coordinates at scry plus are correlated of course at the time with the time at which the radiation crosses the um crosses into the bath region so here i have the radiation split into two bits this is the early radiation r1 which is all the radiation the black hole has emitted up to the time t naught when the diary has been thrown into the black hole and then there is the late time radiation r2 which is all the radiation emitted by the black hole after time t naught up to any given time Time t0 up to any given time t. So, the question is: How is the diary returned in R1 union R2? How do we find the diary or the information in the diary in R1 union R2? So, to answer this question, you actually need to compute something simple. You need to compute the mutual information. Now, the mutual information of the radiation, where the radiation I repeat, has got these two bits. The early bit, bits the early bit union this late bit just leaving out the the d bar and the idea is i want to compute the mutual information between r and d bar and the point is that for this system it's easy to see that when the diary is returned back to the radiation the mutual information is maximal and in fact the mutual information should be twice the entropy of the diary so recovery Of the diary. So, recovery will happen when this mutual information saturates to twice the entropy of the diary. Okay, so we need to calculate this. And so, a question is, how do we use this island mechanism to calculate this? That's really the question. So, in the calculation, there are two important bits. The mutual information r, d bar is defined as the entropy of r, entropy of diary, which is whatever it is. It's not important, right? It's some quantity. And then it's Quantity and then it's entropy of R union d bar, the radiation union d bar. I don't know what the Vonnoman entropy of the radiation is because this is dynamically determined and I need to look at the different saddles that contribute. It's ditto for the Vonnoman entropy of the radiation union d bar. Okay, the radiation of the diary, it's given to begin with. So there are these two things which need to be computed. And they need to be computed using the generalized. Using the generalized entropy, not the QFT von-Neumann entropy. So, in this problem, it turns out that there are three saddles that are relevant. There are actually more than three saddles in the calculation, three semi-classical saddles. The first saddle is the obvious one, which is the no-island saddle, which means each of these guys, S of R and S of R union D bar, is simply given by the QFT entropy or the radiation entropy. So, in the no island, entropy so in the no island saddle the entropy of the radiation is the radiation of is the uh is the s rad for the early radiation plus s rad for the late radiation plus entropy of the of the diary similarly s of r union d bar is entropy of the radiation at early times plus the entropy of the radiation at um at late times okay and Okay, and the island contributions. Well, it turns out there are two relevant island contributions, I1 and I2, which I will explain in a bit now. Actually, I have very little time, so I'm not going to kind of explain how the prescription works out. But I'll just tell you, I'll just sketch what the picture is. There are two islands which are relevant for the problem, or two saddle points, which I'll call I1 and I2. So we'll examine. We'll examine these things in turn as we look at the diary recovery sequence. So, the case, the first case we'll look at is when the diary is thrown into the black hole before the page time. So, when T0, the time at which the tiny diary is thrown, is less than the page time, the black hole is still evaporating and the radiation entropy follows the thermodynamic law. So, now if you throw in the diary, the Throw in the diary, the black hole heats up and it produces more radiation. So at early times, right, for T greater than T naught, which is times greater than the time at which the diary was thrown before the putative page time of the black hole, the radiation entropy is given simply by the thermal entropy: S rad of R1 plus S rad of R1. S rad of R1 plus S rad of R2. And then S of R union D bar also follows the thermodynamic entropy considerations. And then if you compute the mutual information in this system during this early phase, the mutual information is exactly zero, which just tells us that the diary has not been returned. Now, what happens just a little bit before the page time is that one of these two guys. Is that one of these two guys s of r union d bar and s of r, and in particular it's s of r union d bar, it actually makes a transition to one of the islands, in this case I2. And s of r union d bar is now no longer given by the by the thermal result, but in fact given by the black hole entropy at that time because of the page transition or the page curve. The radiation entropy still remains at the no island saturation. Remains at the no island saddle. And what happens at this stage? Well, if you do the arithmetic, you begin to see that the mutual information is bigger than zero in this phase and begins to rise continuously. So there is a small time just before the page time or the putative page time when information recovery begins. Right? And then a little bit after page time, yet another phase transition occurs where the von Norman entropy of the radiation. The von-Norman entropy of the radiation transits to this new island saddle, which I call I2. And then you can look at the behavior of the mutual information. So the mutual information does this. You throw the diary at time t0. Just before the page time, the mutual information starts growing. You can actually find exactly what this growth is. And then it saturates exactly a little bit after page time and then remains there. So you get all the information. So moral of the story. So moral of the story, you throw in a diary much before page time. It is emitted just a little bit after page time. Now, you can repeat the exercise when the diary is thrown after the page time. So imagine that you have a black hole which is old and it's already undergone this page transition. So information recovery, the page curve is already going down. Going down, and now you throw in a diary. So now it's something more interesting starts happening. And in fact, what one finds, I'll just summarize this, is by looking at the different islands that dominate SR union B bar and SR, what you find is that just a little bit after page time, T minus, the mutual information starts growing up. Mutual information starts growing up. And then, at a little bit of time, T plus later, the mutual information saturates and the information has recovered. So, basically, if the diary is thrown in after the page time, you recover it after a very small time delay. The time delay, there are two times involved. The first is the time delay, after which mutual information starts growing, which means the diary is getting retrieved. Is getting retrieved. This time is related to the change in the entropy of the black hole because you've thrown the diary in. And here it's kind of important that there is a generalized second law in operation because you throw the diary in and the entropy of the resulting black hole, which is now bigger or slightly hotter, the entropy, the change in the entropy of the black hole is actually bigger than the entropy of the diary. It's actually quite important. Without the generalized second law in operation, this time delay would be non-existent. This time delay would be non-existent. But in general, the fact that the process of throwing a diary into a black hole and its absorption is actually an irreversible process. And so there is a non-trivial time delay, which you can quantify after which the information recovery takes place. Okay, so I'll just summarize very quickly now. So I've just kind of summarized the overall picture, the nuts. The overall picture, the nuts and bolts calculation for this is actually done using the machinery of the JT gravity theory, where you can actually study the full back reaction problem and all its glory. So you can actually send in a CFT local quench, which what it does is it produces excitations or shock waves, which have a finite width. And so that shock, the diary which I showed you is actually a spread out pulse that goes into the black hole. And then it has a partner pulse. And then it has a partner pulse that comes out and is gathered at Sky Plus. The JT gravity equations, the way they work is you basically have to solve an energy balance equation, which tells you how the energy or the mass of the black hole in here changes with the flux of the incoming radiation or the incoming, in this case, the pulse, the diary. And the energy itself depends upon this thing, which is the Schwartzian. And the Schwarzenegger. Schwartzian. And the Schwartzian here involves the trajectory of the boundary particle. So there's a very beautiful picture in JT gravity where you can think of this entire system as a boundary of this particle in ADS2, which is undergoing an accelerated trajectory. And you can sort of relate this problem to the UNRU effect in the presence of an accelerated particle. But there is more than that. Sorry to interrupt. So timing of particles. So, timing of this, yeah, I'm kind of done. This is the last transparency. So, one goes through the entire procedure and one then extremizes the generalized entropy in JT gravity. And in general, the generalized entropy can have many extrema, as I've kind of alluded to. We have seen here two of these, I1 and I2, which I've kind of mentioned, but there's also a third one. And it turns out this third extremum is actually not a local minimum, but a maximum. Minimum, but a maximum. It's related to what's called a Python's lunch, or in this case, what I would call a Python snack, because we've thrown a diary in, which is a small object. And the third island, which is this maximum, actually gives us an idea of the complexity of the decoding process. So the Python snack or its action tells us, measures the complexity of the unitary required to decode. Of the unitary required to decode the diary during this diary recovery process. So it goes exponentially and depends upon the change in the entropy of the black hole and the entropy of the diary. Okay, so here's summary and conclusions. So we've talked about the generalized entropy and the island formalism and showed how it reproduces the Hayden-Preskell picture of information recovery. Information can be recovered from many different subsets of the radio. From many different subsets of the radiation, and it's more and more difficult to recover the diaries if you choose smaller subsets of late radiation. Irreversibility of the information absorption process by a black hole is actually quite important for all the steps in this analysis. It's responsible for the delay in information recovery, and it's a delay which comes on top of what's called the scrambling time. It also gives us an idea that. Idea that irreversibility is related to increased complexity of the decoding process of the information that's thrown in. There's many further questions, but I won't list them all. Thank you very much. And sorry for going over time. Thank you for the wonderful talk. Anyone have any questions? Oh, there is an online question. Robert, yes, yes. Yeah, keep going. Yeah. So at the very end, you mentioned the scrambling time. Where did that appear in your analysis? Yeah, so in the analysis which I presented in the beginning, which was basically a sketch, the scrambling time is taken to be very small. And it's actually, it is very small because it's of order, it's parametrically small because it's logarithmic. It's logarithmic, but its effect does come when you compute the generalized entropy precisely using the JT gravity equations. The scrambling time does make an appearance. It gives a sub leading correction to all the formulae that I wrote down. And it's related to the fact that there is a non-trivial time scale associated to this. If you throw in this diary, there is a typical time scale associated to its absorption by the black hole, and that's completely determined by. And that's completely determined by the temperature at that time and the entropy of the diary that's been thrown in, the log of the entropy. Okay, thanks. Any more questions? Not really thanked frame for the full talk. In fact, we thank both the speakers. So this was the This was the last draw of our function. Thank you very much.
