And I'm interested in this work. This is a joint work with Dave Tell, that you know, both of them are in this workshop, and two oncologists here in Anschutz, Steve Bayer and Clay Smith from the Cancer Center in Anschutz. So, okay, so this work is still in early stages. So, I will basically share with you what I've learned so far, what we did. I've learned so far, what we did in part of a as part of a pilot study, and some I'll finish with conclusions and some future directions. So, no surprise that there are these people use those different approaches to treat lots of things about the cancer patients, treatment outcomes, or occurrence of some side effects, and many, many like the effects or Or influential factors for the therapy outcome, and so on. So, we can consider all these approaches very broadly in these two different settings. But again, this treatment, cancer treatment, prediction of cancer outcomes is a very broad, very extensive field. So that's why I will focus on one treatment, which is chimeric antigen receptor therapy or CAR T cell therapy. Or CAR T cell therapy. One disease, it is diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and we're going to use one modeling approach today, mechanistic modeling. So what's firstly, CAR T-cell. It's a relatively new treatment approach compared to other standard chemotherapy regimens. It's a type of an immunotherapy. In this therapy, they remove the T cells or the T cells. The T cells, the T cells of the patients, they genetically modify the T cells in the lab settings so that these cells now can recognize the cancer cells and kill them. So they grow these cells in the lab settings and before infusing back them to the patient, they give some chemotherapy. And as far as I understand, this chemotherapy is. This chemotherapy is called lymphodepletion, and it is given basically to kill the T cells of the patient so that they can, in the late terms, have some more room for these CAR T cells, these CAR T cells to work more efficiently and kill the cancer cells. So, why do we want to look at the diffuse large D-style lymphoma? Firstly, the very last point here is CAR T-sulture. Last point here is CAR T-cell therapy is FDA approved as the third line of treatment for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma patients. So, mostly for these blood cancers, because it has been shown less effective for solid cancers. And non-Hodgkin lymphoma is then aggressive and the DLDCL is an aggressive and most common subtype of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are around 81,000 estimated cases. Thousand estimated new cases and 20,000 deaths in 2021 for this lymphoma, and the LBCL accounts for 30 to 35 percent of these new diagnosed cases. Moreover, the number of these cases is projected to increase in the next five years. Also, there are some results showing that CAR T-Cell therapy could be more effective if it's used as a second line of treatment instead of as a third line of treatment. Instead of as a third line of treatment, so currently some drug companies are applying to FDA to use it as a second line of treatment. So this means that the number of eligible patients will increase more probably in the future. So, but still, why do you want to predict the therapy outcome? So, first, even as a third line of treatment option, this therapy has shown some improvement, but Improvement, but it obviously doesn't work for everyone. And it may cause some severe adverse events, toxicity like cytokine release syndrome or some neurotoxicity. It requires a lengthy hospital stay and it's a very costly treatment. But the goals are associated with when can we make this prediction. So if we can predict even before giving the therapy to the patient, Even before giving the therapy to the patient, that's great because then we can make a decision who are more likely to benefit from the therapy. And then we can just reduce the cost, avoid these side effects, and in early stages, navigate patients to other potentially more beneficial therapies. But it's not always possible to do this before the treatment. And if we can still predict this. If we can still predict this after giving the therapy to patients using data short amount of time after the infusion, that's still helpful because if we can predict the relapse, which patients are going to relapse as early as possible, that means that we can schedule the next line of treatment as early as possible, and that could be still life-saving for some of the patients. So, I will talk about this very simple model because when we start. Simple model because when we start modeling a new case, we start with as simple as possible and we try to make the model as more complex as it required, depending on what we want to achieve or what data that we have. So in this paper, they used cartiosotherapy is not approved for glioma, but there are some very like clinical trial kind of studies. Studies. So they have real patient data and they use this very simple mathematical model, basically the predator-prey model. So here, X is representing the cancer cell count and Y is the CAR T cell count. And this model is showing the dynamics of the CAR T cells, cancer cells, and their interaction in the possible simplest version. So this term, for example, is the logistic. This term, for example, is the logistic growth of the cancer cells. Here is the CAR T cell-induced cancer cell death, and cancer cell stimulated proliferation or exhaustion of CAR T cells and CAR T cell death. So one, obviously that's not very complicated or a very high fidelity model. For example, CAR T cells could, when they're infused at first, they are proliferating, but after a while, they start to. But after a while, they start they move to the exhaustion process. So, but there is only a single term here. Let's the goal, the aim is like, let's just model it in this way and see what we can achieve with this one so that we can just make it more complex later. And here, this model has these five unknown model parameters. And the beauty of having this kind of models is we can do some mathematical analysis. Some mathematical analysis here, just very simply rescaling time and state variables with these new defining these new variables, we obtain this equivalent system here, this one. And this is a dimensionless system and it has only two parameters. It's much easier to understand the dynamics of this one. And here, by doing this simple analysis in that paper, all these figures are from that paper because they're very nice to show. That paper because they're really nice to showing how we can understand the model. So, this model can represent three different therapy outcomes, which is in accordance with reality, successful CAR T cell treatment, CAR Treatment Failure, and pseudo-failure, pseudo-imverse. So, for example, I just want to show one of them, like even in this case, even if in the beginning after infusion, cancer cells start growing. Cancer cells start growing, they are going to just go back and there will be rapid response and all the other cases. And another good thing is we have these new dimensionless parameters A and B, some functions of the original parameters, and we can characterize the therapy outcome by just looking at the values of these parameters. And if the model is accurate enough and well validated, these Enough and well validated, these could be very helpful to make a decision. Okay, so they use this model with some tumor, brain tumors, different lesions. This one, in this case, they did not try to make any kind of predictions. The aim is just to understand if we can fit this data to this model and if we can use this model to represent dynamics. And here are like two. And here are like two different lesions. They were apparent in these MRI scans before the infusion. And the MRI, these are these timestamps are the dates. And they basically just try to estimate the volume of the lesions from the MRI scans. And by simple math, like assume that the tumors are in the spherical shape and the volume of a single cell is different. A volume of a single cell is this much, and then just divide it to estimate the cancer cell count. And here, that these two in the MRI scans, it's seen that CAR T-cell worked for these two scans and model was able to predict them. And before, they did not estimate all five of the parameters by using some in vitro studies. They firstly estimated the carrying capacity, which is one of the parameters. Which is one of the parameters, and they use this value for all of them. So, this leaves us with four parameters to estimate, and one of them is the tumor growth rate. So, again, by looking at the data, just simply they estimated the tumor growth rate by using the logistic growth function, and again, use this parameter value as default. And that remain that remains us with three model parameters to estimate. And in each case, they estimated these three parameters. Case they estimated these three parameters. And there it turns out there appeared another lesion after actually the infusion, as far as I remember. And it turns out this CAR Terrapy didn't help for this lesion. And they were able to like fit the model accurately. And here we see phase plane analysis that it was in accordance. These parameter values were in accordance with the model output and with the reality. So we So, we wanted to use this model in these DRDCR setting. But we don't only want to see if the model fits or not. We want to make predictions. But the data set in this case is very, very sparse. We have, so total metabolic tumor volume is obtained from the PET scans. We need a radiologist to review the PET scans and come. The PET scans and compute these numbers, and as exactly as they did, we are going to convert this volume to the cancer cells, and this is going to represent our cancer cell measurements. So we are going to use data starting the infusion time and as small time interval as possible after the infusion because we want to make this prediction as early as possible. And it turns out these PETs can. Out, these PET scans are done like a couple of times before the infusion, and sometimes the latest one is even a few months before the infusion. We don't know the actual TMTV at the infusion time. So just to stay as simple as possible, again, we use the latest TMTV measurement as an approximation to the cancer cell or TMTV measurement at the time of infusion. Time of infusion. So we have one single data point that we use only as an initial condition. And for CAR T-cell measurements, CAR T-cell, we only know the exact dose given to the patient at the infusion, and it's never measured again. Instead, they measure this absolute lymphocyte count, which can be used as a proxy to CARISAN measurement after only a short amount of time. Because after a while, Time because after a while the effect of lymphodepletion will disappear, and then patient will have other lymphocytes in the blood, and this won't be an accurate proxy for CAR T cells. So we used data starting at the infusion time up until 15 days after the infusion. And here is the model fitting. So all in all of the first one is the cancer cell count, the second The cancer cell count, the second one is the CAR T cell count, and in both of them, the red circles are showing the data that we used to fit the model. And then blue curves are continuous simulation, and the crosses are just the point-wise simulation. Okay, we see that it's able to, this is just the initial condition. There is not really a fitting here. We are mostly fitting this CAR T-cell count as opposed to gliom. Outcount as opposed to the glioma study, and it looks like it's a reasonable fit at this point. But let's see now. We predicted the estimated the unknown model parameters. Let's simulate model further and see if it's what it does. So the model predicts that the cancer cell count is going to reach to zero and it's not going coming back again. And here, there are new PET scans that are done. new PET scans that are done at the 19th around 19th day that's that's the standard after three months of the infusion and another one after around six months so this patient really did not relapse and the model was able to predict this by using the 15 day of data but again in this pilot study we only had four patients and model was able to predict the outcome for three of them we missed the prediction for one of them We missed the prediction for one of them, and we really think that's because of the highest parse data case. So what's the conclusion here is, with this study, we have found out that mechanistic modeling provides insight into CAR T cell and cancer cell dynamics, as it always does in other settings as well. But this is really a two-way road. We have a initial We have an initial belief about the system. We represent this belief, hypothesize, and represent this belief with the differential equations and see if it's in accordance with what we believe that the model behaves according to our belief and data. And then we start improving it by adjusting it properly according to our needs and data limitations. So we are still in this stage. And it turns out that the mechanistic model could handle. Turns out that mechanistic model could handle the data sparks and limitations very well. I guess there is no way that we can make such a prediction with machine learning models, with only, I guess, in total 10 data points or something like that. And finally, it could provide more information than a binary outcome prediction. So if we can obtain the show that model is well enough and validated, we can use. Validate it. We can use it even to predict other stuff like timing of relapse. We can do uncertainty quantification, and these kinds of things could be really helpful for our ultimate purpose, which is to create clinical decision tools by using this kind of models. So, some future directions. As I said, I used the latest available total metabolic tumor volume data, but we are still. Volume data, but very soon we are going to have access to a larger data set. If we have more PET scans, at least a couple of PET scans collected before it, we can easily fit a logistic growth model and find the growth parameter and obtain hopefully more accurate TMTV measurement at the infusion time and see if this is going to improve the prediction results. Improve the prediction results. And then, so we are using TMTV for cancer cell count and ALC for CAR T cells, but there are other possible biomarkers that we can use that are thought to be correlate well with these quantities that we are interested in the modeling. So, one of them is LDH, lactate dehydrogenase, I guess. It is thought to correlate well with TMTB. With TMTV. So we are going to investigate it. And then for CAR T cells, it's not standardly collected, but there is this circulating tumor DNA. And if it turns out it's effective, it's not so hard to collect this data for these patients. Another one is, as I said, the model is just estimate one single parameter for proliferation and exhaustion. And if it's positive, it's proliferating all the time. If it's negative, it's exhausting. All the time, if it's negative, it's exhausting. So, we want to see if we can how we can modify the models so that we can estimate the proliferation and exhaustion time windows separately, because it's known that longer proliferation time period is associated with better therapy outcomes. And finally, we can just investigate optimal dosing strategies after validating this model, of course, to see how effectively CAR T. How effective the CAR T cell does, or even to see, find out maybe instead of infusing it only one time, giving it maybe over some time period at different times if it could improve the therapy outcomes. So that's all I want to say. Thank you very much for your attention. And I can try to answer any questions if you have any questions. Thank you, Malika. Very interesting talk. We kind of have a model that is more focusing on atropenia. Could these be somehow like, I mean, the treatment is different, but could you combine the model then with kind of models that look more at this or other side effects to then combine the information that comes from the different models? Because actually, that's what we are trying to do. That's why I'm asking this. Trying to do, that's why I'm asking this. So, if you had different models that model different parts of the treatment, how would you bring them together essentially to do the prediction? Are you asking like if this model is taking care of any kind of side effects? No, I was more wondering if you had a different model that was doing this. Do you have any ideas to how to bring the information together? Because, yeah. Well, I am not sure of that. Well, I am not sure of that. That's really one of the first models that I tried. And I have some ideas how to make it a bit more applicable in this lymphomas, I think. But again, in the future, we are very interested using your data assimilation reinforcement learning kind of approach of these ones for these dosing strategies. If that answers you, I just thought it's actually the new model, I think. It's actually that your model, I think the types of cancers don't fit, and the treatment doesn't necessarily fit. But we're actually looking for something that's modeling the actual cancer because that's one thing we don't do. We just model noitropinia. And so your model might or a version of your model might be very helpful in our scenario too. I don't know what she's saying. Well, I can't really hear you. Can you repeat, please? I will call you. Okay, yes, that might be much better. Sorry. It's a little bit hard to hear people who are sitting on the back row. That's why maybe. Sorry. Ask your question, Lalakh. Is there time? Yes, sure. So, well, what do you think it would take to validate the model of Verger? So you predict that you have an initial condition and then you have this exponential growth and that leads to. Exponential growth, and that leads to zero. Are there times when it doesn't do that? And do you get that right too? And is there any time sensitivity? Or is the prediction basically just it's going to go to zero? Well, there are some cases here. I simulated only until the latest measurement time. So, I, for one of the patients, it was really interesting. I was surprised how it actually was surprised how it captured it, but the patient was relapsing. The patient was relapsing. It wasn't accurately estimated the timing, but when I simulated it long enough, at some point, cancer cell counts started to increase. The timing was definitely awful, but still it was able to capture that. So that's one of the good sites, I guess, but we need to investigate more. I need that larger number of patients' data to see if it's high. Data to see if it's how in how many occupations it's working and if we can really capture the dynamics with this model. But you have predicted failure. Yes, I predicted failure, yes. And it turned like it was in even in accordance with data, cancer cells return to the vicinity of zero. Here we said that we see they're almost like zero, but look at the range of the y-axis, it's 10 to the 9th. Access, it's 10 to the 9, so they might be very small numbers close to zero, and they may start increasing after a while, too. Another thing that I want to quickly say is there are some models that not some models, a model that I find about is they model everything is deterministic when the cancer cell counts are larger than a threshold, but when they are very small, they start modeling it stochastically so it can go back. Stochastically, so it can go back, it can increase. So, I am very interested to look at that stochastic as well to see if it's going to play any role or how we can apply it in this case. Thank you very much, Malik. Thank you. We'll take a quick 10-minute break and then come back for Jana and Phil. I would say it was a different.
